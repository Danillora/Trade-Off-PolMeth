Abstract = {The South Australian Parliamentary Internship Program (SAPI) is jointly
   supported by the Parliament of South Australia and by the three South
   Australian universities: The University of Adelaide, Flinders University
   and The University of South Australia. While each university remains
   responsible for the internal administration of its own students,
   responsibility for overall coordination of the scheme rotates among the
   academic staff of the three universities. The unique nature of this
   program is that it is one of the very few courses which all three
   universities undertake together and on 25 October 2019 in the House of
   Assembly the SAPI program celebrated 25 years in which the history and
   contributions to students' learning were acknowledged. The program
   offers undergraduate students an opportunity to undertake sustained
   research and present their reports to Members of Parliament, to their
   peers and academic staff. The program is very effective in understanding
   policy and is an excellent example of work-related learning undertaken
   in collegiate and cooperative way. This comment provides an overview of
   the SAPI structure and performance in recent years.},

Abstract = {Recent political developments point to the presence of grave problems
   with democratic governance in the United States. They suggest that
   scholarship in American political development (APD) could be better at
   studying the experiences and thinking of everyday Americans. APD
   scholars often study institutional changes, policy initiatives, and
   other shifts in governance without studying how these developments
   affect the lives of U.S. citizens and residents. And many developments
   of critical political importance are ignored or do not receive the
   scholarly attention they deserve. For our scholarship to do justice to
   the recent crises and better relate to the political world around us, as
   several recent past American Political Science Association (APSA)
   presidents have recommended, the article calls for APD scholarship to be
   better at focusing on people themselves: on their health and safety,
   their material standing, and their personal and social educations. By
   adding a fuller study of people to their research, APD scholars would be
   better equipped to identify important political developments that do not
   always capture the attention of Congress, the White House, and the
   media, but that are too important to ignore.},

Abstract = {So often celebrated as Abraham Lincoln's defining achievement, the
   Emancipation Proclamation is best understood as a ``painful last
   resort{''} that Lincoln turned to only after repeatedly failing to
   persuade others to back his preferred policy of gradual, compensated
   emancipation, accompanied by the voluntary colonization of freed Blacks.
   For all its fame, the proclamation is a classic ``case of command{''} in
   which the reliance on unilateral power reveals not mastery but a failure
   to persuade. Although Lincoln, despite all his political talents and
   rhetorical abilities, had scant success in persuading others to support
   his preferred policy, he displayed a keen grasp of the limits and costs
   of command, which reflected his understanding that command is
   ultimately, as Richard Neustadt (1960) argues, a method of, rather than
   a substitute for, persuasion.},

Title = {Left Behind and United by Populism? Populism's Multiple Roots in
   Feelings of Lacking Societal Recognition},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {A prominent but underspecified explanation for the rise of populism
   points to individuals' feelings of being ``left behind{''} by the
   development of society. At its core lies the claim that support for
   populism is driven by the feeling of lacking the societal recognition
   one deserves. Our contribution builds on the insight that individuals
   can feel they lack recognition in different ways and for different
   reasons. We argue that-because of this multifaceted character-the common
   perception of being neglected by society unites otherwise heterogeneous
   segments of the population in their support for populism. Relying on
   data from the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) Pre-Election
   Cross-Section 2021, our preregistered study investigated the multiple
   roots of populist attitudes in feelings of lacking societal recognition
   in two steps. First, our results indicate that, from rural residents to
   sociocultural conservatives or low-income citizens, seemingly unrelated
   segments of society harbor feelings of lacking recognition, but for
   distinct reasons. Second, as anticipated, each of the distinct feelings
   of lacking recognition are associated with populist attitudes. These
   findings underscore the relevance of seemingly unpolitical factors that
   are deeply ingrained in the human psyche for understanding current
   populist sentiment. Overall, by integrating previously disparate
   perspectives on the rise of populism, the study offers a novel
   conceptualization of ``feeling left behind{''} and explains how populism
   can give rise to unusual alliances that cut across traditional
   cleavages.},

Abstract = {Amidst an unprecedented swell in global protest, scholars and activists
   wrestle with the question of why protests succeed or fail. I explore a
   new answer: more cohesive crowds, where protesters agree on their
   demands, are more likely to win concessions than less cohesive crowds.
   Drawing on psychology and linguistics, I theorize that cohesive demands
   are more comprehensible and thus persuasive. I test this theory with a
   multimethod approach. First, I use cross-national data from 97 protests
   to estimate the relationship between crowd cohesion and subsequent
   concessions, applying natural language processing to measure cohesion in
   participants' self-reported motivations. Second, a survey experiment in
   South Africa tests the causal effects of crowd cohesion and assesses
   comprehensibility of demands as the mechanism driving concessions.
   Third, case studies of two British protests demonstrate the theory in
   real-world settings. My findings suggest that activists can improve
   their odds of success by coordinating around a common goal.},

Abstract = {Diminishing accountability of state institutions in Kashmir and the
   expectation from women to adhere to strict socio-cultural norms are
   subtly imposing multidimensional social exclusion on them. It limits
   women's mobility and choices. Security, political and institutional
   compulsions of conflict zones further heighten the impediments to
   women's lives. Civil societies in many conflict zones have demanded that
   violence against women and discriminatory cultural practices and
   stereotypes be addressed by holding state and non-state actors
   accountable for structural inequalities which further marginalize women.
   Certain dimensions of social exclusion faced by women, specifically
   engendered due to conflict situations, become invisible and unnoticeable
   by getting eclipsed by the meta-narrative of the political discourses of
   conflict, creating the binary of the state and the combatant. Seeing
   women as separate entities gives deeper insights into the graded
   vulnerabilities of a conflict zone. This paper attempts to see how
   women's agency in everyday life is affected by a persistent state of
   turmoil. Besides, it also looks at the structural fault lines in state
   institutions in addressing women's issues in the aforementioned regard.},

Abstract = {According to partisan theory, variations in policy choices and outputs
   originate from the party composition of the government studied. In this
   study, we take a novel approach to address such assumptions by linking
   changes in municipal taxes with local government changes. We also add a
   baseline scenario in which we examine whether the composition of the
   local government affects tax levels. Drawing on a dataset that contains
   official Swedish statistics from 1994 to 2018, we find convincing
   support for the partisan effect. Tax levels are higher under left-wing
   rule, and more specifically, tax cuts particularly occur when left-wing
   governments are replaced by right-wing ones. These results do not vanish
   when controls are accounted for, while it can be particularly noticed
   that the condition of the municipal economy influences partisan
   ambitions. These findings thereby contradict prior theoretical
   assumptions that the local arena is free from ideological battles.},

Abstract = {Local food movements rely on engaged farmers, gardeners, and shoppers to
   challenge the conventional food system through consumer-based tactics by
   advocating food systems change to reduce social injustice and
   environmental harm. While much literature engages in debate over the
   efficacy of such ``lifestyle movements{''} to effect change, little
   analysis to date considers the rationale for and contexts in which
   lifestyle politics are used as an approach to address the
   socio-ecological impacts of conventional food production and
   consumption. Using interview data and participant observation collected
   from 57 leaders in eat-local initiatives in three Canadian cities, we
   analyze why leaders in the movement rely on consumer-based strategies to
   both initiate and sustain engagement from actors that might not
   otherwise engage in social movement mobilizations for food system
   change. We found that many ``eat-local{''} leaders are aware of the
   political limitations of shopping for change tactics, but withhold
   explicit critiques of power in the food system from public debate. They
   do so in order to maintain a perception of optimism that they perceive
   as central to maintaining and increasing engagement of consumer actors
   in eat-local initiatives. This study advances research on informal
   participation in food movements by demonstrating how convivial
   engagement at the everyday level can sustain political participation and
   simultaneously obscure critical political talk.},

Abstract = {The article traces the Chinese conception of citizenship in imperial
   China and its modern transformation by looking into the socio-political
   thought of modern Chinese intellectual Yan Fu (1854-1921). It begins
   with an analysis of the Confucian-Legalist ruler-ruled relationship in
   imperial Chinese history, arguing that it is characterized by a
   hierarchical order among four different social groups to which Chinese
   are divided and collectively belong. After depicting the historical
   context of late Qing China in which Yan plays a vital role, the article
   further discusses Yan Fu's transformation of Chinese citizenship idea
   based on cultural integration between Western and Chinese political
   thought. It introduces the idea of `symbiosis of the state and citizens'
   to illustrate Yan's vision of the Chinese citizenship model. The
   symbiotic relationship is characterized by 1), the endorsement of the
   liberty of individual min as citizens and the democracy of the state;
   2), the interdependence and reciprocity between citizens and the Chinese
   state.},

Abstract = {The article aims to analyze the presence of actors from the financial
   sector within the ownership and management of big business in Argentina
   between 2015 and 2019. The results highlight the importance of

   the role of nostalgic producerism, occupational risk, and feedback

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {One of the growing constituencies of populist movements has been those
   facing labour market risks. These individuals are hypothesized to be the
   most likely to find themselves in need of government protection or
   service provision as their occupations face challenges from abroad
   through global competition, domestically through competition from
   immigrant labour, or technologically from automation. Nations, however,
   vary in how their populations experience such risks. Some nations expend
   greater effort on job placement or retraining programmes. Others provide
   legislative protections for workers that shield them from the potential
   of lost employment. Using data from the latest three rounds of the
   European Social Survey, this paper seeks to examine how individual-level
   preferences towards populist radical right parties are mediated by the
   visibility/size of contemporary county-level efforts to ameliorate
   labour market risk in a sample of 14 West European nations. The analysis
   distinguishes whether occupational characteristics and/or government
   policies have a differential impact on supporting populist radical right
   parties. While labour market policies might be designed to mitigate
   labour market risk, for many individuals, they have the effect of
   intensifying support for populist parties.},

Abstract = {This piece reflects on my work and its relationship to the study of
   citizenship. Throughout my career, I have studied citizenship from
   various vantage points - including the regimes that extend/restrict
   rights; the movements that seek to deepen citizenship; the organizations
   that can upend it; and the states that are necessary to protect it. As a
   whole, my scholarship speaks to the inherent tension between inclusion
   and exclusion as well as between promise and practice. In this context,
   my work features the importance of social movements struggling to
   contest (and advance) the boundaries of citizenship (and often human
   rights) - expanding who is included and the rights this affords.},

Abstract = {Common good and commons are expressions that have been increasingly used
   in a pos-itive sense, either in terms of alternatives to a status quo
   that generates problems of various orders, or to refer to a common
   denominator that brings together something that it is sup-posed to be
   desirable, utopian or not. In this essay, the common good is discussed
   by passing through theoretical and ethical frameworks: the `common pool
   resources', the `Common' as a political principle and the `ethics of the
   common good'. The discussion is based on a remem-brance of the World
   Social Forum as a landmark for the discussion of planetary and universal
   alternatives; and of the humanism of praxis, a philosophical and
   practical perspective that is expressed in the categorical imperative
   declared by Marx in a classic text written in 1844 in which he declares
   the necessity to `destroy all relations in which the human being is a
   humiliated, subjugated, abandoned and negligible being'. These
   references make it possible to discuss the common good from the question
   of potentialities and possibilities: the common good, categorized as
   common pool resources, acquires a deeper, more radical, human, utopian
   and universal existence when it is thought of as ethics.},

Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of gothic violence in order to better
   theorize how domination operates in Mary Wollstonecraft's unfinished
   novel, The Wrongs of Woman, or Maria. The fictive companion to A
   Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Maria is an account of the titular
   character's struggle for self-determination in all aspects of her life,
   including her desire for a companionate partnership. I argue that
   Maria's ultimate lack of freedom is directly attributable to coverture,
   the patriarchal legal fiction whereby wives are subsumed under the legal
   persona of their fathers or husbands. Building on scholarship that
   positions Wollstonecraft as a republican feminist, I show how Maria
   articulates what I call gothic violence, a form of psychic domination
   that places the other in a condition of unfreedom by denying their
   status as an autonomous being and holding them in subordination through
   a variety of techniques, such as denial of legal and social status and
   testimonial quieting. I show how gothic violence results in the
   unfreedom of women through its reliance on domestic settings and
   intimate relationships, and with the support of law and custom, of which
   coverture is a central example. I conclude by suggesting that attending
   to gothic violence in Wollstonecraft's thought allows us to further see
   the continuity between her political and fictional writings.},

Abstract = {The Interoperability, continuous data and technology flow are core
   requirements of a proper smart city. Smart cities take on the
   characteristics of innovative, competitive and attractive megalopolises,
   which is strategically important for residents and investors. The aim of
   the article was to identify the current state and current issues of the
   Smart City concept implementation in Ukraine in the context of the
   experience of developed countries. The main methodological tools
   included the observation, statistical and comparative analysis. The
   study found that the effective development of digital transformation of
   territorial units in Ukraine requires focusing on certain factors during
   the implementation of the Smart City concept. Such factors conditionally
   include: technology-based infrastructure; environmental comments;
   constructive level of public transport; progressive city plans;
   opportunities for citizens to use appropriate resources. It was found
   reasonable to introduce infrastructural development of smart cities in
   Ukraine as a foundation of digital transformation of territorial units.
   Smart Cities were substantiated as an important tool for effective
   prevention and control of the pandemic without the introduction of
   restriction policies. A comparative analysis of the practice of Ukraine
   and developed countries in the implementation of infrastructural
   development of Smart Cities is a promising area of further research.},

Abstract = {The revival of the Quad with an ``Indo-Pacific strategy{''} was
   initially not taken seriously by China. However, after the COVID-19
   pandemic erupted in 2020, especially after the China-US trade war, the
   Quad is increasingly moving in a strategic direction aimed at containing
   China. From China's perspective, the United States is staging a
   ``five-four-three-two{''} formation in the Asia-Pacific, a form of an
   Asian NATO. In response, China's diplomatic efforts will focus on
   breaking the strategic containment of the US-led Quad.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Abstract = {A corpus of research on the effect of exposure to income inequality on
   citizens' economic policy preferences renders inconclusive results. At
   the same time, a distinct body of work demonstrates that ethnic
   fragmentation within a polity reduces government spending, presumably
   due to opposition among the public to spending believed to benefit
   stigmatized ethnic minorities. Focusing on the American context, this
   short article ties these two bodies of work together by arguing that the
   effect of routine exposure to income inequality should depend on the
   racial composition of the have-nots, with citizens being most likely to
   support liberal economic policies in the face of pronounced inequality
   only when potential beneficiaries are not a highly stigmatized minority
   group, such as Black Americans. Using geocoded survey data, we find that
   exposure to local economic inequality is only systematically associated
   with increased support for liberal economic policies when the respective
   have-nots are not Black.},

Abstract = {Recent research suggests that many faculty members believe that their
   students are lacking the information literacy (IL) skills needed to be
   successful in their college career. Reports also suggest that there is a
   broader issue about the uncertain position of IL in the university
   curriculum. This article uses data from a worldwide survey of political
   science faculty to better understand how widespread this perception is,
   what is being done about this perceived problem, and what steps can be
   taken to encourage faculty to implement IL training in the classroom. We
   find that faculty believe that there is a problem but many are not
   explicitly teaching IL as part of their courses. We also find that
   faculty members who have received IL training are far more likely to
   include it in their courses. This leads us to suggest that IL training
   should be provided at the faculty level, which will have positive
   downstream effects on the IL training that students receive. We also
   contend that IL deserves a more prominent place in the university
   curriculum.},

Journal = {ANALECTA POLITICA},

Abstract = {Various recent debates and initiatives have once again brought to the
   forefront the need to reform research evaluation and its greater link
   with society, based on a growing openness, collaboration and
   participation in the field of knowledge, following some of the
   principles of transition to open science. The foregoing entails multiple
   challenges for the design of research promotion instruments and their
   evaluation. Taking as a sample case an experience in the Research Area
   of the Latin American Council of Social Sciences (Clacso), this article
   aims to describe and analyze the challenges of evaluating research aimed
   at mobilizing knowledge, based on the configuration of Clacso's Groups
   of Work, with a focus on the criteria of the 2019-2022 call. In
   particular, the specific characteristics of the evaluation criteria
   involved in this program and its scope in relation to inclusion,
   openness, collaboration and interaction with society are explored. The
   approach is qualitative in nature and benefits from the collection of
   mainly documentary data related to the bases of the call for the
   2019-2022 Working Groups, the evaluation grids used and the

Abstract = {In a collaborative project, we argued that citizenship was always both
   `unfinished' (imparfaite) and `under construction' (en travaux). This
   contribution examines some of the ways in which citizenship continues to
   be unfinished and is in the process of being reconstructed. It
   highlights three particular tendencies that have dominated the processes
   - and the politics - of citizenship's reconstruction: a deepening
   nationalisation of citizenship; an ensuing intensification of practices
   of `bordering', even as borders become more mobile; and the
   subcontracting of the management of citizenship to agents and agencies
   `beyond' the state.},

Title = {Knowledge of Social Rights as Political Knowledge},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1911-1931},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Conventional measures of political knowledge assess citizens'
   familiarity with institutions, political parties, and political actors
   at the national level. We argue that other types of political knowledge
   are also important to democratic citizenship. We focus on knowledge
   about social rights (i.e., government guarantees that predominantly
   concern material well-being). We develop a new systemized concept that
   we call knowledge of social rights (KSR) and argue that KSR is
   particularly important in lower and middle-income countries. Using
   original survey data from Argentina, Brazil, Malawi, and Pakistan and
   secondary survey data from the Afrobarometer, we show ways in which KSR
   is empirically distinct from political knowledge as traditionally
   measured. The established correlates of conventional political knowledge
   in the United States also predict political knowledge in the contexts we
   examine. In contrast, these relationships are attenuated or in some
   cases reversed when we examine knowledge of social rights as an outcome.
   These results contribute to a growing literature that highlights the
   diverse areas of citizen knowledge that are relevant for contemporary
   politics. Our findings also point to the need for more research on forms
   of political knowledge outside the long-standing wealthy democracies.},

Abstract = {Populist appeals to `pure people' have been theorised to mobilise
   previously disengaged citizens. However, this `corrective consequence'
   has found weak support in empirical research. This finding is consistent
   with studies that suggest that novel campaign appeals and new political
   offerings have a negligible effect on turnout. As a consequence, this
   research proposes a distinction between the behavioural and attitudinal
   effects of populism and introduces a softened revision to the corrective
   argument: Despite a negligible behavioural impact on individuals'
   turnout propensity, the electoral success of populism is nevertheless
   associated with an attitudinal change: increased political interest.
   This proposition is supported by two empirical tests. The first detects
   this dynamic among 232,208 respondents in 136 national election studies
   from 16 Western countries (1970-2017). The second analysis, which uses
   an improved causal identification strategy, uncovers an analogous effect
   in the GESIS Panel (2014-17, Germany). Hence, the emergence of populist
   parties can stimulate political interest among citizens, even though it
   does not necessarily lead to increased turnout.},

Abstract = {In this contribution, I approach the question of the future of the
   African human rights system both by situating the issue within the
   broader context and by reference to the system's own institutional and
   political setting. To this end, I deploy the COVID-19 pandemic as a lens
   to discuss the existential questions facing human rights, drawing out
   the major issues the pandemic has brought out and the lessons we can
   take from these about the flaws and gaps in the current human rights
   system in general. While the issues that threaten human rights worldwide
   apply to human and peoples' rights in Africa, there are some contextual
   peculiarities to the question of the future of human and peoples' rights
   on the continent. Zooming in, I address these issues of specific concern
   for the African human rights system, which affect its current standing
   and are sure to frame its future trajectory. The first consists of the
   institutional and structural challenges that continue to bedevil the
   effective functioning of the human rights institutions making up the
   regional system. The second concerns the political, socioeconomic, and
   regional context in which the African human rights system operates and
   the tension that has emerged in this context between human rights
   institutions and African Union political bodies, as highlighted in
   recent trends of political backlash against these institutions. It is
   accordingly submitted that the future of human rights in Africa depends
   on how the existential challenges currently facing human rights in
   general, and the specific issues afflicting human rights in Africa, are
   resolved or at the very least managed.},

Abstract = {We examine an understudied component of partisan
   polarization-disagreement over whether the U.S. economy rewards merit.
   Drawing on data from party platforms and surveys over four decades, we
   illustrate large, and increasing, partisan divides in beliefs regarding
   whether an unequal society, or unequal behavior, is the cause of
   socioeconomic inequality. Republican politicians and citizens are
   optimistic about the American Dream and pessimistic about poor people's
   behavior; Democratic politicians and citizens are pessimistic about the
   Dream and optimistic about poor people's ability to succeed if given the
   chance. These patterns hold for beliefs about economic inequality along
   both class and race lines. Variation in societal versus individual blame
   is consistently associated with views on social welfare, taxation, and
   affirmative action. We conclude that Americans' beliefs about the
   fairness of the economy represent a crucial component of a
   redistributive versus anti-redistributive ideology that is increasingly
   associated with the two political parties.},

Abstract = {Asylum seekers who enter the European Union (EU) need temporary housing
   while awaiting the outcome of their asylum application procedures. It is
   unclear, however, which conditions must be fulfilled to achieve the goal
   defined by the EU that asylum seekers enjoy an `adequate standard of
   living', including housing. Because this goal is only described in
   general terms, there are large differences in asylum seekers'
   accommodation in and among EU member states. This article argues that
   multiple purposes would be served if the EU would adopt a right to
   adequate shelter for asylum seekers as a common accommodation standard
   with well described material conditions. In order to determine whether
   there would be a legal basis for a right to adequate shelter, and which
   conditions should be met, the article presents relevant sources of human
   right law and EU law. It also consults scholarly articles, NGO reports,
   blogs, and newspapers. An examination of the actual reception
   circumstances shows that several problems need to be addressed. Based on
   this analysis, I argue that the conditions for adequate shelter
   encompass safety, dignity, adequate structure, appropriate space and
   facilities, and temporariness.},

Abstract = {Because of its genealogy and a shared commitment to racial justice, the
   Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement might be expected to have strong
   cooperative links with community organizing groups. Close, localized
   study of the interactions between these two approaches to social change
   reveals, however, something quite different. Far from being harmonious,
   the relations between BLM and community organizing prove to be marked by
   distrust, sometimes competition, and, more sporadically, cooperation.
   This article, based on ethnographic surveys in Los Angeles and Chicago,
   investigates how the BLM movement deployed and took root at the local
   level and how it interacted with community organizing groups in both
   cities. Emphasizing the importance of blending a meso-sociological level
   of analysis with a micro-sociological approach, we argue that the
   relations of competition and distinction, embodied in distinct group
   styles, repertoires of action, and organizational forms, can be
   explained by taking into account the actors' resources, social
   properties, socializations, and trajectories. The article's comparative
   perspective also shows that forms of cooperation may exist despite
   competition, and that cooperation is made possible in particular by
   younger people playing a bridging role.},

Abstract = {The UK parliament's role in the Brexit process has been closely
   scrutinised and fiercely contested. Despite this, we still have
   relatively little systematic evidence about parliament's role in shaping
   Brexit legislation. This article therefore analyses the extent and
   nature of parliamentary influence on Brexit-related legislation between
   2017 and 2019. Using new data on the legislative passage of 13 different
   bills, including over 3000 proposed amendments, we measure the
   prominence of three different kinds of parliamentary influence, and
   compare this to findings from earlier periods. We show that some Brexit
   bills had a fairly typical parliamentary experience, with very few
   successful non-government amendments but numerous government
   concessions. However, a dramatic change from earlier periods was the
   large number of Brexit-related bills that were simply paused once the
   government encountered parliamentary difficulties. Parliament's
   influence over Brexit legislation in this period therefore showed
   elements of both continuity and change. This finding contributes to our
   understanding of the Brexit process, and of parliament's role in recent
   British politics.},

Abstract = {Solidarity is a key ingredient to making society work. Yet, recent
   developments such as the refugee crisis and the declining support for
   social democratic parties question the degree of solidarity in Western
   societies. So what could increase solidarity? The national identity
   argument (NIA) claims that a stronger national identity can foster
   solidarity. While this claim was proven in some cases, several others
   challenged it. This paper sets out to put the NIA to a severe empirical
   test by distinguishing five different forms of national identity:
   national belonging, national pride, patriotism, national chauvinism, and
   the normative perception of national boundaries. The data stems from
   national surveys in Germany, the UK, and the USA linked to the ISSP. The
   results reveal no clear support for the NIA. Whether national identity
   fosters solidarity depends on what type of national identity and what
   country one is looking at.},

Abstract = {Summer 2020 saw widespread protests under the banner Black Lives Matter.
   Coupled with the global pandemic that kept America's children in the
   predominant care of their parents, we argue that the latter half of 2020
   offers a unique moment to consider whites' race-focused parenting
   practices. We use Google Trends data and posts on public parenting
   Facebook pages to show that the remarkable levels of protest activity in
   summer 2020 served as a focusing event that not only directed Americans'
   attention to racial concepts but connected those concepts to parenting.
   Using a national survey of non-Hispanic white parents with white
   school-age children, we show that most white parents spoke with their
   children about race during this period and nearly three-quarters took
   actions to increase racial diversity in their children's environment or
   introduce them to racial politics. But the data also show parenting
   practices to be rife with uncertainty and deep partisan, gender, and
   socioeconomic divisions. Drawing upon our findings, we call for a
   renewed focus on political socialization that considers how parenting
   choices are shaped by political events-including Black Lives Matter-and
   the possible long-term consequences of racial parenting practices on
   politics.},

Abstract = {America Firstism is a political idea that, I argue, dates to the 1919-20
   Senate debate over the Treaty of Versailles. I recount that debate with
   the goal of demonstrating that the founders of America Firstism drew key
   elements of this idea from those places where durable features of the
   domestic political order clashed with the imperatives of the
   international system envisioned by the treaty's advocates. America
   Firstism, I claim, must be seen as a response to institutional conflict
   between domestic and international orders. One way to understand America
   Firstism's recurrence over the intervening century is by considering its
   origins in this institutional conflict.},

Title = {The rise of cybernetic citizenship},
Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 21},
Abstract = {The global COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates how states and companies
   mobilise new sociotechnical systems to track, trace, evaluate, and
   modulate the behaviour of citizens. This development illustrates an
   already-existing transformation of citizenship governance, which this
   article captures as the move to `cybernetic citizenship'. First, the
   article explores the concept of cybernetic citizenship, providing an
   overview of the concepts of `cybernetic' and `citizenship' and
   synthesising these in a discussion of the cybernetic modulation of
   citizenship. Second, it presents the rise of cybernetic citizenship in
   the urban realm, zooming in on the case of the Chinese social credit
   system and the way it affects civic life in the urban realm. Third, it
   turns into the normative implications of cybernetic citizenship, arguing
   that it confronts the idea of citizens as equal, free, and vigilant. It
   challenges equality by turning rights into ends, freedom by turning
   status into process, and civic virtue by turning excellence into
   effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Differentiated integration (DI) in the European Union (EU) has mainly
   been understood as variation in participation in common policies. But DI
   also has implications for the nature and functioning of the EU as a
   polity. While temporary DI may facilitate deeper integration, permanent
   DI is liable to increase transaction costs and fragmentation. However,
   little is known about how such alternatives are assessed by
   decision-makers in the member states. This article uses novel
   quantitative and qualitative data to shed light on this question. It
   looks at the explanatory role of various types of opt-outs and at member
   states' dependence, capacity, and identity. We find that temporary and
   permanent differentiation are assessed differently in the member states
   but neither alternative is clearly preferred. Long-term involuntary
   opt-outs are related to negative assessments of both forms of DI.
   Surprisingly, voluntary opt-outs do not seem to lead to more positive
   assessments of DI. We also find that the temporary DI is preferred in
   smaller member states, while support for permanent DI is higher in
   larger member states. Finally, we find differences in the effects of
   dependency, capacity, and identity between older and newer member
   states.},

Abstract = {The selection process by which individuals are recruited and elected
   into office creates a population of elected officials with distinct
   characteristics and personality traits. In this paper, we investigate
   the relationship between those personality traits and the
   representational approaches and behaviors of local elected officials.
   Combining a survey of local municipal officials with an audit study with
   the same individuals, we examine how variations in the personality
   traits of local officials affect their preferred representational
   approaches and responsiveness to constituent policy concerns. We find
   significant variation by personality traits both in the approaches that
   local officials take to representation as well as the rate and nature of
   the responsiveness of these officials to inquiries about policy from
   constituents with whom they agree and disagree.},

Abstract = {Scholarly research suggests that Canadian election campaigns are
   centralized affairs, with party headquarters managing a disciplined
   campaign organization across 338 federal constituencies. At the same
   time, local realities can incentivize constituency campaigns to deviate
   from their parties. This article examines the extent of local campaign
   discipline, given these tensions between parties' centralizing
   compulsions and countervailing forces that militate against party
   cohesion. The article relies on original data to identify and explain
   the extent of local campaign behaviour that defies central party
   preferences and directives. It draws from interviews with 87 former
   candidates and eight party strategists, as well as observational data
   gathered from 10 constituency campaigns during the 2019 federal
   election. The findings indicate a relatively high level of undisciplined
   constituency campaign behaviour during the 2015 and 2019 elections. The
   article contends that this behaviour stems from insubordination,
   innovation and incompetence within constituency campaigns.},

Abstract = {A vast empirical literature has investigated economies of scale in local
   service provision, especially in water and waste management. By
   contrast, the question of scale economies in local government
   administration has attracted much less attention, especially in
   Australian local government. To address this gap in the Australian
   empirical literature, we investigated administrative scale economies in
   the New South Wales (NSW) local government system for rural, regional,
   and urban local authorities over the period 2014/15 to 2017/18. We find
   that total municipal population and municipal staff exhibit a U-shaped
   relationship with the total administration costs of urban councils in
   NSW. However, we find no economies of scale for administrative intensity
   in rural and regional councils in NSW.},

Abstract = {In this study, we provide descriptive evidence on the importance and
   evolution of climate-related energy policy in Swiss elections over the
   past 15 years. We combined data collected by us on the issue of energy
   transition (as the primary policy tool to prevent climate change) in
   party manifestos with the results of recent Swiss election studies on
   voter preferences. Our findings indicate that energy and environmental
   issues have become increasingly polarizing for both parties and voters.
   This development was mainly driven by the populist right SVP.
   Simultaneously, the salience of the issue has risen across the
   electorate and for parties on the right of the political divide.
   However, issue owning green parties are particularly devoting less
   attention to energy and environmental issues, narrowing the space in
   which parties compete along this dimension and disregarding the strong
   upward trend of these issues among their core voters.},

Abstract = {Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) candidates for public
   office generally perform better among traditional Democratic voters
   including women, progressives, young people, People of Color (POC), and
   the non-religious. Yet, LGBT candidates represent only a fraction of
   elected officials even in ``liberal{''} states such as California. Using
   data from a representative sample of California voters, I examine the
   relationship between Christian nationalism and support for LGBT
   political candidates. I hypothesize Christian nationalism consolidates
   hetero- and cisnormative boundaries around American identity which
   exclude LGBT people and extend across groups who are traditionally
   supportive of LGBT rights. While the research design cannot demonstrate
   causation, I find adherence to Christian nationalism is associated with
   opposition to both lesbian/gay and transgender candidates. Furthermore,
   the negative effects of Christian nationalism are invariant across
   measures of partisanship, race, and religious affiliation. Other
   variables including gender identity, education, and age also predict
   support for LGBT candidates, but the results suggest Christian
   nationalism likely represents a stained-glass ceiling for candidates
   among potential constituents, even constituents from traditionally
   supportive groups.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to make an approach to the concept of
   madness in two significant works of Modernity: Orlando Furioso by
   Ariosto and Mandragora by Machiavelli. Although both are authors of
   Italian Renaissance humanism, they make a different approach to the
   events of their time, which drive the writing of their works, and which
   reveal the close relationship between the political and social events of
   the moment in the case of Machiavelli, and the reference to classical
   and medieval sources in Ariosto. The methodology used in this work
   constitutes a documentary review of the sources, in order to establish a
   parallelism between them.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to reconstruct Hannah Arendt's understanding of the
   notion of the body. To this end, we divide the text into four sections.
   The first of them describes the way in which the body manifests itself
   in labor as an activity dedicated to the satisfaction of the biological
   needs of the organism. In this framework, the body expresses its
   properly biological dimension, tied to the needs and demands of natural
   life. In the second section, we observe how the body is involved in
   work, as a human activity that seeks to produce an objective external
   world. There it is shown that the production of this external world
   depends on the intervention of the body as an instrument. In the third
   section, we analyze the way in which the body manifests itself in
   violent action, understood as an action that, although it does not
   become political, succeeds in founding a space of fraternity. In this
   horizon, the body emerges as a reaction in response to an injustice.
   Finally, in the fourth section, we try to show that, in the field of
   political action, the body expresses itself in two ways: on the one
   hand, as speaking bodies, which manifest their singularity through their
   body and their voice; on the other hand, as performative bodies that in
   their meeting manage to give existence to the political body.},

Abstract = {In retracing the main moments of the reflections of Pierre Levy and
   Derrick de Kerckhove, two of the greatest exponents of the so- called
   cyberculture, the purpose of the essay is to compare their
   philosophical-political theses to evaluate their effective impact in the
   light of social and political transformations that have occurred over
   the last few decades. What we intend to show is how the differences
   between Levy and de Kerckhove are due, in large part, to a different
   interpretation of the influence exerted by technologies on the human
   cognitive structure. Two political perspectives arise from these
   differences. Although starting from similar assumptions, they end up
   favoring the notion of participation in the first case, and that of
   transparency in the second one. However, in recent years, both Levy and,
   more strongly, de Kerckhove have preferred to focus, unlike in the past,
   on the dangers associated with the use of ICTs, one coming, as an
   antidote to the threat of dataism, to talk about << Reflective
   collective intelligence >> and the other one, relying on the concept of
   digital twin, to fear the disturbing scenario of << datacracy >>},

Abstract = {If the jurist is a good shepherd: the romantic tale of strategic
   litigations and the warnStrategic litigations are a means of using the
   trial to create norms. What is new? Very little, from the views of a
   legal culture which, as the one that dominates from modernity onwards,
   is convinced that law is a matter of decisions and that everything in
   law is doomed to change, because it relies only on will. There is a lot
   new, however, from the views of a classical, ancient, or pre-modern
   legal culture, which thought that a rule was first of all an act of
   knowledge, and that the legal experience - a facet of the human
   experience, which always changes, and it is always the same - contained
   some unchanging principles, often expressed by ancient Roman maxims,
   which were considered as many observations and interpretations of facts.
   In Italy this culture (which can be said pre-modern because convinced
   that facts and values communicate), survived so long that it was still
   the target of harsh criticism in the second half of 1900. In 1966, this
   criticism invested an emblematic maxim, In pari causa turpitudinis,
   which, saying that no right can arise from crime, warns against the
   risks of abusing justice. The polemics marked the triumph of culture
   animated by noble aims of reform, by pastoral intentions of inclusion
   and emancipation, convinced that no fact, no human action, no relation
   must remain out of the scope of law. The ancient maxim, that posed some
   limits to the cases and matters on which law could intervene, was now
   deemed immoral, selfish, indifferent: formalistic. Expression of legal
   activism and romanticism, the polemics against In pari causa had good
   intentions, but also a cost: it made us forget that when it aims to a
   purpose, a trial does not deserve this name.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyze the relations between
   democratic political life and techno-scientific configurations that
   model the current way of living. This work will host the question about
   a new nomos and it will be based on a case study about the 2016 United
   States presidential election. This case comes as extremely appropriate
   because it allows us to think about the way in which data companies and
   social networks enter to the political arena during the whole campaign.
   As we could identify, these new configurations of politics can promote
   democratic participation, deliberately affect circulation of
   information, increase or diminish engagement to candidates as well as
   modify electoral behavior of the citizens. Also, it implies evaluating
   the conditions of existence that the technological totality proposes and
   needs from the human beings to develop itself. Even though we may not
   declare that the reason of Donald Trump's triumph was related to these
   new actors in politics, the case assisted us in the task of illustrating
   how the democratic ways of governing in the present times intertwine
   with a new political configuration of political life. Although it may
   not bring out a new political order, this question addresses the
   theoretical-political question about the structure of the world, i.e.,
   the question about a new nomos.},

Abstract = {How do face-to-face, assembly processes, and non-face-to-face, popular
   vote processes impact the decisions made by citizens? Normative
   discussions of the comparative merits of these two broad types of
   participatory decision-making processes partly rely on empirical
   assumptions concerning this question. In this paper, we test the central
   assumption that assemblies lead to decisions that are more widely
   supported by participants than popular votes. We do so by analyzing
   1,400 decisions made through these processes on the highly salient issue
   of municipal mergers in Swiss municipalities since 1999. We find that
   assembly decisions are consistently made by larger majorities than
   popular vote decisions and that this relationship is significantly
   mediated by turnout. This suggests that higher levels of agreement in
   assemblies mainly result from selection biases - with fewer dissenting
   citizens participating in assemblies than in popular votes - rather than
   from internal dynamics in assemblies.},

Abstract = {The rising participatory demands of citizens have been addressed with a
   variety of democratic innovations. However, increasing demands for
   democratization have been accompanied by a parallel rise in scepticism
   and doubt about the capabilities of representative democracies to ensure
   policy efficacy. I seek to address this democratic ambivalence by
   focusing on the demands for citizen participation in the context of
   local democracy. In a series of qualitative interviews, and using
   Vienna's Seestadt Aspern, Europe's biggest city development project, as
   an illustration, I examine (a) bottom-up and top-down understandings of
   democracy and participation among administration, city-planners and
   citizens and (b) strategies to reconcile inconsistent expectations of
   participation. I show that conflicting understandings of participation
   are dealt with in different settings and that, despite a public
   commitment to democratic participation, citizens, city-planners and
   administration alike expect a democratically concealed yet controlled
   management process allegedly ensuring more efficacious policy decisions.},

Abstract = {The phenomenon known as emergency eLearning saw many institutions of
   higher education switch from face-to-face learning to virtual or online
   course delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The transition
   posed a unique suite of challenges to instructors and students alike,
   especially in the case of active learning pedagogy. This article
   reflects on the experiences of a multi-institutional, multi-term
   pedagogical project that implemented peer review assignments as
   opportunities for asynchronous but nevertheless active learning. We
   shared instructor experiences through the course design and application
   stages of courses in International Relations and political economy,
   discuss the ability of peer review assignments to create active learning
   opportunities in online courses, and reflect on our own pedagogical
   development benefited from the community of practice.},

Title = {Gifts for votes? Vote buying as a predictor of turnout in Latin America},
Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {20-32},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the repercussions of vote buying on turnout in
   presidential elections in eight Latin American countries. The research
   is conducted with individual-level data from the AmericasBarometer
   database from 2018 to 2019, which includes unique questions about the
   respondents' experience with vote buying and whether they participated

Abstract = {Intra-party competition is widespread and affects political parties'
   strength. This article presents a model of elections in which
   intra-party factions can devote resources to campaigning for the party
   or undermining competing factions to obtain more power. The model shows
   that inter- and intra-party competition are substitutes: Internal
   competition increases when the electoral stakes are low - for example,
   in consensus democracies granting power to losing parties - because the
   incentives to focus on the fight for internal power increase. Similarly,
   an increase in party polarization incentivizes factions to campaign to
   avoid a more costly electoral loss. Factions in the moderate party
   campaign more than those in the extreme party; conversely, when factions
   in the same party are ideologically divided, extreme factions campaign
   more. Finally, the model studies how internal rules affect intra-party
   competition, showing how parties design internal contests among factions
   to maximize campaigning.},

Abstract = {Is reciprocity possible in human rights agreements? This article argues
   that human rights agreements can create negative diffuse reciprocity if
   there is reliable information about countries' compliance levels. The
   article analyses the link between information on countries'
   non-compliance with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
   Cultural Rights on the one hand, and countries' efforts to protect
   social economic rights on the other. It finds that the more information
   is published on violations of rights, the lower the levels of countries'
   efforts to protect these rights. This means that countries practice
   negative diffuse reciprocity with regard to the International Covenant
   on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This is a notable finding since
   there are several factors working against the practice of reciprocity in
   human rights agreements. The article draws theoretical conclusions
   regarding the conditions for reciprocity in human rights agreements and
   sheds new light on the concept of reciprocity and its link with
   information.},

Title = {Political information consumption and electoral turnout during COVID:
   the case of the 2020 municipal elections},

Abstract = {The effects on political participation of the consumption of political
   information from traditional and digital media are widely addressed in
   the literature. However, what happens in times of pandemic when people
   have other pressing concerns that are likely to receive significant
   media coverage? Does the consumption of political information-which
   increases in times of pandemic-mobilize or rather demobilize voters in
   local elections? By focusing on the two rounds of the French municipal
   elections in March and June 2020, we explore how the pandemic affected
   turnout through the consumption of political information distributed by
   official news media and users on social media during the first peak of
   the crisis (March 2020) and during the first period of decline in
   contagion rates (June 2020). Our results show that the association
   between consumption of political information and participation is
   detectable but remains less relevant than traditional predictors of
   turnout such as socio-demographic variables or an interest in politics.
   Moreover, we show that the strength of the effect of consumption of
   political information varies according to both the type of election and
   the type of political information consumption (local or national news,
   online or offline). Overall, it seems that the pandemic context had
   little effect on the relations between political information consumption
   and electoral participation.},

Abstract = {The rise of a new political lexicon-indirectly referring to the
   military's interference in political affairs-in Pakistan's
   civil-military relations (2013-2018) is a recent development. It marked
   the beginning of a transitionary phase in the country's political
   culture and provided an alternative medium for political dissent. It
   helped strike a balance between outright confrontation and complete
   conformism by civilian forces in the political spectrum. The consequent
   formation was tactical deference on the part of civilian authorities to
   voice dissent. This mode of dissent became prevalent in the statements
   of the party leaders. It is a pioneering step toward a more inclusive
   and open society in the country. This study explores how did the new
   political lexicon impact the state and society in Pakistan. This article
   covers a five-year period from 2013 to 2018.},

Title = {Democratic institutions in Brazilian tourism policy: An analysis of
   council laws},
Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {63-81},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Inclusiveness, popular control, considered judgment, and transparency
   are the consensual ``goods{''} democratic innovations should aim to
   produce, according to an analytical framework designed to study
   democratic institutions like policy councils. Tourism councils, although
   not often studied, represent a public policy with potential for local
   development and have as a peculiarity the predominance of entrepreneurs.
   These characteristics lead us to ask how the laws established by the
   councils contemplate participatory democracy. In this article, we carry
   out documentary research on the laws behind the creation and regulation
   of tourism councils in 10 Brazilian cities. Through content analysis,
   the results show that the rules favor some diversity of the members,
   with a bias toward the business sector. Popular control is a concern in
   only half the rules studied. Most councils favor considered judgment and
   internal transparency but are not concerned with external transparency.
   Overall, the laws show a lack of clarity in the organization of tourism
   councils, which affects the council members and society and leads to a
   failure to provide adequate rules to improve the production of
   democratic goods.},

Journal = {PUBLIUS-THE JOURNAL OF FEDERALISM},

Abstract = {In June 2020, President Trump issued an executive order calling for the
   deployment of federal law enforcement agents to protests against police
   brutality. Several mayors across the country objected to this unilateral
   deployment of federal force as unconstitutional. In an online survey
   experiment, we test whether the public stands against this type of
   federal power aggrandizement by evaluating how approval of federal
   intervention in protests changes depending on whether it is requested by
   local mayors or directed by the presidential administration. The results
   show that the public is responsive to the level of government directing
   the action. Respondents are significantly less approving of the use of
   federal forces when it is directed by the federal executive branch.
   However, not all subgroups respond equally to the manipulation. The
   treatment effects vary significantly by respondent partisanship, trust
   in government, and perceptions of the importance of federalism.},

Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-48},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study explains the adoption of the National Childcare and
   Development Network in Costa Rica using John Kingdon's multiple streams
   approach. Traditionally, the literature on social policies argues that
   in the presence of socioeconomic transformations and pressures from
   women's movements and from left or center-left governments, the adoption
   of care policies is more likely to happen. Yet, Costa Rica adopted its
   care policy during a fiscal crisis, with a lack of demands for care
   policies from the women's movement, and with a right-wing party in
   government. Drawing data from documents and semistructured interviews,
   this article demonstrates the applicability of the multiple streams
   approach to understand care policy-making processes in developing
   countries. The study finds that the multiple streams approach
   effectively explains the adoption of the policy as the product of
   top-down decisions from the national women's agency that constructs the
   problem, a close-knit policy design led by technocrats and bureaucrats,
   and the politicization of care policies to gain electoral support.},

Abstract = {Arguments about the supersession of historic injustice often use the
   dispossession of Indigenous lands as an example of the sort of injustice
   in the past that can be superseded in certain circumstances. This
   article aims not to directly challenge the content of such arguments but
   to place them into a different context, wherein they are seen playing a
   role in ongoing efforts to remove Indigenous understandings of law,
   justice, and morals from discussions aboutstate-Indigenous histories and
   interactions. The normative narrowness of these arguments is explored
   alongside developments within Canadian law that purport to respond to
   the historic denial of substantive Indigenous interests in lands by
   colonial and Canadian authorities. While the analysis predominantly
   takes a bird's-eye view of the interaction of varied normative systems,
   the conclusion advances a normatively charged argument, as I speculate
   about why courts - and academics writing about the passage of time -
   seem intent on developing arguments that displace Indigenous
   understandings.},

Abstract = {In several essays, Jeremy Waldron has suggested that changed
   circumstances may have superseded the rights of Native peoples to their
   ancestral lands. I contend that his argument is problematic and propose
   a Kant-inspired framework to assess the property and territorial claims
   of Native peoples. My conclusion is that, while in many cases they must
   share their country with the descendants of their colonizers and later
   arrivals, their prior property and territorial entitlements can leave a
   strong normative residue that should be addressed. My argument has
   general implications, but I focus on the Qom people in Argentina.},

Abstract = {Asylum-seeking women's liminal citizenship in home countries is a
   contributing factor to their irregular migration. In this paper, we
   examine how conditions of gendered citizenship, specifically family
   violence, exert additional pressures on women to undertake irregular
   journeys. In examining the narratives of refugee and asylum-seeking
   women from Iran and Afghanistan, women spoke of multiple instances of
   family violence in home countries, in addition to the more traditionally
   understood factors of insecurity associated with irregular migration,
   such as conflict, torture and war. Using the concept of lived
   citizenship to examine women's experiences, we contribute to the nexus
   of knowledge on global mobility, gender and family violence. These
   findings are important to ensure women who seek asylum have supports and
   services tailored to them that address these issues within the broader
   family violence schema in affluent host nations, including within the
   Australian context.},

Abstract = {Chile has become the first country in the world where an equal number of
   men and women will draft the new Constitution due a parity law that was
   passed in March 2020. In addition, this historic opportunity will take
   place during one of the worst health pandemics in recorded history,
   COVID-19, which has revealed deep gender inequalities. The new Chilean
   Constitution, drafted with gender parity, will have a unique opportunity
   to grant a right to a universal basic income (UBI), which has been
   targeted to address some of the worst consequences of the pandemic: the
   increase in poverty, unemployment, and vulnerability of women. This
   article reviews the theories developed to justify a UBI and the feminist
   critics who argue that not all UBI is equally advantageous to women. The
   misconception that a `morally neutral' model is sufficient and
   women-friendly disregards the way in which it encourages stereotypes
   that feminists have fought for centuries. We argue for the development
   of public policies with a gender focus, especially the right to a
   `gendered UBI'. This means a UBI that meets two basic requirements:
   first, that every citizen or resident be guaranteed the same amount of
   income from birth; second, that caregivers be provided with management
   rights to turn the UBI into a compensatory income that can also promote

Title = {China's Complex Leadership in G20 and Global Governance: From Hangzhou
   2016 to Kunming 2021},

Abstract = {How and why have China's G20 and thus global leadership changed since
   China hosted its first G20 summit at Hangzhou in September 2016? Since
   then the G20 has shaped global governance on an expanding array of
   subjects beyond its finance-economic core. China has consistently
   surpassed the other major powers in its economic growth, but also in its
   vulnerabilities at home. Its institutional leadership in
   long-established multilateral organizations has grown. The most
   systematic detailed account of China's leadership in G20 governance from
   1999 to 2015 argued that China was always a leader in G20 governance but
   never led alone, always doing so with another, different G20 member, as
   the subject changed. New findings arise by using an expanded model of
   China's leadership, matching Xi Jinping's priorities at G20 summits with
   the summit's collective conclusions, commitments, compliance, and
   institutional development of global governance and examining the
   critical cases of climate change, biodiversity, infrastructure, and
   digitalization. This shows that China's G20 leadership has become more
   complex and cautious since 2016, even as G20 performance has generally
   grown. In 2022 as China institutionally leads global governance on
   biodiversity and thus climate change, by hosting the United Nations
   biodiversity summit in Kunming in April and May, it can create
   cooperative leadership in the G20 from all the world's great
   biodiversity powers of Russia and Brazil from the BRICS, Canada and the
   US from the G7, and Indonesia as G20 host.},

Abstract = {This work explores the ways that federalism exacerbates gender
   inequality among women by explaining the adoption of domestic violence
   laws across different states in the context of policy diffusion. Using
   an original dataset of domestic violence firearm law (DVFL) enactments
   across all 50 states in the United States from 1990 to 2017, we analyze
   the circumstances under which states will adopt these laws. Using a set
   of political and demographic indicators as independent variables, we
   find evidence that state and federal factors influence policy adoption.
   In particular, the number of gun-related homicides, partisan control of
   the legislature, citizen ideology, federal policy, and election years
   each influence the likelihood of DVFL enactments. We find support for
   the effects of vertical policy diffusion on initial enactment of federal
   laws in this domain, but not for reauthorizations, which raises
   important questions about the continuous influence of the federal
   government on state policies.},

Abstract = {Though 1984 is often praised for its prescience, critics in Orwell's
   time and ours have also condemned its pessimism. Orwell's despair, the
   argument goes, undermines the power of his warning, representing a
   retreat from politics, a betrayal of socialism, and a repudiation of
   utopianism. This article draws on the text of 1984 and Orwell's
   contemporaneous writings to reassess his thinking on power, socialism,
   and utopia and to reconsider 1984's appeal to the political imagination.
   Characterizing Orwell's late political sensibility as one of desperate
   radicalism, the article demonstrates that Orwell remained both a
   socialist and a steward of the utopian imagination and that he feared
   totalitarianism because it threatened to expunge utopian ideals from
   historical consciousness. 1984 depicts a world in which this effort has
   nearly succeeded, rendering Orwell's present as a moment of choice
   between an egalitarian future and a future of permanent hierarchy.},

Abstract = {When the marginalized dare to speak of a world in which inequality is
   not the norm, they are accused of utopianism by those who usually do not
   take issue with faith-based assumptions that contradict even the most
   elementary of the laws of physics and biology. This irony has been going
   on unnoticed thanks to the bourgeoisie's totalitarian domination of the
   means of knowledge production. Given this hegemony, it is imperative for
   any genuine form of critical thought to seek a revolutionary mode of
   perception and theorization to deliberately and insistently negate the
   actual for the sake of the realizable. This is precisely the forgotten
   essence of critical theory. From its origins in Marx's work, critical
   theory was an anti-philosophy philosophy, a negative theory aimed at
   negating the capitalist and racist order and problematizing the unspoken
   rules of domination. These stateless outsiders who refused to compromise
   in return for personal and financial security left us a school of
   thought that adamantly defies the prevalent order in favor of universal
   emancipation. In defense of this stance, and negativity as a philosophy
   of resistance, this article aims to expand the potential scope of
   critical theory by enhancing its fidelity to the marginalized.},

Abstract = {Building on the work of Fikret Adaman and Pat Devine, this essay
   considers the social presuppositions for the construction of a socialist
   investment function. When it comes to investment, people care about many
   issues: not only efficiency but also work satisfaction, fairness,
   sustainability, and so on. Investment decisions therefore need to be
   structured to make people feel that their voices can be heard across the
   wide range of their concerns. Facing this complexity and potential for
   conflict, socialist investment would likely be structured as a
   negotiated political-planning process in which not only workers take
   part but also individuals organized into a variety of civic
   associations, including political, cultural, scientific, and religious.
   This essay questions how such associations would acquire the resources
   needed to carry out their activities and proposes a possible solution in
   social provisioning.},

   on the supranational political stage, in particular, its relationship
   with the European Union; (3) the legislative and policymaking activity
   of the Government. The main aim is to highlight the extent to which the
   technocratic nature of the executive played a role in each of these
   three areas of analysis. Elements of change and continuity with the

Abstract = {While philanthropy is seen as a critical instrument for wealth
   redistribution in countries with low state capacity or weak welfare
   institutions, there is little empirical evidence of its distributional
   consequences. What are the incentives of the rich to philanthropically
   invest in local public goods? How do these incentives shape inequalities
   in access to services across ethnic and social groups? I answer these
   questions by exploiting the fact that fountains in Ottoman Istanbul, a
   city with rigid religious and social cleavages, were built by the Muslim
   elite's private initiatives through the waqf system. Using data on water
   provision from 1868, I find that elites used philanthropy to benefit
   themselves disproportionately. Elite neighborhoods were more likely to
   have water access and had more fountains. Also, Muslim communities were
   better endowed than non-Muslim communities. I conclude that philanthropy
   can reproduce or even exacerbate inequalities in access to essential
   services.},

Abstract = {Although covert warfare does not readily lend itself to scientific
   inquiry, new technologies are increasingly providing scholars with tools
   that enable such research. In this note, we examine the effects of drone
   strikes on patterns of communication in Yemen using big data and anomaly
   detection methods. The combination of these analytic tools allows us to
   not only quantify some of the effects of drone strikes, but also to
   compare them to other shocks. We find that on average drone strikes
   leave a footprint in their aftermath, spurring significant but localized
   spikes in communication. This suggests that drone strikes are not a
   purely surgical intervention, but rather have a disruptive impact on the
   local population.},

   Kraho and Satere-Mawe. The article combines methodological techniques of
   ethnography and geolocation mapping. It also addresses the digital
   transformation of these non-objects, their displacements, and their new

   impossibility of defining such materiality, alive and interacting,
   through the use of Western categories based on the ontological

Abstract = {The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 consolidated executive budgetary
   powers within the presidency and Congress. I evaluate how the Act
   reforms altered the nature of executive budgetary influence, using an
   original historical database from fiscal years 1895 to 1940. I show that
   these reforms were not only consistent with both political branches'
   objective to empower presidents to rein in profligate executive budget
   proposals under the decentralized budgetary system but also afforded
   presidents greater budgetary influence when seeking higher funding
   levels relative to Congress. This mutually beneficial power-sharing
   arrangement between the president and Congress stands in contrast with
   existing accounts that these reforms favored one branch at the expense
   of the other. Finally, I offer evidence that this arrangement was made
   possible by solving collective action problems within the executive
   branch that reduced the capacity of seasoned agency heads to shape
   budgetary outcomes during the postreform era.},

Title = {Economic shocks and militant formation},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A prominent debate in the civil war literature asks whether commodity
   price shocks incentivize fighting, but existing analyses find
   inconsistent results. This paper shows these results arise, in part,
   because research conflates the decision to form a militant campaign with
   the start of civil conflict. Using original data on 973 militant groups,
   I sequentially disaggregate between civil conflict onset and the earlier
   stage of militant mobilization. I use fixed effect regression methods to
   test for indirect and interaction effects that could obscure the
   shock-civil conflict relationship. First, I estimate the effect of
   export commodity price shocks on mobilization onset. Second, I
   re-examine the shock-civil conflict relationship conditioning on the
   number of militant groups mobilizing at the time of the shock. The
   results show economic shocks indirectly increase the risk of civil
   conflict by driving militant formation. Disaggregating these stages of
   militant activity advances research about two-stage conflict processes
   as well as the indirect causes of violence.},

Abstract = {Conventional OLS fixed-effects and GLS random-effects estimators of
   dynamic models that control for individual-effects are known to be
   biased when applied to short panel data (T <= 10). GMM estimators are
   the most used alternative but are known to have drawbacks.
   Transformed-likelihood estimators are unused in political science. Of
   these, orthogonal reparameterization estimators are only tangentially
   referred to in any discipline. We introduce these estimators and test
   their performance, demonstrating that the unused orthogonal
   reparameterization estimator in particular performs very well and is an
   improvement on the commonly used GMM estimators. When T and/or N are
   small, it provides efficiency gains and overcomes the issues GMM
   estimators encounter in the estimation of long-run effects when the
   coefficient on the lagged dependent variable is close to one.},

Abstract = {Many studies have identified ethnic divisions as an obstacle to
   successful democratization. The present study examines political
   attitudes among ethnic majority Malays and two minority communities,
   Chinese and Indians, in Malaysia, a country which took a step toward
   democratization with a change of national government in 2018, yet seems
   to have reverted to single-party dominance. Utilizing survey data from
   2006 to 2019, we compare attitudes at four levels of political support
   among the three ethnic communities: rejection of authoritarian regimes,
   confidence in public institutions, engagement in channels of political
   participation, and national pride. The availability of data collected
   after 2018 allows us to detect changes following the country's first
   national-level power alternation. Empirical analysis reveals that in
   recent years the Chinese are significantly more likely to reject
   non-democratic regime alternatives to democracy compared with the ethnic
   majority Malays. Moreover, the Chinese community's long-held distrust in
   the government, parliament, judiciary and civil service has faded by
   2019, suggesting a change of attitude brought by the 2018 election. On
   the other hand, while all three ethnic groups express some degree of
   national pride in the surveys, ethnic minorities are less likely to be
   very proud of being Malaysian compared with ethnic Malays.},

Abstract = {We ask whether and why European political parties receive election news
   coverage abroad and investigate this phenomenon by combining theoretical
   stipulations regarding the politicisation of European integration and
   the horizontal Europeanisation of national public spheres. Based on a
   content analysis of 64 newspapers in 16 European Union countries
   following the 2019 European Parliament election, we argue that
   contestation over European integration increases the likelihood that
   foreign journalists report election results from a particular member
   state. Eurosceptic parties are more often visible abroad than Europhile
   parties, unless they stood for election in a highly polarised party
   system. Our results have important implications for the European Union's
   legitimacy as contestation over European integration increases the
   chances for citizens to learn about election results in other European
   countries.},

Abstract = {United States territories-home to more than 3.5 million Americans-are
   excluded from the safeguards of American federalism. Unlike states, they
   are subject to the plenary power of the U.S. Congress, lack core legal
   protections, and are denied meaningful political representation. As
   such, territories must find alternative approaches to exercising
   political voice in the American federal system. Yet territorial-federal
   relations have received virtually no empirical attention from federalism
   scholars. To address this gap, we examine territories' efforts to
   advance their interests within both bottom-up and top-down
   intergovernmental councils, as well as through territory-specific
   advocacy. Our analysis of organizational participation, agendas, and
   policy outcomes suggests that territories-while denied access to
   traditional mechanisms of shared rule-do participate in
   intergovernmental relations, through a combination of bottom-up and
   top-down multilateral intergovernmental councils (IGCs), as well as
   bilateral intergovernmental lobbying. Challenges to exercising political
   voice vary across these institutions.},

Title = {Party System Change in Eastern and Western Germany Between Convergence

Abstract = {This paper compares the evolution of critical characteristics of the
   party systems in Eastern and Western Germany since unification. While
   the institutionalisation hypothesis implies that the party system in
   Eastern Germany should adjust towards its Western German counterpart,
   the ongoing dealignment suggests a loosening of party-voter-linkages
   and, ultimately, non-institutionalisation in Eastern Germany and party
   system de-institutionalisation in Western Germany. However, both
   hypotheses predict a convergence. Against the backdrop of persisting
   regional differences in party strengths, a third hypothesis assumes that
   Eastern and Western Germany still have two distinct party systems thirty
   years after reunification. Using election results and survey data since
   the 1990s, we inspect the development of five indicators of party
   systems - volatility, vote-switching, electoral availability,
   fragmentation, and differences in vote shares - in light of the
   hypotheses. There are three main results: First, most of the indicators
   point to party system institutionalisation in Eastern Germany and
   convergence to Western Germany in the 1990s. Second, for the last 20
   years or so, the indicators point to parallel developments of
   dealignment and partial party system de-institutionalisation. Third,
   regarding the specific parties and their vote shares, there has been no
   convergence between Eastern and Western Germany.},

Abstract = {The continual rise of affective polarization in the United States harms
   trust in democratic institutions. Scholars cite processes of ideological
   and social sorting of the partisan coalitions in the electorate as
   contributing to the rise of affective polarization, but how do these
   processes relate to one another? Most scholarship implicitly assumes
   period effects-that people change their feelings toward the parties
   uniformly and contemporaneously as they sort. However, it is also
   possible that sorting and affective polarization link with one another
   as a function of age or cohort effects. In this paper, I estimate age,
   period and cohort effects on affective polarization, partisan strength,
   and ideological sorting. I find that affective polarization increases
   over time, but also as people age. Age-related increases in affective
   polarization occur as a function of increases in partisan strength, and
   for Republicans, social sorting. Meanwhile, sorting only partially
   explains period effects. These effects combine such that each cohort
   enters the electorate more affectively polarized than the last.},

Abstract = {Public employment services (PES) have undergone significant change since
   2011, reshaping the roles of the market, state, and community sector
   within Ireland's mixed economy of welfare. The post-crisis years saw the
   replacement of FaS with a new network of one-stop-shop Intreo activation
   services, and the procurement of new employment services for the
   long-term unemployed through competitive tendering and
   Payment-by-Results. This process of marketisation is now being extended
   to other PES currently delivered by community organisations under block
   grants, such as Local Employment Services and Job Clubs. We position
   Ireland's PES landscape as a strategic action field wherein various
   providers compete with one another for position, power and resources
   during episodes of contention. Applying this lens to the ongoing reform
   of activation policy and PES institutions, the paper considers how the
   recent trajectory of PES marketisation has remained politically
   contentious. It examines the strategies of various providers and policy
   actors in shaping the politics of reform, focusing especially on the
   position of community organisations within the field and the degree to
   which they have been able to strategically mobilise against
   marketisation. Lessons are drawn about the nature of Irish politics and
   policy reform.},

Abstract = {India, the world's largest democracy, has been experiencing a democratic
   decline. Since coming to power in 2014 and winning reelection in 2019,
   Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party have become
   increasingly illiberal and authoritarian. The rule of law has
   deteriorated, rights and liberties have been curtailed, and scholars and
   the media have been silenced. If electoral constraint, constitutional
   design, judicial independence, and a free press haven't slowed India's
   march toward illiberalism, what can? In November 2020, India's farmers
   began a highly organized protest against the government. In this
   research note, I ask, how has this protest protected Indian democracy
   from further degradation, and has it radically altered India's political
   future? I argue that the farmers' protest provides an alternative vision
   of democracy, one rooted in radical egalitarianism. Protesting farmers
   have actualized the spirit of dissent enshrined in the Indian
   constitution by holding the current government accountable to it.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the behavioural immune system hypothesis, we argue that the
   prevalence of the Covid-19 pandemic threat in an individual's respective
   environment relates to exclusive, ethnic conceptions of nationhood.
   Referring to the affective intelligence theory, we maintain that
   specific negative emotions are prompted by the perception of being
   exposed to a pandemic threat, and these emotional states in turn
   structure political preferences regarding national belonging. Using an
   original survey in six European countries during the first peak of the
   pandemic in late April and early May 2020, we analyze both the impact of
   individual Covid-19 experiences and the contextual exposure to a
   pandemic threat through hierarchical analyses of 105 European regions.
   Our empirical analysis shows that exposure to the pandemic is linked to
   stronger ethnic national identities for both levels of analysis. We also
   find that anger substantially mediates this relationship and has primacy
   over feelings of fear. Taken together, our results indicate that the
   behavioural immune system appears as a pervasive obstacle to inclusive
   orientations.},

Abstract = {We investigate the prevalence and correlates of sexism in the British
   political context, using a measure of ambivalent sexism that
   distinguishes between hostile and benevolent sexist attitudes. Drawing
   on original data from two nationally representative online surveys, we
   find that more than half of the population hold some sexist attitudes
   and that these are predicted by gender, education, religiosity and
   authoritarian values. We demonstrate that the most significant division
   in sexist attitudes within the British electorate falls along political
   rather than gender lines, with men and women expressing more similar
   views about sexism than either Conservative and Labour voters, or Leave
   and Remain supporters. We also find that endorsing hostile sexism is
   associated with voting Conservative in the 2019 general election, even
   after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and political
   values. Our findings reveal that sexism is important for political
   competition in contexts where gender is not obviously salient.},

Abstract = {Can non-citizen enfranchisement policies reduce the turnout gap between
   citizens with an immigration background and native citizen voters? While
   increasingly common in practice, there are only a handful of studies on
   the political consequences of non-citizen enfranchisement on voter
   mobilisation. Here, we examine the impact of non-citizen voting (NCV)
   rights on the political participation of citizens with and without an
   immigration background. Focusing on Switzerland, we use high-quality
   household panel data (SHP) from 1999 to 2014, leveraging both
   longitudinal and municipal level variation of enfranchisement laws when
   identifying their effect on turnout. We show that NCV rights boost
   political participation overall, and it particularly enhances turnout
   among citizens with an immigration background. Our analysis adds to
   existing theoretical explanations and empirical debates on
   representation and political participation in diverse democratic
   societies with large immigrant populations.},

Title = {Issue substitution or volume expansion? How parties accommodate agenda
   change},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {How do political actors respond when an issue suddenly jumps to the top
   of the public agenda? While conventional theories of party behaviour
   predict that parties increase their attention to that issue, they tell
   us little about how they will do so. One approach is to increase
   attention to the focal issue while maintaining the messaging level on
   other issues (volume expansion). Alternatively, political actors can
   increase their attention to the focal issue while decreasing their
   emphasis on other issues (issue substitution). We theorize that the
   overall volume of communication determines which approach dominates:
   Parties with high communication volumes will tend towards issue
   substitution, whereas those with lower communication volumes will prefer
   volume expansion. We confirm this hypothesis using a data set covering
   all press releases issued by members of the Austrian parliament between
   2013 and 2017-a period that includes the 2015 `refugee crisis' as an
   agenda shock.},

Abstract = {The activating welfare state often frames recruiting ordinary people as
   `local' co-producers of residence-based welfare provisions as the
   antidote to standardised bureaucracy. This article demonstrates that
   their enrolment in the delivery of public services in the Netherlands
   constitutes not an antidote, but another variant of standardisation. To
   do so, it introduces the concept of `intimate standardisation', a set of
   tactics and techniques that draw from and seek to evoke intimacy, rather
   than bureaucracy as a standardising mechanism. Drawing upon ethnographic
   fieldwork in the knowledge practices of third sector professionals who
   enrol ordinary people in residence-based welfare delivery across the
   Netherlands, the article demonstrates how intimate standardisation
   produces and circulates qualifications of `local' citizenship from one
   locale to another. In conclusion, I discuss the dynamics of power and
   politics at play in intimate standardisation to reflect upon the
   governmentalisation of local people in the broader context of the
   activating welfare state.},

Title = {When handpicked successors of charismatic leaders prosper: the
   surprising success of Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia},

Pages = {1116-1136},

Abstract = {Charismatic leaders, who loathe sharing power, often anoint sycophantic
   successors who fail to become powerful leaders in their own right.
   Curiously, however, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos (2010-2018),
   the handpicked successor of Alvaro Uribe (2002-2010), became a
   remarkably effective leader who served two terms and oversaw Colombia's
   landmark 2016 peace agreement. We investigate this unlikely outcome and
   develop a novel theory to reveal a pathway through which some handpicked
   successors of charismatic leaders can establish independent authority.
   We argue that success is more likely when the successor breaks away from
   the predecessor. However, doing so requires the successor to engage in a
   sequential and highly strategic process we label tightrope walking, in
   which the new leader gains the predecessor's endorsement to win office,
   expands his/her coalition by incorporating new allies from outside the
   predecessor's base, and reforms the predecessor's unsustainable policies
   and narrative. To substantiate our theory, we trace how Santos moved
   through each stage of the tightrope-walking process and ultimately broke
   from Uribe to achieve independent authority. The results suggest a rare
   but important mechanism through which charismatic movements can be
   challenged from the inside out, curtailing or reversing democratic
   erosion.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 global pandemic has had a devastating impact on economies
   and could lead to a surge in shadow or informal economic activity.
   Perhaps more than ever it is imperative to understand the nature and
   drivers of shadow economies. The primary focus of this analysis is to
   reexamine the relationship between corruption and shadow economies by
   extending previous research to consider a possible moderating effect
   between economic development and corruption on shadow economies. It is
   hypothesised that the effect of corruption on the shadow economy will
   vary with the level of economic development, with corruption having the
   strongest positive effect in low income countries, but this effect will
   be mitigated as the level of economic development increases. We find
   empirical evidence to support this hypothesis using multiple data
   measures of country corruption and the size of the shadow economy.
   Policy implications are offered based on the empirical results.},

Abstract = {Utilizing a nationally representative survey of Americans from December
   2020, we consider the degree to which COVID-19 risk perceptions are
   related to political factors. We examine the likelihood that one
   believes they will be infected with COVID-19, the likelihood that a peer
   will be infected, and the difference between the individual and peer
   perceived risks, known as optimism bias, and compare these perceptions
   across partisan characteristics. Results show that Trump voting category
   is the most important contributor to perceived COVID-19 risks. We find
   similar partisan differences as prior research, note that these
   differences persisted through the end of 2020, despite the
   post-Thanksgiving surge with high and growing rates of COVID in all
   regions of the United States. Contrary to prior expectations,
   partisanship does not strongly predict the level of optimism bias, as
   both assessed personal and general health risks track closely with one
   another by both political party and ideology.},

Abstract = {About one third of American voters cast a vote more ``against{''} than
   ``for{''} a candidate in the 2020 Presidential election. This pattern,
   designated by negative voting, has been initially understood by rational
   choice scholarship as a product of cognitive dissonance and/or
   retrospective evaluations. This article revisits this concept through
   the affective polarization framework in the light of the rise of
   political sectarianism in American society. Based on an original CAWI
   survey fielded after the 2020 election, our regression analysis
   demonstrates that the predicted probability of casting a negative vote
   significantly increases among individuals for whom out-candidate hate
   outweighs in-candidate love. Negative voting is less prevalent among
   partisans as their higher levels of in-group affection can offset
   out-group contempt. By asserting the enduring relevance of negative
   voting in American presidential elections, we aim at stimulating further
   research and discussion of its implications for democratic
   representation.},

Abstract = {The texts of Walid Daka, a Palestinian political prisoner incarcerated
   since 1986, challenge the notion that colonial power ends with
   decolonization and expose the shortcomings of examining colonial prisons
   solely through the eliminatory prism of death and deprivation. Studying
   Daka's texts, the article presents how the Israeli carceral system has
   managed to utilize prisoners' hopes and longings - in their relations
   with one another, their political actions such as hunger strikes or
   their building of internal leadership hierarchies, and their affective
   worlds - to further its own goals. Rather than a pessimistic account,
   this article critically analyzes Daka's writings to demonstrate how a
   first-person study of carceral subjectification can unfold within an
   activist framework. Daka uses these observations to develop an
   alternative articulation of decolonization that I term `abolitionist
   decolonization' as a collective and continued insistence on setting the
   terms of getting free. By `abolitionist decolonization,' I conjure a
   difficult conversation between a Fanonian project of never-ending
   decolonization and a Foucauldian project of never-ending abolition. As
   such, this critical attitude aims to counter settler-colonial
   carcerality in ways that will foil the administration's attempts to
   reproduce the dangers that the prisoners seek to elude, through the very
   means they deploy to elude them.},

Abstract = {Strategic health diplomacy (SHD) involves governments actively working
   to improve public health abroad and, at the same time, further their own
   foreign policy agenda. While military assets are often used in soft
   power roles that might enable such work (defence engagement), the
   contribution of Defence to SHD is not well articulated. Simon Horne and
   Laura McCrae draw on recent research to understand how defence assets
   can contribute to SHD, the mechanism by which health impacts deliver
   strategic security objectives and the most effective means to deliver
   those effects. They challenge approaches where SHD is considered
   primarily in terms of UK influence, showing how the real benefit to the
   UK depends on the delivery of large-scale, sustainable benefit to the
   partner country.},

Abstract = {The Pinjarra Massacre of 1834 was a large-scale colonial attack on
   Aboriginal people in Western Australia. Led by Governor James Stirling,
   a party of British police, soldiers and settlers ambushed a group of
   Bindjareb Noongar, killing of at least 15 Bindjareb Noongar men by
   Stirling's reckoning, and as many as 80 men, women, and children by
   other accounts. Though the event was widely recorded in the
   nineteenth-century, this massacre was effaced in the commemoration of
   its leader - Governor Stirling. This article will trace the history of
   the massacre and how it has been remembered, the troubled history of a
   statue of Stirling which still stands in the city of Perth, and the
   fight by Bindjareb Noongar to establish a memorial to the victims.},

Title = {Understanding drivers of support for English city-region devolution: a
   case study of the Liverpool City Region},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},

Abstract = {Metro mayors heading a combined authority represent the most recent
   innovation in English devolution. City-region devolution has been a key
   way in which successive Conservative governments have sought to boost
   local economic growth against a background of local authority austerity,
   and now form a part of the Johnson government's `levelling up' agenda.
   However, the perspective of voters is often overlooked in these debates.
   City-region devolution is a top-down innovation, with a focus on
   city-region economics rather than democratic renewal or engagement, and
   there is so far very little academic literature on identifying the
   drivers of public support for mayoral combined authorities. This study
   draws on survey responses of voters in the Liverpool City Region and
   explores a number of potential drivers of support for the Liverpool City
   Region combined authority, including party support, English, British and
   European identity, left-right and other value positions, and the role of
   place in driving support. It finds that support for devolution to the
   Liverpool City Region is driven by whether one lives in the centre or
   periphery of the city region, support for the Labour Party, left-wing,
   socially liberal and European identities, as well as being female and
   older. This paper also lays the groundwork for further research into
   drivers of public support for city-region devolution in England.},

Title = {Proportional ranking in primary elections: A case study},
Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Many democratic political parties hold primary elections, which nicely
   reflects their democratic nature and promote, among other things, the
   democratic value of inclusiveness. However, the methods currently used
   for holding such primary elections may not be the most suitable,
   especially if some form of proportional ranking is desired. In this
   paper, we compare different algorithmic methods for holding primaries
   (i.e., different aggregation methods for voters' ballots) by evaluating
   the degree of proportional ranking that is achieved by each of them
   using real-world data. In particular, we compare six different
   algorithms by analyzing real-world data from a recent primary election
   conducted by the Israeli Democratit party. Technically, we analyze
   unique voter data and evaluate the proportionality achieved by means of
   cluster analysis, aiming at pinpointing the representation that is
   granted to different voter groups under each of the algorithmic methods
   considered. Our finding suggest that, contrary to the most-prominent
   primaries algorithm used (i.e., Approval), other methods such as
   Sequential Proportional Approval or Phragmen can bring about better
   proportional ranking and thus may be better suited for primary elections
   in practice.},

Abstract = {Should candidates respond when they are described as unelectable?
   Although strategic arguments about the viability and electability of
   candidates were commonplace in the 2016 election, we know little about
   whether campaigns can effectively rebut these arguments. Assessments of
   a candidate's chances in a general election are often complicated by
   partisanship and candidate-specific factors, and it is difficult to
   disentangle viability from electability. Our studies are situated in an
   electoral context without partisan primaries, which complicates
   judgments by pitting partisan goals against ideological and electability
   objectives. In our experiments, a Democratic candidate is described as
   viable in the first round of voting but unelectable in the second round,
   and Democratic voters are encouraged to strategically vote for a more
   acceptable Republican to advance. Subjects were then randomly selected
   to see a press release from the Democratic candidate responding to that
   description by asserting their electability. We find that when
   respondents see a campaign respond to the strategic voting argument by
   asserting their electability, it significantly improves perceptions of
   that candidate's electability but does not change voters' preferences.
   Candidates should push back when their electability is challenged.},

Abstract = {At the 2018 general election, Italy's two main populist parties, the
   Five-star Movement (M5s) and the League (Lega), achieved unprecedented
   success. They secured an absolute majority of votes and seats and
   eventually gave birth to the first government in Western Europe to be
   composed entirely of populist parties. Although the two parties are
   today located on opposite sides of the political spectrum, their
   experience of governing together raises relevant questions about the
   compatibility of their electorates. Using individual-level survey data,
   in this article we analyse the predictors of electoral support for the
   two parties. Empirical results show that the parties' voters occupy
   opposing positions on the left-right dimension and do not share all
   populist traits but share a `demarcationist' profile, as not only the
   Lega but also the M5s is influenced by anti-EU and anti-immigration
   attitudes.},

Abstract = {This article questions the discreet strategies of social anchoring of a
   dominant party. It analyzes how women affiliated with the AKP in Turkey
   contribute to this party's governing practices through their involvement
   in social work, a crucial area for its popularity. Based on a survey in
   the city of Gaziantep between 2018 and 2021, the article shows that
   social work is a sector largely delegated, at the local level, to women
   activists, volunteers, or professionals, some of whom are linked to the
   AKP. The study of the phenomena of multi-positioning, disengagement, and
   reconversion of women between the party, public institutions and their
   civil society partners reveals that women's trajectories may be based on
   discrete forms of patronage. Overall, the overflow of militant logics
   contributes to the partisan control of local public policy in the
   context of AKP's domination. Partisan repertoires of action have been
   imported into social policy devices that constitute interfaces between
   the public authorities and certain social groups of the AKP's core
   electorate. It is thus a particularly interesting case for exploring how
   partisan discretion can be mobilized by a dominant party, and the role
   of women in this strategy of anchoring and social control.},

Abstract = {The article studies the everyday of violent conflicts and wars. It uses
   Somalia as a case study to explore how ordinary people experience and
   legitimize actors of violence. Building on biographic interviews, I show
   how violence became a normalized aspect of daily lives and was
   integrated in the habitus of people who developed the ability to
   routinely respond to it. However, I also show, that the specific
   temporality of violence impedes its full routinization and
   normalization. Legitimation processes in Somalia are marked by the
   tension of the routinized extraordinariness that protracted violence
   generates. Unsurprisingly, therefore, legitimation was mainly driven by
   experiences of security. These experiences were closely tied to four
   factors: clan membership, mobility, justice, and patriarchal
   conventions. These findings demonstrate the need to further develop a
   relational and processual understanding of legitimation that takes
   account of the everyday, as it is here that the actions of violent
   groups are felt, discussed, agreed-upon, rejected, or contested.},

Abstract = {Phishing is a crime where the victim is contacted by an attacker posing
   as a trustworthy source and lures them into providing sensitive
   information. This work makes sure that time delay is averted, and the
   attack can be thwarted with fewer computational resources. To solve the
   above-mentioned problem, a web browser add-on that works as a background
   script on the client side is implemented. All the background scripts are
   made cross-platform compatible to make the development easier and more
   efficient. The contribution in this paper is the new add-on,
   Off-the-Hook-Plus. The main objective of this Off-the-Hook-Plus is to
   find if the web page that the user visits is a phish or not. The page
   redirect logs along with the page details are used to find if the site
   is a phish or not. And then, if the site happens to be a phish, the
   similar looking site, which this web page tries to impersonate, is
   given. To make the repeated accesses faster, a whitelist is maintained,
   where all the safe sites are logged. The add-on is experimentally
   evaluated, and the results are discussed and found to be effective.},

Title = {The Polyphonic Sounds of Europe: Users' Engagement With Parties'
   European-Focused Facebook Posts},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {108-120},
Abstract = {It is an old concern in public and academic debates that people are not
   interested in European-level issues, and even European Parliamentary
   election campaigns, which are the main democratic tools of the European
   Union (EU) to involve ordinary people into political decision-making,
   are mostly about national-level political topics. Moreover, even when
   European issues emerge, the context of its discussion is often harmful
   to European integration and strengthens the perceived importance of
   domestic politics. In the age of social media, however, users' content
   preferences may significantly affect the presence of different political
   levels in political campaigns, but these preferences are still largely
   uncovered in academic literature. To fill this gap, we investigate the
   direct and moderated effects of European-focused Facebook posts on user
   engagement drawing upon a content analysis dataset including 9,688 posts
   of 68 parties from 12 EU countries. In line with the well-known
   second-order election hypothesis (Reif \& Schmitt, 1980) we hypothesize
   a negative direct main effect. However, we also assume that this effect
   is moderated by several content-, and party-level factors, and when
   people engage with European-level contents they do it with those ones
   that are posted by populist parties, focused on a few divisive hot
   topics, and are framed with a negative tone. Moreover, we expect
   cross-country differences. We find that on the whole, user engagement
   with national-level political content prevails over the European-level,
   but in some countries there are no remarkable differences in user
   engagement patterns of the two levels. While our findings mostly confirm
   the second-order election hypothesis, they also demonstrate that
   European politics can spread within social media platforms in a less
   divisive and negative way than we expected. European-focused posts do
   not perform better when they are posted by populist parties, focused
   selectively on the salient issues of immigration or environment, or
   framed in a negative way.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of a special political form that
   arises in the ``empty space{''} on the ``edge of the state{''}, where
   actors of power exist remotely, beyond the boundaries of the
   ``emptiness{''}, but they can be materialized in it. The authors use the
   term ``periphery of power{''} to describe this political form. The
   article shows that ``empty space{''} is not a va-cuum, but it does not
   contain what the observer (in this case, the authorities) expects to
   see, what he can read and comprehend as some kind of entity. It is the
   absence of the expected objects, actors and practices that makes the
   space ``empty{''}.
   The paper verifies the hypothesis that, being ``empty{''} for an
   observer, such space is populated and has authorities. Empirically, the
   study is based on the results of two field works to the upper Lena
   River. The territory has neither settlement structure nor legal economic
   activity, and the number of registered residents is minimal. The nearest
   authorities (police, environmen-tal protection, municipal authorities,
   etc.) are located on the borders of the territory, and the distance to
   the nearest large city (Irkutsk) is 500-700 km. Nevertheless, the field
   work there revealed a fairly large community with its own hierarchy,
   stable forms of communication, legalization and mobiliza-tion of remote
   authorities. For members of this community, staying in the ``empty
   territory{''} makes no sense from the economic point of view. They are
   registered in other places (district centers or other regional cities,
   includ-ing capitals) and represent relatively successful citizens.
   However, the city remains for them nothing else but a source of
   resources (material, financial, etc.). They live exactly in the ``empty
   space{''}. Social networks are formed in it, statuses and communication
   are built, which can be turned into the space of power.
   The insights that the authors obtained give ground to assume that this
   process is not an outlier, but rather represented a more general process
   of sepa-rating a place to earn money and a place to live. According to
   their conclusion, while maintaining the current trends, the ``exit
   space{''} documented by them will expand, forming more and more new
   forms of ``emptiness{''}.},

Abstract = {Since 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has been
   prosecuting crimes of aggression, war crimes, genocide, and crimes
   against humanity. The legal requirements to constitute a crime of
   aggression may be very high under international criminal law, but they
   are likely to be met in the case of Russia's attack on Ukraine. However,
   in this case, the ICC can only exercise its jurisdiction if the act
   results from the aggressive act of a signatory state. But Russia has not
   signed the statute. The other three core crimes defined by international
   law, on the other hand, can be prosecuted before both the ICC and German
   courts. The list of possible war crimes and crimes against humanity
   committed by Russia's army in Ukraine is long. However, proving them is
   not easy. This is difficult in the case of genocide. Here, international
   jurisprudence basically requires proof that the perpetrator was striving
   for the physical, biological destruction of the group.},

Abstract = {The article examines the reconciliation mechanism of protectionist and
   liberalization components in the economic policy of the United States
   and China. Under tightening economic competition, the U.S. and China are
   implementing a set of measures to support national economies, aimed both
   at protecting the industries which are crucial for the development of
   the states, and at ensuring markets for the goods produced in the
   country. These observations have led to the hypothesis that the set of
   protectionist and liberalization tools in the economic policy of
   countries is combined and varied to ensure economic security and
   international competitiveness of national economies. Based on the
   analysis of indicators measuring the openness of the US and PRC
   economies as well as a number of examples of government intervention in
   the economy, the authors detect the trend towards the strengthening of
   protectionism in the economic policy of the states since 2008. Taking
   into consideration the research on the participation of both countries
   in globalization and integration projects, the authors determine the
   protectionist instruments implemented by China and the USA to improve
   the economic growth and competitive advantage of their economies. In
   particular, government subsidies, fiscal tools, administrative barriers,
   as well as tariff measures affecting the foreign trade of the countries
   under study have been identified. On the basis of the comparative
   analysis of certain indicators measuring the manifestation of
   protectionist and liberalization components in the economic policy of
   the United States and China, the authors highlight common and different
   trends in combining protectionism and free trade. The synthesis of
   findings has led to the conclusion about the complementarity and
   interdependence of the tools used in the economic policy of the states
   aimed at increasing the competitive advantages of national economies.},

Title = {Neoliberal Brazil and the paradox of distance learning at university
   level},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2022},
Number = {27},
Abstract = {This article aims to describe the paradox of distance learning in
   Brazilian universities created by the Coronavirus pandemic. With the
   spread of Covid 19, distance learning has proven to be the only way to
   avoid the interruption of academic activities at public universities.
   This situation constitutes a paradox. The neoliberalism that proved
   hegemonic in the 2018 Brazilian elections suggested distance learning as
   a tool which could reduce state investment in education and promote
   ``emancipatory{''} ideological monitoring. Coronavirus has brought this
   approach into question. In fact, public policies which reinforce the
   government system, rather than dismantling it, have become necessary.
   The social block in power, which, before the Covid 19 emergency, viewed
   distance learning - now deemed wholly unsuitable for replacing the
   multiple resources offered by face-to-face teaching - as a tool which
   could free people from statism and replace inperson learning without
   disparities in quality, is, amid the pandemic, faced with the problem of
   rethinking distance education at university level, which is now
   inexorably associated with lockdown and imprisonment and the realm of
   disease.},

Number = {1},
Pages = {29-50},
Month = {JAN-APR},
Abstract = {Keynes's economic theory is precisely, and truly, a method, and a logic,
   a new way of reasoning in economics, wherein form and content are not
   independent entities. Keynes's method is best described as an apparatus
   of probable reasoning, where the term probable refers to the logical
   conception of probability he exposed in his A Treatise on Probability.
   Probable reasoning is a non-demonstrative organised way of thinking,
   which however cannot furnish infallible answers nor settled conclusions.
   Keynes's theory of economics is in fact non-positivistic: it consists in
   a method of analysis, which necessarily requires reader's involvement.
   Readers are called upon to follow Keynes in his further analysis of the
   economic material. Keynes's theory is in fact an open-end theory shaped
   by an open system of thought. In Keynes's economics, there are no
   theoretical limits to further analysis: all closures are provisional,
   and the list of probable repercussions is never complete. The General
   Theory provides a perfect illustration of such an open-end theory
   produced by an equally open system of thought and a way of dealing with
   uncertainty.},

Abstract = {The debate on predistribution, which already pervades many areas of
   social sciences, does not seem to be a passing fad. But is it an
   unproblematic proposal? To be sure, the idea of predistribution ???the
   establishment of regulatory frameworks that allow for broad social
   participation within a ???civilized??? economic life??? has great
   potential for democratic thinking. But the most politically promising
   aspect among predistributionists is anything but new. In fact,
   transformative or ???popular??? political economies, from the
   seventeenth to the twenty-first centuries, have always stressed the
   importance of the ex-ante guarantee of resources of various kinds, in
   keeping with the main intuitions of the republican tradition. According
   to this tradition, the extension of freedom and not simply of material
   well-being was the main reason for predistribution. For this reason,
   rescuing the predistributive vestiges in republicanism seems something
   necessary in the light of some of the main approaches to
   predistribution, which are presented merely as a welfarist alternative
   to tax and transfers. This article tries to understand basic income as a
   predistributive tool beyond material welfare, that is, as a tool that
   makes possible a republican-democratic political economy that may lay
   the foundations for the collective co-determination of ways of working
   and living.},

Abstract = {Two of the most promising developments to emerge from the failed
   attempts to contain the spread of infectious disease outbreaks since the
   World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of novel
   coronavirus (2019-nCoV) a pandemic on 23 January 2020 are (i) an
   acceleration of the critique of neoliberalism and (ii) a reinvigoration
   of the state crime vocabulary. As Henry Giroux (2020) argued, the
   pandemic has exposed ``the plague of neoliberalism{''} and revealed the
   need for a new language to make sense of the current crisis. In this
   article, I argue that the language of state crime has both the
   terminological and the conceptual capacity to inform such a sense-making
   endeavour and, relatedly, that the academic literature on state
   criminality can complement critiques of the global neoliberal order in
   the context of the failed governance of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the digitization processes in Latin America over the
   last few years, as well as its relationship with the changes in the
   dynamics of information monitoring and political participation. First, a
   characterization of the changes in the political culture of the region
   is carried out, taking into account both its structural factors and
   subjective and cognitive conditioning factors, paying special attention
   to political and institutional trust and satisfaction. Second, the state
   of the art about the media in the region and its relationship with
   political culture are presented in order to deepen some of the dynamics
   of citizen political participation and its changes based on the new
   digital media. Subsequently, the results of the field work, obtained
   from the data collection of successive waves of the Latinobarometer, are
   analyzed.
   In relation to the digitization processes and the use of digital media
   for political information, the results show the great progress that the
   region has made, at the same time that they highlight the great
   differences between countries, finding development as the main
   explanatory variable. economic. Regarding the relationship between the
   components of political culture taken into account and the use of
   digital media for political information, the results show the role that
   both institutional trust and democratic satisfaction play in the
   political use of digital media.},

Pages = {239-267},
Abstract = {The present work aims to analyze the presence of the concept of
   neutrality in constitutional law. To this end, several application have
   been chosen to verify, in linguistic terms, connections and intersection
   between a broad Constitution Theory and neutrality: international law,
   democracy, separation of powers, the economic Constitution,
   administrations independent or religious freedom. The reason for making
   this preliminary examination is that neutrality is currently a
   controversial notion that has reappeared in the context of populism and
   the deep politicization of public and private life: with this, it seeks
   to give constitutional meaning to a term, that allows resolving
   controversies in which the fundamental rights of citizens are involved.},

Abstract = {This article explores press coverage of sport-related violence in the
   Czech Republic by applying Stuart Hall's analytical framework to
   articles published in selected newspapers between 1998 and 2017.
   Covering a gap in the current scholarship, this case study shows that in
   the Czech Republic there are similar trends to the ones present in other
   European countries when it comes to media coverage of sport-related
   violence. However, the typical simplifications and exaggerations
   associated to the topic are present only in a minor part of the analysed
   sample and even tabloid press articles report rather neutrally on the
   matter. There is also a marked difference in how the newspapers report
   on football - and ice hockey related violence, with the former largely
   explained by football supporters' characteristics and the latter more
   readily interpreted as directly influenced by the game. The scarce calls
   for action and reactions from politicians, as well as the fact that
   police and game authorities are usually those who seem to frame the
   topic support the thesis that sport-related violence is more often
   politicised by actors that deal with it as part of their everyday
   duties, while politicians only exploit it under certain socio-political
   circumstances.},

Abstract = {The history of the development of human communities opens up a large
   number of chapters of the alliance of rationality and power. The
   determining power of the implementation of elements of purposeful
   rationality at the political level is almost always represented by the
   legitimation of a certain type of interest associated with the greatest
   power to enforcing them. The primary goal of this paper is in an
   endeavour to place the normative nature of current (democratic)
   political regimes where we encounter the need for a more fundamental
   theoretical argument that would enable us to respond to their dynamic,
   often contradictory development. We focus on the productivity of
   dichotomies in the theory and practice of rationalism, irrationalism and
   liberal democracy. Their interaction in fact defines and creates the
   conditions for experimenting with different forms of political
   structures in the search for a better human and the world. At the same
   time, its performance not only defines the conditions for the
   theoretical justification of the idea of power, but also becomes a tool
   for its implementation. The theoretical background of this approach
   develops monitoring the content turbulences in the political systems of
   liberal democracies, with an emphasis on political life in Slovakia.
   Hence, in the present study, in the context of possible effects of the
   infectious disease COVID-19 on the activities of individual political
   actors, we point to a unique experience that contributes to addressing
   the issue of the way of establishing ``softer{''} forms of political
   communication instead of political struggle, especially at the level of
   relations between the conservative, socialist, and liberal
   party-political communities not just in Slovakia, but also in other
   countries around the world.},

Abstract = {The legacy of the KGB, the Soviet intelligence service, shapes Russia's
   domestic and foreign policy. Institutional structures have been
   preserved, values and worldviews have been passed down from one
   generation to the next, as are techniques of infiltration,
   disinformation, and assassination. Ukraine, which has the largest KGB
   holdings outside of Russia, and the Baltic states have opened up their
   archives, thus making new sources from the period 1954-1991 available to
   scholars and the public. This has sparked a veritable archival
   revolution. The new findings about the Soviet intelligence services also
   serve as background knowledge for analysing contemporary Russian
   politics.},

Abstract = {The objective of the research was to demonstrate the hypothesis that
   greater budgets do not generate greater procedural speed in the
   Constitutional Court of Peru (TC), restricting access to a reasonable
   time period between 1999-2020. At the methodological level, data was
   collected from 22 years of Constitutional Court (TC) sentences. From the
   Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), the accruals of the transferred
   budget. In addition, Pearson's Rho and discriminant analysis for
   clusters were used. The results highlight that the procedural burden
   depends on the actions of amparo, habeas corpus and non-compliance with
   an R2 of 99.93\%. There is a delay in resolving lawsuits, while the
   budget grows. The Rho is 0.245. If the budget grows by 10\%,
   publications would increase by 2.45\%. Remunerations grow 7 times in the
   period and resolutions by 2.36 times. The Rho ratio is 0.33. The
   discriminant analysis proves that, of the three stages, 1999-2002;
   2003-2012; and 2013-2020, in the third stage productivity and celerity
   decrease, while budgets increase. The processed information allows
   concluding that the public management of the (TC) does not show
   procedural celerity in the resolution of the files, in terms of access
   to justice in a reasonable time.},

Abstract = {The year 2022 has been declared by the European Council as `European
   Year of Youth'. Because of this, this article seeks to know which role
   the European youth thinks the European Union could play on their future
   and whether if there are gender differences about it. Likewise, those
   differences are analysed in different social and political activities
   both in the Union as a whole and by different geographical areas. This
   paper shows how men tend to take part in conventional activities while
   women seem to feel more distant about political participation. It also
   unravels the existing gender differences regarding the obstacles to take
   part in any type of action.},

Title = {The Gendered Discourses of Illiberal Demographic Policy in Poland and in
   Russia},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {49-60},
Abstract = {Despite being dissimilar cases, both Poland and Russia exhibit strong
   anti-liberal and democratic backsliding tendencies. Concomitantly,
   politicians are spreading a demographic moral panic, employing the
   argument that both nations are in danger of demise. There is
   scaremongering concerning below-replacement population growth rates and,
   in parallel, a tightening grasp on reproductive health rights and a
   growing fear of non-binary gender identities, people of color, and
   homosexuality. The political anti-gender mobilization in Poland in the
   2010s and the gendered anti-Western and anti-gay conspiracy narratives
   in Russia are examples of this phenomenon. How are the policy responses
   to ``demographic crises{''} constructed and gendered in political
   discourses today? What lies behind it and what is its role in illiberal
   politics? In this article, I discuss the current demographic discourses
   in Poland and in Russia. I argue that the politics of rallying against
   ``demographic crises{''} surfaced on the wave of growing dominance of
   ultraconservative and nationalist discourses in East-Central Europe in
   response to perceived socio-economic pressures. I demonstrate how Polish
   and Russian politicians have been utilizing nativism, familialism, and
   ``tradition{''} discourses for reasons of political legitimacy and
   expediency. Looking at political debates and concrete demographic
   strategies, I trace how the rhetoric of ``democratic crises{''} is
   deployed to shore up illiberalism in both countries.},

Journal = {REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE PENSAMIENTO POLITICO},
Year = {2022},
Number = {17},
Pages = {323-343},
Abstract = {Law, in contemporary societies, presents itself with special
   characteristics that demand -from the market- a new legal professional
   and, consequently, a specific training to cover such needs. Likewise,
   the scientific-technological revolution, also called the Third
   Industrial Revolution, forces us to review the traditional paradigms of
   legal science, now at the mercy of this new reality. The possibilities
   for a new type of governance, the modulations of legitimacy and the
   democratic principle, largely due to the risks of abandoning oneself to
   digital platforms, and the uncontrolled degeneration of discrimination
   fueled by the biased training of algorithms, they force, among other
   compelling reasons, the Philosophy of Law to respond in an indubitable
   manner to the lack of protection of the most basic rights. In all this
   framework, the binding principle of gender mainstreaming, marks, in
   turn, a new way of doing Law, betting on a transforming instrument of a
   subordinate status quo between human beings and the safeguarding of
   their rights.},

Abstract = {New Brunswick's 2020 election was Canada's first election during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. It produced a slim majority government for the
   Progressive Conservatives under Premier Blaine Higgs after all-party
   talks to create a quasi-coalition arrangement failed. The major parties
   continued to decline in voter support, and two newer parties, the Green
   Party and the People's Alliance, still have a presence in the
   Legislative Assembly. The Liberal Party failed to win seats in
   Anglophone New Brunswick, reducing their support to just the francophone
   areas of the province. Higgs is left to govern a province polarized
   along linguistic lines with French-speaking New Brunswickers distrustful
   and unsupportive of the premier.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {320-338},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There has been a lively debate about the economic and cultural-based
   drivers of support for populism. This article argues that economic
   concerns matter, but that they are realized through the relative gains
   and losses of social groups. Using new survey items in a large
   representative survey administered in Britain, it shows that citizens'
   economic assessments of the ethnic minority out-group - in relation to
   the group's situation 12 months ago and to assessments of the economic
   conditions of the white British in-group - are a predictor of support
   for Brexit. The results, which are robust to prior referendum vote,
   immigration attitudes and cultural sentiment, extend across income
   groups and national identity strength. Extending the analysis to a
   comparison of geographic in- and out-groups between local communities
   and London lends additional support to the argument. The implications of
   relative group-based economics are important for understanding Brexit
   and the economic sources of support for populism more broadly.},

   VIOLENCE AGAINST PEOPLE CROSSING THE GREEK-TURKISH LAND BORDER},
Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {12-32},
Abstract = {The Greek-Turkish land border became the site of a border spectacle in
   March 2020, following the ``opening{''} of the border by the Turkish
   government and its simultaneous closure by the Greek government. The
   ensuing violence was legitimated by narratives of exception and racist
   discourses hinging on the notions of ``invasion{''} and ``asymmetrical
   threats.{''} Yet, the spectacular and highly mediatized nature of the
   events of March 2020 hid the embeddedness and longevity of border
   violence in Evros, the area named after the river that constitutes the
   land border between Greece and Turkey.
   Drawing on qualitative research including fieldwork, interviews and
   document analysis, we focus on the practice of pushbacks as an enduring
   feature of the local border regime. We argue that pushbacks and other
   forms of violence should not be conceived merely as human rights
   violations and therefore aberrations to the laws and values of Europe
   and its states, but as normalized technologies of border management
   embedded in the racialized, violent border regimes of liberal states,
   exemplifying the inherent and unavoidable violence of borders.},

Abstract = {The relevance of the article is seen in the fact that it is one of the
   first attempts of systematic scientific research and analysis of the
   current state of cultural heritage objects of Ukraine which were
   destroyed or partially destroyed during the Russian aggression against
   Ukraine, starting from February 24, 2022. There were determined losses,
   caused by the looting of cultural and art institutions by the occupation
   forces, and world practices, the experience of various scenarios of
   reconstruction of cultural objects as well as the measures of European
   partners aimed at preserving and rebuilding the cultural heritage of
   Ukraine were analysed. The research methodology is represented by a set
   of general scientific philosophical methods, including theoretical and
   empirical levels of cognition, special historical methods of scientific
   cognition, principles of historicism, scientificity, systematicity, and
   complexity.},

Abstract = {The way in which public opinion represents a war conflict is never
   neutral and, therefore, is given by the journalistic handling of such a
   problematic situation by the social media, always conditioned by the
   interests of its political agenda, so that the written press is also one
   of the privileged theaters of operations where the war conflict between
   the Russian Federation and Ukraine takes place. The objective of the
   research was to analyze the representations, this is (what is said, when
   it is said and how it is said) that certain Latin American written press
   of wide dissemination makes about the Russian invasion of Ukraine in
   2022. Methodologically, dialectical hermeneutics and critical analysis
   of political discourse were used to describe the scope and meaning of
   the journalistic narrative on this conflict that acquires unpredictable
   consequences for the current world order. It is concluded that the war
   conflict between the aforementioned countries occupies a prominent place
   in the international politics section of the Latin American press. In
   general, support for Ukraine's resistance and Russia's condemnation of
   Russia as dangerous to the security of Europe and the Western world
   prevail in these media.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research is to reveal the relationship between legal
   progress and the fundamental principles of law in the context of their
   implementation at different levels of the legal system. The importance
   of justice, freedom, equality and humanity as an instrument of legal
   progress is shown. It is proved that the fundamental principles of law
   act as the limits of the development of the legal system, and these
   limits ensure the legal and political progress of mankind. The
   methodological basis of the research is presented as comparative-legal
   and systematic analysis, formal-legal method, method of interpretation,
   hermeneutic method, as well as methods of analysis and synthesis. In the
   conclusions the authors state that legal progress depends on the extent
   to which the fundamental principles of law are presented and implemented
   in the actual legal order. The fundamental principles of law converge
   with each other. Thus, it can be said that it is precisely the
   interaction and synergy of principles that strengthens legal progress in
   a given society.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article was to investigate the principles of the
   implementation of diplomatic policy and the problems of the
   Russian-Ukrainian war settlement by applying the method of mediation.
   The work is based on the use of both special methods of political
   research and general scientific methods (analysis, synthesis, induction,
   deduction). With the help of a prognostic method, an attempt was made to
   characterize the short-term results of the introduction of political
   mediation in the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war. The results showed that
   mediation is a special negotiation technology for resolving political
   conflicts. The key tasks of mediation in political conflict resolution
   are neutralization of negative consequences of the confrontation, search
   for dissonance between the parties and development of a strategy for
   further actions, etc. It is concluded that, at this stage of the war,
   political mediation to resolve the problems is possible only due to the
   military failures of the Russian side and the Ukrainian collaborators
   supported by it.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article was to discuss conceptual ideas on the state of
   legal support of the electoral process in Denmark, New Zealand and the
   United States, as well as to identify opportunities to use the positive
   experience of these countries in Ukraine. The article uses such methods
   as dialectical, comparative law, systemstructural, formal-dogmatic,
   modelling and forecasting. It should be noted that, despite the ability
   of EU countries to introduce their own electoral legislation and choose
   the electoral system, the exercise of the right of everyone to vote or
   be elected is ensured by compliance with international standards of
   organization and conduct of elections. It is concluded that the
   countries studied: Denmark, New Zealand and the United States generally
   adhere to the rule of law and the electoral process is well organized.
   It is stated that the due legal support of the electoral process is a
   tool for the formation of legitimate representative bodies of state
   power and local selfgovernment. In addition, it is proposed to implement
   in the Ukrainian electoral legislation the positive experience of some
   countries, as well as to identify possible ways to improve it.},

Abstract = {The object of the research was the disclosure of universal human
   principles of law as a universal normative framework. It has been
   investigated that the term ``principle{''} is used in several meanings:
   1) in the main framework of the original ideas that are characterized by
   universality, of general meaning and higher imperative, and reflect the
   essential provisions of theory, doctrine, science, system of domestic
   and international law for a political, state or public organization; 2)
   in the inner conviction of a person, which determines his attitude to
   reality, ideas and social activities. The methodological basis of the
   research is presented as comparative-legal and systematic analysis,
   formal-legal method, method of interpretation, hermeneutic method, as
   well as methods of analysis and synthesis. By way of conclusion, it has
   been investigated that universal human principles of law are based on
   such diverse rights (principles of their concentrated development) as:
   humanism, all of which are used on the grounds of the dignity of the
   person and his fundamental rights and freedoms.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {528-550},
Abstract = {Immanuel Kant's political philosophy has enjoyed renewed attention as an
   egalitarian alternative to contemporary inequality since it seems to
   uncompromisingly reassert the primacy of the state over the economy,
   enabling it to defend the modern welfare state against encroaching
   neoliberal markets. However, I argue that, when understood as a
   free-standing approach to politics, Kant's doctrine of right shares
   essential features with the prevailing theories that legitimate really
   existing economic inequality. Like Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman,
   Kant understands the state's function as essentially coercive and, in
   justifying state coercion, he adopts a narrow conception of political
   freedom that formally preserves the right to choose while denying that
   the range of choices one actually has can be a matter of justice. As a
   result, Kant cannot identify various forms of social pressure as
   potential injustices even as he recognizes their power to create and
   sustain troubling inequalities. For both Kant and the neoliberals, the
   result is that economic relations almost never count as unjust forms of
   coercion, no matter how unequal they are. Views that identify coercion
   as the trigger for duties of justice are thus particularly ill-suited to
   orient us to contemporary inequality.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {75},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Recruitment to key positions in institutions can be viewed as one way to
   introduce strategic reforms; however, little research has been conducted
   as to the effectiveness of the practice within parliaments. Even less
   has been written about the recruitment practices for non-elected
   parliamentary actors. Applying a feminist discursive institutionalist
   analysis, this article highlights the main discourses prominent in
   discussions around the recruitment to the Clerk of the House of Commons
   in 2014. It is argued that there are three discourses that rhetorically
   de-gendered career structures in the UK House of Commons, while two
   discourses explicitly gendered the applicant to the position of Clerk.
   The article discusses the broader significance of these insights for
   analysing parliaments as gendered workplaces, and for member engagement
   with parliamentary administrations.},

Abstract = {In the scientific article, based on the analysis of scientific sources,
   the provisions of the current legislation and the practice of its
   application, with the help of general scientific and special methods of
   knowledge, the essence of property rights is revealed, and their
   characterization is carried out. It has been proven that the conceptual
   principles and provisions of the legislation, which should be relied
   upon when solving issues related to property rights, along with the
   norms of private and public law, are also contained in the provisions of
   international humanitarian law, which regulates the relevant legal
   relations in conditions of war. Attention is focused on the fact that in
   the event of a military conflict, the state is obliged to introduce
   appropriate legal mechanisms for compensation of the value of property,
   housing, land, in case of failure to ensure the possibility of returning
   to it or its destruction. It was concluded that it is necessary to
   develop and introduce a comprehensive law that will take into account
   all aspects of legal relations regarding ownership, use and disposal of
   property by individuals and legal entities.},

   Colombian Civil War},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {This article proposes a new concept of territorial dispute in civil wars
   to ask what makes a place more likely to be contested. It also
   investigates the territorial dispute causes of the Colombian armed
   conflict. I suggest that there is a correlation between land inequality
   and state capacity, and the process of inequality production and its
   resulting state capacity provide the motives, incentives, and
   opportunities for territorial dispute. I test my theory with a database
   composed of 200 Colombian municipalities over a five-year period. My
   results suggest that land inequality leads to greater state capacity,
   and intermediate state capacity correlates with territorial disputes.
   The findings confirm the existence of a nexus between land inequality
   and conflict in Colombia through state capacity. This has implications
   for the strategy of expanding state presence during the post-conflict
   period.},

Abstract = {The internal unity of party organizations is an important aspect that
   impacts not only their dynamics but also their credibility in the eyes
   of the electorate. One commonly-used strategy for measuring this unity
   is to analyze the degree of intra-party agreement on policy issues.
   Despite this importance, there is a lack of up-to-date understanding of
   the internal unity of political parties in Latin America and of its
   determinants. In this article, we analyze the degree of agreement in the
   views of legislators' ideological self-placement over the course of the
   last thirty years. Evidence suggests that this level of agreement is
   greater amongst members of left-wing parties than amongst their
   right-wing rivals. As has also been shown in Europe, in Latin America,
   the emphasis of these parties on ideology is a major influence on their
   dynamics, and the effects of this include more similar ideological
   identities between their members.},

   Diplomacy as Frontier},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},

Abstract = {Science diplomacy (SD) is consolidated as an eclectic and frontier
   proposal between science, technology, and innovation (STI), on the one
   hand, and International Relations and foreign policy, on the other. How
   is public policy on science and technology in Colombia articulated with
   public policy on technology and International Relations through
   scientific diplomacy? This article identifies the SD actions that
   Colombia implemented between 2018-2022, based on an exploratory and
   qualitative-descriptive analysis of public policy documents from that
   period. We conclude that important and accelerated steps have been
   taken, but challenges persist in terms of the articulation and
   consolidation of sd as an effective strategy that facilitates the
   achievement of objectives for both the sti sector and International
   Relations. We sketch the conceptual foundations that can aid in
   understanding sd in a situated manner, introduce some of its criticisms,
   and place the Colombian experience in comparative perspective with
   relation to those of Brazil, Mexico, and Chile.},

Title = {The Role of Gender in Parliamentary Attacks and Incivility},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {286-298},
Abstract = {It has been well established that politicians attack their competitors
   to reach their political goals. As such, there is a con-siderable amount
   of literature on their attack behaviour. However, this literature almost
   exclusively investigates attack behaviour during campaigns, and so far,
   few studies have addressed the nature of attacks during more routine
   times in parliaments. This article aims to fill this gap by examining
   in-parliament attack behaviour and, more specifically, the gender
   characteristics of attacks. It is theorised that women are less likely
   to attack and be attacked than men due to the stereo-typical gender
   roles. However, it is anticipated that this compliance to stereotypes
   diminishes as proximity to elections increases, resulting in women
   engaging in attacks as much as men. To limit the cost of their
   divergence, attacks employed by and toward women are expected to be more
   civil. Lastly, this study argues that adherence to gender stereotypes is
   stronger in countries with candidate-centred parliamentary systems than
   party-centred ones. This study finds support for the theoretical
   framework using longitudinal data on individual attacks in the
   parliaments of Belgium, Croatia, and the UK. Results confirm that
   politicians adhere to gender stereotypical roles in parliaments, with
   women attacking and being tar-geted less than men, and when women do
   attack or are targeted, less incivility is employed. Proximity to
   elections makes both women and men more hostile, but women lower the
   cost of their increasing attack behaviour by using less incivility,
   unlike men who increasingly opt for uncivil attacks closer to elections.
   Additionally, these findings strongly apply in the candidate-centred
   system of the UK, whereas in the party-centred system of Belgium and
   Croatia, hardly any support for the theory can be found.},

Abstract = {The Swedish model which makes the purchase of prostitution illegal but
   not its sale was approved in the government in 2009. Neither the
   circumstances of people in prostitution, nor what resources need to be
   in place should they want to get out of prostitution have been mapped
   out since the law was passed. This study is meant to fill this knowledge
   gap and its focus is on exit options for people with prostitution
   experiences. Fourteen interviews with women with prostitution
   experiences were carried out and an interview with a spokesperson from
   the Red umbrella, an organization focused on supporting sex workers.
   Main results are that the women experienced lack of resources before
   enter-ing prostitution, they do not feel heard or understood
   communicating with the police, health care and other professionals, and
   they refrain from seeking their assistance. They wish for diverse
   resources for those who want to exit prosti-tution, a stricter penal
   code for buyers of prostitution, and that knowledge of prostitution and
   its consequences will be increased in society.},

Abstract = {What is the effect of violence on political mobilization? Taking the
   repression-mobilization nexus debate as a starting point, we study the
   effects of police interventions on political participation, focusing on
   the Spanish police crackdown on Catalonia's independence referendum on 1
   October 2017. We analyze the effect of police actions on turnout using
   detailed aggregate data, as well as a survey conducted a few days after
   the referendum. The two empirical approaches show that police
   interventions had both deterrent and inverse spatial spillover effects.
   Although police raids had a local negative impact on turnout, they
   induced positive spillover effects in the surrounding areas. Our
   findings also indicate heterogeneity in the spatial dynamics, with
   police actions encouraging people to go to vote in nearby areas, but
   also mobilizing residents in neighboring areas to participate,
   especially those individuals with fewer incentives to turn out to vote.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},

Abstract = {This article analyses the literary genre of historical-political
   commentary typical of Renaissance political literature, emphasising the
   importance of its essentially Florentine origins. Indeed, the birth and
   spread of Tacitism (a specific format of political argumentation, not to
   be confused with the generic ``fortune of Tacitus{''} in late
   Renaissance and Baroque literature) are difficult to explain without
   contextualising them in a decisive period of Florence's history, namely
   the transition from the Republic to the Grand Duchy. The
   ``fragmented{''} form of these political treatises-which depends, in
   essence, on Machiavelli's Discorsi- makes them particularly suitable for
   reflections related to sudden social and political crises. The case of
   the famine at the end of the 16th century that is the subject of the
   reflections of two of the most important authors of the ``Tacitist{''}
   canon, such as Scipione Ammirato and Virgilio Malvezzi, shows clearly
   how this textual typology was very effective in that sense.},

Abstract = {This research explores how international migration helps migrants to
   obtain economic resources, save and productive invest, as well as the
   acquisition of labor knowledge and personal experiences that migrants
   brought with them. It is a qualitative perspective, based on the
   testimonies provided by migrants interviewed in two rural locations
   (forest, agricultural), in the municipality of Ocuilan, in the South of
   the Estado de Mexico. The results show that, four in five interviewees
   had material improvements (house, furniture, cars, basic sustenance),
   and that more than half managed to invest remittances in activities
   related to the local productive vocation. Although they generate income
   and self-employment, in the end, less than one in every five migrants,
   they are the ones who live stable upon return and are sustained by the
   resources they obtained from international migration},

Journal = {ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {This paper analyses the relationship between demand-driven clientelism,
   economic disparities, and public expenditures at the county level in
   Romania. Using several economic and social indicators we realize an
   in-depth analysis of economic development disparities in Romania
   concerning the clientelistic incidence of the Romanian parties. The
   latter was based on an extensive original survey developed in the first
   quarter of 2021 regarding clientelism perception among 42 counties of
   Romania for both national (parliamentary) and local elections,
   addressing both positive and negative clientelism approaches. Thus, we
   tested if, in Romania, greater economic constraints increase the
   individuals' propensity to engage in a clientelistic relationship with
   political parties or candidates and the correlation of local public
   expenditures (social protection and personnel local expenditures) with
   the incidence of clientelism.},

Abstract = {The question of having competent lawyers and judges is becoming
   increasingly important in the twenty-first century and is also
   attracting the attention of specialists from large law firms; students
   of educational institutions (lawyers, administrative staff); politicians
   and economic experts. Consequently, through the documentary method, this
   research work analyzes the problem of training highly qualified legal
   personnel, elaborating priority tasks and various development
   strategies. The authors examine the current situation in this area in
   European countries, emphasizing their experience. The article is
   addressed to experts in the field, such as specialists working in law
   firms (lawyers and staff), students of higher education institutions
   (lawyers, administrative staff), political scientists, economists, civil
   servants. It is concluded that competency-based education using
   cutting-edge technologies improves the educational system of Ukraine
   and, at the same time, adapts it to the standards of Western Europe with
   a gradual result of production of highly qualified lawyers.},

Abstract = {In a time deeply marked by the experience of the Covid-19 pandemic,
   uncertainty appears as a dominant cognitive and emotional condition,
   both as a result of epis-temic failures in understanding phenomena, and
   of their existential reverberations on interpersonal relationships and
   on the prospects of economic and social well-being. In order to
   understand the roots of this condition and to advance visions capable of
   orienting new political and social assets, it seems appropriate to trace
   the connections that the sociological and philosophical literature of
   recent decades has highlighted between the pervasive uncertainty of life
   and the neoliberal economic and political order, and between the latter
   and the widespread experience of social vulnerability. The Covid crisis
   was particularly revealing in this regard, having amplified, along with
   the vulnerability of bodies, a whole range of human essential needs that
   require people and structures capable of ``care `` in order to be
   satisfied, and exposed the ``crisis of care `` of neoliberal societies.
   In this framework, the feminist philosophy of care offers a theoretical
   perspective capable of challenging the idea of the individuals'
   self-sufficiency, opening up the possibility of a radical critique of
   the social ontology underlying neoliberalism, as well as a normative
   reflection on the forms in which democratic can to},

   research made it possible to analyze the regulatory policy and establish
   the rationale for the institutional transformation of the banking sector
   in the conditions of digitalization in order to increase the efficiency
   of its activities and competitiveness, which means: putting the banking
   system on track to merge with the global financial system;
   transformation of the functioning of the National Bank of Ukraine in the
   direction of creating economically adaptable functions and, at the same
   time, implementing behavioral mechanisms of influence on banking
   institutions; implementation of methods of preventive rehabilitation of

Abstract = {Using an analytical methodology, the article examines the connection
   between social conflicts and national security. The discursive space of
   the problems of social conflict has been systematized and the reasons
   that influence the dynamics and duration of social conflict have been
   determined. Complex systems of social conflict prevention are presented
   and a model of influence of social conflicts on the national security
   system of the state is developed. The driving forces of social conflicts
   and national security indicators are also grouped together. The sequence
   of conceptualization of the results of the institutionalization of the
   public management of social conflicts has been announced. The
   methodology and levels of assessment of the willingness of the
   authorities of public management of social conflicts for interaction are
   indicated. It is concluded that, since there is currently no single
   criterion for assessing the impact of the interaction of public
   management institutions on the prevention of social conflicts in the
   context of national security, the study of the capacity for such
   interaction should be carried out considering conditions of complexity,
   systemic and convergence.},

Abstract = {The paper proposes a contextualized approach to local government
   transparency and its determinants. It starts by briefly discussing the
   distinction between local government compliance with transparency
   regulations and broader/more substantial local government transparency.
   A context-dependent measure of local government compliance with
   transparency regulation is built for the Romanian case and used to
   showcase significant variation from one local government to the next.
   Next, the paper approaches a set of inter-related questions concerning
   the predictors of compliance: Which previously identified predictors of
   compliance are also relevant in the Romanian context? Does external
   pressure exercised by the central government and/or civil society
   increase compliance with transparency provisions? In a strong leader
   local government system, how strong is the influence of the
   characteristics of the political leader in explaining compliance? The
   analysis finds that Romania has a distinct profile in terms of
   explanatory factors of local government compliance with transparency
   regulations. Characteristics of the local political and institutional
   environment such as the status, size, and financial autonomy of local
   governments are found to be relevant for understanding compliance in
   Romania. The paper also provides some points for practitioners.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Pages = {7-22},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of the most promising and popular
   strategies for the development of modern political science and the
   theory of international relations. In conditions of strategic
   instability, effective institutions of both national and global
   governance, designed to establish norms of collective action, are in
   demand. However, many of them, need to improve their efficiency. The
   author argues that the UN remains an key institution for international
   law, providing representativeness, regulation, and carrying out a
   political mission and a functional role. New structures are being
   created along with traditional international organizations, and rising
   powers are gaining influence. Contrary to popular belief, the rise of
   international institutions is not associated with a reduction in the
   role of the nation-state. The author believes that the idea that the
   threat is primarily posed by the so-called excessively `rigid' states is
   flawed: at present, a kind of `conceptual rehabilitation' of the
   effective states with a stable central government is overdue. In the
   context of global turbulence, the greatest danger is not `tough', strong
   states, but `weak' and `fragile' - insolvent ones. The consideration of
   the regional dimension of modern political processes in the article
   reveals some evidence of the erosion of the vector of globalization
   during the massively increasing regionalization in its various
   manifestations, including macro-regionalization and glocalization.
   Within the study of methodological perspectives of regionalism, regional
   diversity and regional cooperation, both qualitative methods and
   quantitative strategies are used. Political governance and international
   relations, which represent a separate challenge and at the same time a
   new horizon of opportunities for political science, are the processes of
   comprehensive digitalization, including the use of big data (Big Data),
   artificial intelligence (AI) and other new technologies in political
   analytics. Big Data, artificial intelligence and other new technologies
   in political analytics is a new challenge and at the same time a popular
   prospect for political science and IR theories. This contributes to
   Russia's efforts to form a digital sovereignty-related agenda in this
   area. In order to stimulate interdisciplinary synthesis and empirical
   processing of large amounts of data on the subject areas of political
   science and international relations in Russia, it is necessary to form
   an integral scientific infrastructure, which MGIMO participates in
   developing with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. Strengthening
   the value sovereignty of the Russian Federation in the face of external
   danger involves improving its axiological framework, within which it is
   difficult to overestimate the role of historical consciousness: it is
   historical experience that forms the coordinate system for assessing
   current events and justifying a reliable forecast of long-term
   development. The natural driver of this process is universities, which,
   in cooperation with local and regional communities, form vectors of
   socio-cultural activity and responsibility.},

Title = {The Effect of Renewable Energy on Energy Import Dependence: An Empirical
   Analysis in Turkey},
Journal = {SIYASAL-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCES},

Volume = {31},

Pages = {443-462},
Abstract = {Energy import dependency has remained one of the most important problems
   of countries that cannot meet their energy needs from domestic sources
   from past to present. Countries with insufficient resources in terms of
   fossil energy sources have met their energy demand through imports. This
   situation has caused countries to become dependent on external
   resources. For this reason, Turkey's energy import dependency has
   increased continuously; according to the data published by EUROSTAT as
   of 2018, Turkey is foreign-dependent with approximately 74\%. This
   situation has brought the issue of energy supply security to the agenda
   in Turkey.For this reason, it is important to examine Turkey's energy
   import dependency and to propose solutions according to the results
   obtained. In this study, the effect of renewable energy sources on
   energy import dependency in Turkey during 1990-2018 was analyzed using
   the ARDL bounds test approach. The working results have determined that
   renewable electricity production, GDP per capita, urban population
   growth, and world natural gas prices have a statistically significant
   effect on energy import dependency. World oil prices were not
   statistically significant. As a result, renewable energy production
   reduces energy import dependency, while the most important determinant
   is GDP per capita.},

Abstract = {Reality, documentary, and fiction merge in Ukrainian cinema in a unique
   way. Directors, actors, and cinematographers come from the war, make
   films about the war, and go to the front lines again to defend their
   country. Filmmaking is participation and a gesture of self-empowerment.
   The films about war from 2014-2022 make visible physical and
   psychological injury, personal loss, and social tragedy in a broad
   spectrum of forms. They oscillate between the dream of peace, freedom,
   and independence, on the one hand, and the traumatization caused by
   violence, torture, rape, and death, on the other.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to study why politicians in the same elected
   assembly perceive political polarization differently, as well as whether
   and how this influences perceptions of their behaviour. The findings
   reveals that there is a relationship between local politicians'
   perceptions of polarization and winner-loser partisanship and trust. The
   results show that politicians who have higher levels of trust perceive a
   lower level of antagonistic behaviour. Being a political winner (in a
   ruling party coalition) or loser (in opposition) fosters a specific form
   of partisanship, which affects politicians' perceptions. Politicians who
   are winners tend to perceive lower levels of polarization and
   antagonistic behaviour. More insight into how and why political actors
   perceive the same situation differently could potentially foster a
   greater understanding - a political empathy - among political
   combatants, facilitating interaction. The study is based on data from a
   survey conducted among all councillors in the 290 municipalities in
   Sweden.},

   power over leader selection in political parties. To this end, we apply
   an analytical framework in which the selection process is divided into
   three phases: gatekeeping, preparation and decision. The focus is on
   determining the extent to which each of these phases is influential for
   the outcome and thereby locating the distribution of intra-party power.
   Underpinning the analysis is the conviction that the comparison of
   leader selection is too limited if it relies solely on information about
   formal procedures, including the composition of the selectorate. We
   should also take the preselection phase of leader selection into
   account. Empirically, we examine a sample of recent selection processes
   in European parliamentary democracies. In contrast to previous research
   on intra-party politics, which has suggested an ascendancy of the party
   in public office, our results suggest an enduring strength of the party
   on the ground and the party in the central office.},

Abstract = {Can those dominated and oppressed by racialized power structures be held
   responsible for their actions? On some plausible accounts of moral
   responsibility, the answer is ``no{''}: domination exempts the oppressed
   from moral obligations because they are structurally deprived of the
   freedom to make choices for which one might be blameworthy. In this
   article, I use the work of Frederick Douglass to offer a different
   understanding of moral responsibility. Attending to specific arguments
   that Douglass makes regarding the moral responsibility of slaves, and
   the tensions it raises with other parts of his corpus, I argue that
   one's ability to act as a moral agent is deeply tied to the
   environmental resources at their disposal. Drawing on distributed
   theories of cognition, I offer a Douglassonian conception of
   ``distributed moral agency,{''} contending that Douglass's writings draw
   our attention to various environmental factors that can scaffold moral
   responsibility, even among the enslaved.},

Abstract = {The role of domestic public opinion is an important topic in research on
   international negotiations, yet we know little about how exactly it
   manifests itself. We focus on government rhetoric during negotiations
   and develop a conceptual distinction between implicit and explicit
   manifestations of public opinion. Drawing on a database of video
   recordings of negotiations of the Council of the European Union and a
   quantitative text analysis of government speeches, we find that public
   opinion matters implicitly, with the exact pattern depending on
   governments' stance toward the EU. Pro-EU governments are responsive to
   public opinion in their support for compromises and attempts to stall
   negotiations, whereas Euroskeptic governments tend to remain silent when
   confronted with a public positively disposed toward the EU. Our results
   show that although governments implicitly represent public opinion, they
   do not systematically invoke their voters explicitly, suggesting the
   public matters but in different ways than often assumed.},

Abstract = {Though presidents often criticize organized interests, presidents also
   expend considerable effort engaging them. Using original elite
   interviews, a survey of lobbyists, and administrative data, I consider
   how this engagement manifests, why presidents engage interests, and with
   which interests presidents engage. Unlike in other institutions,
   presidents exercise substantial control over engagement with interests,
   and they engage to mobilize interests' institutional resources in
   service of their goals. To optimize mobilization, presidents focus
   engagement on well-resourced interests and interests who share
   presidents' preferences. Pairing over seven million White House visitor
   log entries from two administrations with lobbying and campaign finance
   records, I demonstrate that presidential engagement is informed by
   interests' electoral and policy resources and partisan alignment, though
   these characteristics' substantive effects are modest. My findings
   highlight coalition building with interests as an underappreciated
   source of presidential power and elucidate the degree to which
   presidents amplify the political voice of well-resourced and copartisan
   interests.},

Abstract = {A burgeoning literature documents the emergence of a new globalization
   cleavage in Western Europe, centered around the issues of immigration
   and European integration. We investigate to what extent the
   globalization cleavage has crystallized by studying the alignment of
   preferences regarding open borders, their connection to more fundamental
   elements in the normative component of cosmopolitanism and
   communitarianism, and the extent to which this links up to the
   organizational component through party choice. To do this, we use
   innovative items tapping into political priorities, values,
   understandings of democracy, and virtues in a cross-sectional
   comparative survey in Norway and the UK. We find that the globalization
   cleavage is significantly more developed in the UK than in Norway but
   lacks a solidified normative component in both. This implies that
   considerable opportunities remain for ideological entrepreneurs to
   either fortify or dilute this cleavage, even in the UK.},

Abstract = {Most Americans believe that politicians do not try to keep their
   campaign promises. This deep level of cynicism threatens to break a
   fundamental link in representation and undermines the legislative
   process. If candidates cannot credibly convey their positions, then
   voters will not trust them to enact policies. Yet, we know little about
   the strategies politicians might take to convey the sincerity of their
   claims. We argue that politicians can signal sincerity by justifying
   their stances in moral terms or by taking more extreme positions. Across
   three experiments, our results suggest that moral justifications tend to
   enhance perceived sincerity, while extreme positions do not. In a fourth
   study, we show that extreme stances increase polarization in candidate
   evaluations, but moral justifications do not. Taken together, our
   findings suggest that moral justifications are a useful strategy to
   reduce cynicism without contributing to rising levels of polarization.},

Abstract = {How do members of Congress build public support for legislation? Many
   argue it is through the framing of the legislative process or carefully
   curated explanations that appeal to their constituents' preferences.
   Some suggest the key to members of Congress building public support for
   legislation is appealing to bipartisanship-signaling to the public that
   legislation was crafted through compromise and is liked by members on
   both sides of the aisle. Given the hyper-partisan era that presently
   exists, however, these bipartisan appeals are unlikely to occur in a
   vacuum. The minority party has incentives to engage in counter framing
   to undermine support for legislation. We demonstrate that the benefits
   awarded to members by engaging in bipartisan appeals are overstated. By
   engaging in counter messaging, members in the minority party can
   undermine the legislative accomplishments of their opponents, as well as
   approval for the legislature. Minority-party members, however, must be
   careful in how they counter message: partisan, rather than non-partisan,
   messages actually increase support for the legislature's majority party
   while decreasing support for the minority party.},

Abstract = {The American criminal legal system is an important site of political
   socialization: scholars have shown that criminal legal contact reduces
   turnout and that criminalization pushes people away from public
   institutions more broadly. Despite this burgeoning literature, few
   analyses directly investigate the causal effect of lower-level police
   contact on voter turnout. To do so, we leverage individual-level
   administrative ticketing data from Hillsborough County, Florida. We show
   that traffic stops materially decrease participation for Black and
   non-Black residents alike, and we also find temporal variation in the
   effect for Black voters. Although stops reduce turnout more for Black
   voters in the short term, they are less demobilizing over a longer time
   horizon. Although even low-level contacts with the police can reduce
   political participation across the board, our results point to a unique
   process of political socialization vis-a-vis the carceral state for
   Black Americans.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is the analysis of the 2022 elections in
   Colombia and is focused on the level of pluralism and the degree of
   renewal and stability of the members of parliament. The methodology
   included two central aspects. On the one hand, conceptual and
   theoretical clarification (pluralism and continuity/stability). On the
   other hand, the dimensions of the analysis: for pluralism, the parties
   were differentiated according to their identification as left or right
   and between traditional and alternative parties; the presence of ethnic
   and religious minorities; the gender of the parliamentarians and their
   condition of insider or outsider and for the measurement of the
   renewal-stability of the congressmen, continuity was taken into account
   and they were grouped according to the number of periods of permanence
   in their seats in the two decades of the period 2002-2022. The electoral
   information was obtained from official sources (National Registry of
   Civil Status), in addition to secondary bibliography and journalistic
   information for complementary data. The two main results indicate that
   the elected Congress has a high degree of pluralism and that there are
   high levels of renewal in both chambers.},

Abstract = {This paper surveys the post-1989 Europe/Balkan conjuncture from the
   perspective of communication studies. I employ David Morley's
   materialist defi-nition of communication, encompassing exchange/movement
   of information/ ideas, goods, and people. Observing the exchange of
   ideas, we find EU's Eu-roscepticism contrasting the Balkans' Europhilia.
   Considering the movement of people, the brain-drain from the Balkans is
   paralleled by incoming migra-tions and a questioning of whether leaving
   the region is necessarily advantageous. The movement of goods, finally,
   elucidates the ascendancy of Chinese investment in the region,
   confronting Europe with being seen as a periphery of Asia. The
   materialist communication approach thus reveals unanticipated dynamism
   (a working-through of inherited inequality), rather than one-way
   perpetuation of old centre-periphery prejudice. Though historically
   modelled as Europe's traumatized inner Other where nationalism was
   imposed, the Bal-kans still have much to narrate about impurity of
   identities and uncertainty as Europe's new/old possible cultural
   heritage.},

Abstract = {Although comparatively rare, political resignations are essential for
   the health of democracy and political institutions. Protagonists risk
   their political careers when resigning but can hold governments to
   account and make real the Nolan principles of public life. In July 2022,
   an unprecedented 62 resignations ended Boris Johnson's time as British
   prime minister to be replaced first by Liz Truss and then, 44 days
   later, by Rishi Sunak, the second minister to resign. An inductive,
   qualitative, content analysis of the resignation letters elucidates the
   reasons for the resignations and highlights the ethical dilemmas that
   confronted would be resignees. Events lessened the effectiveness of
   government, triggered fears for the electoral prospects of the
   Conservative Party and separately challenged individuals' personal
   integrity. Considerations that prevented resignees acting
   earlier-promises that things would change, competing loyalties, fear of
   reprisal, love of job, attachment to status and allegiance to
   ideological faction-may partially explain why much of government
   remained in post in July.},

Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {The rise of the knowledge economy has led to a bifurcation between
   prosperous, often urban, areas and ``left-behind{''} regions. While the
   literature has started to analyse the political implications of these
   developments for electoral behaviour and socio-cultural attitudes, the
   structuring of social policy preferences by place remains unclear.
   Distinguishing between an economic (booming-declining) and a geographic
   (urban-rural) dimension, I argue that differences in material
   self-interest and ideological predispositions explain spatial divides in
   support for different types of social policies. Combining original
   survey data on voters' preferences with municipal-level data in Germany,
   I show that general support for social policy is higher in declining
   than in booming regions. However, social investments (e.g., active
   labour market policies) are preferred over consumption policies (e.g.,
   unemployment benefits) in booming and, to a smaller degree, in urban
   than in declining and rural regions. These findings contribute to a
   bigger discussion on compensating ``left-behind{''} regions.},

Abstract = {Sociological explanations for interelectoral vote shifting to the
   Alternative for Germany party (AfD), which for the first time gained
   seats in the German Bundestag in 2017, have been scarce so far. In this
   study, we investigated what roles, if any, changing attitudes towards
   migration and economic situation as well as socioeconomic circumstances
   played for interelection shifting of Christian Democratic
   Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and Social Democratic Party (SPD)
   voters towards the AfD. For our two-wave logistic regression analyses
   spanning the years 2013 to 2017, we used data from the German
   Socio-Economic Panel. Probabilities of switching to the AfD from both
   coalition parties were significantly increased when employed voters of
   the coalition parties felt concerned about immigration to Germany and
   when these concerns strengthened between both measurements. Furthermore,
   a low net equivalent income in 2013 predicted vote switching to the AfD
   in 2017 among CDU/CSU voters but not among SPD voters. Party
   identification with the SPD significantly decreased the probability of
   switching to the AfD in 2017. Future studies should be based on broader
   voter samples and take into consideration more than two waves and more
   refined change measures in order to explain the rise of the AfD during
   recent elections in Germany.},

Abstract = {While the subject of populism receives increasing scholarly attention
   from both political scientists and criminologists, so far these two
   bodies of literature have existed mostly in isolation of each other.
   This paper aims to connect them by investigating whether parties that
   political scientists describe as populist are likely to evince positions
   on criminal justice that criminologists describe as populist. Relying on
   a secondary data analysis comparing mainstream right-wing and populist
   right-wing parties for 131 elections in 24 countries since 1973, this
   paper concludes that the populist right on average expresses slightly
   more support for penal populism than the mainstream right, but that its
   positioning is crucially shaped by considerations relating to issues of
   immigration and multiculturalism. These findings suggest that most
   contemporary populist parties on the right primarily pursue a nativist
   agenda and will only invoke penal populism when it fits this overall
   strategy.},

Abstract = {We test somewhat counter-intuitive the expectation that support for
   populist radical right (PRR) parties at the national level is associated
   with public support for ethno-traditional cues-a frequent feature in PRR
   imagery and nativist discourse-abroad. We do so by leveraging a
   large-scale comparative dataset that covers voting patterns during the
   Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) between 1999 and 2019. Looking at voting
   patterns for more than 30,000 country dyads (i.e., ESC points given by
   country A to country B in a given contest), we show that countries with
   stronger national support for PRR parties tend to vote more clearly for
   songs showcasing ethno-traditional cues (ethnic imagery and, in
   particular, the use of non-English national languages), even when
   accounting for cultural and regional ties and song characteristics.
   These results provide novel insights into the relationship between
   nativism, radical right populism, and perceptions of foreign
   ethno-traditionalism.},

Abstract = {Tackling an important gap in the literature on political trust, this
   article focuses on politicians and the relevance of their other-to-self
   trust judgements for decision-making in public office. A unique
   quantitative dataset gathered from national politicians in the UK,
   Canada and South Africa is used to (1) examine descriptive levels of
   felt trust and distrust among politicians and (2) evaluate the impact of
   these feelings on politicians' risky decision-making. To achieve outcome
   (2), this article presents the results of three survey experiments in
   which politicians were asked to make decisions in scenarios where both
   the presentation and the nature of risk varied. The results indicate
   that MPs' perceptions of public trust and distrust do matter for risky
   decision-making, and that these variables moderate a reflection effect
   whereby MPs are otherwise more risk-averse in the face of gains and
   risk-taking in the face of losses.},

Title = {Is disloyalty rewarded? The electoral consequences of bloc changes of
   Scandinavian Centre Parties 1977-2019},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {548-575},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Centre Parties (Agrarians, Christian Democrats and Liberals) used to be
   an established part of the Scandinavian party systems and have often
   been pivotal for government formation. With ongoing individualisation,
   secularisation, decline of traditional cleavages, and the rise of new
   ones such as immigration, as well as polarisation, these parties face
   the challenge of losing representation in parliament as already happened
   to the Danish Centre Democrats and Christian Democrats. To shift a
   party's bloc affiliation and coalition preferences is a feature of
   centre parties, and it may itself be a strategic decision to mobilise
   new voters in a changed political environment to survive. Yet, it may
   alienate voters. While the strategic decision to change bloc is common
   among Scandinavian centre parties and theoretically relevant, empirical
   investigations of the electoral effects of bloc changes have been dim.
   We provide a systematic analysis of the electoral effects of bloc
   changes in Scandinavia in the last four decades. We collected data on
   bloc changes of Scandinavian centre parties and found 24 between 1977
   and 2021. Our panel regressions reveal that bloc changes are indeed
   electorally costly as centre parties on average lose around 2\% after a
   bloc change. Frequent bloc changes in the past do also reduce a party's
   average electoral performance. The electoral punishment of a bloc
   change, however, is cushioned by a large membership base as centre
   parties evade significant losses if they have a strong anchor in the
   electorate.},

Abstract = {Valid inference in an observational study requires a correct control
   specification, but a correct specification is never known. I introduce a
   method that constructs a control vector from the observed data that,
   when included in a linear regression, adjusts for several forms of bias.
   These include nonlinearities and interactions in the background
   covariates, biases induced by heterogeneous treatment effects, and
   specific forms of interference. The first is new to political science;
   the latter two are original contributions. I incorporate random effects,
   a set of diagnostics, and robust standard errors. With additional
   assumptions, the estimates allow for causal inference on both binary and
   continuous treatment variables. In total, the model provides a flexible
   means to adjust for biases commonly encountered in our data, makes
   minimal assumptions, returns efficient estimates, and can be implemented
   through publicly available software.},

Abstract = {Most global population growth over the next two decades is projected to
   occur in small- and medium-sized cities in low- and middle-income
   countries. Expectations derived from the literature on fiscal federalism
   suggest that this is a cause for concern, as larger cities are thought
   to deliver public goods more effectively than smaller ones owing to
   economics of scale. Drawing on detailed cross-sectional data from Brazil
   and Indonesia, we show that smaller municipalities tend to possess more
   basic public health clinics and schools per capita, scattered throughout
   their territory, than larger cities. We theorize that the greater
   prevalence of such facilities in small cities reflects a relative lack
   of non-state alternatives, fewer concerns regarding ``urban{''} problems
   faced in larger cities, and politicians' greater ability to secure and
   claim credit for such facilities. We illustrate the logic of this
   argument in case studies of otherwise-similar cities of different sizes
   in Brazil, and with shadow cases from Indonesia. Our analysis
   underscores how jurisdiction size and non-state service provision can
   affect government services.},

Abstract = {The insurrection at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, was
   the most dramatic contemporary manifestation of deep political
   polarization in the United States. Recent research shows that violent
   protests shape political behavior and attachments, but several questions
   remain unanswered. Using day-level panel data from a large sample of US
   social media users to track changes in the identities expressed in their
   Twitter biographies, we show that the Capitol insurrection caused a
   large-scale decrease in outward expressions of identification with the
   Republican Party and Donald Trump, with no indication of
   reidentification in the weeks that followed. This finding suggests that
   there are limits to party loyalty: a violent attack on democratic
   institutions sets boundaries on partisanship, even among avowed
   partisans. Furthermore, the finding that political violence can deflect
   copartisans carries the potential positive democratic implication that
   those who encourage or associate themselves with such violence pay a
   political cost.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to answer the question how congruent the policy
   positions of the four main Europarties were compared with their
   respective national member parties, as well as how they influenced each
   other in the drafting process, using the comparative example of German
   parties in the EU election 2019. It finds that the programmatic
   congruence of Euro- and their German member parties is small, with only
   insignificant coherences in issue salience and policy prioritization. In
   fact, some parties are even revealed to have higher programmatic
   congruence with other German parties than with their own Europarty.
   Nevertheless, cases of up- and downloading of policy positions as well
   as general political reconciliation processes are reported for all
   parties.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Abstract = {From the onset of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in January 2020
   to Election Day in November, the United States experienced over
   9,400,000 cases and 232,000 deaths. This crisis largely defined the
   campaign between former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald
   Trump, centering on the Trump administration ` s efforts in mitigating
   the number of cases and deaths. While conventional wisdom suggested that
   Trump and his party would lose support due to the severity of COVID-19
   across the country, such an effect is hotly debated empirically and
   theoretically. In this research, we evaluate the extent to which the
   severity of the COVID-19 pandemic influenced support for President Trump
   in the 2020 election. Across differing modeling strategies and a variety
   of data sources, we find evidence that President Trump gained support in
   counties with higher COVID-19 deaths. We provide an explanation for this
   finding by showing that voters concerned about the economic impacts of
   pandemic-related restrictions on activity were more likely to support
   Trump and that local COVID-19 severity was predictive of these economic
   concerns. While COVID-19 likely contributed to Trump's loss in 2020, our
   analysis demonstrates that he gained support among voters in localities
   worst affected by the pandemic.},

Abstract = {The provincial elections in the Serbian region of Vojvodina are
   preconditioned to demonstrate the typical effects of second-order
   competition. Its main features include the weak competences of regional
   institutions in a specific shared-rule arrangement, which are limited to
   only one province, and a non-politicized regional identity. The trend of
   simultaneous voting, along with a recently aligned electoral system and
   a centralized political arena, has created a nationalized regional
   competition, emulating national political dynamics. This claim is
   substantiated through an analysis of candidates, campaigns, and results,
   as well as voters' behaviour, the last being operationalized through the
   dissimilarity index, both on the provincial level and on the level of
   polling-stations.},

Abstract = {As European integration has become politicised over the last several
   decades, scholars have paid keen attention to the role of identity in
   shaping political conflicts and contestation in Europe. This article
   investigates the microfoundation of the political divide over European
   integration by building on and extending theories of social identity and
   recent studies on affective polarisation. Large-scale survey experiment
   data from 25 European Union member states are analysed to explore the
   extent of divides over European integration. This analysis shows a
   statistically significant and substantively large magnitude of the
   divide based on European identity. Moreover, results show that this
   divide over European integration deserves particular attention as it is
   largely driven by out-group animosity, rather than in-group favouritism.
   Lastly, results show that electoral context, such as electoral salience,
   involvement in elections, elite polarisation, and the strength of
   Eurosceptic parties, influences the intensity of the European divide.},

Abstract = {The increasing saturation of all facets of contemporary capitalism,
   including human labour, with computer and digital technologies, has
   given rise to a number of apologetic concepts, variously termed the
   information society, cognitive capitalism and digital capitalism. These
   concepts are ideological in nature. They have gained wide acceptance
   because of the underdevelopment of Marxist epistemology. This article
   submits a Marxist theory of knowledge accounting for modern developments
   in the natural sciences from the standpoint of the the materiality of
   knowledge and of its class content. It deals at length with two
   important examples: the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics and
   the internet. It shows that the generation of knowledge on the internet
   is at the same time, a battle for knowledge. It is part of the wider
   cognitive class struggle between capital and the rationality of labour
   in its multifarious and ever-changing forms.},

Abstract = {In recent years the United States has placed the Indo-Pacific at the
   centre of its foreign policy and national security strategy. While the
   Trump administration introduced the United States' first strategy for
   the Indo-Pacific, the administration fell short of implementing an
   effective policy that catered to the regional realities on the ground.
   The Biden administration has improved upon its predecessor's
   shortcomings in the diplomatic domain but has yet to implement a
   comprehensive economic strategy for the region. This article compares
   the distinctive diplomatic, economic and security characteristics of the
   Trump and the Biden administrations' Indo-Pacific strategies and argues
   that the latter administration crafted a more effective, albeit
   incomplete, strategy for advancing US interests.},

Abstract = {The power of authoritarian elections is not unlimited. When using
   elections as a source of information, authoritarian regimes may not be
   able to collect from a single election all the information it could
   theoretically provide, and so they must commit to seeking only some
   specific signal(s) in each election. It is possible to identify the type
   of information each regime seeks from its elections by studying its
   reactions to small but unexpected defeats. Applying this logic to
   Vietnam, I find that the regime responded to the defeats of its favored
   candidates in the 2016 election for the national legislature by
   increasing central transfers to provinces in which it had suffered these
   defeats. This evidence suggests that the Vietnamese regime uses
   elections as an opinion poll to identify areas in which it is less
   popular, instead of as a test to detect local officials who underperform
   in their electoral manipulation efforts.},

Abstract = {Starting the inception of the 2010s, Ethiopia's relations with Egypt
   have been experiencing one of the deepest crises in the relationship of
   the two countries' history. Ethiopia, one of the upper riparian states
   of the Nile River not only theoretically challenged the exclusive veto
   power of Egypt over the Nile River but also practically start
   constructing one of Africa's largest hydropower dams on the Blue Nile
   since 2011. The challenging behavior of Ethiopia over the Nile River
   worried the long-standing regional hegemon, Egypt. Against this
   background, this paper aims to forward a new insight into how and why
   Ethiopia challenged the long-standing superior-subordinate Egypt-led
   order over the Nile River. Moreover, in its discussion, the paper tries
   to address key drives, challenges, and prospects of Ethiopia-Egypt water
   diplomacy. The paper also illustrates how and why the Ethio-Egypt water
   diplomacy strain becomes a cross-cut on the two nation's foreign policy
   matters. The paper has also attempted to understand how the
   superior-subordinate power duality approach works over the Nile River
   against the new balancer.},

Abstract = {Misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms can cause serious
   harms by undermining the integrity of elections, destabilising political
   systems, and derailing public health messages. Yet, key decision-makers
   still struggle to agree on definitions of these terms. This dissensus
   can frustrate holistic approaches needed to tackle the harms caused by
   online falsehoods. This article focuses on the Asia Pacific and draws
   upon a comprehensive set of expert interviews in Singapore and Indonesia
   to investigate how digital platforms, civil society actors, academics,
   and journalists conceptualise misinformation and disinformation. We find
   existing definitions have been developed in `information silos'. In
   response, we map stakeholders' key definitional indicators of
   misinformation and disinformation to identify overlap and difference and
   to explicate the role of harm in their conceptualisations. This
   framework is used to recast working definitions of misinformation and
   disinformation with the intention of assisting greater stakeholder
   collaboration needed to mitigate its societal harms.},

Title = {Outsourcing Bureaucracy to Evade Accountability: How Public Servants
   Build Shadow State Capacity},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {117},
Number = {3},
Pages = {835-850},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The solution to weak bureaucratic capacity in developing countries is
   often presumed to be more accountability. This paper shows how
   accountability initiatives, intended to reduce corruption, can actually
   hinder the development of capable government agencies by making it
   harder for directors to recruit experts and spend their budgets. It
   further highlights a common way public servants escape the
   accountability rules that limit their effectiveness: outsourcing
   bureaucracies to nonstate organizations. This practice of outsourcing
   bureaucracy to avoid accountability rules creates what I call
   ``shadow{''} state capacity and, paradoxically, it may help explain
   ``pockets of effectiveness{''} among government social programs in
   developing countries. Drawing on in-depth interviews and descriptive
   statistics, I show how outsourcing was a critical factor in producing
   two of Brazil's most vaunted social sector programs. However, I also
   suggest that outsourcing bureaucracy may ultimately limit state
   capacity, even if it helps to build capable programs in the short run.},

Abstract = {Observational studies and anecdotal evidence suggest that party unity
   improves a party's electoral performance. Yet, due to a lack of
   experimental evidence, the causal standing of these findings remains
   unclear. Moreover, party unity manifests in various ways and we do not
   know how much different types of party unity affect the vote. Relying on
   a conjoint experiment implemented in a probability-based survey of the
   German population, our study unveils the distinct causal effect of
   different forms of party unity on vote choice. We further establish that
   appearing united can compensate for substantive policy distances between
   parties and voters. These findings have important implications for our
   understanding of how citizens vote and how infra-party politics affects
   the political representation of citizens in democracies.},

Abstract = {Studies of ambition often frame decisions to run for reelection, seek
   higher office, or retire in terms of the nature of those opportunities
   and the risks associated with them. However, career decisions can also
   be framed in terms of the value of one's present position, which depends
   on what we refer to as institutional attachments. In contrast to
   institutional positions (leadership, committee chairs), institutional
   attachments relate to social position in the legislature and how it has
   changed over time. In this article, we explore how factors related to
   institutional attachments influence career decisions. Specifically, we
   ask whether a legislator's cohort, including its size, compatibility,
   and experience in possessing majority status affect the propensity to
   exhibit static ambition. Looking at a sample of more than 5500 state
   legislative open-seat opportunities in 47 states between 2003 and 2016,
   we find some but not all these traits are predictive of career
   decisions.},

Abstract = {Many instructors of political science wrestle with the question of
   whether to reveal their political ideology to their students and recent
   polarization in the United States intensifies those concerns. Prior
   research suggests that liberal and moderate students are wary of taking
   a course with a conservative professor, but do students react to
   economically conservative professors the same as they do socially
   conservative professors? We conducted an online survey experiment of
   current students at two public universities in the southern United
   States to test whether a reputation for expressing conservative opinions
   on either economic or social issues affected a professor's appeal to
   students. Participants split along ideological lines on both professor
   profiles, but greater skepticism was directed at the socially
   conservative professor. Preference for a socially conservative professor
   was greatest among more religious students.},

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Politicians engage in, and the media amplifies, social constructions of
   welfare recipients as undeserving. Such messaging seeks to influence
   mass public opinion, but what are the effects on the target population
   receiving welfare benefits? We test if deservingness messaging affects
   welfare recipients' mental health. To do so, we exploit a
   quasi-experiment entailing a dramatic shift in deservingness messaging
   after a welfare recipient in Denmark became the subject of a national
   debate, utilizing detailed administrative data on the ensuing
   consumption of antidepressants by other welfare recipients. We find

Abstract = {The theory of the firm initially developed by Ronald Coase has made
   explicit the political nature of firms by putting hierarchy at the heart
   of the economic process. Theories of workplace democracy articulate this
   intuition in the normative terms of the conditions under which this
   political power can be legitimate. This paper presents an organizational
   theory of workplace democracy, and contends that the democratization of
   firms requires that we take their organizational dimension explicitly
   into account. It thus construes democracy as an organizational principle
   and juxtaposes it to market, hierarchy, and norm-compliance as rival
   principles for the organization of economic activities. Attempts to
   construe democracy as an organizational principle with unique features
   in the tradition of transaction-cost economics are discussed before
   proposing an innovative solution based on an updated version of
   grid/group cultural theory of politics, adjusted to accommodate the
   basic requirements of democratic theory.},

Abstract = {This article examines and compares the foreign policy preferences of
   three small states in Central Asia, namely Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and
   Turkmenistan, in the post-independence era. Although the three countries
   share similar features, such as a common Soviet legacy, landlocked
   position, and population size, the foreign policy behavior differs in
   Turkmenistan. While Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan align with Russia,
   Turkmenistan embraces permanent neutrality. This study argues that
   natural resource endowment, coupled with fewer internal threats and
   geographical constraints compared to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, helped
   Turkmenistan to pursue a neutral and more independent foreign policy.
   Yet, over-reliance on China as the major buyer of Turkmen natural gas
   may make it difficult to sustain permanent neutrality.},

Abstract = {This article examines the main stages in the development of relations
   between Russia and Latin America from 2OOO to 2O22. The research covers
   the entire set of bilateral cooperation between Russia and Latin
   American countries, and the internal and external factors influencing
   their evolution. The article presents the author's view of interstate
   interactions from two perspectives - the foreign policy of Russia, and
   the national and international objectives of leading Latin American
   countries. The author concludes that for Russian foreign policy in the
   21st century, all the countries of this region can be divided into four
   conditional groups: traditional partners, ideological allies, trade
   partners, and low priority states. This mapping of the region can
   explain the peculiarities of the formation of dialogue between Moscow
   and Latin American countries, and the possibilities and limits of
   interstate and interregional cooperation.},

Abstract = {A growing number of scholars who study race in the United States are
   calling on white Americans to advance racial equality by renouncing
   their ``white privilege.{''} Yet few academics have explicitly defined
   this term. Here I analyze how scholars who discuss the phenomenon use
   ``white privilege{''} in their work. In so doing, I argue that examining
   racial injustice through the lens of white privilege not only fails to
   subvert racial inequality in the United States but also helps maintain
   it. It does so by reinforcing racial stereotypes and undermining
   cross-racial worker solidarity and calls for universal public goods,
   both of which are necessary to advance the interests of most nonwhite
   Americans. By analyzing the most common invocations of ``white
   privilege,{''} I ultimately find that white privilege discourse provides
   a pseudo-progressive smokescreen that protects the laws, policies, and
   economic and political interests that perpetuate racial inequality in
   the United States today.},

Abstract = {Increasing the share of women in politics is often promoted as a means
   to reduce corruption. Recent studies indicate the importance of
   considering the gender gap in corruption as a dynamic, rather than
   static, phenomenon. Our study combines data from surveys and
   incentivized behavioral games among 400 inexperienced and experienced
   local politicians in West Bengal, India. We find no gender gap in
   attitudes toward corruption. However, in incentivized games,
   inexperienced female politicians are more honest than their male
   counterparts. No such gender gap exists among experienced politicians.
   Drawing on a theoretical discussion of four possible mechanisms, we find
   that the apparent increase in dishonest behavior among female
   politicians is associated with lower risk aversion and stronger
   political networks. Our findings indicate that women, like men, are
   socialized into their local political culture and that benefits from
   changing who is elected may be short-lived unless that culture is also
   changed.},

Abstract = {The present article considers Francis Bacon's New Atlantis against the
   backdrop of Bacon's Short View to be taken of Great Britain and Spain,
   one of Bacon's least studied and most imperially audacious and bellicose
   texts. In the Short View to be taken of Great Britain and Spain, Bacon
   argues for a naval war and blockade of both the Iberian Peninsula and
   Spanish colonies in the Americas, advocating the British seizure of the
   latter. The article argues that the fulfillment of these imperials and
   colonial proposals is, in Bacon's view, a prerequisite and
   presupposition of the action of Bacon's New Atlantis.},

Abstract = {Scholars warn that affective polarization undermines democratic norms
   and accountability. They speculate that if citizens were less
   affectively polarized, they would be less likely to endorse norm
   violations, overlook copartisan politicians' shortcomings, oppose
   compromise, adopt their party's views, or misperceive economic
   conditions. We advance reasons to doubt that affective polarization
   influences political choices. We support this argument with five
   experiments that manipulate citizens' affective polarization with
   multiple approaches. We then trace the downstream consequences of
   manipulating citizens' affective polarization, such as their reactions
   to information about their actual representatives in Congress. In our
   experiments (total N = 12,341), we ``rewind{''} the equivalent of three
   decades of change in affective polarization but find no evidence that
   these changes influence many political outcomes, only general questions
   about interpersonal attitudes. Our results suggest caution when assuming
   that reducing affective polarization would meaningfully bolster

Abstract = {Moving past the conventional focus on ministerial portfolios, this paper
   investigates how coalition governments allocate and share ministerial
   responsibility for individual policy issues. Sharing responsibility
   induces coalescing parties to collaborate on policy issues, which
   addresses the problem of ministerial autonomy. Consequently, I argue
   that incumbent parties in coalition governments share ministerial
   responsibility for contentious and salient policy issues. This claim is
   corroborated based on a newly elicited dataset of over 30,000
   ministerial policy responsibilities from Denmark, Germany, and the
   Netherlands. The findings have important implications for scholarship on
   coalition governments, as they demonstrate that incumbent parties can
   use the design of ministerial portfolios itself to insulate a coalition
   compromise from partisan deviations.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {46},

Abstract = {Although populist radical right-wing parties (PRRPs) are regarded as
   male-dominated, many have in recent years expanded their female
   electorate and reduced their electoral gender gap. Studies explain this
   trend as the result of a conscious strategy to target female voters
   through representation. This strategy is applied in both the descriptive
   and substantial realms, as PRRPs appoint female leaders and adopt
   relatively more progressive stances on gender, while still holding
   conservative, family-centred positions. However, the central question of
   whether and which of these strategies explain the closing gender gap in
   the populist vote has not yet been thoroughly comparatively examined. To
   answer this question, this study uses conditional logit models to
   explore the relationship between descriptive and substantial
   representation and women's vote for a PRRP. The results show that a
   higher convergence between voter and PRRP positions on gender equality
   increases female votes for the PRRP. However, female descriptive
   representation does not prove relevant to explaining women's vote for
   PRRPs. This has important implications for the literature on female
   representation in general, and women's vote for PRRPs in particular.},

Abstract = {In many Western European states, right-wing populist parties made it
   into the national parliaments. This presents the established parties
   with the challenge of how to behave towards the new party. While the
   scholarly literature has focused more on the interaction with the
   populist radical right in the electoral arena, we know little about how
   it functions in an institutionally constrained arena such as parliament.
   This study asks in what way these structures affect the position taking
   and confrontation in speeches. Using different text-as-data approaches,
   I analyze parliamentary debates in four Western European parliaments
   after the entry of right-wing populist parties. The results show that
   government-opposition dynamics continue to structure parliamentary
   debates by and large, but right-wing populist parties succeed in
   polarizing debates on immigration. They also become the center of
   attention in these debates. These results have important implications
   for the analysis of strategic party interaction in the parliamentary
   context.},

Abstract = {Due to the slow rate of COVID-19 vaccine uptake and the spread of the
   highly contagious Omicron variant, governments are considering mandating
   COVID-19 vaccination for specific professions and demographic groups.
   This study evaluates popular attitudes toward such policies. We fielded
   a survey of 535 registered voters in South Dakota to examine popular
   attitudes towards vaccine mandates for five groups-children 12 and
   older, K-12 teachers, medical staff, nursing homes staff, and police
   personnel. We estimated a series of logistic regression models and
   presented predicted probabilities to find the primary determinants of
   these attitudes. Results revealed that political partisanship and trust
   in government are strong predictors of support for vaccine mandates
   across all models. Should government and public health officials wish to
   increase the proportion of people vaccinated for COVID-19, they must
   recognize the limitations of current public health campaigns, and
   reshape their efforts in congruence with scientific findings.},

Abstract = {Male, Sudanese experiences of displacement in Amman, Jordan are
   characterised by the exclusions of state and international humanitarian
   response bureaucracies, and compounded by pervasive racial
   discrimination and violence. As part of their efforts to maintain their
   presence in the city, the men have created household-level hosting
   relationships, based on a situated ethics of care developed through
   shared understandings and experiences of displacement and a recognition
   of their interdependence. Through these personal relations, the men
   inhabit the city and offer one another some safety from the uncertain
   and hostile context of their displacement in Jordan. Hosting
   arrangements are not merely convenient or functionally necessary in the
   difficult circumstances of displacement, but produce new ways of being
   together and serve as sites for the enactment of social rights and
   claims to presence. As such, refugee-refugee hosting practices hold the
   potential for lived citizenship, enacted through everyday and ordinary
   acts of care.},

Abstract = {Research about women's representation in county governments and whether
   women's representation at the local level translates into different
   policy outcomes has been relatively unexplored (Holman 2017). Thus, we
   ask whether electing a woman to the county legislative body leads to
   different policy outputs, specifically in areas like education, health,
   hospitals, housing, and welfare. Our dataset builds on de
   Benedictis-Kessner and Warshaw's (2020) work on county legislative
   elections by gender coding candidates, leading to a full dataset of
   nearly 16,500 gender-coded races for county legislative positions, thus
   creating the most comprehensive, gender-coded dataset of elections in
   county governments. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find
   that electing a woman to the county's governing body does not lead to
   greater spending generally or on social and redistributive policy. Yet
   there are specific conditions in which they can more easily advocate for
   their preferred fiscal preferences. For instance, under commission forms
   of government, electing a woman leads to increased expenditures on
   welfare. Moreover, electing women has a positive effect on spending when
   the county is receiving a greater proportion of revenue from higher
   levels of government.},

Abstract = {Since the 2016 Brexit referendum a series of crises has gripped Northern
   Ireland's politics. This has had a destabilising effect across society,
   which has arguably been felt most acutely by political unionism. The
   Belfast/Good Friday Agreement (B/GFA) of 1998 created a series of
   institutions to deal with political conflict in Northern Ireland, manage
   cross-border cooperation and normalise relations between the UK and
   Ireland. However, many aspects of it have been sparingly and
   ineffectually deployed, most notably the second and third strands
   dealing with north/south and east/west relations respectively. In this
   article, the authors argue that regular use of the institutional
   arrangements created by the Agreement would help to deal with the
   challenges currently facing Northern Ireland and help address unionist
   anxieties over the Protocol. Use of the North-South Ministerial Council
   (NSMC), the British Irish Council (BIC) and the British-Irish
   Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) should be prioritised. The
   unresolved issues arising from Brexit require a recommitment to the
   intergovernmental logic at the heart of the 1998 Agreement, despite the
   obstacles.},

Abstract = {In recent years, pessimism about plebiscitary intra-party democracy has
   been challenged by assembly-based models of intra-party democracy.
   However, research has yet to explore the emergence of new power dynamics
   in parties originating from the implementation of deliberative practices
   in their intra-party democracy. We investigate how deliberative
   democratization reshuffles power relations within political parties
   through a case study of Agora, an internally deliberative movement party
   in Belgium. Employing a process-tracing approach using original
   interview and participant observation data, we argue that while
   plebiscitary intra-party democracy shifts power towards passive members
   prone to elite domination, our case suggests that deliberative
   intra-party democracy shifts power towards active members that are more
   likely to be critical of elites.},

Abstract = {Since the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, more attention
   is being paid to anti-black racism and anti-racism. The authors contend
   that, by extension, other forms of racism need to be considered more
   closely, including those that have received limited scholarly and public
   attention. This article isolates key elements of anti-Palestinian racism
   as a specific form of racism that operates at local and global levels.
   As an Arab group which includes both Christians and Muslims,
   Palestinians can experience anti-Muslim racism (or Islamophobia) along
   with being subjected to anti-Arab racism and Orientalist stereotypes.
   Using the concept of racial gaslighting which has been advanced recently
   across a number of disciplines, the authors isolate an identifiable
   anti-Palestinian racism, arguing that anti-Palestinian racism is
   expressed through racial gaslighting in a threefold manner. The first is
   denial, with a key example being the treatment of the 1948 Nakba (or
   catastrophe). The second is how racial gaslighting operates through
   power inequities, with stateless Palestinians, occupied Palestinians and
   Palestinians holding Israeli citizenship having clear inequities,
   distorted by an active repositioning of the apartheid and
   settler-colonial character of the Israeli state as one that is
   `democratic', `Jewish', and unfairly treated. Finally, the article
   considers how Palestinians are victim-blamed, by discourses which
   present them as `terrorist', `anti-semitic', and `undemocratic'.},

Abstract = {Do economic experiences early in life affect regime support later in
   life? Effects of recent economic performance on regime support are
   extensively studied, but lasting effects of individual-level economic
   experiences across the lifespan remain unexplored. We argue that in
   democracies and autocracies alike, economic experiences in early
   adulthood (that is, age eighteen to twenty-eight) are wired into
   people's memories and become important cues for their democratic support
   later in life. Having lived in a well-performing economy in a democracy
   increases democratic support throughout most of people's lives, whereas
   having lived in a well-performing economy in an autocracy decreases
   democratic support throughout most of people's lives. Using extensive
   survey data on support for democracy covering ninety-seven countries
   from 1994 to 2015, we find support for these propositions, demonstrating
   that economic experiences in early adulthood, conditional on the regime
   in place at the time, have strong, robust and lasting effects on
   democratic support.},

Abstract = {Beijing played a critical role in establishing the SCO in the aftermath
   of the break of the former Soviet Union in response to the emerging
   non-traditional security challenges. Overtime, the SCO has evolved into
   a regional institution critical to China's growing interests in Central
   Asia/Eurasia and increasingly, Beijing seeks to influence and shape the
   organization in support of its institutional balancing
   strategy-inclusive in soliciting Russian endorsement of its diplomatic
   agendas in the region ranging from energy security and greater economic
   integration, and exclusive in resisting and preventing US influence in
   the region. Lately, that strategy has also been displayed in the SCO
   membership expansion to India to minimize chance of a Washington-Delhi
   axis against China, at least not where SCO-wide (that would include
   China) interests are concerned. But the most critical transformation of
   the SCO as a regional institution is its utility in Beijing's exclusive
   institutional balancing strategy against the US, to prevent the latter
   from gaining access and influence in Central Asia/Eurasia; to foster
   trust among member states, and develop the SCO into a regional security
   community, and to safeguard Chinese interests in both geo-economic
   (trade and energy) and geopolitical (security and regional stability)

Abstract = {The paper examines the developments in citizenship studies over the past
   twenty-five years through the lens of `citizenism', understood as a
   presumed prioritisation of state citizenship as the only form of
   political relationship between an individual and a state (and perhaps
   even among individuals) that can be formally recognised. It suggests
   that while citizenship studies may not be citizenist in nature, the use
   of the language of citizenship to describe a wide range of political
   relationships puts those using the core concepts of critical citizenship
   studies at risk of inadvertent banal citizenism. I start by setting out
   the language of citizenism as it has been used to date. Writers on the
   left use it to describe social democratic political movements that
   function within existing state structures. Underlying the various ways
   in which citizenism has been used is, I suggest, what can be called
   `banal citizenism', which presumes the priority of citizens and of
   citizenship. I will focus on threads within citizenship studies that
   seek to trouble this privileging of traditional state citizenship and
   examine the extent to which they succeed in escaping citizenism. I will
   conclude that while critical citizenship studies has made a significant
   contribution to how we think about politics, adjusting the terminology
   used could make it more powerful.},

Abstract = {The war in Ukraine manifests a major crisis both for US imperialism in
   its struggle to maintain and expand its hegemony against challenge, here
   primarily but not exclusively, Russia and for international capitalism
   itself. How this crisis will play out is unknown but at this stage three
   characteristics are evident. Firstly, the use of proxies; Ukraine for
   the military struggle and Europe to a large extent for the economic one.
   Secondly, the primacy of economic instruments, such as sanctions rather
   than direct military power. Thirdly, undergirding and legitimizing the
   other two, the expanded role of information warfare. Information warfare
   sits on two pillars. One is cultural hegemony, the soft power to mold
   perception because of the esteem in which the provider of information is
   held by the recipient. The other is the organizational framework, or
   architecture of information collection, creation and dissemination to
   manage perception.},

   elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {78},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Negative partisanship has been on the rise in American politics: While
   many Americans feel lukewarm about their own party, disdain toward the
   opposing party is steadily intensifying. Prior scholarship has examined
   to what extent negative partisanship can arise without any prior
   attachments to a particular party. Yet, most preceding work focuses on
   self-declared supporters of a political party who - by definition - have
   a positive party identification, thereby making it challenging to
   disentangle positive and negative partisanship. In this paper, I address
   this conceptual difficulty by surveying self-identified Independents
   shortly before the 2020 U.S. presidential elections. I show that
   negative partisanship among Independents predicts turnout, political
   engagement, strong emotional responses to the election outcome, as well
   as opposition to bipartisanship. These results confirm the notion that
   negative partisanship can influence political behavior independently of
   positive partisanship.},

Abstract = {This article, using the documentary review, explores different edges
   that peace pedagogies in Colombia can address, in a post-agreement
   context, to build a reconciliation environment. To do this, this
   research reviewed the literature about the change of the Latin phrase Si
   vis Pacem, para Bellum (If you want peace prepare for war) into Si vis
   pacem, para educationis (If you want peace, prepare for education). This
   work requires commitments and radical turns in the model and conception
   of the formative act, its objectives, forms and actors, if it seeks
   peace and national reconciliation.},

Abstract = {Political theorists have long worried that propaganda turns the
   democratic commitment to open communication into a tool of domination by
   elites. Where recent empirical and normative work on elite rhetoric
   focuses on how speech acts can exercise democratically problematic forms
   of power, I draw on John Dewey to argue that such approaches neglect how
   social organization shapes audiences' vulnerability to propaganda. I
   reconstruct Dewey's account of how social fragmentation and inequality
   impede cross-group communication, creating structural flaws in
   collective inquiry that propaganda in turn exploits. Dewey suggests that
   decoupling analysis of propagandic speech acts from the context of their
   reception fails to fully capture the harm done to democratic publics.
   His positive account provides new grounding for studying how social
   institutions and social inequality mediate the effect of elite rhetoric
   on democratic practice.},

Abstract = {The present paper addresses a problematization between the demands for
   rights and the emergence of social conflicts during the first Peronism
   in the province of La Rioja. In the arti-cle, we propose to analyze the
   dimensions reached by the democratization of the social wel-fare in this
   provincial context, based on the conflictive expression of demands for
   new rights. Reflecting on the sending of letters to government
   authorities, our analysis is based on letters from the campaign ``Peron
   wants to know what his people need{''} to warn of the emergence of
   diverse conflicts that recover the daily experiences of men and women;
   in which identity processes are manifested between these conflicts and
   political experience of Peronism. Thus, it can be anticipated that, in
   these sources, the modulation of demands is composed, on the one hand,
   around the expression of social injustices and, on the other hand, in
   the delimita-tion of the community.},

Abstract = {This study comparatively explores the determinants of membership in
   political parties and social movement organizations in the Ecuadorian
   context of 2017-2019. The methodological design corresponds to a
   repeated cross-sectional research, with three samples collected in
   Quito-Ecuador in 2017 (n1 = 1136), 2018 (n2 = 1520) and 2019 (n3 = 824),
   through the application of face-to-face surveys. For data analysis,
   logistic regression models were developed to detect the factors that
   influence the individual probability of belonging to political parties
   or, on the other hand, to social movements. Empirical findings reveal
   that while factors such as internal political efficacy and online
   exposure to recruiting actions generally favor membership in political
   organizations, there are also differences in the explanatory pattern of
   membership depending on whether they are political parties or social
   movements. Specifically, socioeconomic and psychological predictors that
   are relevant to political party membership tend to vary significantly in
   the case of social movements. Given that the quantitative study of the
   determinants of membership in political groups has been a topic little
   explored in Ecuador, and Latin America, this study seeks to make an
   initial contribution to the explanatory knowledge about this political
   phenomenon.},

Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {301-330},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Many democracies use geographic constituencies to elect some or all of
   their legislators. Furthermore, many people regard this as desirable in
   a noncomparative sense, thinking that local constituencies are not
   necessarily superior to other schemes but are nevertheless attractive
   when considered on their own merits. Yet, this position of
   noncomparative constituency localism is now under philosophical pressure
   as local constituencies have recently attracted severe criticism. This
   article examines how damaging this recent criticism is, and argues that
   within limits, noncomparative constituency localism remains
   philosophically tenable despite the criticisms. The article shows that
   noncomparative constituency localism is compelling in the first place
   because geographic constituencies foster partisan voter mobilisation,
   and practices of constituency service help to sustain deliberation among
   constituents and within the legislature and promote the realisation of
   equal opportunity for political influence. The article further argues
   that it is unwarranted to criticise geographic constituencies for being
   biased against geographically dispersed voter groups, for causing
   vote-seat disproportionality, and for being vulnerable to
   gerrymandering. The article also discusses the criticisms that local
   constituencies may pose risks of inefficiency and injustice in resource
   allocation decisions, may lead legislators to neglect the common good,
   and may limit citizens' control over the political agenda. Whilst
   conceding that these objections may be valid, the article argues that
   they do not outweigh the diverse and normatively weighty considerations
   speaking in favour of noncomparative constituency localism. Finally, the
   article's analysis is defended against several variants of the charge
   that it exaggerates the benefits of geographic constituencies.},

Abstract = {Do lasting differences in the political cultures of social subgroups
   call into question the legitimacy of democracy? This danger has been
   discussed for three decades now, always in the run up to German Unity
   Day, which marks the reunification of Germany in 1990. Is there still a
   `wall in people's minds', as postulated in the late 1990s? This article
   examines the question comparatively and over time: Do political cultures
   and their main political attitudes still differ between Western and
   Eastern Germany 30 years after reunification? And, if so, to what
   extent? Using an extended concept of political support, we analyse
   East-West differences by drawing on different data material from
   representative surveys. What we show that there is no deficit of
   legitimacy in Eastern Germany in terms of democracy. Nevertheless, there
   are consistent East-West differences in terms of people's satisfaction
   with democracy as it is currently practised. These differences can be
   explained neither by existing socio-economic and socio-structural
   inequalities between Eastern and Western Germany, and nor by feelings of
   nostalgia for socialism. Rather, they are due to a combination of
   feelings of disadvantage, of a lack of recognition, and corresponding
   narratives that can draw on objective manifestations of inequality.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the impact of the changing international order on
   the subjugation of state citizens. The increased need for security
   brought on by great power competition has led states to become more
   authoritarian. Citizen freedom may decrease as states seek security.
   With the advancement of facial recognition software, data collection and
   censorship, the state is encroaching on the rights and freedoms of
   citizens right to privacy. Authoritarianism is a significant part of a
   state's motivation to remain independent and secure as the international
   order changes from American unipolarity to a multipolar one given the
   rise of China and the resurgence of Russia. The three traits described,
   absolutism, organicism, and irrationalism, point to rising
   authoritarianism providing useful analysis to understand the zero-sum
   relationship between liberty and security.},

Abstract = {The degree to which party systems are ideologically and programmatically
   structured is central to democracy. This article analyzes differences in
   the extent and nature of programmatic structuration in Latin America and
   Europe, using a new original data source, the Chapel Hill Expert
   Survey-Latin America (CHES-LA), in combination with the long-standing
   CHES-Europe. First, we demonstrate the reliability of CHES-LA in
   relation to CHES-Europe, and substantiate its validity by comparing it
   to other expert, elite and party manifesto surveys in Latin America.
   Using confirmatory factor analysis, we then show that while party system
   structuration in Latin America is somewhat lower than in Europe, it is
   also of a decisively different nature. In Latin America economic and
   socio-cultural policy positions are largely captured in a single
   overlapping dimension; in Europe, by contrast, competition occurs
   overwhelmingly along two dimensions, each with distinct clusters of
   policy positions.},

Abstract = {Although the existence of strategic voting in the United Kingdom and
   Canada has been well documented, quantifying when a voter will cast a
   strategic ballot has yet to be done. This article draws on electoral
   data from five UK and Canadian elections in order to address this gap by
   identifying a precise ``tipping point{''} for when a non-viable party
   supporter's probability of voting strategically crosses a 50 per cent
   threshold. I find the best tipping point measure occurs when a voter
   rates their favourite viable party greater than 59 out of 100 in the UK
   and greater than 73 out of 100 in Canada. Both countries also have clear
   tipping points for the likeability of an individual's highest preferred
   party and perceptions of that party's distance from contention. Overall,
   by calculating these tipping points, researchers can better gauge voter
   behaviour and how, or when, certain factors contribute to strategic
   voting.},

Abstract = {What are the origins of elite splits? Why do regional elites break away
   from central elites and develop regional parties? This paper contends
   that intra-elite differences are more likely to be politicized when an
   economic shock exacerbates pre-existing asymmetric economic preferences
   and disadvantaged elites can mobilize the electorate on the basis of
   identity. I employ constituency-level data from Catalonia spanning the
   late 19th and early 20th century to test which factors influenced
   regional elite decisions to form a regional elite political party. To
   understand elite divisions, I exploit a historical exogenous trade shock
   and its asymmetric impact within Catalonia, and the availability of
   identity-based mobilization agents. The results show that regional elite
   splits took place in areas more affected by the 1898 colonial trade
   shock and where elites had larger mobilization capacity.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship on U.S. regulatory federalism has tended to focus on
   conflict between the states and state resistance to federal initiatives.
   Less attention has been given to federal-state cooperation and how it
   affects regulatory enforcement. In this article, we examine
   intergovernmental cooperation in multistate lawsuits filed by state
   attorneys general to ascertain trends in multistate regulatory
   enforcement through litigation over time. We pay particular attention to
   the increasing use of compliance monitoring by both state and federal
   regulators, including through monitors independent of the regulated
   industries. Relying upon a dataset of legal settlements, scoping
   interviews, and two case studies of recent multistate litigation, we
   find that federal-state cooperation in multistate lawsuits has become
   more institutionalized over time. This increased cooperation has created
   a two-way street in which state and federal regulators often combine
   resources and learn from each other through the process of compliance
   monitoring.},

Abstract = {The article presents a study of the special powers of the Constitutional
   Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, reflecting the specifics of the state
   structure. The Constitutional Court of Bosnia has certain powers that
   can determine the specifics of the legal nature of this state. Leading
   in this study is the method of systems analysis, which allowed the
   author to analyze the degree of participation of the constitutional
   control body in ensuring the continuity of the lawmaking process. As a
   result of the study, it was revealed that the implementation of the
   constitutional project is associated with ensuring the parity of
   interests of constitutive peoples and making the state mechanism
   provided in the constitution effective. Analyzing the institution of
   protection of vital interests in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the author
   concludes that the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina
   significantly influenced the change in the structure and content of this
   institution in the studied state.},

Abstract = {The literature on the populist radical right has underlined the party
   family's influence on a variety of issues, such as immigration, welfare,
   and the EU. However, scholars have hardly studied its influence in the
   field of democracy reform, even though populist radical right parties
   strongly criticize how democratic systems currently function. In an
   exploratory and qualitative study of four cases, we analyze the
   adaptation (or lack thereof) of mainstream parties to populist radical
   right parties' challenge in the field of democracy reform in Austria,
   France, Germany, and the Netherlands, focusing on direct democracy. In
   contrast to other policy issues, we find limited adaptation of
   mainstream parties in the field of democracy reform: Instead of being a
   driver on democracy reform, the populist radical right is merely a
   fellow passenger. Where it has an effect, that effect is mostly
   negative, turning mainstream parties away from direct democracy.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the state of democracy around the world in 2021.
   The level of democracy enjoyed by the average global citizen in 2021 was
   down to 1989 levels. In 2021, autocracies were on the rise, harbouring
   70\% of the world population, or 5.4 billion people. There was also a
   record number of countries autocratizing in 2021: 33 countries, home to
   36\% of the global population. In recent years, the EU seems to be
   facing its own wave of autocratization, with 20\% of its members
   autocratizing over the last decade. In addition to the continued
   downturn in global democracy, this article documents several signs that
   autocratization is changing in nature. Polarization increased
   substantially and signi?cantly in 40 countries between 2011 and 2021,
   and our analysis indicates that polarization increasingly damages
   democracy especially recently and under anti-pluralist governments. Over
   the past decade, the data also shows that autocratic governments more
   frequently used misinformation to shape domestic and international
   opinion. Finally, with ?ve military coups and one self-coup, 2021
   featured an unprecedented increase in coups for this century. These
   coups contributed to the uptick in the number of closed autocracies in
   2021 and seem to signal a shift toward emboldened autocratic actors.},

Abstract = {When President Biden took office in January 2021, it was widely expected
   that he would reverse Trump-era policies and take steps to address
   climate change, racial justice, and rising inequality. Then-candidate
   Biden made strong commitments to addressing the climate crisis,
   including stating that ``the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for
   meeting the climate challenges we face.{''} But with the parties evenly
   split in the Senate, this meant legislating ambitious climate policy
   would be difficult. This article analyzes the Biden Administration's
   climate and environmental justice initiatives in its first year. The
   Biden administration successfully advanced some environmental policy
   through legislation but relied primarily on ambitious executive orders
   and with a particular focus on integrating equity and justice
   considerations into climate and environmental policy, while encountering
   challenges from Republican state officials.},

Abstract = {Social accountability initiatives seek to empower citizens to hold
   officials to account between and beyond elections, yet often meet with
   mixed results. This article highlights a neglected dimension in the
   study of accountability: intermediation by brokers who share and frame
   information. In contrast to literature that focuses on political brokers
   in clientelist networks, I introduce the concept of social brokerage:
   efforts to motivate and to link action by citizens and officials,
   without the expectation of an electoral return. I illustrate the
   practice of social brokerage in India, through study of a network of
   citizen journalists who attempt to mobilize citizen claim-making and to
   encourage official responsiveness to those claims. I argue that
   effective social brokerage requires both vernacularization (giving
   information meaning in local contexts) and interlocution (speaking to
   and between multiple audiences). This, in turn, rests upon a
   powerful-but often elusive-combination of community embeddedness and
   ties to bureaucracy.},

Abstract = {In conversations surrounding technology and the future of politics, Adam
   Smith is a valuable resource for evaluating the subtle relationship
   between technology and freedom. Smith explores the tendency of
   specialization occasioned by the advancement of machines to cause
   ``mental mutilation{''} where the worker's human faculties are stunted
   through overspecialization or narrowing of scope of opportunities to
   judge. Smith's treatment of the development of sympathetic judgment as
   necessary to the practice of liberty illuminates the depth of the harms
   caused by this mutilation; it is the very freedom of the worker that is
   at stake when the development and the exercise of judgment are
   restricted. Taken together, Smith's discussion of the advancement of
   machines and free and independent judgment can aid contemporary thinkers
   in understanding the relationship between technology and freedom in
   commercial society, particularly if new technologies substitute for the
   judgment of the worker or prevent the development of their judgment.},

Abstract = {This collection of articles demonstrates the variety of ways in which
   business interacts with politics. This can only be understood if we
   recognise the heterogeneity of business. Indeed, capital vs capital
   conflicts are often now more important than those with traditional foes.
   Reputation is an important driver of business responses to political
   challenges, not least in relation to climate change. Government remains
   reliant on information and consent from business, but can face business
   down on particular issues.},

Title = {THE TIDE RAISING ALL BOATS? SOCIAL CLASS DIFFERENCES IN POLITICAL
   PARTICIPATION AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND},
Journal = {SCOTTISH AFFAIRS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {165-189},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Social class differences in political participation are a pressing issue
   for democracies and they are particularly severe among young people in
   the UK. Disadvantaged young people are the least likely to be
   politically engaged in the UK and it is assumed that with declining
   levels of participation inequalities in political participation
   increase. What happens to political inequality though when levels of
   youth participation increase? Do more advantaged young people account
   for most of the extra participation or do disadvantaged young people
   `catch up'?
   Based on representative survey data, this paper investigates levels of
   political inequality among 16- and 17-year-olds in a context of
   increasing participation in Scotland. We find that in Scotland young
   people of all social classes were equally likely to be politically
   engaged, while among young people in the rest of the UK and adults from
   Scotland those of higher social status were more likely to be engaged in
   politics. Overall, social class differences in political engagement were
   less pronounced amongst 16- and 17-year-olds in Scotland than in the
   rest of the UK. The paper offers some possible explanations of this
   finding and suggestions for further research.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has overwhelmed the Lithuanian
   healthcare system. In an attempt to meet its emergency situation and
   mitigate the new challenges, the Government reached out to the private
   sector, aiming to develop a sustainable cooperation approach in
   healthcare service provision. The article examines the potential
   implications for the healthcare system in Lithuania and adaptation
   paths. The preliminary overview refers to the assumption that the
   efforts to deliver sustainable service in the healthcare sector were
   uncoordinated and showed institutional vulnerability in both private and

Abstract = {Previous work on candidate campaign finance in list proportional
   representation systems has focused on differential electoral returns of
   spending for incumbent and challenger candidates. This article asks
   whether incumbents and challengers in these systems fund election
   campaigns from different sources. We hypothesize that incumbents receive
   more: (a) contributions from individual and corporate donors; and (b)
   financial support from party organizations, as party elites
   strategically deploy resources to constrain intra-party competition. The
   analysis is based on a dataset on campaign funding sources of candidates
   for two legislative elections in Colombia (2014 and 2018). The results
   confirm that party organizations transfer more financial resources to
   incumbents than to challengers. Contrary to expectations, parties do not
   specifically support the electorally most vulnerable incumbents. We also
   find that challengers receive higher levels of non-corporate private
   donations than incumbents. These findings provide insights into
   individual campaigns and demonstrate how parties coordinate intra-party
   competition through campaign funding.},

   Evidence from a Workshop-Based Experiment in Zambia},

Abstract = {In many places around the world, young voters participate in politics at
   low rates. What factors might increase youth political participation? We
   investigate one possibility: exposure to a religious message that
   emphasizes the possibility of change through faithful action. We argue
   that this message, which is common in religious groups that attract
   large numbers of youth around the world, addresses several barriers to
   political participation by young voting-age adults. Working in
   collaboration with the major religious coalitions in Zambia, we randomly
   assigned young adults (18-35 years old) into civic engagement workshops.
   Identical informational material, based on pre-existing, non-partisan
   curricula, was presented in each workshop. Workshops then concluded with
   one of two randomly assigned, pre-recorded Christian motivational
   messages based on existing religious programming in Zambia. In some
   workshops, the concluding message emphasized a Christian obligation to
   work towards the greater good. In other workshops, the message
   emphasized the power of faith to make change in the world. We found that
   the power of faith message moved workshop participants to be more
   willing to participate in protest, to disavow political violence, and to
   criticize other people who choose not to participate, relative to
   pre-workshop measures and to an information-only condition. By contrast,
   the message focused on an obligation to the greater good did not change
   political participation, resulting in lower willingness to participate
   in politics than the power of faith message. We discuss implications for
   youth political participation and the study of religion and politics.},

Abstract = {This study aims to explain the role of the economic dimension of Iran's
   foreign policy toward Iraq between 2003 and 2020. The study shows that
   after the U.S. occupation of Iraq in 2003, there were fundamental shifts
   in the structure of Iraqi power and identity and a change in geopolitics
   in the Middle East. The structure of political actors in power has
   shifted from Arab Sunni-Shiite to Shiite-Kurdish, and this has led to
   the transformation of Iraqi identity from an Arab-Sunni political
   identity to Iranian Shiite identity, providing Iran with an opportunity
   for influence and strengthening its regional role in Iraq. The study has
   concluded that since 2003, Iran has been able to expand its dominance
   over the Iraqi regime and the country's economy through its firm policy
   in Iraq by signing agreements and contracts in various productive
   sectors that guarantee a considerable share of Iraq's sovereign wealth.},

Abstract = {We applied Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to responses to items from the
   Activism and Radicalism Intentions Scales (ARIS). In two studies
   (undergraduates n = 530) and prisoners (n = 670), item profiles
   identified four groups - Inert, Moderate Activists, Strong Activists,
   Radicals, and Mixed - that confirm and extend the levels of the Action
   Pyramid of the Two Pyramids Model of Radicalization. Radicals were a
   higher proportion of prisoners than undergraduate respondents (20\% vs.
   12\%), and, among prisoners, Radicals were more likely than other groups
   to be gang members. The distinction between Moderate and Strong
   Activists is a surprising addition to the literature of political
   radicalization, and we suggest in the Discussion that the study of
   Activists, and comparison of Activists and Radicals for the same cause,
   deserve more attention.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions will international compliance-monitoring
   institutions pursue violations of international law? The European
   Commission's infringement procedure is a multi-step process that
   culminates at the Court of Justice of the European Union when a member
   state has allegedly violated European Union law. The Commission,
   however, does not have meaningful enforcement powers, and may
   potentially spend valuable time and resources on a case only for a
   member state to not comply with European Union law. To manage this
   opportunity cost of pursuing other violations of European Union law, I
   argue that the Commission will strategically delay advancing a case
   through the infringement procedure when it anticipates that the
   political conditions will be more favorable for compliance in the
   future. I provide evidence that the Commission delays infringement
   proceedings when it expects the election of a new government that will
   be more likely to comply than the incumbent government.},

   Policy-Making in Autocracies},

Abstract = {The Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) builds on the concepts of timing
   and ambiguity and their effects on the policy process. Since its
   introduction to agenda-setting in the U.S. presidential system, scholars
   have transferred the MSF's core ideas to multiple issue areas, policy
   stages, and political systems. However, what has been lacking so far is
   a thorough discussion of the MSF's travelling capacity to nondemocratic
   forms of government. Building on a brief summary of the MSF's main
   ideas, this article discusses the challenges that policy-making in
   autocracies poses for MSF applications and ways to adapt it to the
   peculiarities that are typical for these regimes. The article focuses on
   the agenda-setting stage in which formal institutions are less important
   and introduces falsifiable hypotheses explaining agenda change. Due to
   tremendous differences regarding the organization of the decision-making
   process in autocratic regimes, the article only sketches out how the MSF
   could be adapted to explain policy change in this institutional setting.
   The article concludes with a discussion of whether the MSF is stretched
   too far by applying it to nondemocratic systems. It turns out that in
   theoretical and conceptual terms, the MSF travels surprisingly well to
   these systems.},

Abstract = {Public diplomacy entails the management of international political
   communication in accordance with the interests of foreign action and
   policy. The discipline originated in the United States, and its school
   of thought and models have influenced a multitude of chancelleries. This
   article investigates the existence of an original and distinct Latin
   American public diplomacy, although it shares the theoretical foundation
   of soft power and international public relations for a global audience.
   It can be concluded that no unique school of Latin American public
   diplomacy exists. There are two trains of thought and foreign
   policy-conservative values and Chavists-which complicates a united
   action. Furthermore, the presidentialism system make the professional
   profile of public diplomacy complex, resulting in delays in the
   development of international communication conducted by chancelleries.},

Abstract = {This article presents an ideational perspective of new institutional
   leadership and applies it to the European Commission's role in the
   policy process concerning the European Union (EU)-Turkey cooperation on
   migration from 2014 to 2016. On a conceptual and methodological level,
   through searching for evidence of the causal mechanism of `strategic
   framing', the article traces how the Commission deployed its ideas in
   the different phases of the policy-making process. This contribution
   feeds into the claim for new institutional leadership by revealing how
   such ideas shaped some of the main policy outcomes in the EU-Turkey
   cooperation during the refugee crisis. The ideational perspective of new
   institutional leadership also suggests that the Juncker Commission's
   `strategic framing' was part of the EU's broader principled realism
   philosophy that led the Commission to take some contestable political
   choices.},

Abstract = {AI and other forms of automation are causing a shift into a more
   capital-intensive form of capitalism. Many scholars have suggested that
   we can best understand this process as the cost-efficient substitution
   of labour by capital in routine tasks based on relative factor costs.
   However, this model, which has cast firms as endlessly chasing the
   productivity frontier, has not paid sufficient attention to
   cross-national divergences in technological changes. This paper builds a
   comparative historical case study tracing the divergent introduction of
   credit scoring in British and German bank branches to argue that the
   introduction of credit scoring was a result of a policy-led process in
   both countries. Increased liberalisation of financial market
   institutions benefitted the rise of market-led banking which
   fundamentally changed the business model of banks resulting in a
   devaluation of the services provided by branch managers. This case
   suggests we need to think about the role of politics and policy within
   our, often deterministic, models of labour-saving technological change.},

Abstract = {Concerned with poor service delivery, a large literature studies
   accountability of politicians to voters. This article instead considers
   accountability relationships within governments-the ability of
   politicians to implement policies by holding bureaucrats responsible for
   their actions. In collaboration with the Ugandan government, I conducted
   a field experiment across 260 local governments. The objective of the
   reform was to empower local politicians to exercise closer oversight
   over the bureaucracy through training and the dissemination of financial
   information. Lowered oversight costs increase politicians' monitoring
   effort and the quality of services, but only in areas where the
   political leadership is not aligned with the dominant party. In areas
   under ruling-party control, politicians fear uncovering mismanagement of
   funds. In contrast to scholars arguing that insulating bureaucrats
   allows them to do their jobs more effectively, these findings imply that
   increased political oversight can improve government responsiveness in
   settings with a modicum of party competition.},

Abstract = {How does an authoritarian past shape voters' left-right orientation?
   Recent studies investigate ``anti-dictator bias{''} in political
   ideology, where citizens in a former right-wing (left-wing) dictatorship
   may display a leftist (rightist) bias in their ideological
   self-identification. In this paper, I provide evidence for a
   ``pro-dictator bias{''} where citizens hold ideological positions close
   to those of the dictator, depending on their experiences prior to
   transition. In countries with high economic growth under dictatorship
   and without violent ruling party ouster, authoritarian successors could
   continue mobilizing the popular base and invoke positive sentiment on
   the past in democratic elections. Such positive sentiment can facilitate
   individual ideological orientation close to the ideological label of the
   former dictatorship. I test this hypothesis by combining individual- and
   country-level data covering 1985 to 2018 from 48 countries. I
   demonstrate that voters in countries with high economic growth during
   dictatorship and without violent party exit are more likely to have
   pro-dictator bias in ideology. I further show that voters in former
   developmental states show pro-dictator bias from the history of economic
   growth and more peaceful transition. The findings emphasize the role of
   pre-transition features in shaping alternative legacies on voter
   attitudes in post-authoritarian societies.},

Abstract = {Little is known about whether and under which conditions populist
   radical right parties' (PRRPs') nativist welfare politics matters to the
   voters. I address this gap in the research and test the argument that
   the electoral appeal of this electoral discourse varies among welfare
   regimes. The study compares the conservative and social-democratic
   welfare regimes and focuses on the vote choices of the two core
   constituencies of PRRPs - economically exposed and immigration-sceptic
   voters. The results show that these electorates support PRRPs' nativist
   welfare positions for very different reasons in the two welfare regimes.
   First, in the conservative regime, economically exposed citizens vote
   for PRRPs, the more they stress nativism and welfare expansion. By
   contrast, in the social-democratic regime this group of voters is more
   likely to support positions combining nativism and dismantled welfare
   benefits. Second, immigrant-sceptic voters in the social-democratic
   regime support PRRPs who pledge to preserve the welfare state, and
   increased migration considerably boosts the probability that they do so.
   By contrast, this group of voters in the conservative regime is more
   likely to support PRRPs who seek to partly dismantle the welfare state,
   and the inflow of immigrants is unrelated to these choices. These
   results have important implications and suggest that welfare regimes
   moderate public opinion differently in the current age of populism
   compared to previous eras.},

Abstract = {While research documents that some migrants leave their country of
   origin for political reasons, we do not know how the political factors
   in the host-country matter to explain immigrants' (im-)mobility
   behaviours after an initial migration. Addressing this gap, this study
   explores noncitizens' (im-)mobility responses to regional integration
   policies. Building on the evidence that inclusive policies foster
   immigrants' ties to the host-country over time, the paper argues that
   effective exposure to inclusive policies decreases inter-cantonal and
   international mobility, i.e. increases noncitizens' immobility. To test
   this, we run multilevel analyses using STATPOP register data on the
   entire immigrant resident population of Switzerland, and cantonal
   integration policy data. Findings reveal that inclusive policies do
   indeed amplify the sedentary effect of time spent in Switzerland, and,
   thus, increase noncitizens' immobility. This pattern holds true for
   international and inter-cantonal mobility, and is most pronounced among
   vulnerable immigrants, i.e. non-EU citizens holding a less-stable legal
   permit.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has upended global trade. Production patterns have
   shifted, with widely publicised impacts on supply chains and a stark
   reduction in the trade in services that involve the movement of people,
   such as travel and tourism. While the global economy faltered and New
   Zealand's services trade all but evaporated, the country's agricultural
   exports remained robust. How has this strong performance in the face of
   adverse conditions shaped the public depiction of agricultural
   producers, who had previously faced a change in government and growing
   public criticism around agriculture's environmental impact? I expect the
   export performance of agricultural producers to have resulted in a more
   positive public depiction. Quantitative text analysis of news media data
   supports this view. The average sentiment in news media about
   agriculture has improved over the course of the pandemic. This is not
   just a product of cheery reporting about export performance: I report a
   positive trend for articles relating to agriculture and the environment,
   the very issue that has been most contentious in recent years. COVID-19
   has seemed an unexpected boon for agricultural producers, the public
   depiction of whom has been strengthened on the back of their
   contributions to New Zealand's export economy.},

Abstract = {This paper considers a messaging strategy to shift immigration
   preferences, arguing that if citizen attitudes in this issue-area build
   from several dimensions, then a positive message related to each
   dimension should move attitudes in a more favorable direction. It tests
   the first part using original survey data with directly comparable
   questions about whether immigration hurts/helps American culture/the
   economy/national security, providing evidence that all three dimensions
   currently support the preferences of voting-age citizens. It tests the
   second part by randomly presenting another sample with different
   messages about how labor immigration strengthens national security,
   creates new jobs, or enhances culture, finding that all three reduce
   anti-immigration attitudes with significant effects even within groups
   that are more opposed to immigration (namely, white Americans, those
   with less education, and partisan Republicans).},

Abstract = {External power competition in the Horn of Africa is intensifying. In
   recent years, the US and China, as well as regionally powerful states
   such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE and Qatar, have all deepened their
   involvement in the sub-region. This has opened new opportunities for
   state and non-state actors in the Horn to gain influence through
   financial and material resources by associating themselves with external
   powers. Somaliland is one such actor. In the current scenario,
   Hargeisa's increasingly sophisticated foreign policy has enabled it to
   step up its quest for international recognition and development. In this
   article, Aleksi Ylonen discusses the increasing contestation of
   influence among external powers in the Horn of Africa and Somaliland's
   position in this changing regional context.},

Abstract = {This essay explores Fikret Adaman and Pat Devine's position that
   democratic planning would expand human autonomy. It argues that economic
   democracy involving workplace democracy, private property, and
   widespread markets would generally be more autonomy enhancing than a
   system of democratic planning with social ownership and few markets.
   However, it acknowledges the problems ecological limits may place on the
   autonomy of future populations, making the choice between democratic
   planning and economic democracy more ambiguous.},

Abstract = {Comparative analyses of party policy diffusion are only just emerging.
   To better understand the conditions under which diffusion occurs, this
   article argues that three heuristics - availability, representativeness
   and anchoring - shape parties' efforts to gather information (from
   elsewhere), leading to differing diffusion effects. The study
   operationalizes the outcome as textual similarity of party manifestos in
   nineteen Western democracies from 1960 to 2016, applying a text-as-data
   approach and machine translation. Analyzing dyads, it assesses how
   commonalities and sender/receiver attributes impact diffusion. It finds
   that there is little room for cross-border diffusion as successful
   parties stick to their old program. Beyond the still-prevailing domestic
   context, `learning from cultural reference groups' in a region is most
   important. In addition, diffusion appears within EP factions and
   transnational party organizations independently of the success/loss of
   the sender. The analysis thus sheds light on (un-)favorable conditions
   for party policy diffusion and paves the way for future studies applying
   machine translation and quantitative text analyses.},

Abstract = {Many states have become concerned with Russian cyberattacks and online
   propaganda. The Ukrainian government responded to the information threat
   in 2017 by blocking access to several Russian websites, including
   VKontakte, one of the most popular social media websites in Ukraine. By
   exploiting a natural experiment in Ukraine, I find that the sudden
   censorship policy reduced activity on VKontakte, despite the fact that a
   vast majority of the users were legally and technically able to bypass
   the ban. Users with strong political and social affiliations to Russia
   were at least as likely to be affected by the ban as those with weak
   affiliations. I argue that the ease of access to online media-not
   political attitudes toward the state-was the main mechanism behind the
   users' response to the ban. These findings suggest that this pragmatic
   view on the effects of censorship holds, even in the highly politicized
   military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which later evolved into a
   full-scale Russian invasion.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, a large number of extremist and hate groups have
   turned to internet platforms to inspire mass violence. Currently, there
   is little reliable evidence on how such campaigns radicalize targeted
   audiences. We provide systematic, large-scale, microevidence on the
   effect of Islamic State propaganda on social media. We use several
   machine learning algorithms to detect recruitment messages in online
   propaganda, identify their dissemination on Twitter, and quantify the
   reactions of exposed users. Analyzing content produced by the Islamic
   State between 2015 and 2016 shows that propaganda conveying the
   material, spiritual, and social benefits of joining ISIS increased
   online support for the group, while content displaying brutal violence
   decreased endorsement of ISIS across a wide range of videos. Only the
   group's most extreme supporters reacted positively to violent
   propaganda.},

Abstract = {The term `Westminster model' is frequently used by political scientists
   and practitioners. But our recent examination (Russell and Serban 2021),
   published in this journal, uncovered wide variation in how it is defined
   demonstrating that it is more `muddle' than `model'. This sparked a
   response article from Flinders et al. (2021), which we in turn respond
   to in this piece. We briefly revisit our initial research questions,
   methodology and findings, before reflecting on their analysis. We
   emphasize that, notwithstanding the critics' negative tone, we and they
   agree on certain fundamentals. In particular on our original central
   point, that the `Westminster model' is an ill-defined term with a long
   history, which mostly makes it unsuited to positivist comparative
   political science research. While the `Westminster model' may have some
   valid vestigial uses, within the UK political system, or as an object of
   study for interpretivist political science, it does not provide a
   rigorous basis for case selection and comparative political science
   analysis.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the effect of economic growth on executive
   elections in the context of a multilevel governance structure and how
   party ties across federal, state, and local levels affect the
   relationship, using data from Brazilian municipalities. We test the
   hypothesis that the president is the main politician accountable for
   economic performance, measured by local growth, and that party politics
   moderates the evaluation of the economic performance of state governors
   and the president. Our research shows that there is a high degree of
   interdependence between levels of government in the evaluation of
   economic performance. We highlight how party alliances strongly moderate
   the economic performance effects at the different levels. Using
   aggregate local level-municipality panel data and fixed effects
   estimations, we show that the previous year's economic growth positively
   impacts the percentage of votes obtained by the incumbent in the
   presidential elections and that those effects are higher in states whose
   governors are allied to the president.},

   feelings about receiving this great honor. I experienced all of those
   emotions in full measure. I must begin by sincerely thanking the
   American Political Science Association (APSA) Public Administration
   Section for conferring the 2021 John Gaus Award on me and by saying how
   much it means to me. Looking at the list of previous John Gaus Award
   winners, I am indeed awed to be included in their number. There are so
   many names whose work I have deeply admired and others whom I have known
   quite well. Just three examples are George Frederickson, Vincent Ostrom,
   and Aaron Wildavsky, all of whom were extraordinarily kind and generous
   to me and greatly influenced my work. I only wish they were still here
   so I could thank them for all they did for me. The same is true for
   other now-departed mentors, including Mary Douglas, Andrew Dunsire, and
   Bill Mackenzie, to mention only a few.},

Title = {Exploring climate change discourses across five Australian federal
   elections},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {161-180},

Abstract = {It is clear that transitioning towards environmental sustainability
   requires a strong and sustained effort to address climate change.
   However, despite high levels of public concern about climate change, it
   has remained a highly politicised and hotly contested issue in
   Australia, and Australia's climate change policy remains inadequate and
   ineffective. Climate change first emerged as a key election issue in
   Australia's 2007 federal election and remained a highly contentious
   issue in the 2010 election. Although climate change was much less
   prominent during the 2013 and 2016 election campaigns, it re-emerged as
   a major election issue in 2019. This paper uses critical discourse
   analysis to identify and trace climate change discourses in the media
   through these five federal election campaigns. It explores the main
   arguments, actors, and discursive strategies associated with two key
   discourses, how climate change was constructed during each campaign, and
   the implications of these constructions for the development of
   Australia's climate change policy. It is argued that while the discourse
   of climate change activism has put climate change firmly on the national
   agenda, the discourse of climate change denialism has contributed to
   stymieing the development of effective climate change policy in
   Australia.},

Abstract = {After the Civil War, congressional Republicans used sweeping powers to
   expand and enforce civil rights for African Americans. Though the
   electoral benefits of African American suffrage were clear, Republicans
   had to overcome party divisions and racist voters. This paper argues
   that the war imbued Northern veterans with the belief that true victory
   required renewing the Union by abolishing slavery and establishing
   (imperfect) legal equality. This made veterans more receptive to Radical
   Reconstruction and ignited activism for it from below. Using
   difference-in-differences, I show that greater enlistment increased
   Republican vote share, particularly in pivotal postwar elections.
   Moreover, ``as-if{''} random exposure to combat deaths increased
   Republican partisanship among soldiers after the war. Finally, I show
   that veterans became more likely to vote for African American suffrage.
   The paper concludes that Union veterans, through their votes and their
   activism, were a decisive part of the white coalition that backed
   America's ``Second Revolution.{''}},

Abstract = {How do citizens form evaluations of the economy? Defining features of
   advanced capitalism like income inequality and labor market dualization
   present a challenge for assessing the health of the economy based on a
   small set of macroeconomic indicators. This is particularly true for
   those whose proximity to poverty and precarious labor market position is
   not always reflected in the official unemployment rate. For those
   individuals, socio-economic segregation and the geographic concentration
   of poverty mean that information on poverty is more accessible and more
   salient than information on macroeconomic indicators which needs to be
   explicitly sought out. Poverty risk thus shapes how individuals evaluate
   the economy: at-risk individuals are less likely to rely on conventional
   indicators of growth and unemployment and more likely to allocate
   attention to the poverty rate. Analyses of public opinion data from 27
   countries provide support for this argument. We further show that those
   at risk of poverty know less about economic performance by standard
   economic indicators but offer more accurate estimates of national
   poverty rates. These novel findings underline the need to depart from
   familiar indicators and address how unequal economies structure
   preferences and policy responses.},

   analyses on four elections from 2000 to 2008 using a decade's worth of
   data from the Canadian Election Study. The local candidate effect first
   uncovered by Blais et al. is not specific to a single election. Local
   candidates are a decisive consideration for about 5 to 8 per cent of
   voters outside Quebec and for about 2 to 5 per cent of voters in Quebec.},

Title = {Are `carrots' better than `sticks'? New EU conditionality and social
   investment policies in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy
   and Spain},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article asks whether the novel EU approach to member states'
   economic adjustment strategies constitutes a `social investment turn' by
   the Italian and Spanish welfare states. The analytical framework
   combines insights from different strands of the literature on policy
   change, in particular those devoted to policy legacies and to
   policy-making `conditionings' (constraints and facilitators). The study
   assesses the extent of social investment, as advocated by EU
   country-specific recommendations, of the set of measures introduced to
   fight the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and of
   programmatic documents issued by the Italian and Spanish executives,
   such as the State Budget Laws for 2021 and National Recovery and
   Resilience Plans. In order to evaluate the impact of new conditionality
   on policy outputs, the article then turns to consider the economic,
   social and policy legacies of the previous economic crisis and what
   would have been the prospects for a social investment turn in the
   absence of Next Generation EU funding. Conclusions show that, at least
   at the level of intentions, `carrots' seem to be working better than
   `sticks' on the quest for more intense social investment in Italy and
   Spain.},

Abstract = {The American knowledge economy (AKE) is not a foreordained transition in
   the organization of economic production, nor is it a form of political
   economy shaped predominately by the political demands of highly educated
   workers. It is a politically generated consensus for producing economic
   prosperity and economic advantage over other nations in which
   intellectual property (IP), and the businesses that produce it, play a
   leading role. The history of AKE development reveals as much. In the
   AKE's formative period, from 1980 to 1994, IP producers and a faction of
   neoliberal Democrats (the ``Atari Democrats{''}), not decisive
   middle-class voters, played a pivotal role in reconfiguring institutions
   of American political economy to hasten the AKE transition. Their vision
   of AKE development inherently complicated the Democratic Party's
   attitude toward rising market power and continues to shape contemporary
   disputes within the party over antitrust enforcement and the validity of
   the AKE project itself.},

Abstract = {Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain went several times to the polls during
   the 2010-2019 decade. It was a period characterised by the strenuous
   effort to recover the economic situation before the onset of the Great
   Recession; an effort, however, often constrained by externally imposed
   austerity policies, and by a refugee crisis that contributed to the
   growing salience of the immigration issue. The article adopts an
   original sub-national approach to examine if and how the economic
   situation and the incidence of immigration affected the electoral
   outcomes in the four South-European countries. Adopting a theory of
   retrospective behaviour, the research reported in the article confirms
   the association between employment and immigration levels, on the one
   hand, and punishment of the incumbent government on the other. However,
   the electoral effects of immigration are conditioned by the partisan
   composition of the government and, under centre-right cabinets, are
   aggravated by a negative economic conjuncture.},

Abstract = {An important challenge facing political decision making today is
   inequality in representation. Political scientists have shown that the
   preferences of certain groups-especially those who have higher incomes
   or are better educated-systematically preponderate in political decision
   making. Trying to elucidate the mechanisms behind these findings, this
   research note explores one specific possible driver of representational
   inequality: that politicians downplay the opinions of disadvantaged
   groups, and here specifically, of the lower-educated. By means of a
   survey experiment with politicians, we test the idea that politicians
   have a hard-wired inclination to assume that the opinions of citizens
   who have received lower (i.e., vocational) education are less thoughtful
   than the opinions of citizens who followed a higher (i.e., general)
   education. The findings are somewhat ambiguous but the expectation is at
   least partly corroborated by the evidence. The findings illustrate the
   psychological foundations that may ultimately make politicians disregard
   the preferences of the lower-educated.},

Abstract = {Experts agree that vaccination is the most effective way to bring the
   COVID-19 pandemic under control. Nevertheless, vaccination rates have
   slowed nationwide and substantial segments of the population report an
   unwillingness to get vaccinated. We conducted an online survey
   experiment to investigate whether endorsement messages from various
   types of leaders can encourage the unvaccinated population to receive
   the vaccine. We surveyed 709 unvaccinated registered voters in South
   Dakota in April 2021 and presented them with identical messages
   endorsing vaccination from a political, religious, or medical leader.
   Our results show that messaging from a religious leader had a positive
   and statistically significant effect on interest in getting vaccinated,
   whereas messages from a political or medical leader had no statistically
   significant effect. These results strongly suggest that religious
   leaders are more effective messengers than other potential messengers
   and that public health officials would be well served to coordinate
   their efforts with leaders in faith communities.},

Abstract = {This study examines the role played by the Hong Kong crisis in the
   outcome of the 2020 Taiwanese presidential election. Using the original
   data from a two-wave panel survey, we present solid evidence showing
   that the effect of cross-strait relations on voting behaviour in Taiwan
   is certainly complex and intricate. This study finds that greater
   optimism about Taiwan's future is conducive to the Democratic
   Progressive Party's chance of winning the election. However, when
   Taiwanese voters takes into consideration the Hong Kong crisis, it is
   found that greater optimism about Taiwan's future helps relatively more
   the Kuomintang. Thus, this study deepens our understanding of the role
   of the cross-strait relations in shaping electoral behaviour in Taiwan
   for presidential elections.},

Abstract = {In the 2019 Swiss federal elections, women's representation increased
   more than at any time before, reaching an all-time high at 42\%. In this
   article, we offer several explanations for this. First, in almost all
   parties, the percentage of female candidates was significantly larger
   than in the previous elections. Second, on average female candidates
   held better positions on party lists, both compared to men and to the
   previous election. Third, in 2019 (but not in 2015) women were about one
   percentage-point more likely to be elected than men, controlling for
   many relevant factors. Fourth, about one third of the surge was linked
   to the fact that parties that won seats in 2019 (the Greens, especially)
   had more women on their lists compared to the parties that lost seats.
   Fifth, in 2019 voters (women in particular) perceived female candidates
   as more fit for a political office compared to 2015.},

   proces in Catalonia, while Catalans' different emotional architectures
   are also examined based on their position on the proces, their voting
   orientation and their temporary period of ascription to the independence
   movement. A quantitatively oriented methodological approach has been
   used to develop this research. As a result, a descriptive analysis is
   carried out that observes: a) Catalans' emotional component towards
   leaders and parties; b) the way how the different emotional regimes are
   articulated; and c) the relationship they establish with the
   independence process.},

Abstract = {Richard Bellamy's new book A Republican Europe of States represents one
   of the strongest recent defenses of the so-called demoicratic approach
   to the European Union. This paper situates Bellamy's argument in the
   broader normative architecture of European Studies. It then raises some
   skeptical objections about the viability of a European demoicracy in a
   G2 world - a world where the United States and China are the dominant
   powers. Lurking behind these skeptical objections is the worry that the
   EU in its current form lacks the power to protect its own political and
   economic interests, and Bellamy's demoicratic reforms would simply make
   this situation worse.},

Abstract = {How were the most underprivileged women mobilized after suffrage? Newly
   enfranchised women faced a multitude of barriers to voting, and this was
   especially the case for working-class women. We theorize that
   working-class women were more likely to acquire civic attitudes and
   information through ties with neighbors of the same class than
   working-class men or privileged classes. Working-class women's typical
   employment and domestic responsibilities provided the most
   opportunities, motivation, and need for local networks, while limiting
   the opportunities to acquire political resources via outside employment
   or voluntary associations typically available to other social groups.
   Utilizing an original dataset of individual voting records in a
   mid-sized industrial city during interwar period in Sweden, we employ a
   difference-in-differences design that isolates neighbor effects from
   confounders at the individual level. Consistent with our argument, we
   find that class homogeneity of neighbors enhanced working-class women's
   turnout, but not that of privileged classes and working-class men.},

Abstract = {By exploring the operation of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) since
   its rise to power in 1949, this article demonstrates how a
   non-democratic regime maintains its legitimacy. While previous studies
   have shed light on the CCP's sources of legitimacy, few abundantly and
   comparatively discuss the different forms of legitimacy and how
   legitimacy changes over time in a non-democratic state. This study
   addresses these gaps by analyzing how the CCP's operational principles
   change over time, including changes in sources and forms of legitimacy.
   This study uses different frameworks of legitimacy to facilitate the
   comparison of changes in legitimacy of different leadership generations,
   and also demonstrates the specification of legitimacy of the CCP from
   different perspectives. By comparing the sources and forms of legitimacy
   of different generations of regime leaders, this study demonstrates that
   after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, the CCP regime lacked substantial
   legitimacy based on political participation, and thus emphasized
   instrumental legitimacy based on economic development instead. Using
   process tracing to analyze policy changes, this study argues that
   different CCP leadership generations employed different sources and
   forms of legitimacy to maintain regime support.},

Abstract = {In autocratic-leaning countries, the level of genuine public support for
   ruling parties and reasons driving it are often unclear. While such
   parties often rely on violence, electoral manipulation, and corruption
   to help maintain power, maintaining legitimate popularity is the ideal.
   Parties that emerged from national liberation struggles and other
   extraordinary events are thought to have developed strong branding and
   organizational structures. This paper tests the determinants of ruling
   party identification among Zimbabweans through seven geo-coded rounds of
   Afrobarometer data. First, genuine ruling party support is estimated to
   be exaggerated in public opinion surveys, but not insignificant. The
   ruling party's base of support is centered in rural areas that
   experienced the greatest concentration of guerrilla activity during the
   liberation war. Respondents from the liberation generation are also more
   likely to support the ruling party, and view the party as tied to
   nationalism. The liberation war generated and solidified ruling party
   stronghold areas through democratic advantages such as nationalistic
   branding and robust party organization structures as well as autocratic
   tools such as the capture of traditional leaders, politicization of the
   military, and the use of violence against dissidents.},

Abstract = {Do United States Supreme Court decisions on LGBT rights shape attitudes
   towards LGBT individuals among the mass public? In this paper, I conduct
   an empirical test of the effect of quasi-random exposure to the
   announcement of Bostock v. Clayton County-a landmark case which held
   that an employer who fires their employee because of their sexual
   orientation or gender identity violates Section VII of the 1964 Civil
   Rights Act-on favorability towards LGBT individuals. Relying on data
   from Phase 2 of the Democracy Fund/UCLA Nationscape survey, I find that
   quasi-random exposure to the announcement of Bostock engendered
   increases in favorability towards LGBT individuals among the wider
   American public. Subgroup analyses also indicate that the largest
   increases in favorability were among Democratic partisans and the
   religiously unaffiliated, while minimal changes in favorability were
   detected among those who are among the most likely to oppose LGBT
   rights, including Republicans and Evangelical Protestants. The findings
   speak to the validity of the legitimacy model and highlight the
   limitations of the backlash model in the post-Obergefell era of public
   opinion towards LGBT rights.},

Abstract = {Understanding sources of judicial bias is essential for establishing due
   process. To date, theories of judicial decision making are rooted in
   ranked societies with majority-minority group cleavages, leaving
   unanswered which groups are more prone to express bias and whether it is
   motivated by in-group favoritism or out-group hostility. We examine
   judicial bias in Kenya, a diverse society that features a more complex
   ethnic landscape. While research in comparative and African politics
   emphasizes instrumental motivations underpinning ethnic identity, we
   examine the psychological, implicit biases driving judicial outcomes.
   Using data from Kenyan criminal appeals and the conditional random
   assignment of judges to cases, we show that judges are 3 to 5 percentage
   points more likely to grant coethnic appeals than non-coethnic appeals.
   To understand mechanisms, we use word embeddings to analyze the
   sentiment of written judgments. Judges use more trust-related terms
   writing for coethnics, suggesting that in-group favoritism motivates
   coethnic bias in this context.},

Abstract = {With its micro-level perspective, this article addresses a gap in the
   literature on democracy support. The study focuses on the analysis of
   eight national international party assistance (IPA) providers and their
   penchant for tame, regime-compatible support, based on data gathered in
   more than fifty qualitative interviews with practitioners, experts,
   policymakers and government analysts over a 4-year period (2015-2018).
   Structured around the four factors that distinguish national IPA
   providers - objectives, organizational model, financial scale and modes
   of intervention - as well as provider age, the analysis centres on the
   role played by survival-seeking behaviour when providers opt for tame
   assistance, with a view to identify variation between the vulnerable and
   less vulnerable NGOs. The study finds that, while survival-seeking
   behaviour often plays a role, it is frequently not the main factor
   driving tame assistance, even amongst those providers whose survival is
   most at stake. Rather, drivers of tame assistance vary from case to
   case, habitually involving one or more of the following factors:
   institutional set-up, branding and growth. Thus, if the sector is to
   move away from tame assistance, we need to look beyond macro-level
   factors and also focus on ameliorating institutional constraints and the
   factors that shape agency at the micro-level.},

Abstract = {Why are we failing the environment and our ethico-ontological
   relationships? I engage Anthropocene studies scholars (for example,
   Chakrabarty), geologists, environmental-ontologists (for example,
   Arianne Francois Conty) to understand human arguments for a hopeful
   future. While some argue hope, we are continually reminded, by the very
   scholars giving us hope, that we are failing. I argue an ontological
   repositioning as a means of saying ``fuck-it{''} in the face of death in
   order to accept human failure as a positive movement out of the shadow
   of the nihilistic eternal recurrence of hope. Turning to Arthur Kroker
   and Heidegger, we can understand why hope as a product of the will can
   never be anything but a ``will of will:{''} aimlessness. Jairus Grove's
   work on political pessimism gives us a frame of reference for turning to
   do otherwise. I derive this project from Thom van Dooren's question:
   ``Should we rape the Whooping Cranes to save them from extinction?{''}},

Abstract = {This article analyses the `Unteilbar coalition for an open and plural
   society' in Germany, as an emblematic case to advance scholarship on
   cross-movement coalition-building and intersectionality in social
   movement studies. We argue that migration-related polarisation and an
   accentuated threat of rising far-right mobilisation has provided a
   context for progressive social movement organisations in Germany to
   converge and to engage in a particular kind of boundary spanning. The
   organisations involved have actively constructed an intersectional
   variant of `political solidarity' by interlocking diverse
   socio-political struggles - explicitly moving beyond the topic of
   migration. In contrast to the common understanding of heterogeneous
   coalitions, being both challenging and prone to fragmentation, we argue
   that the boundary spanning work performed during Unteilbar has resulted
   in the outcome of a sustainable mobilisation capacity, and a fostering
   of movement solidarity rooted in an `intersectional consciousness'.},

Abstract = {Research on political style suggests that where women make arguments
   that are more emotional, empathetic and positive, men use language that
   is more analytical, aggressive and complex. However, existing work does
   not consider how gendered patterns of style vary over time. Focusing on
   the UK, we argue that pressures for female politicians to conform to
   stereotypically `feminine' styles have diminished in recent years. To
   test this argument, we describe novel quantitative text-analysis
   approaches for measuring a diverse set of styles at scale in political
   speech data. Analysing UK parliamentary debates between 1997 and 2019,
   we show that the debating styles of female MPs have changed
   substantially over time, as women in Parliament have increasingly
   adopted stylistic traits that are typically associated with `masculine'
   stereotypes of communication. Our findings imply that prominent
   gender-based stereotypes of politicians' behaviour are significantly
   worse descriptors of empirical reality now than they were in the past.},

Title = {The Curious Case of Theresa May and the Public That Did Not Rally:
   Gendered Reactions to Terrorist Attacks Can Cause Slumps Not Bumps},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {116},

Abstract = {Terrorist attacks routinely produce rallies for incumbent men in the
   executive office. With scarce cases, there has been little consideration
   of terrorism's consequences for evaluations of sitting women executives.
   Fusing research on rallies with scholarship on women in politics, we
   derive a gender-revised framework wherein the public will be less
   inclined to rally around women when terrorists attack. A critical case
   is UK Prime Minister Theresa May, a right-leaning incumbent with
   security experience. Employing a natural experiment, we demonstrate that
   the public fails to rally after the 2017 Manchester Arena attack.
   Instead, evaluations of May decrease, with sharp declines among those
   holding negatives views about women. We further show May's party loses
   votes in areas closer to the attack. We then find support for the
   argument in a multinational test. We conclude that conventional theory
   on rally events requires revision: women leaders cannot count on rallies
   following major terrorist attacks.},

Abstract = {Civic duty is a critical feature of explanations of political
   participation, but why do individuals differ in their propensity to
   adopt particular civic duty norms? We argue that norms are likely to be
   adopted when congruent with underlying values and support this
   contention using evidence from the European Social Survey. We show that
   individuals who prioritize self-transcendence values (which capture
   altruistic goals) place much greater emphasis on norms positively
   related to participation while individuals who prioritize conservation
   values (which capture goals related to social stability) place much less
   emphasis on these norms. The substantive influence of personal values in
   explaining norm adoption is greater than that of education, age, and
   interpersonal trust. Our results thus provide new insights into how
   citizens form their normative conceptions of citizenship and also
   highlight the substantive role played by value orientations in
   conformity to social norms more generally.},

Title = {When the US far-right sneezes, the European far-right catches a cold.
   Quasi-experimental evidence of electoral contagion from Spain},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Does the electoral defeat of a far-right party abroad influence support
   for similar parties at home? In this paper we posit, and test, the
   theoretical argument that signals of viability and popularity akin to
   bandwagon and titanic effects operate beyond the confines of national
   boundaries to cause voters to update domestic preferences based on
   comparable party performance abroad. By exploiting the
   quasi-experimental setting provided by the coincidental timing of Donald
   Trump's 2020 electoral defeat with the Spanish sociological study's
   monthly barometer data collection, we provide robust causal evidence to
   show that Trump's electoral loss in the US had a negative contagious
   spillover effect on self-reported support for the Spanish far-right.
   Empirically we estimate intent-to-treat effects based on the as good as
   random exposure to the electoral results to isolate the impact of
   Trump's defeat on the voting intentions for Spain's new far-right party,
   VOX. Our results - which are robust to various modelling approaches
   including covariate adjustment, regional fixed effects, placebo issues,
   and nearest-neighbour matching - demonstrate that Trump's defeat to Joe
   Biden had a sizeable negative effect on expressed support for VOX. The
   contagion effect is substantive: equal to 3 to 6 percentage-points among
   the general population and 11 percentage-points among former right-wing
   voters. Our findings make an important contribution to the broader
   literature on electoral behaviour as they indicate that the electoral
   success of ideologically symmetrical parties abroad can play a role in
   understanding a party's domestic success by serving as an important
   information signal of these parties' electoral viability.},

Abstract = {The present article aims to analyse the impact of pilgrim tourism on
   bilateral relations and to identify the mediating effect of
   people-to-people contact. It further proposes to test the framework
   empirically in the neighbouring context of India and Nepal. To achieve
   the objective, random sampling is used, and 380 usable questionnaires
   are taken for testing the theoretical framework. Structural Equation
   Modelling (SEM) is used to assess the framework's fit and analyse the
   impact of pilgrim tourism on bilateral diplomatic relations while using
   people-to-people contact as a mediating variable. The study findings
   reveal that pilgrim tourism has a direct impact on improving the
   bilateral diplomatic relationship between India and Nepal. It also shows
   that people-to-people contact between India and Nepal acts as a
   mediating variable between pilgrim tourism and bilateral diplomacy. In a
   vast country like India, which shares a border with many nations,
   pilgrim tourism and people-to-people contact have great potential to
   remove barriers and increase bilateral treaties for better development
   of the nation. The present research developed a measurement instrument
   about bilateral relations from the stakeholder's perspective. It also
   proposed a structural model to elucidate the relationships between
   pilgrim tourism, people-to-people contact and bilateral diplomacy.},

Abstract = {Since Iran's revolution in 1979, relations between Washington and Tehran
   have been invariably fraught. The Trump presidency saw escalating
   tensions which the Biden administration has sought to moderate with
   uncertain results. This article locates contemporary events within a
   broader analysis of US policy towards Iran, which for over four decades
   has oscillated between attempted rapprochement and hostility
   short-of-war. Seeking to explain the fluctuation and failures of US
   policy, it shows how two intersecting logics have shaped and constrained
   the decision-making environment - path dependent at the international
   level, cyclical at the domestic level. Going beyond accounts which treat
   domestic constraints in an ad hoc manner, the article explores how the
   electoral cycle systematically shapes decision-makers' ability to
   respond to geopolitical conditions. Shedding light on contemporary
   policy debates, it concludes that any lasting departure from the default
   posture of hostility will require a favourable alignment of conditions
   on both levels.},

Abstract = {What impacts people's willingness to restrict the civil liberties of
   suspected terrorists? For decades, social scientists have studied the
   dynamics that shape political tolerance, and increasingly, scholars
   examine the effects of terrorism for people's willingness to limit civil
   liberties in pursuit of security. We argue that the social
   categorization of a suspected terrorist (e.g., White Nationalist or
   Islamic Fundamentalist) is consequential for civil liberty attitudes in
   the United States, but, importantly, we theorize that the effects are
   contingent on partisanship. We implement question-wording experiments in
   four surveys. Three of the studies are comprised of national samples
   implemented at different points in time; a fourth sample incorporates a
   targeted sample of U.S. military servicemembers. We find evidence that
   partisanship moderates the effects of terrorist categorization such that
   Republicans are less likely to restrict the civil liberties of White
   Nationalists than unspecified suspected terrorists. By contrast,
   Democrats are more inclined to restrict the civil liberties of White
   Nationalists. At times, partisanship also moderates the effects of an
   Islamic Fundamentalist categorization. The study has implications for
   political tolerance, partisanship, and attitudes toward terrorism in
   contemporary politics.},

Abstract = {This article problematises the proliferation of European Union (EU)
   agencies with operational tasks as a new phenomenon capturing the
   exercise of joint sovereignty in European integration. While joint
   decision-making has been a feature of EU politics for decades, joint
   sovereignty is a broader category that additionally involves the
   creation of EU bodies able to intervene `on the ground' alongside
   national public actors. We argue that the choice for joint sovereignty
   opens a Pandora's box of implementation deficiencies which undermine the
   ability of both national and supranational actors to conduct operational
   activities effectively. We subsequently identify two frequent
   dysfunctions in policy implementation and connect them to ambiguity and
   conflict at the decision-making stage. Empirically, we illustrate the
   systemic link between decision-making and implementation problems in the
   functioning of two agencies with operational tasks active in the fields
   of border management (Frontex) and police cooperation (Europol).},

Abstract = {Across disciplines and contexts, scholars vary in their conception of
   politicization. This variation reveals a need for more consistent
   concept definition and measurement of the extent to which politics
   influence administration. We engage this need by providing a typology of
   politicization that includes consideration of the actions of elected
   offwials, political appointees, and merit-based administrators. We then
   assess dynamic differences across the typology in the United States
   using personnel records spanning four decades, measures of insulation
   derived from statutory language, and three surveys of senior federal
   executives. Our analysis provides a research agenda for scholars who
   seek to examine the politicization of the executive branch.},

Abstract = {There is a direct relationship between epistemology and one's attitude
   toward those with whom one disagrees. Those who think that the truth is
   difficult to ascertain can be expected, other things equal, to tend to
   tolerate (in the sense of sympathizing with) those with whom they
   disagree, as the blameless victims of an opaque reality. Those who think
   that the truth is easy to ascertain can be expected, other things equal,
   to tend to be intolerant (in the sense of being unsympathetic) toward
   those with whom they disagree, who perversely refuse to acknowledge what
   should be clear to any well-intentioned inquirer. However, these
   tendencies toward tolerant or intolerant attitudes can be offset by
   other factors; and they do not, in any case, necessarily dictate whether
   one will favor tolerant or intolerant policies regarding those toward
   whom one feels tolerant or intolerant. The complex relationship between
   epistemology, tolerant or intolerant attitudes, and tolerant or
   intolerant policies is evident in the thought of prominent early-modern
   Protestant theologians who, under the pressure of rampant and violent
   religious disagreement, theorized tolerance.},

Abstract = {This paper explains the configuration of the political scenario in
   Ecuador after the 2021 general elections. The pandemic left a
   challenging economic and social aftermath that created policy challenges
   for the new government. Guillermo Lasso won the elections securing
   support from the anticorreismo front. However, this electoral coalition
   did not translate into the legislative arena. Lasso addressed policy
   challenges using political strategies widely used in Ecuador by minority
   governments during the nineties. We focus on Lasso's attempts to push
   economic reforms to show how his legislative strategy adapted to the
   prevailing political conditions, namely: 1) aimed for less ambitious
   policy goals; 2) used his institutional prerogatives to shape the
   legislative agenda; and, 3) crafted short-lived and informal agreements
   in exchange for (political) pork. Complex executive-legislative
   relations can limit the government's ability to address economic and
   social problems in the future, which could lead to political and
   economic instability, as in the past. De facto coalitions are necessary
   for Lasso yet come at a cost for a government quickly losing support. We
   also provide an overview of other social problems and policy responses
   relevant throughout this year.},

   AL-DDoS Attacks Detection},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CYBER WARFARE AND TERRORISM},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are one of the main threats
   to information security. The purpose of DDoS attacks at the network (IP)
   and transport (TCP) layers is to consume the network bandwidth and deny
   service to legitimate users of the target system. Application layer DDoS
   attacks (AL-DDoS) can be organized against many different applications.
   Many of these attacks target HTTP, in which case their goal is to
   deplete the resources of web services. Various schemes have been
   proposed to detect DDoS attacks on network and transport layers. There
   are very few works being done to detect AL-DDoS attacks. The development
   of an intelligent system automatically detecting AL-DDoS attacks in
   advance is very necessary. In this paper to detect AL-DDoS attacks a
   deep learning model based on the convolutional neural network is
   proposed. To simulate the AL-DDoS attack detection process, while in
   testing of the model on CSE-CIC-IDS2018 DDoS and CSIC 2010 datasets,
   0.9974 and 0.9059 accuracy values were obtained, respectively.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {This article analyses the inclusion of a gender perspective into housing
   policies in Spain. To do so, the text examines literature on gender
   mainstreaming and the development of housing policies, with a particular
   focus on the Spanish case. Subsequently, a theoretical framework based
   on former scholarly works allows scrutinizing the content of 55 pieces
   of legislation on equality, gender based violence, and housing
   corresponding to the 17 Autonomous Communities (ACs). The study reveals
   that ACs have used those regulations to incorporate a gender perspective
   into housing policies. Yet, differences amongst regions help
   differentiate analytically three intervention models-welfare, dual-weak
   and dual-strong models-. This article contributes both to gender and
   housing studies, and to those academic debates exploring the presence of
   regional welfare regimes.},

Abstract = {This letter is the first to systematically scrutinize the multifaceted
   claim that a strong state promotes democratic development. It analyzes
   new Varieties of Democracy data from 1789 to 2015 to specify and examine
   eight different versions of this `state-first' argument in analyses that
   span the entire era of modern democracy. The authors document that high
   levels of bureaucratic quality at the time of the first democratic
   transition and during democratic spells are positively associated with
   democratic survival and deepening. By contrast, state capacity has no
   robust effects on democratic survival or deepening and does not
   condition the impact of bureaucratic quality. These findings underline
   the importance of particular features of a strong state as well as the
   importance of a disaggregated approach. They imply that democratic
   development is better aided by strengthening the impartiality of
   bureaucratic organizations than by building capacity for territorial
   control.},

Abstract = {Whilst the politicization of the EU has been increasingly studied over
   recent years, the analysis has been focusing mainly on political parties
   and media. Thus, although not completely overlooked, studies looking at
   EU politicization amongst individuals remain scarce. This article
   presents a new qualitative dataset from 21 focus groups conducted across
   social groups and four countries. It was designed to observe processes
   of (de-)politicization at citizens' level, how they talk about the EU
   and along which cleavages are their attitudes structured. This
   comparative research design sheds new light on discourses and opinions
   on Europe, mechanisms of politicization and political discussions.},

Abstract = {The focus of this study is the mobilization and collective action of
   contemporary Moscow citizens. The research question deals with the
   socio-organizational factors that influence collective actions of
   different types among citizens. The research is based on theories of
   trust and social capital, as well as organizational density and resource
   mobilization. The key source of data in the article is the results of a
   mass representative survey in 30 districts of Moscow, as well as data on
   NGOs registered in these districts. Based on the analysis of literature,
   the author puts forward a theoretical assumption about the relationship
   between the characteristics of interactions and communication of people,
   as well as organizational structures - with the involvement of citizens
   in various types of collective actions. The formal models partially
   confirm the hypotheses. Expectations regarding the relationship between
   the form of home management, the frequency of interpersonal neighborhood
   interactions, the ownership and the length of residence did not show a
   statistically significant relationship with citizens' participation in
   collective actions. In contrast, communication factors - involvement in
   home affairs (participation in meetings and similar activities) and
   involvement in neighborhood / district social networks and messengers -
   turned out to be significant and showed a positive association with
   participation in collective actions of all types. Organizational factors
   also showed a positive relationship: the analysis suggests that the
   density of civic associations is associated with the participation of
   citizens in collective action. At the same time, the organizational
   factor is significant for collective actions of various types. The
   results indicate that for Moscow citizens communication in institutional
   forms is an important pre-condition for mobilizing citizens to
   participate in collective actions of various types: both politicized in
   the form of public protest actions and non-politicized in the form of
   charity or subbotniks.},

Abstract = {Bridging the literature on gender and politics, democratization, and
   political parties, this article investigates the causes of parties'
   varying compliance with electoral quotas. Whereas research has so far
   focused on parties' willingness to comply, this article sheds light on
   their ability to do so. It suggests that the more quotas parties have to
   comply with, and the more complex the quotas' designs, the more
   difficult implementation becomes for the organizationally weak parties
   that we often encounter in new democracies. The argument is developed
   and substantiated in a comparative analysis of parties' quota compliance
   in the 2018 Tunisian local elections. Although the Islamist party was
   able to comply fully with all quotas (for women, youth and people with
   disabilities), small secular parties lost a number of lists and state
   funding due to non-compliance. While the quotas were highly effective in
   securing group representation, they had repercussions on party and party
   system consolidation.},

Abstract = {The response to the coronavirus pandemic in the United States has shown
   that even a serious public health crisis cannot escape the lens of
   partisanship. The literature shows that most Republicans have viewed the
   coronavirus as less serious than their Democratic counterparts. This
   study demonstrates that this partisan gap extends to the real behavior
   of the public during, and after, the coronavirus state lockdowns. Using
   location data from mobile phones, we find that county-level partisanship
   predicts compliance with state shutdown orders, even when controlling
   for local COVID-19 intensity. Further, the magnitude of this effect is
   stronger than that of other explanatory variables, such as age,
   education, and population density. These results show that partisan
   beliefs can affect behavior regarding issues that are not overtly
   political, even behaviors that could put one or others at risk.},

Abstract = {This article aims to overcome the most common interpretive paradigms on
   vaccine hesitancy and refusal when are limited to consider the
   individual or group level and provide a contextual reading. For the
   purpose of this study, cultural, economic and political conditions are
   considered constituent materials of ``thinking{''} and ``doing{''} in
   everyday life and of ``problematizing{''} the issue of vaccines in the
   Covid-19 era. By adopting an analytical model derived from Sewell's
   pattern of contextualized structures (as a result of schemas and
   resources), the article compares three exemplary cases: Portugal, the
   country with the highest rate of Covid-19 vaccination; Italy, one of the
   most vaccine-hesitant western countries in Europe; and Poland, which
   with its vaccination rate well exemplifies vaccine-hesitant
   post-socialist CEE countries. By combining the schemas and resources,
   this study gives a social map with types of context-driven structures
   and offers an initial interpretative key useful to understanding the
   complexity of problem framing and structuring in the Covid-19 pandemic
   era in different sociocultural and political contexts.},

Abstract = {Modern democratic political systems are hardly conceivable without
   political representation. This also applies to the European Union, a
   unique political system with a directly elected and fully-fledged
   assembly representing the EU citizens, with the European Parliament
   being the first international parliamentary assembly to strive for
   democratic political representation. The case study addresses the
   composition of the European Parliament, or more specifically, it focuses
   on methods of apportioning the European Parliamentary seats among the EU
   Member States according to the degressive proportionality principle as
   codified by the Lisbon Treaty. First, the paper discusses the principle
   of degressive proportionality, both from a theoretical and empirical
   perspective, in the latter case taking into account the composition of
   the European Parliament since the first popular elections in 1979.
   Subsequently, the study discusses the most relevant proposed European
   Parliamentary seat apportionment methods, i.e. the Cambridge Compromise,
   the Power Compromise and the 0,5-DPL method, and seeks to analyse their
   consequences on the representation of the EU Member States in the
   European Parliament. The paper concludes that the Cambridge compromise
   is the most appropriate of the methods discussed as it best meets the
   requirements of the Lisbon Treaty and related documents for the
   composition of the European Parliament.},

Abstract = {Despite the increasing sums devoted to online political advertising, our
   understanding of the persuasive effects of such advertising is limited.
   We report the results of a ZIP code level randomized field experiment
   conducted over Facebook and Instagram during the 2018 U.S. midterm
   elections in Florida. The ads, produced by a Democratic-leaning
   political action committee, were designed to spur Democratic vote share
   and were seen more than 1.1 million times with over 100,000 full views.
   This wide saturation notwithstanding, we find that these advertisements
   had very small estimated effects on Democratic vote share at the
   precinct level (-0.04 percentage points, SE: 0.85 points). Our results
   underline the challenges of political persuasion via digital
   advertisements, particularly in competitive electoral contexts.},

Abstract = {This article aims to understand how intrapreneurial behavior manifests
   itself in government laboratories by proposing indicators. A
   predominantly quantitative approach was used, based on structured
   questionnaires and bibliographic and documentary sources. The research
   sample consisted of 40 civil servants in 19 government innovation
   laboratories in South America. The results show that the dimensions of
   Innovation, Proactivity, and Leadership are the most significant and
   recurrent in the laboratories, based on behaviors focused on
   relationships, opportunity searches, and active listening to citizen
   demands. As a practical contribution, the laboratories are mechanisms to
   stimulate intrapreneurial behavior in the public sector.},

Abstract = {This essay seeks to understand specificities that structure and
   reproduce certain economic processes of exploitation and marginalization
   of women in contemporary society. The focus is to analyze the conditions
   of income generation, the difficulties of entering the Brazilian labor
   market and the unequal distribution of care activities that cross female
   bodies. As well, it aims to stimulate the debate about the importance of
   formulating and implementing active public policies, especially in times
   of crisis and in the field of care, through the analysis of the role
   played by Emergency Aid (EA) during the first year of the Covid-19
   pandemic. The method used in the research is based, in the first part,
   on bibliographic research of Feminist Economics. In the second,
   referring to the quantitative part, in the descriptive analysis of the
   PNAD -COVID19 data, aided by results found in studies and relevant
   articles on this topic. This, in order to verify if the magnitude of the
   impacts felt in the pandemic varied according to gender, reaching women
   disproportionately, and if the granting of the benefit in this first
   year was able to mitigate the growth of social inequalities considering
   the intersectionality between gender, race and class.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a comparative analysis of how the borders of Latin
   America, the Arab World and Africa were - and still are - built,
   legitimized and contested. Based on a constructivist perspective, which
   does not only understand state sovereignty, but also state borders, as
   socially constructed, the text seeks to demonstrate that even if the
   countries located in the three regions are recognized as sovereign
   entities in the current international system, the processes that led to
   the definition and establishment of their borders responded to different
   logics and had differentiated dynamics. In methodological terms, the
   comparative method supported by the hermeneutic approach was adopted.
   The study concludes that Latin American borders were built at a
   historical moment when the system was more permissive for territorial
   acquisition through war. The African continent, on the other hand, had
   its colonial borders maintained by the new independent nations, as these
   were fundamental both to avoid conflicts and to guarantee its
   international recognition. Finally, in the Arab world, contesting
   borders meant erasing the artificial borders that divided the imagined
   Arab nation. Keywords: Borders; Africa; Latin America; Arab World;
   constructivism.},

Abstract = {We examine the use of proxies, shell companies, and offshore firms to
   defend property against seizure by private and state actors. Our
   theoretical framework emphasizes the role of political connections in
   defensive ownership. Linking information from investigative journalists
   on the key holdings of numerous Ukrainian oligarchs with firm-level
   administrative data on formal ownership ties, we observe some form of
   defensive ownership among more than two-thirds of oligarch-controlled
   firms, but such conduct is much less common for those connected to the
   incumbent regime. Further exploiting the abrupt shock to political
   connections that accompanied the Orange Revolution, we find a sharp rise
   in defensive ownership among previously connected oligarchs.},

Abstract = {In the present essay review, the authors have placed the notion of the
   war on terror under the critical lens of scrutiny. Far from being a
   foundational event, the global pandemic affirms a trend that originated
   after the war on terror. In both, the idea of living with the enemy
   persist. The modern nation-state, which is supported by the health
   system, deploys disciplinary instruments to detect, trace, and isolate
   the undesired guest. In the days after 9/11, surveillance technologies
   were used to spy on different citizens who were suspected to be
   terrorists. In the post-COVID-19 context, we are all suspected to be
   terrorists (carriers) who place the social order in jeopardy. Of course,
   terrorism and the virus have certain differences which merit being
   mentioned. Terrorism is moved by political and psychological aims while
   COVID-19 is simply a virus (disposed of any reasoning and will).
   Nevertheless, the reaction of society that exacerbates the
   instrumentalist gaze seems to be the same.},

Abstract = {Feature films about the Great Patriotic War have been experiencing a
   boom in Russia for several years. Thanks to generous support from state
   funds, a flood of new productions has emerged that form part of the
   country's general martial and patriotic mental rearmament. These films
   increasingly pay homage to an unadulterated cult of victory. Productions
   that are critical of war as such have disappeared. Instead, today's
   films and television series often present combat as a (computer)
   adventure enriched with special effects. The new cinematic canon is
   characterized not only by a romanticization of war, but also by a
   revival of Stalin and a close connection to the Orthodox Church.},

Abstract = {This study analyses how the effective judicial protection, which

   adapting to the irruption of artificial intelligence technologies.
   Therefore, after focusing on the roles and functions that algorithms can
   assume in the different phases of criminal justice, by virtue of their
   polyhedral and multi-faceted character, it will reflect on the need for
   a European procedural statute of AI. To this end, it will consider why
   it is necessary to regulate the << algorithmic due process of law >>,
   which requires rethinking the basic categories of law, through
   compatibility judgement, and the state of the issue, referring to how it
   is progressively being regulated and especially to the Proposal for an
   EU Regulation on AI, adopted in April 2021, which aims to build an <<

Abstract = {Gender violence is being approached in a different way and with
   legislations that are far from being, at least, comparable, much less
   uniform and homogeneous. Hence, it is very important to heed the
   pronouncements of expert bodies as interpretative references of
   international standards on this matter and, above all, how the European
   Court of Human Rights utilises them to apply the European Convention on
   Human Rights. Precisely in that connection it is important to underline
   the obligations of the States for the actions of their state and
   non-state agents in order to protect and relieve the victim of
   gender-based violence from probationary requirements that may lead to
   re-victimization.},

Journal = {ANALECTA POLITICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {22},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {The article approaches the concept of structural violence by elaborating
   on the idea of fear as an indicator of social or individual
   self-destruction. It argues that learning to read fear is an important
   skill for individuation and, therefore, a part of resistance to
   oppressive practices. Based on Tolstoy's political thought, the article
   draws attention to honesty, gratefulness, love, trust, creative act and
   responsibility as essential conditions for developing sensibility to
   read fear and the social structures. Likewise, the article looks at
   several popular series and literary pieces in each other's context as an
   existing intellectual or even social discourse with a special emphasis
   on the science fiction and fantasy genres in the context of spiritual
   anti-hierarchical thought. A distinction is made between organic fear -a
   natural emotion with a function of developing self-recognitio- and
   structural fear -a tool for manipulation and control over individuals
   employed by social institutions. The natural character of the emotion,
   in other words, the experience of fear common to every person, makes it
   a convenient mechanism of control over the Other. The article uses the
   findings to support the qualitative turn in the social studies and
   particularly the tendency towards the holistic or ecological approach to
   data selection and data interpretation.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research was to develop a coherent theoretical proposal
   for counteracting drug trafficking in Russia and Germany. The
   methodological basis of the research is the dialectical and worldview
   approach. The latter determined the application of the general
   principles of cognition to study the current situation of drug abuse in
   Russia and Germany. Among the results stands out the fact that,
   previously tested forms of preventive work require careful restructuring
   and adjustment on the example of the implementation of the Strategy of
   the State Anti-Drug Policy of the Russian Federation until 2030, which
   implies the involvement of various actors in the organization of
   preventive work. In addition, the scientific results of the research
   include a critical analysis of the legislation on drug trafficking,
   trends in the drug situation and criminological study of persons
   involved in drug trafficking. In conclusion, the authors provided a
   legal formulation of certain areas of the fight against drug trafficking
   in the Russian Federation and Germany.},

Title = {STATE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITIES IN A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE: AN
   EXPERIENCE OF BAYESIAN AGGREGATION OF STATE CAPACITY INDEX},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {53-73},
Abstract = {This article endeavors to construct a composite indicator designed to
   facilitate the comparative assessment of institutional capacities across
   diverse political systems. The focal point of analysis resides within
   the domain of state capacity, a pivotal determinant for a myriad of
   inquiries that seek to evaluate the efficacy of public policy
   implementation across varying spheres. The attainment of the research
   objective materialized through the adoption of Bayesian methodologies
   tailored for the scrutiny of latent variables, a prevalent recourse
   within contemporary social sciences to address analogous empirical
   puzzles. Drawing upon antecedent advancements collaboratively undertaken
   with co-authors and a minimal selection of variables, ranging from the
   comprehensive gauge of control over violence to formal economic activity
   (reciprocally aligned with the gauge of informal economy), two distinct
   models were subjected to empirical examination: namely, the linear and
   hierarchical ones. The ensuing analysis of 150 countries across three
   temporal junctures (1996, 2005, and 2015) distinctly advocates for the
   adoption of the latter model after accommodating convergence testing.
   The hierarchical model, oriented towards encapsulating the tripartite
   dimensions of state capacity, namely administrative, coercive, and
   extractive facets, gains preference. This predilection aligns with the
   contribution of J. Hanson and R. Sigman, whose conceptual underpinnings
   are frequently espoused by scholars when delineating the contours of the
   observed construct. The hierarchical model affirms the efficacy and
   discriminatory acumen of the proposed approach in engendering pertinent
   state rankings. These empirical revelations, in turn, constitute an
   indispensable stride towards interrogating assorted hypotheses
   concerning trajectories of institutional development and the
   construction of classificatory frameworks delimiting state capacity.
   Moreover, they extend utility in the realm of comparative studies by
   furnishing an aggregated indicator conducive to cross -national
   analysis.},

Abstract = {This study explores the impact of repression of foreign protests and the
   media source reporting the news upon American foreign policy preferences
   for democracy promotion abroad. We use two survey experiments featuring
   carefully edited video treatments to show that even short media clips
   presenting foreign protests as violently repressed increase American
   support for targeted sanctions against the hostile regime; however,
   these treatments alone do not inspire respondents to political action.
   Furthermore, we do not find evidence that mobile treatment magnifies the
   effects of violence.},

Abstract = {Since its attack on Ukraine, Russia has been using all means of symbolic
   politics in an effort to justify the occupation and annexation of
   territories in the southeast of its western neighbour. Above all,
   toponyms from the era of the Russian Empire play a major role. But
   emblems and posters also display historical imagery that is supposed to
   justify the violent appropriation of territory. Soviet symbols, such as
   the monuments to Lenin that have been returned to public spaces, serve
   the same purpose. The occupiers are very restrained in their use of
   Russian toponyms from the Tsarist era and today's.},

Abstract = {Mobile communication technologies can provide citizens access to
   information that is tailored to their specific circumstances. Such
   technologies may therefore increase citizens' ability to vote in line
   with their interests and hold politicians accountable. In a large-scale
   randomized controlled trial in Uganda (n = 16,083), we investigated
   whether citizens who receive private, timely, and individualized text
   messages by mobile phone about public services in their community
   punished or rewarded incumbents in local elections in line with the
   information. Respondents claimed to find the messages valuable and there
   is evidence that they briefly updated their beliefs based on the
   messages; however, the treatment did not cause increased votes for
   incumbents where public services were better than expected nor decreased
   votes where public services were worse than anticipated. The
   considerable knowledge gaps among citizens identified in this study
   indicate potential for communication technologies to effectively share
   civic information. Yet the findings imply that when the attribution of
   public service outcomes is difficult, even individualized information is
   unlikely to affect voting behavior.},

Abstract = {The article examines a series of issues related to the current Afghan
   crisis, such as various states' approaches to the conflict
   (contradictions and disagreements between them) at the global and
   regional level, the economic and domestic political situation in
   Afghanistan and the problems of preventing a large-scale humanitarian
   catastrophe; issues of legitimacy of the interim Taliban government in
   the eyes of the international community and the problem of its
   recognition; the terrorist threat from Afghanistan after the seizure of
   power by the Taliban; the problem of the production and traffic of
   drugs. The authors briefly analyze the background of the crisis,
   including a number of features of the previous Taliban regime that
   governed the country from 1996 to 2001. The authors emphasize the fact
   that the Afghan crisis is deep, large-scale and protracted, that it is
   fraught with all sorts of exacerbations, including those with the most
   negative consequences for the countries of Central Asia, in whose
   security and stability the Russian Federation is vitally interested.},

   minimization of the impact of destructive factors on the investigation
   of military crimes, so it is necessary to create a special governmental
   institution to cooperate with the International Criminal Court with the
   appointment of national coordinators in relation to amendments to the
   Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine, which provides for the
   possibility of investigation. The methodological basis of the research
   was the methods and techniques of scientific knowledge, specifically the
   main method of research was the dialectical method. It is concluded that
   the concept of investigation of military crimes committed in armed
   conflict and criminal prosecution of perpetrators can be defined as of
   important scientific and practical significance, a holistic
   interdisciplinary comprehensive theoretical system of activities under
   special conditions, which generally combines theoretical provisions on
   specific patterns in the field of legal support, organization of
   investigation and collection of evidence of military crimes. : search,

Abstract = {There are nearly 15,000 public libraries in Ukraine. In 2022, after
   being closed due to Corona, they were supposed to once again become
   places to promote reading, encourage learning, and facilitate
   encounters. But Russia's war thwarted those plans. In defiance of the
   Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property, libraries have
   also been the target of artillery and missile attacks. The destruction,
   damage, and loss of inventory are lamentable. The situation in the
   occupied territories is unclear. In the areas where there is no active
   fighting, libraries are going about their work. Moreover, they often
   coordinate the efforts of volunteers supporting displaced persons and
   soldiers on the front lines.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Number = {2},
Pages = {130-150},
Abstract = {Research on international migration in the field of political science
   and international relations has been relatively new. Research on the
   political aspects of migration in Slovakia has been even more recent. In
   our study, we focus on the relationship between international migration
   and international relations. The study aims to explain how some
   governments use the regulation of migration processes in their territory
   to advocate their domestic and foreign policy goals. We use the concept
   of migration diplomacy to explain the policies of national governments
   in relation to the European Union. Using the examples of three states -
   Libya, Turkey and Belarus - we seek to clarify how two basic categories
   of migration diplomacy operate: the cooperative and coercive ones. The
   study concludes that all three states used migration diplomacy as a tool
   of their foreign policy, although not always with the same success.
   Powerfully weaker states can be successful in using this strategy
   because, by regulating migration processes, they achieve influence over
   the decisions of the ruling elite of stronger states. Since political
   success in competitive democracies is determined by the mood of the
   electorate, democratic governments may be more willing to accept the
   demands of non-democratic countries that are able and, under certain
   conditions, willing to regulate migration processes on their territory
   or to stop them altogether. However, the case of Belarus shows that the
   pressure of one state on another through migration may not be successful
   if migration does not reach a mass character and if the state can ensure
   the successful protection of its borders.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to identify the conditions that lead Latin American
   International Organizations (IOs) to remain active or to paralize. It
   surveys various elements identified by IO literature that accounts for
   the IOs activity/paralysis and applies Qualitative Comparative Analysis
   to search for configurations that explain the outcomes. By exploring 31
   IOs in the Americas, the analysis shows that adequate staff is crucial
   for an IO to maintain regular activities in the region. High-quality
   staff and large teams are sufficient to keep regular operations, with
   the possible tradeoff either by restricting IOs??? scope or having a
   high number of member states. Conversely, we found that a more complex
   combination of institutional features and external aspects is needed for
   Latin American IOs to paralyze. Small teams and diminished political
   autonomy combined with low levels of statehood and member states that
   contest the organizations proved to be a consistent path to drive IOs
   not to operate regularly.},

Title = {Conceptualizing and Measuring Legal Culture: Evidence from a Survey of
   Mexican Federal Judges},
Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The article proposes a new approach to a central concept in the
   literature on judicial behavior: legal culture. The legal culture of
   judges is the set of formal and informal professional norms that
   indicate how the legal framework should be interpreted and that define
   expectations about what type of conduct is appropriate within the
   judicial field. The concept has three dimensions: a) hermeneutic
   routines, b) judges' vision of their role in the political system and c)
   their vision of their role within the judiciary. In the Latin American
   context, these dimensions translate into a continuum that goes from
   textualist or formalist legal cultures to interpretivist legal cultures
   close to neo-constitutionalism. The authors apply this conceptual
   architecture in Mexico with a survey of federal judges that measured
   different aspects of their legal culture. The survey captured attitudes
   about the judicial decision-making process. In particular, the
   instrument investigated how judges characterize their formal
   prerogatives and their work, the way in which they see their obligations
   with respect to the political system, and how they perceive their
   ability to issue innovative jurisprudence. The results indicate the
   presence of textualist and interpretivist legal cultures within the
   Mexican federal judiciary. They also suggest that the effect of certain
   aspects of legal culture on the pro-rights behavior characteristic of
   interpretivist or anti-textualist judges is substantively important and
   different from that of political ideology.},

Abstract = {A great deal of academic research addresses the problems of U.S.-Russian
   competition in Eurasia. Much of this research examines such issues as
   strategic stability, the crisis of the European security architecture
   against the backdrop of NATO's eastward expansion, and problems of
   anti-terrorist wars. Yet, the scholarship barely deals with topics
   comparing the foreign policy disposition of states from a nonmilitary
   perspective. In this article, we focus on this understudied topic: the
   assistance projects of the two countries as a means of advancing their
   national interests in one of the most conflict-prone regions of the
   former Soviet Union, the South Caucasus. The authors explain how the two
   countries address them differently, in spite of sharing many of the same
   threats due to instability in one of the key regions of Eurasia. Thus,
   this article will significantly broaden the issues of regional security
   and U.S.-Russian competition defining the place and role in the
   nonmilitary, politico-economic strategies of Moscow and Washington in
   the South Caucasus. The article is divided into four parts. First, the
   authors will provide a conceptual framework for the analysis, revealing
   the trend of the ``geopolitization{''} of the Caucasus region and
   showing what is meant by non-military political interaction. Next, the
   authors will offer an overview of the American and Russian approaches to
   building political and economic projects in the Caucasus and identify
   their characteristics. Finally, the authors conclude with a comparative
   analysis of non-military approaches to regional security in the Caucasus
   in Russia and the United States.},

Title = {REGULATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN RUSSIA: ECLECTICISM OF
   APPROACHES AND ACTORS},

Abstract = {Many observers expect artificial intelligence (AI) to become one of the
   most important technologies of the 21st century, whose development will
   be a decisive factor in shaping the future global technological balance
   of power. A practical confirmation of this statement is the fact that
   today an increasing number of states are striving to accelerate their
   national AI development programmes. Russia is one of them, although it
   is generally not perceived in the West as a potential leader in this
   emerging competition. At the same time, Russia's demonstrated ability to
   build its own successful national IT ecosystem is attracting increased
   international interest in its national AI development efforts. The
   purpose of this paper is to outline the contours of these efforts, and
   to trace the evolution of the regulatory framework and its underlying
   principles. The authors draw the following conclusions. Russia is
   developing a flexible and science -based approach to AI and its
   potential humanitarian impacts, combining its own historical experience
   with international practices. Strategically, Russia sees the development
   of national AI as an important means of advancing its economic and
   technological development in a way that benefits its citizens and
   businesses, as well as preventing a possible economic and technological
   slowdown. Significant progress has been made on legal and ethical
   issues. The focus of Russian efforts in this area is more on soft law
   norms and self -regulation rather than on prohibitive legislative norms.
   This approach leaves a lot of room for the development of AI and reduces
   the possibility of its premature bureaucratisation, which could hinder
   innovation in the field. There are certain similarities between the
   Russian and European approaches to AI development and regulation. Human
   security concerns, data protection and a risk -based approach to the
   development of AI technologies are prioritised by the state and
   supranational institutions (respectively) as the main actors responsible
   for safeguarding the well-being, interests and rights of the citizens.},

Abstract = {The article investigates the strategy of forming the image of the
   political leader in the context of the presidential election campaign.
   It points out the importance of the creation of professional images in
   the political activity of political leaders during their pre-electoral
   career. in addition, the concept of archetypes and their importance in
   the formation of the image of a political leader is outlined. The
   political images of the leaders of the presidential race of the United
   States of America are characterized. In the research aims to establish
   the meaning of the image for a political leader, the strategies of its
   formation and determine the prospects for future research. The
   methodology of the research is determined using methods of analysis,
   synthesis, behaviorist, systemic, structural-functional approach. It is
   concluded that, political imaging reveals a variety of technologies to
   improve speech, behavior, pronunciation of convenient words in the
   implementation of political activity. The lack of a thorough and complex
   analysis of this issue is evidenced by the fact that the number of
   scientific studies on the problem of political image in the context of
   the presidential campaign is scarce, at least in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {The paper presents a transdisciplinary approach to the processes of
   political subjectivation that occurred in members of clandestine
   anti-Francoist organizations in the territory of Gipuzkoa (Euskadi /
   Basque Country), between 1965 and 1975. For this, 15 individual
   Narrative Productions were carried out with 5 women and 10 men who
   participated in social, union and political organizations in that
   period; said Narrative Productions were analyzed by categories and
   linked to historiographic and political science psychosocial literature,
   tracing a transdisciplinary account of anti-Francoist political
   subjectivation. The results show processes of political subjectivation
   that take place through processes of socialization, from childhood to
   youth, which are inserted in the tension between the instituted Franco
   regime and the instituting spaces of Basque anti-Francoism, showing a
   political subjectivation that implies integration of psychosocial,
   cultural and political elements through concrete political experience.
   This leads us to observe these processes of subjectivation as a dynamic
   and complex phenomenon, characterized by the recursion between personal
   issues and social and structural phenomena linked to the political.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article was to study the problems that arise during
   the settlement of disputes in the order of international commercial
   arbitration. The article used general scientific (dialectic, analysis
   and synthesis) and special legal (comparative legal, formal-logical,
   systemic, hermeneutic, axiological) methods. In the results of the
   research, it was established that the characteristic features of
   electronic development contracts in international trade are: electronic
   forms of conclusion of pre-contractual and contractual communication,
   making amendments and additions to the contract. Taking into account the
   features that accompany the chosen form of contracting prevails the need
   to refer to the provisions of the applicable legislation on tax and
   customs legislation and protection of personal data, etc. The
   conclusions state that the main problems in the resolution of disputes
   arising from e-commerce contracts, in international commercial
   arbitration, are the issues of requirements and validity of the
   arbitration clauses contained in such contracts, the importance of the
   agreements reached in the pre-contractual stage in the subsequent
   resolution of disputes between the parties and the problems of proof
   arising from the peculiarities of entering into relevant contracts.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the transnational relations of non-state armed
   organizations. The question is why the organizationally more successful
   armed groups tend to revolve around transnational networks. The
   hypothesis is that it has to do with the way in which they generate
   cohesion within their combat units. Armed groups, especially clandestine
   ones, tend to co-opt parochial micro solidarity networks for the purpose
   of maximizing small-unit military cohesion. At the level of the wider
   organization, however, this entails a significant risk: societal
   micro-cleavages between local networks tend to create rifts within the
   wider organization. This is especially the case for groups that
   initially have no access to centralized bureaucracies able to arbitrate
   local struggles through anonymous rule. The paper argues that their
   leaders can in this context harness transnational relations to distance
   themselves (physically and symbolically) from these struggles, thus
   allowing them to arbitrate these struggles from a position of
   ``neutrality{''}. The article focuses on Lebanese Hezbollah and its
   transnational clerical networks. In developing the argument, it
   highlights that the religious nature of these clerical networks was only
   indirectly a source of organizational cohesion. What matters is that
   their long-distance character allowed weaving together previously
   opposed shortrange networks.},

Abstract = {The present article analyzes Joshua Oppenheimer's documentaries The Act
   of Killing (2012) and The Look of Silence (2014) from the perspective of
   trauma. The aim of this study is to give new approaches that could allow
   a deeper understanding of such a complex sociopolitical situation as the
   one that is taking place in nowadays Indonesia. First, I will introduce
   the term cultural trauma to explain the situation of the victims of the
   1965-66 mass killings that took place in Indonesia. Then, I will make
   use of the concept of the political taboo to better understand how the
   official narrative imposed by the government has worked, and still
   works, as some sort of unquestionable myth. Afterward, I will point out
   that these two concepts give birth to a vicious cycle from which
   escaping becomes highly unlikely. A possible solution I propose here
   comes from studying another type of trauma, that of the perpetrator,
   since, in an indirect way, it can lead to an improvement of cultural
   trauma. By approaching trauma in a non-moralistic sense, allowing the
   perpetrator the status of a victim, I intend to highlight the importance
   of empathy and understanding in the process of healing of not only
   perpetrator trauma, but also, and more importantly, cultural trauma.},

Abstract = {European institutions have repeatedly represented the EU as an actor
   that can use the attractiveness of its market to promote human rights
   internationally. From this perspective, EU trade sanctions represent a
   hard power tool to push the government of states accused of major human
   rights violations to abide by international law. In its reaction to the
   Rohingya crisis in 2018, despite the European Parliament's call for the
   lifting of Myanmar's trade preferences, the Council of the EU stated
   that it would rather tackle the problem by taking a ``constructive
   approach{''} based on dialogue. We provide a political-economy
   explanation of this choice, making a plausible case that the political
   pressures from European importers and exporters, not to jeopardise trade
   relations with Myanmar, prevailed over the demands of European
   protectionist groups and NGOs advocating a tougher position. The firms
   interested in maintaining preferential trade relations with Myanmar were
   primarily motivated by a desire to avoid a disruption of trade and
   investment links within global value chains (GVCs) so that they could
   continue competing with Chinese enterprises.},

Abstract = {Russia's economy has been stagnant since 2008. Under the interim
   presidency of Dmitry Medvedev from 2008 to 2011, there were attempts to
   modernise the economy. Since Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency
   in March 2012, economic growth has ceased to be a priority. Instead, a
   small group of intelligence officers around President Putin has relied
   on repression to control society and manage confrontation with the West.
   With the war in Ukraine, this development has reached a new zenith. The
   long-term economic consequences for Russia are catastrophic.},

Abstract = {This article is based on the theoretical framework of the doctoral
   thesis ``Model of collective self-management and productivity in the
   small-scale agricultural sector of the Sabana de Bogota{''}. A body of
   hypotheses is constructed that involves: a) the sustainability of common
   use resources; b) the impact of these on productivity; c) the scope of
   informal agreements; and d) the relationships between these and social
   capital. This implementation is tested by means of a mechanism designed
   with survey information obtained from the producers of the associations
   in the area. The mechanism is validated by incorporating the hidden
   costs derived from the agreement to protect water sources, in this case
   four rivers, and the corresponding factor costs. The result is tested by
   means of principal components and it is obtained that the data used in
   the model have a reliability of 82\%. This shows the scope and validity
   of the four hypotheses proposed and the theoretical framework.},

Title = {NETWORK MODELING OF MASS POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS. FIRST RESULTS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {124-140},
Abstract = {The article presents the experience of constructing three networks and a
   comparative analysis of these, where the nodes are the vectors of
   respondents' answers to almost identical sociological questionnaires in
   three countries - Russia, Kazakhstan, and Estonia. The questionnaires
   that regarded citizen's political attitudes and the practices of these
   three countries were used in polls conducted between the spring and the
   fall of 1998. The set of respondents' replies to one questionnaire was
   represented as a set of binary vectors. These binary vectors correspond
   to the nodes of the constructed network. At the initial stage, the
   standardized residuals, as measures of statistical dependence between
   nodes (response vectors), were used as measures of the connection
   between nodes. Thus, a weighted network of each survey was obtained.
   After that, according to the general formal rule of the threshold of
   determination, a transition was created from a weighted to a binary
   network. The main subjects of comparative analysis were the topological
   (structural) properties of such binary networks which are used in
   studies on networks from different origins. The networks constructed in
   this way were then used in the study as models of the respondents' mass
   consciousness. The authors studied and interpreted the cluster structure
   of networks that include the structure of a particular degree
   distribution of network nodes. This helped the authors to obtain
   significant results concerning the degree of distribution in the
   networks nodes examined. The hypothesis that these networks shape a
   separate class of complex networks is confirmed. The study provides
   sociological facts that could not be found out by traditional methods of
   statistical analysis of poll results, based on counting the frequency of
   responses in the whole sample and within the standard groups. These
   results suggest that the proposed approach allows us to interpret the
   networks that are constructed by the proposed method as models of mass
   consciousness, and that this network approach allows new verifiable
   facts about mass consciousness to be obtained. The authors provide ideas
   and directions for further scientific research in this field.},

Title = {COMPETITIVENESS IN MAYORAL ELECTIONS IN SLOVAKIA: ONE MAN RACE},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-73},
Abstract = {The territorial fragmentation of local self-government is attracting
   permanent attention due to economic efficiency and the quality of
   services provided. However, the area of competitiveness in local
   elections has not been explored in depth. The number of mayors in
   Slovakia significantly exceeds the average of European countries. This
   inevitably puts pressure on the number of candidates in elections. The
   purpose of this paper is to explore competitiveness in mayoral elections
   in Slovakia and to its development over 2010-2018 and provide another
   perspective in the discussion on territorial local self-government. The
   paper uses the competitiveness index and the tightness of the electoral
   result to investigate the degree of competition in mayoral elections.
   The data indicates the deficit in local democracy. There was no
   competition in one of four local government units, and only two
   candidates ran for mayoral office in one-third of the local government
   units in the 2018 mayoral elections. We observe an emerging pattern of
   decreasing competitiveness in mayoral elections in Slovakia. The results
   suggest that towns of 4 000 to 5 000 inhabitants are the most effective
   in terms of competitiveness.},

   Grevi's interpolarity approach and the ``thousand plateaus{''} concept
   by J. Deleuze and F. Guattari, the researcher forms a theoretical basis
   for the categories of the collaborative window and collaborative
   platform. The author offers her vision of the external and internal
   structure of the collaborative platform as a transnational interactive
   place for joint actions. Applying the case study, the researcher
   considers the Ukraine Defense Contact Group as a kind of prototype of a
   collaborative platform, while the Kyiv Security Compact is the legal

Title = {It's All About Solidarity Stupid! How Solidarity Frames Structure the
   Party Political Sphere},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {128-145},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Inspired by Lipset and Rokkan, the field of political science has
   primarily focused on party oppositions as a derivative of historically
   anchored conflicts among social groups. Yet parties are not mere social
   mirrors; they are also active interpreters of social context. In a
   globalized era they deploy conflicting frames on how solidarity may be
   preserved, as recent work on populist welfare chauvinism shows. However,
   the role of party political agency in framing solidarity lacks an
   overarching framework. This article therefore proposes a Durkheimian
   model that takes the integrative pole of the conflict-integration
   dialectic seriously and distinguishes among group-based, compassionate,
   exchange-based and empathic frames. The authors test this solidarity
   framework in Flanders (Belgium) - a good case study due to its
   fragmented party system and increasing economic and cultural openness.
   The content analyses of party manifestos presented here suggest that a
   solidarity-based deductive approach to studying partisan competition is
   relevant because partisan differentiation along solidarity lines is
   growing; this evolution converges with similar inductive expert-based
   and issue-based findings.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Within the framework of the research work on the functions and
   collateral effects of the introduction of information systems for social
   protection, the question arises about the theme developed in these
   pages. From this study it appears that these developments not only
   involved technological alterations in the scaffolding of social
   protection, but also contributed to the deployment of specific public
   policy approaches such as risk management and preventive safety or
   behavioral economics. This article addresses the behavioral economics
   approach and its libertarian paternalism with the aim of identifying its
   contribution to the development of public policies based on
   ``evidence{''}.
   The main postulates of this approach are analyzed, its growing expansion
   in various academic and political spheres, its institutionalization
   through the creation of public policy laboratories in government
   agencies and / or university centers, the critical aspects of this
   approach considering its principles and assumptions of interpretation,
   the methodological aspects of their experiments and inferences, the
   ethical-political considerations of these trials and the controversies
   about their limitations and effects in the medium and long term. I
   conclude by identifying factors and practical reasons that would be
   contributing to the global expansion of a very limited approach that
   places individual behaviors at the heart of public policy.},

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Y In this article, I draw on feminist and new social movement literature
   to analyse contemporary Mexico's Women's Collective Action (WCA) through
   a framework of prefiguration. I challenge traditional epistemological
   analysis of social movement theory by engaging with Icaza's (2019) body
   mind-spirit framework and Ahmed's (2004) cultural politics of emotions
   in my analysis of the cultural outcomes of the women's movements. By
   analysing emotions as cultural practices rather than psychological
   states, we can understand the intricate and at times contradictory
   reciprocal emotions at the inside of the women's movements. Similarly,
   analysing direct action through the body-mind spirit framework, allows
   for a complex reading of direct action that transverses the body/mind
   cartesian dichotomy, instead understanding the body as the primary
   territory of defence in the healing, re-imagining and (re)building
   process of new relationships of doing and being. By engaging with an
   analysis of the contemporary Mexican feminist movement, I argue the WCA
   in Mexico is part of a new wave of hope movements which engage in a
   process of prefiguration through the construction of alternative,
   anti-patriarchal worlds in the present. Rather than one united front
   with a series of political goals, the only strategy this movement
   embodies is its desire to build (an)other worlds.},

Abstract = {Since visuality in the (self-)representation of politicians and other
   influential figures has become an important part of political
   storytelling, we propose to use visual narrative analysis (VNA) as a
   systematic approach for its better understanding. VNA is particularly
   suited for this performative strand of interpretive analysis, as it does
   not study images in isolation but in the broader context of political
   narratives. By analysing different layers of communication (images,
   narratives, competing narratives) VNA enables us to identify internal
   contradictions that undermine political efforts of self-representation
   in contexts of global governance (e.g. multilateral diplomacy) and
   render them unstable and contestable. By analysing competing
   (self-)representations at a G7 meeting in 2018, we show how VNA can be
   applied fruitfully to the study of international politics and, second,
   how VNA can explain some of the reasons why one image became iconic
   (Angela Merkel as female leader of the liberal world), i.e. appealed to
   a wider audience, and others (focusing on Emmanuel Macron or Donald
   Trump) did not. While our article is primarily a demonstration of the
   methodological benefits of VNA for various research contexts in world
   politics, it also contributes to conceptual debates on the combination
   of visuality, narratives and emotions in changing practices of political
   storytelling.},

Abstract = {Much qualitative research has drawn an association between social media
   and domestic terrorism, with the studies reaching different conclusions.
   However, few empirical studies have evaluated whether the surge in
   social media participation affects domestic terrorist events.
   Controlling for common explanations in the literature, we conduct a
   cross-national, time-series analysis of up to 151 countries from 2000 to
   2019 to assess the impact of social media penetration on domestic
   terrorism. We ?nd that greater social media penetration increases the
   likelihood of domestic terrorism in countries as it supports extremists'
   ability to recruit, mobilize, and train terrorists. Using mediation
   analysis, we also find that greater social media penetration amplifies
   online and political polarization, increasing the likelihood of domestic
   terrorism events. Our work indicates the possible mechanisms linking
   social media and domestic terrorism and the need to develop and apply
   appropriate counterterrorism strategies to mitigate terrorist
   operations.},

Abstract = {Following the 6 January 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, news
   outlets reported that registered Republicans were leaving the party in
   droves. Drawing on millions of individual-level voter registration
   records in Florida, we place post-riot party-switching in broader
   context. We investigate whether Republicans were more likely to
   experience greater out-migration after the riot, detail to which
   parties' individuals switched their allegiances, use a
   difference-in-difference strategy to determine if the 2021 exodus was
   greater than 4 years earlier, and examine whether those who decamped
   from the GOP returned to the fold a year later. We find that registered
   voters who switched parties after the January 6th uprising were more
   likely to be white, middle-aged, high-propensity voters, and that
   Republicans were nearly four times more likely than Democrats to defect
   following the insurrection. We also find that the GOP defection rate
   after January 6th was nine times higher than during the same time period
   in 2017. However, we find that Republican registrants who switched
   parties post-riot did not migrate to the Democratic Party, but rather
   became independents, and that a year later, almost no Republicans (only
   4.6\%) who had defected returned to their GOP roots.},

Abstract = {International solidarity is indispensable for coping with global crises;
   however, solidarity is frequently constrained by public opinion. Past
   research has examined who, on the donor side, is willing to support
   European and international aid. However, we know less about who, on the
   recipient side, is perceived to deserve solidarity. The article argues
   that potential donors consider situational circumstances and those
   relational features that link them to the recipients. Using factorial
   survey experiments, we analyse public support for international medical
   and financial aid in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results
   show that recipient countries' situational need and control, as well as
   political community criteria, namely, group membership, adherence to
   shared values and reciprocity, played a crucial role in explaining
   public support for aid. Important policy implications result: on the
   donor side, fault-attribution frames matter; on the recipient side,
   honouring community norms is key to receiving aid.},

Abstract = {Many West-European parties have responded to a changing and challenging
   environment by adopting multiple party reforms. In this article, we
   propose a comparative framework to study party reforms based on an
   adaptation of Harmel and Janda's (1994) Integrated Theory of Party Goals
   and Party Change and its application to three different features of
   party action. We argue that the causes leading to reforms are multiple
   and differ according to the nature of these different features (i.e.
   programmatic-, personnel- and organization feature). FsQCA analyses show
   that the three types of reforms implemented by the six mainstream
   Belgian parties between 1987 and 2014 are all explained by fundamentally
   different complex causal pathways and that not a single causal condition
   considered was sufficient in itself to predict party reforms. Hence, we
   argue that the literature should now extend in two complementary
   directions. First, we suggest moving away from considering party reforms
   as only explained by separate conditions, since those are always the
   result of a combination of causal conditions. Second, we highlighted
   that it is not possible to commonly explain different types of reforms
   without stressing that only a diversity of (combinations of) causes
   allows to do so. Future research should better link the nature of the
   reforms undertaken to the different causes that may push parties to
   adopt them.},

Title = {Living in the Shadow of Deportation: How Immigration Enforcement
   Forestalls Political Assimilation},

Abstract = {Prior research demonstrates that acculturated co-ethnics of immigrant
   groups adopt restrictive immigration policy preferences akin to that of
   host country dominant groups. However, acculturated U.S. Latinxs still
   maintain relatively open immigration policy preferences despite their
   distance from the canonical immigrant archetype (e.g., Spanish-speaking,
   immigrant). To answer the puzzle, I draw on sociological perspectives
   and theorize that the increased societal integration of undocumented
   immigrants in tandem with an expanding interior immigration enforcement
   apparatus generates rebuff against Anglo political norms among
   acculturated Latinxs. Using 6 national Latinx surveys, I corroborate my
   theory and find perceptibly threatening immigration enforcement contexts
   forestall the adoption of restrictive immigration policy preferences via
   acculturation. Absent deportation threat, acculturated Latinxs adopt

Abstract = {Coming out of the 2020 redistricting cycle, independent redistricting
   commissions are the clear winners, with most maps drawn by independent
   commissions being upheld against legal challenges, while other state
   maps face significant claims of vote dilution and partisan
   gerrymandering. While a growing literature debates the institutional
   designs of commissions and assess and compare their mapping outcomes,
   this article will offer a commissioner's view of the process. Reflecting
   on my service on the 2020 California Citizens Redistricting Commission,
   I will argue that while independent commissions are not a magic bullet,
   they are the best option for redistricting that allows for transparency
   over backroom negotiations and can, hopefully, help restore some faith
   in our democratic institutions.},

Abstract = {This article examines the patterns of political career movements in the
   Russian Federation using the sample of all 393 governors from 1991 until
   2021. The results show that during the period of regionalization
   (1991-1999), the dominant pattern of career movements was an alternative
   one, with politicians rarely moving across levels. The only exception to
   this rule were ethnic republics, which attracted politicians with
   political experience at various levels (i.e. with an integrated pattern
   of career movements). The period of re-centralization (since 2000) has
   changed the patterns of careers. Contrary to the expectations of the
   literature on political careers, an integrated pattern of career
   movements prevails rather than a unidirectional one (i.e. when
   politicians move from the regional to the national level). I posit two
   important factors for this development: the creation of a dominant
   party, United Russia, and the establishment of mechanisms for enforcing
   governors' accountability to the president.},

Abstract = {Polarisation over cultural issues and the emergence of radical, often
   populist, challenger parties indicate a fundamental restructuring of
   political conflict in Western Europe. The emerging divide crosscuts and,
   in part, reshapes older cleavages. This special issue introduction
   highlights how the transformation of cleavage structures relates to the
   dynamics of polarisation and political participation. The contributions
   to the special issue innovate in two ways. First, they adapt concepts
   and measures of ideological and affective polarisation to the context of
   Europe's multi-party and multi-dimensional party competition. Second,
   they emphasise electoral and protest politics, examining how ideological
   and affective polarisation shape electoral and non-electoral
   participation. Apart from introducing the contributions, the
   introduction combines different datasets - the Chapel Hill Expert
   Survey, Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and the European Social
   Survey - to sketch an empirical picture of differentiated polarisation
   with types of polarisation only weakly associated cross-arena,
   cross-nationally and over time.},

Abstract = {Applying Jurgen Habermas' distinction between the three knowledge
   interests guiding scientific research, this article identifies three
   approaches to `trauma', a clinical approach, rooted in a medical model,
   a literary approach, rooted in psychoanalysis, and a cultural
   sociological approach. After elaborating on each of these perspectives,
   and the various forms through which trauma is represented aesthetically,
   the three are applied in an analysis of the film ``Quo Vadis, Aida?{''}.
   It is argued that although they entail different notions of trau-ma, the
   three are not mutually exclusive and can be combined in a rich
   under-standing of aesthetic representation.},

Abstract = {Starting from the model of interpretation of the artistic and cultural
   field as a social field of action and influence between the agents that
   compose it and the processes that structure it (Becket, Bourdieu), this
   paper analyzes several reports (MAV; CyM) on the representativeness and
   participation of women in various areas of the cultural industries
   today. Among the causes that may be blocking the professional careers of
   women, the validity of two classic interpretations of feminist studies
   is discussed: the role of the creative genius and the separate spheres.
   It is argued that the historical deficit of women's presence in the
   social space of the cultural field, due to the traditional division of
   roles and spheres, continues to be the cause of the underrepresentation
   of cultural goods produced by women.},

Abstract = {This work analyzes the decisions issued by the Constitutional Court
   about the Havana Peace Process with the FARC and its implementation. The
   decisions studied begin with the constitutional reform known as The
   Legal Framework for Peace, in 2012, up until the final ruling, which
   revised a norm adopted in favor of the special proceeding for peace, in
   October 2018. The study begins with the emergence of the 1991
   Constitution and other reforms, which served as a background for the
   peace process. Later on, the analysis of the judgements is developed.
   The objective of such analysis is having a global vision of what
   happened in the Court about the peace issue and the modifications
   introduced to the revised rules, as well as the roll of the Court in the
   peace process.},

Title = {Securing the exception through securitization: Turkish modular emergency
   in the making},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 30},
Abstract = {This study argues that the Schmittian exceptionalist view drawing on the
   norm/exception dichotomy is ill-equipped to grasp the nature and
   operation of current modular emergency regimes where normalcy and
   emergency coexist as different, yet intertwined modes of governance.
   These regimes are modular as they enable the interchangeable and
   simultaneous use of ordinary and extraordinary powers and legislation by
   executives. In modular emergencies, securitization plays a key role to
   create a ``strategic ambiguity{''} where the distinction between the
   ``normal{''} and the ``exceptional{''} becomes untenable and invisible.
   In securitized political environments, it becomes increasingly difficult
   for societies to gauge if expanded executive powers and exceptionalist
   practices are justifiable, reasonable and proportional. Turkey was ruled
   under a nationwide state of emergency (SoE) for two years declared on 20
   July 2016 soon after a failed coup attempt against the Turkish
   government. Even though the SoE was formally lifted in July 2018, the
   emergency powers and exceptionalist practices have become entrenched and
   institutionalized under the guise of the ``presidential system of
   government{''} designed as a rule of modular emergency.},

Abstract = {The 2020 presidential election brought expanded vote-by-mail
   opportunities, a rise in attacks on this process's integrity, and the
   implementation of novel programs such as California's Where's My Ballot?
   system to ensure confidence in mail balloting. Can heightening awareness
   of this ballot-tracking system and other election protections alleviate
   fraud concerns and raise turnout? We assess whether messages reinforcing
   election integrity increased participation in the 2020 election through
   a large-scale voter mobilization field experiment. California
   registrants were mailed a letter that described either existing
   safeguards to prevent vote-by-mail fraud or the ability to track one's
   ballot and ensure that it was counted. Analysis of state voter records
   reveals that neither message increased turnout over a simple election
   reminder or even no contact, even among subgroups where larger effects
   might be expected. In the context of a high-profile, high-turnout
   presidential election, assurances about ballot and electoral integrity
   did not increase turnout.},

Abstract = {Differentiated integration (DI) and flexibility in implementation (FI)
   are two forms of differentiation that can be used to cope with
   heterogeneity among EU member states. Given the different ways in which
   they do so, this article asks whether DI and FI are alternatives for
   each other or whether they serve different functions in EU legislation.
   Based on a dataset that maps the occurrence of opt-outs and flexibility
   provisions in EU directives, the analysis shows that DI and FI tend to
   be used together. A qualitative analysis of directives that combine
   different levels of DI and FI shows that, within that overall pattern,
   DI is used to accommodate individual outliers, while FI is used to
   address widespread concerns among member states. This suggests that DI
   and FI are two forms of differentiation in the EU, which are used to
   address different aspects of a common underlying set of concerns.},

Abstract = {A change of government or minister constitutes a stress test for the
   relationship between ministers and bureaucrats. The new political
   masters may question the loyalty of incumbent bureaucrats and seek to
   replace them. However, the relationship between political changes and
   administrative turnover is poorly understood in meritocratic systems.
   This article analyses how changes of either government or minister
   affect the turnover of permanent secretaries in Denmark and Norway
   (1970-2020). Whereas ministers are completely reliant on career
   bureaucrats in pure meritocratic systems, they are supported by
   political appointees in hybrid meritocratic systems. The article
   investigates whether the effect of political changes on administrative
   turnover is mediated by the presence or absence of political appointees.
   Changes of government increase the risk of administrative turnover in
   Norway (hybrid system), but there are no such effects in Denmark (pure
   system), suggesting that political appointees potentially undermine the
   permanence of career bureaucrats.},

Abstract = {According to one interpretation, Montesquieu believed that laws should
   be suited to the particular physical and moral characteristics of a
   nation, and that political change should not be abruptly imposed.
   However, as Montesquieu nonetheless condemned despotism, he argued that
   change in despotic regimes should happen gradually through the
   noncoercive alternative of doux commerce. My aim is to challenge this
   interpretation of Montesquieu in two ways. First of all, Montesquieu was
   far more skeptical about the possibility of political change; so strong
   was his physical determinism that Montesquieu himself thought that
   despotic states could not be reformed, even through commerce. Second,
   even though successors of Montesquieu-such as the Abbe Raynal-did view
   the use of force in reforming despotic states as futile and preferred
   commerce as a benign alternative, they had to acknowledge that even
   commerce could not take root in those supposedly despotic states without
   coercion. The two most representative doux commerce theorists of the
   eighteenth century, when confronted with the prevailing trope of
   Oriental despotism, were far less optimistic about the civilizing effect
   of commerce than today's interpretations suggest. My reading of The
   Spirit of the Laws and The History of the Two Indies suggests the limits
   of turning to eighteenth-century doux commerce ideals to theorize
   political reform in so-called despotic governments today.},

Abstract = {Football fanzines once stood at the vanguard of fan activism.
   Historically, they have served as the voice of supporters, largely
   independent of the clubs they are associated with. Indeed, a recurring
   characteristic of these fanzines is that they often challenge and
   question authority. In the halcyon days of past decades, they
   proliferated and often acted as a powerful vector of change within
   football. Increasingly though, they have been pushed to the margins, for
   a number of reasons, ranging from the increasing digitalisation of media
   to the growing distance between fans and club owners as a consequence of
   the money that's now in the game. Football's inexorable drift towards
   deregulation means that fanzines alone can no longer act as agents of
   change and challenge. They need to work in synch with supporters' groups
   in order to make their voices heard. More than that, this needs to
   happen not just at a local, but a national level, so that supporters
   from top to bottom of English football's shaky pyramid are seen to speak
   with one voice. Perhaps above all, there is a need for independent
   regulation of the game's governance.},

Abstract = {Private businesses are central actors in the development of artificial
   intelligence (AI), meaning they have a key role in ensuring that AI
   respects human rights. Meanwhile, international human rights law (IHRL)
   has been scrambling to catch up with technological developments that
   have occurred since the establishment of its state-centric framework
   that were not envisaged by its drafters. Despite progress in the
   development of international legal standards on business and human
   rights, uncertainties regarding the role and responsibilities of AI
   businesses remain. This article addresses these uncertainties from a
   governance perspective and against the backdrop of the public/private
   divide; it views laws as instruments of governance, which comprises
   activities by many public and private actors. Section 2 briefly assesses
   the current framework of IHRL regarding AI and businesses, focusing on
   the lack of legal certainty. Section 3 critically analyses AI
   initiatives beyond IHRL that have been adopted at international,
   regional, and national levels to gain insight into specific standards of
   behaviour expected of AI businesses, as well as to challenge a
   dichotomous public/private divide in this context. Section 4 provides
   conclusions and recommendations.},

Abstract = {This text proposes a first approach to the ideas of myth and utopia in
   different interventions by Horacio Gonzalez, where they emerge as an
   internal fold of criticism, in a double epistemological and political
   sense, rather than as the mere object of a deconstruction on the part of
   the existing sciences, or a simple phantasmagoria from which
   emancipatory political practices should keep a distance. As unavoidable
   components of critical language, in Gonzalez's texts myth and utopia are
   not positivized or elevated to slogans, but they are preserved as
   strange objects that may themselves strange certain dominant connections
   and enable, on the one hand, the self-reflection of knowledge on the
   mythological substrate operant in every situation of discernment and, on
   the other hand, a renewed inquiry into the limits of post-utopian
   representations of politics, whether they are approached in their more
   or less buracratized declines or in those antithetically eventualistic.},

Abstract = {In the paper, the authors analyse the institutionalization of the
   discipline of international relations and security studies at the
   Faculty of Political Sciences, guided by the criteria of stability,
   identity and autonomy, which are tested through specific indicators of
   their manifestation. In doing so, the emphasis is on the development
   during the last thirty years, with a brief review of the ear-lier
   periods when international relations were primarily incorporated as one
   of the constitutive disciplines at the then new university institution,
   which eman-cipated political science in relation to the other, older
   scientific fields which it is rooted in. In addition, in order to gain
   insight into the parallel development of international relations and
   security studies since the mid-twentieth century, the paper examines the
   possible emancipation of security studies as a separate scientific
   discipline and tries to answer the question of whether it is possible or
   useful to separate them, considering the intertwining and overlapping of
   the conceptual-categorical apparatus, theories and phenomena they
   investigate. In particular, the development of the discipline of
   international relations and security studies in Croatia is compared with
   neighbouring countries (Serbia and Slovenia), which leads to conclusions
   about the relationship between se-curity studies and international
   relations. The paper argues that international relations and security
   studies, which have been developing more intensely since the second half
   of the 1990s in terms of scientific production and cur-ricula, represent
   a strongly institutionalized discipline.},

Abstract = {What is ``lawfare{''}? A novel and empirically differentiated case of
   judicialization of politics, a defensive rhetorical strategy to be used
   in partisan conflicts, or the reframing of a longstanding regional
   practice of judicial persecution? The article analyzes the instruments,
   the ideological orientation and the political results that characterize
   their use and compare them with those that characterized legal wars that
   took place before 2016. In particular, the article analyzes the former
   Latin American presidents who began their mandates after the year 2000
   and accused for crimes of corruption. The study shows that the behaviors
   and procedures that characterize the practice of << lawfare >> were
   usual and ancient practices in the region, that the Latin American
   meaning of the term indicates the reframing of a pre-existing phenomenon
   and advances a set of hypotheses to explain the success of the reframing
   process.},

Abstract = {This essay traces the development of the phrase ``democratic
   socialism{''} from the early nineteenth century to the present,
   especially in relation to ``social democracy{''} and ``communism.{''}
   These meanings have changed over time, with democratic socialism and
   social democracy indicating the opposite of what they meant a century
   ago when social democracy was the more and democratic socialism the less
   radical position. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the decline of
   the post-World War II social-democratic compromise created space for a
   radical democratic socialism to flourish in our time.
   Twenty-first-century democratic socialism seeks to democratize the
   workplace and reorient the state, against the power of the organized
   capitalist class, to serve the needs of the many rather than the desires
   of the few.},

Abstract = {Economic development fails to greatly increase demand for liberal
   democracy in China. Is China an exception to modernization theory? If
   so, why? This paper studies these questions by analysing five waves of
   Asian Barometer Survey data from 2002 to 2019. We have three major
   findings. First, the shift of political values exhibits an inverted
   U-shaped curve with the mid-2010s as its turning point. Second, the
   better educated and more media exposed turned conservative much faster
   than the rest after the mid-2010s. Third, to trace the mechanism of this
   unusual reversal and divergence, we resort to a
   Difference-In-Differences model, taking political indoctrination,
   measured by media exposure and education, as treatment and the post-2013
   era as treatment time, finding that political indoctrination
   significantly explains political cultural backsliding. Our findings
   enrich modernization theory by identifying the ``interceptive{''} power
   of the state between economic development and cultural shifts.},

Abstract = {The emergence of the Internet has altered how individuals obtain
   information-this also applies to political information. Search engines
   have taken over the role of political information gatekeepers, thus
   becoming key players in democracy. However, surprisingly little is known
   about the role of search engines in the political information process,
   that is, whether they represent an opportunity or a threat to democracy.
   Through an online survey experiment, which mimicked a Google web
   interface, this study examines how Swiss citizens select political
   information on a political news event from a Google search results page.
   Although citizens consider textual cues from snippets, they are more
   likely to select sources of information from the top of a Google results
   page, regardless of the source. We discuss these findings from a
   democratic theory perspective.},

Abstract = {What are the electoral consequences of urban riots? We argue that riots
   highlight the economic and social problems suffered by those who
   participate, inducing potential electoral allies to mobilize. These
   allies can then punish local incumbents at the ballot box. We test this
   hypothesis with fine-grained geographic data that capture how exposure
   to the 2011 London riots changed vote choices in the subsequent 2012
   mayoral election. We find that physical proximity to both riot locations
   and the homes of rioters raised turnout and reduced the vote for the
   incumbent Conservative mayor. These results are partly driven by a
   change in the turnout and vote choices of white residents. This provides
   support for the view that riots can help shift votes against incumbents
   who oppose the implied policy goals of rioters.},

Abstract = {Will a legislator with higher legislative performance receive a higher
   amount of contributions from lobbyists' personal funds? The
   transactional school of lobbying posits that individuals invest funds in
   members who provide productive legislative outcomes. I build on and test
   this theory, hypothesizing that lobbyists will allocate their personal
   contributions across their existing ties based upon a congressperson's
   legislative performance. Using data collected from the 108th Congress to
   the 115th Congress, I find that legislators with higher legislative
   effectiveness receive more contributions from lobbyists. Also, this
   positive effect is more pronounced among freshman legislators. These
   findings show the dynamic relationship between lobbyists and
   legislators, highlighting lobbyists' strategic use of contributions to
   advance their preferred policies.},

Abstract = {This letter explores the prevalence of misperceptions about refugee
   policy and tests whether correcting these misperceptions changes
   attitudes toward refugees. Large numbers of people hold misperceptions
   about both the nature and effects of refugee policy. An experiment
   directly compares the effects of correcting misperceptions about
   existing refugee policy (e.g., the refugee admission process) with
   correcting misperceptions about the outcomes of refugee policy (e.g.,
   the proportion of refugees in the United States and the percentage who
   receive welfare benefits). Corrective information about existing policy
   substantially increases support for refugees, but corrective information
   about policy outcomes has no effect on attitudes. The results suggest
   that including descriptive information about existing U.S. policy in
   media coverage of refugees could both correct misperceptions and change
   attitudes.},

Abstract = {Existing literature on using humor in teaching identifies several social
   and pedagogical benefits, ranging from making students feel more
   comfortable and interested in the subject matter to facilitating a
   critical pedagogy approach. However, there are several risks associated
   with humor attempts that are detriment\& to learning and to student
   experiences. Through analyzing qualitative data from three focus groups
   (FGs) with 2nd and 3rd year Politics and/or International Relations (Pol
   \& IR) students, this article advances a student-centric understanding
   of the pitfalls of using humor in content delivery. While humor is often
   subjective, timing, frequency, established conventions, subject matter,
   and lecture persona all impact how students perceive humor used by
   lecturers. This article juxtaposes existing literature on approaches to
   using humor in teaching, and its pedagogical benefits, with empirical
   evidence of student perspectives and expectations to highlight the
   practical challenges and risks of including humor attempts in effective
   Pol \& IR teaching.},

Abstract = {Fundamental transformations of underlying cleavage structures in
   advanced democracies should become evident in new collective identities.
   This article uses quantitative text analysis to investigate how voters
   describe their ingroups and outgroups in open-ended survey responses. I
   look at Switzerland, a paradigmatic case of electoral realignment along
   a ``second,{''} universalism-particularism dimension of politics
   opposing the far right and the new left. Keyness statistics and a
   semi-supervised document scaling method (latent semantic scaling) serve
   to identify terms associated with the poles of this divide in voters'
   responses, and hence to measure universalist/particularist identities.
   Based on voters' own words, the results support the idea of collective
   identities consolidating an emerging cleavage: Voters' identity
   descriptions relate to far right versus new left support, along with
   known sociostructural and attitudinal correlates of the
   universalism-particularism divide, and they reveal how groups opposed on
   this dimension antagonistically demarcate themselves from each other.},

Abstract = {In light of ongoing debates in England over the urgency of new
   devolution deals to `level up' the country, this article investigates
   how devolved powers have been used to transform and sustain the economy
   in one of the most economically successful regions in Europe: the Basque
   Country. Drawing upon interviews conducted with Basque politicians,
   researchers and practitioners, the article examines the role that
   multi-level governance and public-private collaboration have played in
   shaping the region's economic development, as well as the challenges
   that derive from its complex institutional structure. The article
   concludes by suggesting that one of the most significant takeaways from
   the Basque experience is the importance of using devolution to build a
   collaborative web of actors and institutions at regional and local level
   with an enduring common knowledge and purpose that far outlives any one
   government, as well as the social capital needed to sustain that.},

Abstract = {This study conducted a bibliometric analysis of Chinese politics
   research from 2001 to 2020 (N = 11,285) using Social Sciences Citation
   Index data. The number of publications in the field by scholars from
   Mainland China surged in the past 20 years; however, their influence on
   academia remained limited. Chinese institutions serve as the major hubs
   of collaborative networks. Using structural topic models, we identified
   25 research topics that can be categorized in three clusters. In the
   past 20 years, scholars from Mainland China steered the focus of Chinese
   politics by causing a reduction in the proportion of international
   relation topics and an increase in the proportion of political economy
   topics. Domestic politics topics had the most citations. Scholars from
   Mainland China have made contributions to better research methods in the
   field. This article is a comprehensive view of Chinese politics research
   using a tool that is rarely used by political scientists. It depicts how
   studies of Chinese politics influence academia from a bibliometrics
   perspective.},

Abstract = {Brexit constitutes a puzzle for integration theory. Functionalist
   analyses have not only failed to predict the UK's exit but have also
   underestimated the disintegrative dynamics of the withdrawal
   negotiations. By contrast, postfunctionalism accounts for the
   disintegrative Brexit process but struggles to explain the unity and
   defence of supranational integration among the EU-27. This article tries
   to make sense of the Brexit puzzle. First, it argues that Brexit
   constitutes an attack on the EU polity rather than a policy failure -
   the type of crisis that functionalist theories explain best. Second, it
   complements the postfunctionalist account of domestic politicisation
   with an analysis of the reactions and strategies of the defenders of
   supranational integration. According to this expanded postfunctionalist
   analysis, the interaction of polity attack and polity defence has
   produced `external rebordering': extreme disintegration of the UK from
   the EU, on the one hand, and strengthened integration of the EU-27, on
   the other.},

Abstract = {Recent publicity of Chinese feminist activism highlights the urgency for
   scholarly attention to historically and contextually grounded knowledge
   about socialism and feminism. This essay explores current Chinese
   feminism as a contentious and geopolitically mediated subject,
   introducing critical socialist feminism within the Chinese feminist
   theorizing that has emerged in the last decade. Specifically, the essay
   discusses how several scholars reexamine gender, socialist legacy, and
   community-based socialism and argues that this new terrain of Chinese
   feminist theory should be read critically while paying attention to
   recent theoretical developments in East Asia. Grounded in the context of
   Chinese state capitalism, critical socialist feminism holds potential to
   challenge certain Eurocentric tendencies in the transnational flow of
   socialist feminism.},

Abstract = {The historical turn in political science has yielded numerous
   innovations in historical methods, but little in terms of systematic
   engagement with historical methodologies, understood as the logics of
   inquiry underlying historical analysis. The lack of engagement with
   historical methodologies has led to a narrowing of the space for
   historical inquiry, as scholars are often presented with a binary choice
   between realist and poststructuralist approaches, with the question of
   objectivity serving as the intractable divide. To the extent that
   scholars have carved out a middle ground, it has rested on contextualist
   approaches, though these too have been vulnerable to the critique of
   objectivity. In this article, I articulate the principles of a fourth
   position, rooted in the methodology of Max Weber and the idea of
   reflexive verstehen (understanding), a mode of investigation which seeks
   an empathetic understanding of historical subjectivities while
   foregrounding the researcher's subjective orientation to the inquiry.
   The Weberian alternative, I argue, navigates a unique path around the
   gauntlet of scientific objectivity. It offers the possibility of
   historical understanding that is rooted in subjective understanding, but
   by virtue of submitting to a process of evaluation and incorporating an
   element of reflexivity can claim the status of scientific knowledge. It
   also enables an ``event{''} driven approach to historical inquiry that
   expands where we can look for historical knowledge. In doing so it both
   improves the quality of historical understanding and increases its
   scope.},

   members of the other party},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Do partisans view members of the other party as having lower moral
   status? While research shows that partisans view the out-group quite
   poorly, we show that affective polarization extends to expressing a
   willingness to sacrifice an out-partisan's life. We report the first
   study to consider partisanship in the classic ``trolley problem{''} in
   which respondents are asked whether they would sacrifice an individual's
   life in order to save the life of five individuals. We explore this
   issue with a nationally representative survey experiment in the United
   States, inquiring about politicized variants of the trolley problem
   case. First, we vary the political affiliations of both the group of
   five (to be saved by turning the trolley) and the single individual (to
   be sacrificed by turning the trolley). We find that individuals are less
   willing to sacrifice a co-partisan for the sake of a group of
   out-partisans. These findings go beyond earlier work by suggesting that
   partisans not only hold negative attitudes and judgments toward
   political out-groups but also they will at least signal approval of
   differing moral treatment. We take stock of how these results bear on
   normative questions in democratic theory.},

Abstract = {The central hypothesis of this work argues that the Leninist theory of
   imperialism is nourished, combines and synthesizes a set of
   heterogeneous knowledge. From critical analysis of political economy to
   the theory of war, including studies focused on the analysis of
   colonialism, dependence and the national problem, as well as a detailed
   examination of the logic and dialectical methodology. The mature work
   that the Bolshevik thinker presented in 1916 constitutes the point of
   arrival of 23 years of research, polemics and analysis through which
   Lenin was developing and elaborating his theory of imperialism.},

Abstract = {Largely disregarded or derided in the West, the Shanghai Cooperation
   Organisation (SCO) has grown since its humble beginnings into an
   important vehicle for Chinese digital and technology penetration in
   Central Asia. Raffaello Pantucci and Niva Yau show how China has managed
   to realise some of the economic goals that Beijing has long envisaged
   for the organisation, even if it has often found itself stymied by other
   members. In much the same way as the region has been a testbed for
   Chinese foreign policy approaches, the SCO now appears to have become a
   key locus for implementation of the Digital Silk Road.},

Abstract = {This article addresses, from a historical perspective, the relationship
   that has been maintained between politics and justice in Spain within
   the framework of the separation of powers established by the
   nineteenth-century constitutionalisms. In order to tackle this
   political-justice link, we have chosen to materialise the political and
   the judicial in two of their institutional expressions, the former being
   understood as the Government and the latter as the Administration of
   Justice as an apparatus. From this brief overview, which spans from the
   first constitutionalism of 1812 to the current Constitution, it can be
   deduced that the political nature of the judiciary was incorporated at
   the dawn of the Constitution as a basic element to establish the new
   order; it was enshrined as a substantial aspect of the judges that
   served to articulate the judicial apparatus, and only in very recent
   decades, with a true democratisation of constitutionalism, were
   instruments created to consider it a systemic anomaly, incompatible in
   essence with a separation of powers that structured the constitutional
   order.},

Abstract = {Different methods of measurement for survey research have been developed
   to explore how the public understands democracy. In the existing
   research on the democratic understanding of the Chinese people,
   closed-ended questions are often used to measure this understanding.
   However, the results obtained can only prove whether the democratic
   understanding of the Chinese people deviates from or is close to liberal
   democracy. This article applied grounded theory to classify respondents'
   answers to an open-ended question. Unlike previous research findings,
   this article's findings showed that even Chinese people's democratic
   understanding has certain procedural or substantive elements. However,
   this understanding consists of only emphasizing their rights and
   interests under the Communist Party of China-led system rather than
   being more inclined toward liberal democracy. Additionally, the higher
   effective response rates for closed-ended questions suggested that
   Chinese people need a higher level of political knowledge and engagement
   in public affairs to form their own understanding of democracy when
   answering an open-ended question. We argue that although closed-ended
   questions are more convenient for statistical analysis, open-ended
   questions with the classification method developed in this study can
   paint a more accurate picture of respondents' understanding of democracy
   in China.},

Abstract = {Citizens' attitudes about the political parties in their countries have
   been linked to their overall satisfaction with their democracy, with
   those feeling great love (hate) for parties feeling more (less)
   satisfied with the democracy. Such strong positive and negative emotions
   require time and clear targets to form. This study demonstrates that the
   influence of interparty affect is greater where the party system has
   institutionalized. Where the public can be familiar with the parties,
   their positions, and their relative status in the party system,
   citizens' attitudes toward the democracy are more informed by their
   feelings about the parties in the system. This article draws on 20 years
   of surveys from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems. It
   demonstrates that the positive effect of positive party affect is
   greater in institutionalized party systems, while the negative effect of
   negative party affect is not. This article thus contributes to political
   science's understanding of affective polarization, the benefits of party
   system institutionalization, and popular democratic commitment.},

Abstract = {During the extermination process of the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire
   in the World War I, there were two related, but dynamically different
   forms of violence at work. The first of these can be termed
   ``top-down{''} violence, in the form of government policies put into
   practice by the ruling Union and Progress Party through the decisions of
   its Central Committee. The other form, ``bottom-up{''} violence, was
   perpetrated by local forces who took advantage of the possibilities and
   opportunities created by wartime conditions and central government
   decisions. The target of both types was the population of Ottoman
   Christians, and the Armenians, first and foremost. The origins of the
   ``top-down{''} violence are to be found in the century of ``accumulated
   experience{''} of the Ottoman regime in dealing with various Christian
   populations within its European territories and their demands for
   greater economic, social, and political rights, as well as the Great
   Power intervention on their behalf. Against this background, the
   Armenian genocide can be seen as a ``preventive measure{''}. Rs main
   purpose was the search for ``permanent security{''}, and in this sense
   the article acts as a case study based on the theses found in Dirk
   Moses' book The Problems of Genocide. As for the phenomenon of
   ``bottom-up{''} violence, the article also presents a number of
   previously unpublished documents that give hints as to the role played
   by different groups-especially the Kurds in the Armenian genocide.},

Abstract = {A common limitation of most analyses of electoral agenda-building
   dynamics is that they tend to operate under the assumption that the
   underlying dynamics between the political actors' and the media's
   agendas are more or less stable across time. Drawing upon recent work on
   media storms, I theorize that political parties have considerably less
   influence in periods that are characterized by sudden and explosive
   increases in media coverage of a particular issue. Using an automated
   content analysis built around a custom-made dictionary, I examine how
   parties' electoral agenda-building efficiency was affected by media
   storms during the 2015 Canadian federal election. My results support the
   idea that storm periods diminish parties' influence on the following
   day's media agenda, as the impact of parties' daily issue attention tend
   to be weaker. These findings demonstrate the non-linearity of electoral
   agenda-building dynamics and imply that some electoral contexts are less
   conducive to political actors' influence.},

Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},

Abstract = {This article examines how challenger parties enter the political arena
   and the effect of this entry by looking at the Italian 5 Star Movement
   (Movimento 5 Stelle - M5S). We explain the M5S's entry strategy in 2013
   using the spatial approach to party competition and employing expert
   survey data collected for each national election between 2008 and 2018.
   These data allow us to analyse the changing spatial configuration of
   Italian politics due to the increasing salience of pro/anti-EU and
   pro/anti-immigration dimensions. We then apply the theoretical notion of
   the uncovered set (UCS) to trace how the M5S's entry reshaped the
   overall space of party competition, causing a realignment of existing
   parties. This work contributes to the ongoing debate on the electoral
   success of challenger parties and the emerging cleavages and
   polarization of party systems in Western European countries.},

Abstract = {The meaning of ``laicite{''} has gradually changed from the principle
   that the state should abstain from interfering in citizens' lives with
   respect to religious matters to the idea that citizens themselves have
   an obligation to desist from publicly manifesting themselves
   religiously. French citizens were first forbidden to display religious
   symbols or apparel in public schools; this restriction was subsequently
   extended to the public space. Most citizens are not affected by the
   restrictions, but they are a disproportional burden for Muslim women who
   consider wearing a full veil a religious obligation. Ironically, the
   obligation imposed on every citizen to accept the ``choice of
   society{''} is based on values that may be qualified as religious.
   Laicite is, then, an inconsistent idea, apparently banning religions
   from the public space while imposing alternative religious ideas. It
   cannot serve as the basis for disallowing wearing a full veil in public.},

Abstract = {Research has shown that presidents tend to benefit local level
   copartisans when distributing resources, which can improve the provision
   of public goods, such as security. Considering that fear of crime is
   among the main concerns of citizens worldwide, we examine whether
   alignment affects criminality. Drawing on rich administrative data from
   Chile and a regression discontinuity design in close electoral races, we
   study the impact of alignment on a broad set of crimes against the
   person and property-related. We show that aligned municipalities
   experience a significant reduction in crimes that both affect property
   and occur in public. As a potential mechanism, we find that aligned
   municipalities receive more projects to improve urban infrastructure,
   thus making public spaces less vulnerable to crime.},

Abstract = {The Supreme Court's undoing of almost 50 years of precedent asserting a
   constitutional guarantee of abortion rights is a tectonic shift in
   American reproductive health. In this commentary we examine some of the
   likely consequences of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization for
   three groups within American medicine: patients, practicing physicians,
   and physicians-in-training. Using these consequences as a backdrop, we
   explain not only what questions confront each group, but what the moment
   calls them to do in the face of attacks on their bodily autonomy
   (patients), ability to practice (physicians), and decisions where to
   train and practice (medical students).},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {230-250},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recently, many comparativists and democratic theorists have argued that
   democracy is in imminent peril, even in countries that are thought to be
   its strongholds. But theorists like Andrew Gamble, Wolfgang Streeck, and
   David Runciman suggest that some democracies are too embedded to
   collapse. Instead, they argue these democracies are experiencing
   long-term structural crises. This article explains how this alternative
   kind of crisis works. It conceives of legitimacy crises as `chronic
   crises' in which democratic procedures are contested even as the
   democratic political system is affirmed. In these crises, democracies
   are threatened by distortion and deadlock rather than death. The article
   gives a precise account of chronic legitimacy crises. It treats
   legitimacy as a scalar concept, going beyond binary views where
   legitimacy is something a state either has or lacks. It distinguishes
   periods of chronic crisis from stable periods and from acute crises. It
   shows how chronic crises are distinctively about legitimacy. It carves
   out conceptual space for a different kind of legitimacy crisis, and it
   assists comparativists in thinking about how younger democracies differ
   from older ones.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Violent extremism is an ambiguous and politically loaded concept, and -
   at the national level - the parameters used to define it are usually
   framed by the state, powerful ruling elites, and members of the
   international community, either directly or indirectly through
   donor-funded projects. Although different types of violent extremism and
   extremist movements exist in Kenya, donors and the state often focus on
   religiously-inspired groups such as Al-Shabaab, the Islamic State,
   Al-Qaeda, and affiliated networks such as the Al-Muhajiroun, Al-Hijra,
   and Jaysh Al-Ayman. However, at a community level, participants in our
   body map workshops highlighted gang violence, police brutality,
   ethnically motivated violence, marginalisation, discrimination, and
   gender-based violence as priorities in defining violent extremism. We
   conclude that constructions of violent extremism at the local level are
   shaped by lived experiences of everyday insecurities influenced by
   gender, ethnicity, social status, location, and interactions with the
   state. To effectively address violent extremism in Kenya and beyond, its
   definition needs to be contextualised in ways that take into
   consideration local perspectives and everyday experiences of violence
   and insecurity.},

Abstract = {A surge in the spread of fake news after a terror attack such as the
   2018 Surabaya bombings has been observed in recent times. It was clear
   that the spread of fake news (i.e., information disorder {[}ID]) can
   amplify the social impact and consequences of a terror attack on the
   local community. However, research on the prevalence of ID in connection
   to a terror incident is not well-studied in Southeast Asia (SEA). To
   address this gap systematically, this study describes an approach taken
   to study this nexus between the spread of ID in connection to a terror
   attack. By drawing on the Global Terrorism Database and manual searches,
   a case study bank of 39 terror incidents with instances of ID in SEA
   from 2015 to 2019 was created through the use of a mix of automated and
   human workflows. This exploratory study sought to document the kinds of
   ID that emerged in English language media after a terror incident in SEA
   and to identify implications for the field of ID as well as terrorism},

Abstract = {The aim of the essay is to explore the notion of duration within
   Schmitt's epistemological framework. If at first glance Schmitt sets out
   to formulate a theoretical framework that has its fulcrum in the
   constitution of a sociology of juridical concepts (to be understood as
   `Political Theology') - according to which a sort of mapping of the
   epochal movement of concepts is reconstructed through which the process
   of the collective dynamics through which and in which men organise
   themselves and produce their present is shown (a profoundly rational
   structure centred around the concept of sovereignty born with the modern
   state); subsequently, having ascertained the failure of such a project
   due to its inability to counter liberal theories, Schmitt, thanks above
   all to his reading of `institutionalist' authors, modifies his framework
   by centring his theory on the use of the political myth (an operation
   widely visible in the Nazi years). This essay will move through these
   phases and attempt to draw conclusions from a possible (non-)use of
   Schmitt in conceptualising the formation practices of political groups.},

Abstract = {In the 85 years since the evocation of the two-state solution (i.e., a
   Jewish state and a Palestinian Arab state living side by side in peace
   and security), not a single Palestinian Arab leader has ever evinced any
   true liking for the idea or acted in a way signifying an unqualified
   embrace of it. Allowing their anti-Jewish hatred and obsession with
   violence to get the better of them, Palestinian leaders have repeatedly
   dragged their hapless constituents into disastrous conflicts that
   culminated in their collective undoing and continued statelessness. So
   long as Palestinian society does not undergo a comprehensive
   transformation that will sweep the corrupt and oppressive PLO and Hamas
   regimes from power, eliminate endemic violence from political and social
   life, and teach the virtues of coexistence with Israel, the two-state
   solution will remain a pipe dream.},

Abstract = {There have been calls for greater financial independence for integrity
   agencies, and this paper seeks to advance understanding of the options
   available to achieve this by assessing the legislation and issues for
   Australasian Auditors General. Audit offices are the oldest form of
   integrity agency and have the most detailed previous consideration of
   their financial independence. The paper identifies four characteristics:
   control, transparency, adequacy and certainty and key features for each.
   Analysis indicates that in four jurisdictions the Executive keeps a
   tight rein, in three there is a recognition for a significant role for
   the Parliament and in the remaining two this role is dominant. As there
   isn't a consistent approach to funding and there are many differences of
   detail, the paper develops a checklist of key provisions to inform
   decisions regarding the funding of audit offices and integrity agencies
   more generally. The paper observes that an increased role for Parliament
   in funding can raise new challenges for independence including the
   tensions between the interests of Government and Opposition MPs and the
   ability of committees to function effectively.},

Title = {Who Is ``On Welfare{''}? Validating the Use of Conjoint Experiments to
   Measure Stereotype Content},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-110},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We use the case of welfare recipients to validate conjoint experiments
   as a measure of stereotype content. Stereotypes are politically
   consequential, but their content can be difficult to measure. The
   conjoint measure of stereotype content, in which respondents see
   profiles describing hypothetical persons and rate these persons' degree
   of belonging to the target group, offers several advantages over
   existing measures. However, no existing work evaluates the validity of
   this new measure. We evaluate this measurement technique using the case
   of welfare recipients. Stereotypes of welfare recipients are politically
   important and extensively studied, providing strong a priori
   expectations for portions of the stereotype, especially race, gender,
   and ``deservingness.{''} At the same time, scholars disagree about the
   importance of another attribute with important political implications:
   immigration status. We find that aggregate stereotypes, measured via a
   conjoint experiment, match the strong a priori expectations: white
   Americans see welfare recipients as black, female, and violating the
   norms of work ethic. Individual-level stereotypes also predict welfare
   policy support-even when other demographic and ideological factors are
   accounted for. We also find that immigration status is not a part of the
   welfare recipient stereotype for most Americans, but support for welfare
   is lower among those who do stereotype welfare recipients as
   undocumented immigrants. Finally, we suggest an improvement in the
   conjoint task instructions. Overall, we confirm that conjoint
   experiments provide a valid measure of stereotypes.},

Title = {When Do Men MPs Claim to Represent Women in Plenary Debates-Time-Series
   Cross-Sectional Evidence from the German States},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},

Volume = {76},

Abstract = {Extensive scholarly work engages with the growing number of women in
   legislatures around the world and highlights their role as advocates of
   women's interests during parliamentary decision-making processes. This
   article sheds light on the reactions of men MPs (members of parliament)
   to this trend by uncovering how women's numerical strength in party
   parliamentary groups shapes the issues that their men colleagues
   emphasize when speaking about women during plenary debates. I argue
   that, the higher the share of women in a party parliamentary group, the
   more will men representatives emphasize women's interests in the context
   of issues they can easily relate to-either because the issues lie in
   men's area of responsibility according to ideas about traditional role
   distributions in the society, for example, the financing of gender
   equality projects, or because they are part of broader patterns of
   societal inequality, such as poverty or health. I provide empirical
   evidence for this argument based on original time-series cross-sectional
   data from plenary debates in six German states between 2005 and 2021
   using a structural topic model. These findings shed light on men's role
   as critical actors and have implications for gender equality and the
   functioning of representative democracy more broadly.},

Abstract = {What role do domestic institutional and structural factors play in the
   emergence of national macroprudential regimes? So far, the literature on
   macroprudential policy has mainly focused on transnational processes of
   knowledge production. We therefore still know very little about what
   causes the observed differences in macroprudential regimes at a country
   level. The paper addresses this issue by way of an examination of
   housing sector related macroprudential policies in the UK and Germany.
   It finds that part of the reason for the observed differences is to be
   found in the fact that macroprudential authorities in the two countries
   tend to construct the intermediate goals of their macroprudential
   interventions in somewhat different ways, with the UK paying much
   greater attention to broader macroeconomic outcomes. These differences
   themselves, however, can only be properly understood in relation to the
   wider institutional and structural context (including different types of
   growth models) within the two countries, which create different links
   between their housing sectors and the real economy.},

Abstract = {The article draws on nationally representative telephone surveys in
   Tunisia, Egypt and Lebanon to unpack popular beliefs about who can best
   handle the social and economic consequences from the ongoing COVID-19
   pandemic. It therefore offers insights into state-society relations
   under stress and contributes to the debate on whether or not the state
   should play a key role in social protection. Findings reveal intriguing
   differences between countries, but also among social groups within
   societies. Communal identities and economic status do not appear to
   drive differences, with roughly half of the three countries' populations
   sharing trust in their respective state authorities. In turn, the
   article challenges findings on the gender gap in people's expectations
   about the provision of public goods amid crisis. On the country-level,
   Egyptians exhibit significantly greater trust in their state authorities
   than Tunisians and Lebanese, which substantiates arguments about the
   perceived advantage of autocratic governance to fight health crises.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the strategy India is pursuing to protect its
   interests within the changing dynamics of the Indo-Pacific. The
   Indo-Pacific hailed as a new arena for great-power politics in the
   twenty-first century is marked by extreme unpredictability and
   instability. Although China mostly drives India's Indo-Pacific policy,
   New Delhi has been reluctant to acknowledge this. India is sending a
   message that it supports the Quad ideals, engagement with China, and the
   importance of the ASEAN in the Indo-Pacific by participating
   concurrently in the ASEAN, Quad, RIC, SCO, and BRICS. The article makes
   the case that the concept of ``hedging{''} is the best explanation for
   India's policy in the Indo-Pacific. As a result, this article examines
   the hedging component of India's Indo-Pacific policy as well as the
   driving factors of such a policy choice. Besides, the article also
   explores the significant constraints that can potentially limit India's
   hedging policy in the Indo-Pacific.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the new character of the strategy of the
   Republican People's Party (CHP) using populism to combat the success of
   the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). We consider populism
   along a left-right axis in terms of the differentiation of exclusionary
   and inclusionary approaches and conduct a content analysis of campaign
   speeches by Ekrem Imamoglu during the 2019 local elections, as well as
   speeches of the party elites given during the currency crisis of 2018
   and the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that an alternative to the
   exclusionary right-wing populism may construct images of egalitarianism,
   participatory budgeting, and agrarian populism instead of mobilizing
   security or survival issues.},

Abstract = {How do politicians allocate public resources? Despite the extensive
   literature on distributive politics, we have limited micro-level
   evidence for why and under what circumstances politicians choose various
   allocation strategies. India's discretionary constituency development
   scheme (MPLADS) provides an excellent opportunity to study the spending
   choices of individual politicians. Drawing on an original dataset
   linking voting patterns across 227,507 villages in the 2009 general
   elections to MPLADS allocations 2009-2014, we find that politicians
   generally channel more projects and resources to villages that vote for
   them in higher numbers. We then leverage a natural experiment created by
   the delimitation (redistricting) of electoral boundaries in 2008 to
   provide causal evidence that spending choices are driven by short-term
   electoral incentives. Finally, we show that allocation patterns differ
   by the type of party that has brought a politician to power. Our
   findings contribute to the growing literature on heterogeneity in
   politicians' distributional choices.},

Title = {When the Nation Conquered the State: Arendt's Importance Today},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {355-381},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This essay focuses on the contemporary relevance of Hannah Arendt's work
   insofar as it relates to US racism, imperialism, and migration. While
   Arendt denied that US migration policy and racism were linked or even
   similar to exercises of racialized sovereignty, totalitarian tactics,
   and mass displacement in Europe, I suggest that her analyses help us to
   understand important racialized dialectics between prison and camp,
   citizen and stateless, and external displacement and internal
   displacement. In effect, this essay suggests that many of Arendt's
   analyses of racism, migration, and camps are more relevant to US history
   and contemporary US reality than she did or would have admitted.
   Arendt's work importantly suggested that the stateless were so rightless
   that they lacked even criminal rights. In many respects, the
   criminal-stateless binary accurately illustrates the rightlessness of
   refugees in contrast to the rights of US citizen-criminals. However, she
   partly fails to recognize how the dialectical opposition between
   foreigner and citizen-criminal could lead to less visible forms of
   overlap and convergence. Arendt's binary also indicates an adherence to
   crypto-normativity, despite her professed antifoundational approach to
   political issues. Together, her theoretical strengths and certain
   failures illuminate our own (mis)understandings of a set of complex
   circumstances experienced today.},

Abstract = {The literature on legislative voting either explicitly excludes free
   votes from its analysis, does not distinguish them from other recorded
   votes, or analyses only topic-specific subsets of them. This research
   note shows all three approaches to be problematic, and argues for a
   reconsideration of how free votes are approached in the literature.
   Drawing on a dataset covering all recorded votes in the German Bundestag
   (1949-2021), and analysing the topics, initiators and voting behaviour
   on all free votes held, it is shown that free votes are frequent,
   address a broad range of issues, and display substantial variation in
   legislative behaviour. Most importantly, there is a strong indication
   that free votes are held on topics on which parties refrain from taking
   a position. The findings have substantial implications for the study of
   parliamentary floor voting.},

Abstract = {This article provides the first exhaustive quantitative account of the
   Supreme Court of Canada's use of the term ``cooperative federalism.{''}
   We find that cooperative federalism has appeared in twenty-four Supreme
   Court decisions from 1976 to 2019, and that these decisions have been
   more likely to favor the federal government than the provinces.
   Moreover, the Court's use of the term can be divided between two
   distinct periods. During the formative period (1976-2009), the Court
   used the term fairly consistently. From 2010 to 2019, the Court has
   entered a contested period characterized by split decisions in which the
   Court is divided over differing conceptions of federalism. As
   cooperative federalism has transformed from a relatively vague concept
   into a more substantive constitutional principle, fissures over the
   term's application have developed. This article shows how scholarly
   terminology can have an unexpected and even dispositive effect on
   judicial decisions, which can reflect uncertainty over how judges
   understand their institutional role.},

Abstract = {Government services act as important sites of political socialization.
   Through interactions with the state individuals learn lessons about
   their value as citizens, form preferences over government services, and
   understand the value of political participation. What happens when the
   private sector replaces government provision of basic services? I
   explore this question in the context of a randomized private school
   voucher experiment in India. Based on an original household survey of
   1200 households, and semi-structured interviews conducted 5 years after
   the voucher lottery, I find that voucher winning households hold
   stronger market-oriented beliefs. However, voucher winning households
   show little difference in political participation on most measures of
   political participation. I argue that these results are driven by a
   greater comfort with private providers as permanent economic actors.
   This suggests exposure to different economic actors, in the form of
   private schools, have the potential to change political preferences.},

Abstract = {Scholars have made important advances in explaining policy drift,
   uncovering the prevalence of drift in veto-riddled systems, the
   importance of bureaucratic discretion and statutory ambiguity in
   combatting drift, and its feedback effects. Despite research
   demonstrating the potential for judicial action to alleviate drift, we
   know little about the potential for the Supreme Court to facilitate
   policy drift. I argue that the Supreme Court may operate as a powerful
   agent of drift by stripping statutes of ambiguity, foreclosing policy
   innovation in institutions outside of Congress, and curtailing
   bureaucratic discretion and authority. To demonstrate these mechanisms,
   I show how in the case of federal labor law, the Court's jurisprudence
   addressing the right to strike, federal preemption, and National Labor
   Relations Board authority played a central role in gradually undoing the
   efficacy of The National Labor Relations Act. This inquiry has important
   implications for understanding public policy, judicial power, the
   development of American labor law, and American democracy.},

Abstract = {The China-US great power relationship appears to have entered a stage in
   which anarchy is less responsive to the control mechanisms that allowed
   a certain degree of methodological predictability in much of the
   post-WWII international relations. The present research aims to offer an
   introductory analysis of this problematic. For this end, we pose the
   following exploratory questions: What are the parameters of the new
   anarchy in the China-US great power relationship? What kind of
   international relations does this situation allow us to envision?
   Finally, what are the methodological implications of the new anarchy? At
   the same time, certain caveats apply. This article is an introductory
   endeavor seeking to highlight the need for methodological innovations to
   account for contemporary international relations in the context of great
   power rivalry. It does not suggest that the existing explanatory models
   are altogether inapplicable. Rather, while agreeing that there is always
   room for innovation in both structural and agential theories, this
   article essentially underlines the need for the revision of existing
   models such as balance of power, hegemony, and interdependence to better
   explain the China-US great power rivalry under anarchy.},

Abstract = {The idea of `counter-control' has greatly added to Philip Pettit's
   theoretical framework of freedom as non-domination, not only helping
   Pettit to meet prominent analytical criticisms from contemporary liberal
   theorists, but also helping to better illuminate the possibility of
   `unmoralized' interference without domination. But while this idea has
   helped to increase the attractiveness of freedom as non-domination as a
   philosophical ideal, it has also revealed some disparities between
   Pettit's theoretical framework and the practical model of governance to
   which he ascribes - disparities which call into question the model's
   overall ability to guard against imperium and tackle the issue of
   political legitimacy. In this paper, I review two of these disconnects.
   First, I discuss how Pettit's interpretation of `individualized'
   influence leads him to overlook some of the institutions that would be
   necessary to satisfy this theoretical constraint. Second, I illustrate
   how Pettit fails to account for his own axiom of positionality when
   discussing the institutions that allow citizens to exert `unconditioned'
   influence, or `control' over legislative direction. In concluding, I
   draw several inferences from these arguments for neo-republicans
   continuing to engage in democracy-building.},

Abstract = {September 2022 marks twenty-five years since the referendum on the
   creation of the Scottish Parliament. From the early days of devolution,
   debates over Holyrood's tax powers have been a recurring theme. Recent
   reforms to the Parliament's tax powers have been driven by the Scottish
   National Party and the Scottish Conservatives, an indirect coming
   together of arguments from two unlikely political allies. Both have,
   however, embraced arguments for greater autonomy and fiscal
   responsibility within Scottish devolution. This article reflects upon
   the experience of enhanced tax devolution in Scotland through the lens
   of three competing `logics' of devolution, namely: a logic of
   `accumulating competencies'; `delivering fiscal responsibility'; and
   `capacity to pursue distinct policies'.},

Abstract = {Some authors have suggested that the All Affected Interests Principle,
   an influential principle of political inclusion, requires that animals
   have their interests politically represented. In this paper, I provide a
   systematic formulation, assessment, and defense of this argument, and
   suggest a middle way between two strategies found in the literature. On
   the one hand, I argue that applying the All Affected Interests to
   animals inevitably requires that we make some (potentially
   controversial) assumptions about the weight and scope of animal
   interests, and cannot remain morally noncommittal. This is because most
   formulations of the principle do not apply to all interests, but only to
   those that satisfy a relevancy test - which requires first-order moral
   reasoning. On the other hand, I also contend that one can defend some
   substantive claims about the inclusion of animals via the All Affected
   Interests Principle without having to endorse a comprehensive account of
   animal rights, or a theory about the worth of natural entities. For the
   All Affected Interests Principle to apply to animals, all that we need
   are instances of normatively relevant interests systematically affected
   by political decisions. The interest of mammals in avoiding pain and
   suffering, I contend, provides such an example.},

   significant changes to the region's political balance. For the first

   leading position allowing the party to provide the First Minister. The
   main party of unionism, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was
   relegated to second place. This runner-up position entitled the party to
   nominate the Deputy First Minister. However, in the immediate aftermath
   of the election, the DUP declined to do so, amid a crisis for the
   political institutions established under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
   According to the DUP, it would return to power sharing with nationalists
   only upon removal of the European Union Protocol, agreed between the EU
   and UK government in 2019. The Protocol uniquely aligns Northern Ireland
   with EU rules and requires checks on goods travelling between Great
   Britain and Northern Ireland. Alongside unionist versus nationalist
   rivalries, however, the election was also marked by the best-ever
   performance by a party of the centre ground subscribing to neither
   ideology, as Alliance more than doubled its Assembly seat tally. It was
   now possible to speak of three big pillars in Northern Irish politics:
   unionist, nationalist and non-aligned, each dominated by a single party.
   This article examines what happened at the election, assessing the key
   issues and party fortunes.},

Abstract = {Scholars and commentators are increasingly concerned about the erosion
   of democratic norms in the United States. Political science education
   stands at the forefront of higher education's mission to create an
   educated citizenry, and civic education is linked to outcomes like civic
   engagement and trust in government. Much of the research on civic
   education, however, examines how different classroom interventions
   affect students' intentions of engaging civically in the future. This
   study argues that between intention and action lies agency.
   Specifically, it examines how an introductory course in American
   government influences the development of civic agency. A new
   scenario-based method of measuring civic agency is also introduced. The
   study finds that civic agency does in fact develop, with students
   sharpening their calculus of engagement by the end of the course. In
   other words, students better understand where they can best engage and
   how as a result of taking this course. Increasing agency at this early
   juncture of the university curriculum, we argue, lays the foundation for
   future engagement when students care about an issue enough to weigh in.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses circumstances under which post-conflict
   humanitarian-development interventions may post success despite
   exacerbating population's vulnerability. It concerns Mercy Corps' (MC)
   Revitalisation of Agricultural Incomes and New Markets (RAIN) project in
   Lamwo District, Northern Uganda. MC identified market access as key
   component of community resilience measuring it through technical
   feedback processes. In its own terms, RAIN has proved successful, and
   the market became robust. However, a less narrow evaluation revealed
   RAIN's negative impact including diminished food security, increased
   child malnutrition, domestic and gender-based violence. On any rational
   understanding of resilience, interventions appeared to compromise rather
   than enhance population's resilience.},

Abstract = {To what extent do ministries dominate a particular policy domain? The
   policy dictator model and many principle-agent models of governmental
   control that followed suit assume that governments create ministries
   with clear and exclusive policy responsibilities. We test this assertion
   using data from parliamentary bills from Denmark, Germany, and the
   Netherlands. For each bill, we observe its substantial policy content
   and the responsible ministry. The data show that bills on similar issues
   regularly are drafted by different ministries in parliamentary
   democracies. About 40 per cent of policy issues cannot be ascribed to
   one dominant ministry. The regularities elucidate that ministerial
   division of labour within governments is considerably more complex than
   commonly assumed. The variegated level of ministerial dominance across
   policy domains calls for a new research agenda on how governments assign
   responsibility for legislative action in parliamentary democracies.},

Abstract = {Acknowledging the multiple ways capitalism fails humanity and the
   planet, regularly triggering anticapitalist resistance, this essay
   employs the term ``dialectic of failure{''} to examine how capitalist
   failures often boost profits and facilitate capitalism's reproduction.
   This tendency for capitalism's failures to create opportunities as well
   as risks for itself is analyzed with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   After first analyzing the pandemic as a capitalist failure, and while
   acknowledging the social-justice and anticapitalist struggles the
   pandemic has given rise to, the essay examines how the pandemic may also
   be facilitating capital accumulation and the reproduction of the
   prevailing socioeconomic order.},

Abstract = {Social media have reshaped how people achieve, retain, and perform
   celebrity. This, in turn, has re-shaped how celebrity and politics
   intersect. We contend that the established concept of the `celebrity
   politician' no longer captures all of the most common celebrity
   practices of highly visible political figures. This is because
   politicians increasingly model their public personae on internet
   celebrities. We substantiate this argument with an analysis of a
   specific micro-celebrity practice adopted by Italian populist leader,
   Matteo Salvini: the `good morning selfie.' We argue that Salvini borrows
   the practice of good morning selfies from social media influencers to
   build perceived interconnectedness and affective intimacy with his
   audience of (prospective) constituents. We conclude that the ideal type
   of the celebrity politician can and should be updated for the digital
   age with a new figure we tentatively call the `influencer politician'.},

Abstract = {The unequal distribution of resources is fractal throughout the country,
   even in entities such as Guanajuato with high potential and economic
   growth; Where development alternatives are needed to serve the less
   favored regions of that entity, such is the case of the Sierra de los
   Agustinos subregion, where there is a high intensity migration problem
   caused by unemployment, in a context of strong commercial orientation
   and latent technological qualities. In this sense, the objective of this
   article is to determine whether e-commerce can reduce unemployment and
   consequently migration generating conditions of development; the
   methodology used and fieldwork provided results that indicate that the
   adoption of e-commerce can influence unemployment, which in turn can
   influence the intensity of migration in the region studied.},

Abstract = {While central to theories of polarization and primary elections,
   surprisingly little evidence shows that partisans favor candidates who
   take ideologically consistent issue positions, above other
   considerations, in intraparty contests. In this study, we investigate
   how voters weigh policy and nonpolicy differences when evaluating
   same-party politicians, using novel conjoint experiments that manipulate
   the demographic, biographical, and issue information of congressional
   candidates. We recruit 4,093 participants in the 2016 Cooperative
   Congressional Election Study, assigning half to either rate same-party
   candidates on an ideological scale or choose between them in
   primary-like settings. We find that voters place candidates along
   coherent policy lines and give greater support to those taking
   party-consistent issue positions. We also find evidence of affinity
   voting on shared racial, gender, and religious characteristics, though
   effects are typically smaller. Our results underscore how informed
   partisans' policy attitudes can drive choices in primary elections,
   including which candidates contest them.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the securitisation of COVID-19 in the United
   States was publicly contested. Reviewing the wider securitisation
   scholarship, it outlines five different kinds of contestation:
   securitisation failure, contestation within, counter-securitisation, the
   securitisation of securitisation, and desecuritization. Considering
   these within a discourse analysis of how COVID-19 was securitised and
   contested by both key political figures and protestors between 1 January
   2020 and 30 May 2020, the paper finds that the securitisation of
   COVID-19 took two forms. One used war metaphors to represent COVID-19 as
   a `foreign enemy' to be (quickly) conquered, while the other represented
   normality - everyday economic and social activity - as dangerous. The
   former saw efforts to desecuritize and `close' the threat, while the
   latter was securitised as a threat itself. Ultimately, COVID-19 was
   downgraded to a manageable risk, while measures that recognised its
   continuing threat were depicted as existential threats to American
   lives, jobs, prosperity, and freedoms.},

Abstract = {Claims about international relations and political science more broadly
   becoming more globalized coexist with enduring critiques of the
   discipline being dominated by scholars from wealthier Western countries.
   This article leverages data on publication patterns between 2008 and
   2020 in the Argentine IR community, which we believe is a relevant and
   potentially representative sample from the Global South, to show that
   the discipline is becoming more globalized yet also more segmented. We
   argue that this segmentation is a product of unequal participation in
   social and professional networks. The norms and information that
   circulate through these networks shape the inclination as well as the
   ability of Global South scholars to join a globalizing discipline.},

Abstract = {This text represents an analysis of the controversies of the relations
   of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of Argentine with the
   military regime in 1976-1983, based on the documents of the CC archive
   of the CPSU. In the context of the international socialist system and
   the international communist movement entering the crisis, its relations
   with the military dictatorship presented a series of political problems,
   which correlated and conditioned the attitudes of all parties: the
   Argentine communists occupied the position of support for the regime
   concerned with the preservation of the structures and apparatus of the
   party, justifying it by the interests of the USSR in economic
   collaboration with Argentina, and on another side, the Soviet part
   followed its policy of economic cooperation with the military regime
   having its approval by the part of the Argentine CP. These attitudes
   towards the Argentine military dictatorship provoked complications
   within the international communist movement, half-solved by the CPSU
   without being able to avoid a certain isolation of the Argentine CP.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study is to analyze smart-philosophy, which refers to the
   priority research based on the new interaction between man and society.
   The methodological basis of the study is the synergetic approach, in the
   context of which new realities are ``smart{''} with innovative
   potential. The informational approach to the analysis of society is
   based on the synergetic, nonlinear methodology, the analysis of which is
   applicable to the global transformation's characteristic of
   autoreflexive societies of high complexity. It also uses methods for
   measuring the ``smart society{''} - anthropological and
   socio-axiological, based on people, education, the movement towards the
   ``society of innovation{''} and knowledge. It is concluded that the
   breakthrough in the system of information and communication technologies
   has determined profound meaningful changes in all spheres of social
   activity, which is the theoretical autoreflexion of modernity and its
   dominant direction. The result of the study is the conceptualization of
   the smart-philosophy of the XXI century as the highest stage of
   civilizational development of mankind.},

   one of the pillars of the Trans Agenda for Liberation, in order to
   discuss how nation-state citizenship and migrant deportation regimes
   converge to make home impossible for many living in the United States.
   Beloved Home especially foregrounds genders and sexualities, in their
   interactions with (settler) colonialism, racial capitalism, and slavery,
   as generating and legitimating `unhoming' through logics of normative
   family and home, and highlights transgender, queer and feminist
   scholarship and activisms as resources/tools for transformation.},

Abstract = {Drawing from arguments within sexuality/gender studies, I argue that we
   need to move away from the rigid binary thinking and ideological
   blindness that pervades much contemporary politics, and be more `queer',
   if you will. To this end, we need to move beyond a focus predominantly
   on critique and recognise the need for both tradition and critique
   within citizenship studies itself and societal politics more generally.
   I argue that we need to move beyond narratives that are (deliberately,
   or not) founded on an exclusionary logic that divides and instead better
   recognize the need for - and power of - tradition in a dialectical
   relationship with critique. This is a serious challenge but one that may
   be best achieved through a transformative politics of justice,
   generosity, and forgiveness, where we work through painful histories
   such that we can engage the Other in a spirit of hospitality.},

Abstract = {In an increasingly tight job market, the selection of an adviser has
   never been more important to help guide young scholars in their career
   development. Advisers play a critical role in students' careers and
   beyond, from providing substantive help with the dissertation to sharing
   the norms of the discipline, helping them navigate the job market, and
   introducing them to potential collaborators. Yet, many graduate students
   do not know how to go about identifying the best adviser for them. Here,
   we provide some suggestions to graduate students for how best to pick a
   dissertation adviser and other mentors, noting some of the most
   important aspects of the relationship and highlighting some of the most
   critical elements to look for in finding an appropriate and helpful
   adviser.},

Title = {Self-interest, transitional cosmopolitanism and the motivational problem},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-86},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {It is often argued that cosmopolitanism faces unique motivational
   constraints, asking more of individuals than they are able to give. This
   `motivational problem' is held to pose a significant challenge to
   cosmopolitanism, as it appears unable to transform its moral demands
   into motivated political action. This article develops a novel response
   to the motivational problem facing cosmopolitanism, arguing that
   self-interest, alongside appeals to sentiment, can play a vital and
   neglected, transitional role in moving towards an expanded
   cosmopolitical condition. The article explicates the `motivational
   problem', analyses the relationship between self-interest and
   sentimental cosmopolitanism in addressing it, and develops a series of
   claims that self-interest can be one important component in what we
   label as `transitional cosmopolitanism'. In doing so, we argue that
   self-interested motivations can be compatible with sentiment-based
   approaches, rendering them more plausible. In addition, two expected
   critiques of self-interested `transitional cosmopolitanism' are tackled:
   (A) That it cannot address feasibility constraints, and (B) That
   self-interested motivations cannot meet what an `authentic'
   cosmopolitanism entails. We refute and challenge these critiques and
   outline three conditions in which self-interest can advance a
   transitional form of cosmopolitanism, while also being compatible with
   cosmopolitanism writ large.},

Abstract = {Many were taken aback by the initial spike in support for Black Lives
   Matter among white Americans during the summer of 2020. But will these
   antiracist attitudes translate into antiracist behavior? Accordingly, I
   ask under what conditions do white Americans engage in antiracist
   behavior? To answer this question, I build upon the insights of Martin
   Luther King, Jr., and A. Philip Randolph to theorize contemporary white
   antiracism. I argue that, under neoliberal capitalism, the conditions
   they laid out as necessary for the cultivation of productive antiracist
   politics have been difficult to satisfy. In lieu of that, in many
   instances, has been the privatization of racial responsibility, which I
   coin to describe a form of antiracist politics that relies upon white
   individuals' sympathetic (and often symbolic) gestures rather than the
   implementation of more state programs to address structural racial
   injustices. I discuss what this development might mean for the Black
   Lives Matter movement-and the Black Freedom Struggle writ large-moving
   forward.},

Abstract = {Politicians will cultivate their personal vote if electoral rules foster
   competition within parties. We examine how the value of the party brand
   in the competition between parties affects how politicians attempt to
   build up their personal vote. Theoretically, if party valence is low,
   intra-party crowdedness intensifies, since a given number of candidates
   must vie for a smaller number of expected seats. In addition to this
   first mechanism, a poor party brand should generally (under weak
   assumptions about candidates' beliefs) encourage less party-oriented and
   more person-oriented candidate campaigns. Empirically, we examine this
   argument in the context of the 2011 Irish legislative election. The
   incumbent Fianna Fail struggled with its toxic party brand, as it was
   widely regarded as being responsible for the crash of the Celtic Tiger,
   whereas Fine Gael consistently led the polls. A content analysis of our
   own collection of campaign leaflets suggests that, in 2011, Fianna Fail
   candidates ran much more personal campaigns than their Fine Gael
   counterparts, even when adjusting for the level of intra-party
   competition. For the campaign four years earlier, candidate survey data
   do not suggest such a difference. These findings suggest that low party
   valence contributes to personal vote-seeking.},

   voters?{*}},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {78},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Ageing is often believed to induce a movement towards the right of the
   political spectrum. Yet, empirical evidence remains inconclusive due to
   a dearth of longitudinal datasets covering multiple cohorts. Using
   eleven rotating panels of the Norwegian Election Studies (1977-2017) and
   exploiting first-derivative properties of the vote choice function, our
   empirical approach identifies non-linear life-cycle effects while
   controlling for cohort and period effects. Our main findings indicate
   that shifting towards the left is more likely among the young (under 40
   years) whereas shifting towards the right occurs at an older age (over
   55 years). Evaluating potential mechanisms, we find that individuals'
   income, retirement, family status and political interest explain only a
   small part of the observed ageing effect. Life-cycle shifts in (some)
   policy preferences may play a bigger role. Finally, aging effects are
   similar across women and men, and only marginally stronger among groups
   with lower education and income levels.},

Abstract = {At the beginning of 2022, just as the globalizing world was entering the
   post-Covid period and the United Nations Climate Change Conference
   declared a ``code red{''} emergency for the climate crisis at COP 27, a
   strategically calculated move came from Russian President Vladimir Putin
   to unlawfully invade Ukraine. From the beginning, the invasion of
   Ukraine has generated impacts much larger and more transformative than
   any previous crisis, triggering serious crisis-ridden developments in
   the international system and globalization and forcing national
   governments and global actors to recalibrate and reposition. It is in
   this global and broader context NATO's Madrid Summit and its ``new
   Strategic Concept{''} should be analyzed and assessed. This paper argues
   that the summit is historic, necessary, but not sufficient. To
   substantiate this argument, it analyzes is NATO's new strategic concept
   in detail, exploring its critical importance, its transformative effect
   and the six challenges that it faces.},

Abstract = {Analyses of political, economic, and social actors' discourses in favour
   or against gender quotas are extensive but, to date, only a handful of
   opinion studies have examined support for such a controversial policy
   whose enactment does not necessarily dissolve opposition. This is
   particularly the case of citizens holding modern sexism attitudes who
   dismiss or resent quotas using the language of equality. This article
   examines how support for this policy can be shaped through legitimacy
   cues and question wording. The empirical analysis builds on two framing
   experiments embedded in a representative survey fielded in Catalonia
   (Spain), where gender quotas in politics and private businesses were
   introduced over a decade ago. Our results show that, even among
   respondents holding modern sexism attitudes, priming the legal framework
   yields positive effects on support for electoral quotas, whilst the
   endorsement of gender balance in corporate boards increases when the
   question does not mention the word quotas.},

Abstract = {The paper investigates the role of political ideology and an open-minded
   thinking style (i.e., the tendency to reason based on rules of inference
   rather than intuitive heuristics) with respect to the accuracy of
   factual beliefs. In line with political asymmetry theory, we assumed
   that right-wing beliefs, in contrast to left-wing beliefs, are
   associated with more inaccurate factual beliefs. We also expected that
   the open-minded thinking style acts as a buffer against inaccurate
   factual beliefs among people with right-wing (but not left-wing)
   political affinities. To test these hypotheses, we conducted three
   studies (total N = 1120) in which participants holding right- and
   left-wing beliefs, and displaying differing degrees of the open-minded
   thinking style (as measured by the Active Open-minded Thinking Style
   questionnaire), assessed policy-relevant facts congenial to left- as
   well as right-wing beliefs. The results of the study confirm the
   hypotheses proposed. The paper's findings contribute to the ongoing
   discussion around the ideological underpinnings of (un)biased cognition
   and the controversies concerning the role of cognitive factors in
   ideological polarization.},

Abstract = {The representation of East Germans in elite positions has been a broadly
   debated topic. Most studies show that, comparative to other elite
   sectors, East Germans are best represented in politics. However, in some
   areas of the political sector, like the federal government, we find very
   few East Germans, despite Angela Merkel's chancellorship. This paper
   looks at East German representation in parliamentary leadership
   positions. It finds East Germans remain underrepresented in these
   positions, especially outside of The Left. It explores three explanatory
   approaches: (1) there are not enough East Germans in the recruitment
   pool, (2) East German members lack the desired qualifications and (3)
   the leadership recruitment process is biased against East Germans. Using
   statistical analysis based on a biographical dataset including all MPs
   from the 13th to the 18th legislative period, it finds that both low
   East German membership in the Bundestag and the existence of a bias lead
   to underrepresentation of East Germans in those positions. While The
   Left tries to strongly represent East German interests by recruiting
   them into leadership positions, East Germans' access to these positions
   in all other party parliamentary groups remains low. This has negative
   effects on the substantive representation of East Germans and on their
   trust in representative democracy.},

Abstract = {Research and attention to federalism has vastly increased due to the
   COVID-19 pandemic. While political polarization has largely been used as
   a scapegoat to explain the U.S. policy response to the pandemic,
   federalism has also been credited and blamed for the policy response and
   has played an important role in providing avenues for conflict. This
   article explores intra-state conflict stemming from COVID-19. We utilize
   ten exploratory cases to identify three distinct but interrelated
   patterns of conflict that emerged within U.S. states, focusing on
   tensions between the executive and legislative branches, between
   bureaucratic officials and the legislature, and between state and local
   governments. We then examine a series of questions regarding the
   implication of these conflicts, focusing on the issuance of executive
   orders, the responses undertaken by officials who disagreed with and
   sought to push back against these orders, and the ways that inter-branch
   and inter-governmental disagreements about these orders were resolved.},

Abstract = {Social democratic parties have experienced a profound electoral crisis
   in recent years. We study who still supports the centre-left by
   analysing two different ties to social democracy: vote choice and party
   identification. We develop a simple typology, which categorises voters
   into `core supporters', `distant supporters', `demobilised supporters'
   and `non-supporters'. While demobilised supporters still identify with
   social democratic parties but do not vote for them, distant supporters
   vote for social democratic parties but do not identify with them. Based
   on data from the European Social Survey, we then show that working-class
   voters are more likely to be demobilised supporters than middle-class
   voters, whereas distant voters are a heterogeneous group. Union
   membership as well as more pro-redistribution and pro-immigration
   attitudes are positively correlated with being a core supporter. This
   helps us to re-evaluate the support base of social democratic parties
   and contribute to a better understanding of their current electoral
   crisis.},

Title = {Generational differences in disguise? A longitudinal study of the
   liberalising effect of education on socio-cultural attitudes},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {500-525},
Month = {APR 16},
Abstract = {The underlying mechanisms of the association between education and
   socio-cultural liberal attitudes have received much attention from
   scholars within public opinion. Despite sharp increases in the
   proportion of highly educated in recent decades, the influence of a
   generational replacement has been widely overlooked in research. The
   central hypothesis in this article is that generational differences
   constitute one explanation for the average strength of the education
   effect on socio-cultural values. Also, the importance of education for
   forming attitudes could be weaker in generations that grew up when
   higher education was widespread and the societal climate was more
   liberal. Results from the `age-period-cohort' (APC) analysis, using the
   European Social Survey 2002-2018, confirm that a substantial part of the
   liberalising education effect is generational in origin and that its
   strength depends on the generation. They further show that this
   dependency varies across different European regions. The findings shed
   new light on the mechanisms and political significance of the education
   effect.},

Abstract = {Through a study of Gandhian political writings in mid-twentieth-century
   India, this article explores the neglected question of how the issue of
   representative democracy shaped anticolonial thought. The rise of a
   Gandhian perspective on electoral representation was made possible by
   the account of modern democracy given in Gandhi's ``Hind Swaraj{''}
   (1909). From the 1930s, four key Indian thinkers influenced by Gandhi
   expanded on ``Hind Swaraj{''} to argue that capitalist economics were a
   threat to democratic equality and produced the kinds of unaccountability
   and elite capture of legislatures that they identified in Western
   European parliamentary states. In response, Gandhian thinkers developed
   proposals for federalist postcolonial constitutions, combining a system
   of participatory legislative councils with collectivist agrarian
   socialism. I trace the intellectual origins of Gandhian democratic
   thought in the 1930s and 1940s and outline how its main proponents
   articulated ideas of antiparliamentarism and moral economics. Revisiting
   the Gandhian tradition, I suggest, highlights the importance of economic
   ethics in participatory theories of democracy and popular sovereignty.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a theoretical model for distinguishing between
   mere popularity and personality cults as there currently is an inflated
   use of the personality cult concept, especially in news media, attaching
   it to significantly different phenomena. The model is based on Weber's
   concept of charismatic authority and consists of three parameters,
   widespread symbolic elevation, resilience and religious parallels,
   covering a representational and social practice dimension. Both
   dimensions are needed to constitute a personality cult. Trump, Putin and
   Ardern are used as examples of the model's ability to distinguish
   between cult and non-cult phenomena. The comparison shows that only
   Trump and Putin have a cult on both dimensions. Mere popular politicians
   like Ardern are more comparable to celebrities as these do not have the
   same authority and power over the followers as leaders with a
   personality cult - despite potentially showing some cultlike tendencies
   on the representational dimension. Popular politicians are thus
   especially characterised by lacking the key social practice aspect of
   personality cults. As they might still exhibit some cultlike
   characteristics, the different phenomena are best perceived as being on
   a continuum ranging from mere admiration or popularity to a personality
   cult.},

Abstract = {The political-ideological assumption postulates that different political
   parties have different preferences toward the urgency of environmental
   sustainability. This article examines the relationship between political
   ideology and environmental policy stringency. I employ robust
   econometric specification on 23 OECD countries over 23 years. Results
   show a significant relationship between political ideology and
   environmental policy stringency. However, contrary to expectation, I
   find that environmental policies are less stringent in leftist
   governments. The findings suggest that leftist governments have not
   successfully incorporated their perceived environmentalism ideology into
   stringent environmental policies due to their lesser preference for law
   and order. I also find that the electoral politics view theory does not
   hold in the relationship between political ideology and environmental
   policy stringency. The findings, which are robust to various econometric
   identifications and alternative measurement of variables, add new
   insights on partisan politics and environmental sustainability.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to analyze the international
   cooperation between Argentina and China in relation to the use of the
   space station built in Patagonia, within the framework of a
   comprehensive strategic partnership. Documentary analysis is carried out
   by collecting data and implementing a qualitative strategy based on
   induction and deduction. It is concluded that the agreements that
   establish the Space Station within the framework of the strategic
   association are ``unequal treaties{''} of the same nature as those
   signed by China in the 19th and early 20th centuries.},

Title = {Defense as a Bandwagoning Tool: The Case of Argentina Against the United
   States (2015-2019)},
Journal = {URVIO-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE ESTUDIOS DE SEGURIDAD},
Year = {2022},
Number = {33},
Pages = {53-66},
Month = {MAY-AUG},
Abstract = {Studies on national defense in Argentina have not addressed the
   contributions of the ``escuela de la au-tonoma{''}. Considering that
   this theoretical tradition proposes different ways in which States can
   enable links with the United States (bandwagon/resistance) and that
   defense policy is a governmental area that affects that relationship,
   the article has a double objective: to inquire theoretically about the
   way in which defense policy can contribute to a bandwagon strategy
   towards the Unites States and to illustrate empirically this theoretical
   relationship from the analysis of the Argentine defense policy. A
   qualitative methodology is used, taking as a case study the defense
   policy carried out by Argentina during the period 2015-2019 and taking
   three areas of national defense as an empirical reference: the
   definition of threats, defense as an international positioning tool, and
   the way in which military capabilities are acquired. It is concluded
   that the study of the Argentine defense policy (2015-2019) indicates
   that national defense can be used as a bandwagoning tool towards the
   United States.},

Abstract = {This study investigates to what extent affective polarization, and more
   specifically hostility towards opposing party supporters, finds its
   roots in ideological differences. We look into the way out-groups are
   constructed when there are more than two political parties, and at the
   role of ideology in this process. Hereby we position ourselves in the
   discussion between those who argue that affective polarization finds its
   root more strongly in group attachments vs. those who argue that it is
   mostly rooted in ideological differences. We conduct our study in the
   context of the highly fragmented multi-party system of Belgium which
   enables us to analytically disentangle party label cues from ideological
   distance. Our findings demonstrate that affective polarization is
   largely rooted in ideological differences between party electorates in
   Belgium. Additionally, we find that this particularly holds for citizens
   who are more ideologically invested, namely those with higher political
   interest and more extreme ideological views.},

Title = {Do opportunistic snap elections affect political trust? Evidence from a
   natural experiment},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Pages = {308-325},

Abstract = {Snap elections, those triggered by incumbents in advance of their
   original date in the electoral calendar, are a common feature of
   parliamentary democracies. In this paper, I ask: do snap elections
   influence citizens' trust in the government? Theoretically, I argue that
   providing citizens with an additional means of endorsing or rejecting
   the incumbent - giving voters a chance to `have their say' - can be
   interpreted by citizens as normatively desirable and demonstrative of
   the incumbent's desire to legitimise their agenda by (re)-invigorating
   their political mandate. Leveraging the quasi-experimental setting
   provided by the coincidental timing of the UK Prime Minister, Theresa
   May's, shock announcement of early elections in April 2017 with the
   fieldwork for the Eurobarometer survey, I demonstrate that the
   announcement of snap elections had a sizeable and significant positive
   effect on political trust. This trust-inducing effect is at odds with
   the observed electoral consequences of the 2017 snap elections. Whilst
   incumbent-triggered elections can facilitate net gains for the sitting
   government, May's 2017 gamble cost the Conservative Party their
   majority. Snap elections did increase political trust. These
   trust-inducing effects were not observed symmetrically for all citizens.
   Whilst Eurosceptics and voters on the right of the ideological spectrum
   - those most inclined to support the incumbent May-led Conservative
   government in 2017 - became more trusting, no such changes in trust were
   observed amongst left-wing or non-Eurosceptic respondents. This study
   advances the understanding of a relatively understudied yet not uncommon
   political phenomenon, providing causal evidence that snap elections have
   implications for political trust.},

Abstract = {In Brexit's aftermath, appreciating how UK business will interact with
   Brussels is vital to understanding the mechanics of future economic and
   trade relations. Drawing from work on corporate political activity, the
   article outlines changes that UK business lobbying faces in Brussels
   post-Brexit, focussing on three key aspects: (i) changes at the
   institutional-systemic level; (ii) variance across policy fields; (iii)
   engagement with other organisations. The article discusses potential
   strategic responses for UK business and argues that lobbying for UK
   private interests will become a costlier and more complicated
   enterprise. While policy making access via political doors will become
   harder, demand for reliable technical expertise allows UK business to
   maintain its presence and influence in regulatory policy areas. Targeted
   lobbying and diversified mobilisation offer the safest way forward for
   UK business lobbying in Brussels.},

Abstract = {The study of resistance has exploded during recent years and the field
   has broadened in order to accommodate more issues. The broadened scope
   of resistance studies is fruitful, yet the embracing of resistance's
   complex character has led to a situation where the current research on
   resistance does not offer the appropriate tools to analyze the multiple
   and often overlapping forms of resistance. It is in this scholarly
   context that this paper form a bridge between fields in its endeavor to
   illuminate the richness of `resistance', while still providing tools -
   for example, definitions, paths and forms of resistance - for analyzing
   it.},

Abstract = {Why do politicians vote to decentralize power and resources? Drawing on
   structuralist and voluntarist approaches, we investigate why national
   party elites in Pakistan voted to devolve power to the provinces under
   the 18th Amendment to the 1973 Constitution but are hesitant to devolve
   meaningful fiscal and administrative power to the local level. We argue
   that the explanation for this disjuncture lies in Pakistan's history of
   military experiments with local government, its candidate-centered party
   system, and the re-election incentives of politicians at the national,
   provincial and local levels. Using interviews with local government
   representatives, politicians, and bureaucrats, and archival research
   through National Assembly, Senate debates and newspapers, we show that
   devolution to the provinces was a means of holding a fragile federation
   together. However, Pakistan's political parties, unable to elicit
   credible commitment from their legislators, feared that devolving power
   further could result in party defections, the rise of regional leaders,
   and inevitably, party fragmentation.},

   decentralization are highly politicized and often misunderstood when
   they enter the public discourse. As the survey results indicate, the
   association of ethnic groups with different systems of governance,
   although popular in Afghanistan, is misleading. A concurrent majority of
   ethnic groups takes a more nuanced approach of favoring central
   authorities on some issues, local authorities on others, and shared or
   divided authorities on the rest. The findings are helpful in
   contributing to a better understanding of how Afghans view federalism,
   and also by providing guidance to constitution-makers in designing
   institutional arrangements and distributions of power that address
   society's needs.},

Abstract = {The key question addressed by this article is whether the pandemic might
   represent one of those `critical conjunctures' capable of altering the
   direction of development of the Italian welfare state. Having reviewed
   the main explanations found in the literature for the difficulties in
   modernizing the Italian welfare state, we provide an answer by analysing
   what happened in 2021 in three policy areas: that concerning families
   with children, and early childhood education and care (ECEC); that
   concerning the support of dependent old people, and that concerning
   minimum income policies, looking at the role played by party competition
   as well as by civil society. We find that while in the field of family
   policy and ECEC there has been a clear shift towards greater investment,
   in the area of care for dependent old people, developments have been
   more hesitant and more ambivalent. With regard to minimum income
   provision, political conflict has for the time being impeded any attempt
   at reform. The answer to the research question therefore is only
   partially positive},

Abstract = {In 2021, the Covid-19 pandemic dominated the agenda of Italian politics
   as much as it had done in 2020. Political conflicts within the parties
   were relegated to the background or else were heavily influenced by the
   debate concerning management of the health emergency. The global scale
   of the pandemic and the measures taken at European level to mitigate the
   economic impact helped first to put an end to the Conte II government
   and then to bring to office a government of national unity led by Mario
   Draghi. All the parties represented in Parliament joined the government
   with the sole exception of Brothers of Italy, which decided to remain in
   opposition. In this context, the parties found themselves having to
   grapple with the need to cooperate as governing partners while also
   maintaining their recognizable profiles. Moreover, the effective absence
   of the coalitions with which they had previously been associated forced
   the parties to consider potentially new alliances and what they would
   mean for future political equilibria. This article will explore the
   state of the Italian party system, taking as our point of departure
   these circumstances, which are of considerable significance both
   nationally and internationally. First, we shall consider the dynamics of
   the party system as a whole and then, in more detail, we will explore
   the dynamics within the main parties and their respective coalitions.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Using Mexico's Tarjeta de Visitante por Razones Humanitarias (TVRH) as a
   primary case study, this article examines how states can use temporary
   protection schemes as border security measures while claiming to provide
   protection. Although the TVRH offers a legal pathway and status to move
   within Mexico, it equally restricts certain rights due to its temporary
   nature. It becomes a form of differential inclusion by which the state
   has the right to be able to ``exclude and define the limits{''} of a
   particular population but also claim inclusion on humanitarian grounds.
   Despite the claim of protecting migrants, the application of this
   regular status can essentially become a form of interdiction, which
   sustains the political framing of migration as ultimately a ``threat{''}
   that needs to be governed. On the ground, migrants with these temporary
   regular statuses occupy a liminal space and live a precarious existence
   similar to those migrants who do not possess a legal status at all. This
   power imbalance exists more often as states prefer to grant a temporary
   immigration status, which ensures less responsibility and support that
   accompanies more rights and protections. Based on policy analysis and
   field work, the article will examine the TVRH, the processes for
   obtaining this legal status, and the consequences for irregular
   migrants.},

Abstract = {When separation is a problem in binary dependent variable models, many
   researchers use Firth's penalized maximum likelihood in order to obtain
   finite estimates (Firth, 1993; Zorn, 2005; Rainey, 2016). In this paper,
   I show that this approach can lead to inferences in the opposite
   direction of the separation when the number of observations are
   sufficiently large and both the dependent and independent variables are
   rare events. As large datasets with rare events are frequently used in
   political science, such as dyadic data measuring interstate relations, a
   lack of awareness of this problem may lead to inferential issues.
   Simulations and an empirical illustration show that the use of
   independent ``weakly-informative{''} prior distributions centered at
   zero, for example, the Cauchy prior suggested by Gelman et al. (2008),
   can avoid this issue. More generally, the results caution researchers to
   be aware of how the choice of prior interacts with the structure of
   their data, when estimating models in the presence of separation.},

Abstract = {This article explains the rise, success, and subsequent failure of new
   challenger formations in the Galician party system during the Great
   Recession. For that, it focuses on the multidimensional electoral
   strategies developed by Alternativa Galega de Esquerda (AGE) and En
   Marea, comparing them to that of the traditional Bloque Nacionalista
   Galego (BNG). Our analysis shows the different strategies displayed by
   the BNG and new challengers (AGE, and later En Marea), examining both
   the electoral supply (framing and party programmatic positions) and
   demand (voter positions). We find a new subsuming strategy developed by
   AGE and En Marea, which prioritized left-wing anti-austerity policies
   over core pro-periphery ones. The paper demonstrates the potential of
   this new strategy during the Great Recession but also its limitations,
   linking its demise to the organizational weakness that prevented
   electoral realignment, and ultimately allowed the BNG to regain its
   leading role in the territorial dimension of competition.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the political roots of the global rise in
   corporate savings. In recent years, firms throughout advanced economies
   have started to accumulate enormous savings. Instead of using their
   revenues to reinvest or raise wages, many companies now stash their
   profits within financial markets, contributing to sluggish growth,
   financial fragilities, and rising inequality. I argue that political
   institutions that determine the balance of power between firms and
   employees play an important role in shaping this trend. The stronger
   unions are, the more they pressure firms into using revenues for pay
   increases and investment. The more unions' influence erodes, the
   stronger the rise of savings. Using panel data from 25 Organization for
   Economic Cooperation and Development countries as well as a regression
   discontinuity design leveraging the German law on codetermination, I
   find robust and causal evidence supporting this claim. These results
   have implications for our broader understanding of how political
   institutions affect financial imbalances and economic inequality.},

Abstract = {This article examines the effect of high school civic education on voter
   turnout in adulthood by integrating extensive academic transcript data
   on social studies and civic coursework into a large-scale, longitudinal
   survey of a nationally representative sample of adolescents. In an
   initial series of regression models, civics courses appear to have an
   effect on turnout in adulthood. However, after accounting for individual
   and family attributes, civic education has a fairly limited effect on
   turnout, though several measures have statistically significant effects
   even in the presence of controls. Interestingly, the study finds no
   support for the idea that high school courses that focus on service
   learning, civic skills development or political issues increase turnout
   in adulthood, which is contrary to expectations from the resource model
   of participation. After subjecting the civic effects that persist after
   accounting for controls to additional scrutiny by using family
   fixed-effects models that account for all observed and unobserved
   influences shared by siblings in the same family (for example,
   socialization, predispositions, etc.), the evidence suggests that there
   is a null relationship between civic education and turnout; the
   best-case scenario is that any civic education effects that do exist are
   likely very small. The idea that additional civics training will help to
   substantially elevate voter turnout appears to be overly optimistic.},

Abstract = {The last decade has seen the rise of the Narrative Policy Framework
   (NPF) as a valuable theoretical framework for advancing knowledge of the
   policy process. In this article, we investigate the NPF's ``travel{''}
   capacities across geographies, political systems, policy fields, levels
   of analysis, methodological approaches, and other theories of the policy
   process. We assess these capabilities by reviewing extant research and
   mapping newly explored territories. While we find that the NPF embodies
   all necessary conditions to travel to different settings, the empirical
   applications remain largely confined to the U.S. and European contexts,
   environmental policy, the meso level of analysis, the use of content
   analysis of documents as a methodological approach, and only a few
   combinations with other theories of the policy process. Our findings
   indicate that the NPF can travel well. However, we call for further
   research to conceptualize the NPF's macro level, to replicate NPF
   scholarship beyond liberal democratic institutional contexts, and to
   affirm the framework's capacity to be generalizable in varied settings.},

Abstract = {This article provides a critical comment on chapter five of Richard
   Bellamy's A Republican Europe of States. The chapter focuses on EU
   citizenship as a status conferring to EU citizens certain entitlements
   to social and political rights when they reside in a member state other
   than their own. The chapter rejects the view that EU citizenship should
   entail equal access to social and political rights and provides an
   argument as to why EU citizenship cannot but consist of a more
   restricted bundle of social and political rights than national
   citizenship. I question both the scope and necessity of these
   restrictions on EU citizens' equal access to social and political
   rights, as well as whether this picture of EU citizenship is consistent
   with the earlier theoretical chapters of the book.},

Title = {Does Familiarity Breed Esteem? A Field Experiment on Emergent Attitudes
   Toward Members of Congress},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},

Volume = {76},

Abstract = {Canonical theories of democratic representation envision legislators
   cultivating familiarity to enhance esteem among their constituents. Some
   scholars, however, argue that familiarity breeds contempt, which if true
   would undermine incentives for effective representation. Survey
   respondents who are unfamiliar with their legislator tend not to provide
   substantive answers to attitude questions, and so we are missing key
   evidence necessary to adjudicate this important debate. We solve this
   problem with a randomized field experiment that gave some constituents
   an opportunity to gain familiarity with their Member of Congress through
   an online Deliberative Town Hall. Relative to controls, respondents who
   interacted with their member reported higher esteem as a result of
   enhanced familiarity, a mediation effect supporting canonical theories
   of representation. This effect is statistically significant among
   constituents who are the same political party as the member but not
   among those of the opposite party, although in neither case did
   familiarity breed contempt.},

Title = {Reaching people who are marginalized in major disability policy reform},
Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Policy changes often aim to improve the access of socially marginalized
   people who face systemic, social and personal barriers to the support
   they need. A major policy reform in Australia was the National
   Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was introduced to meet the
   country's human rights obligations. NDIS is publicly funded to allocate
   individual funding packages to 10\% of people with disability and
   facilitates access to mainstream services for all people with
   disability. Support services are intended to be entitlements, consistent
   with a human rights framework. Predictably, the most marginalized people
   remain under-represented in both packages and mainstream access,
   including people with psychosocial disability who are at risk of
   homelessness. A 2-year project was conducted to familiarize people with
   disability and service providers who have contact with them about how to
   access support. People with Disability Australia managed the project as
   action research with university researchers. The research used
   interviews to study how to improve access. People with disability were
   advisors to the governance and research design. The findings were that
   it took many months for people with disability and the organizations
   that support them to trust the project staff, understand the relevance
   of disability to their lives, and to take steps to seek their
   entitlements to support. Some implications for policy are conceptual in
   terms of the policy language of disability, which alienates some people
   from the services to which they are entitled. Other implications are
   bureaucratic - the gap between homeless and disability organizations
   means that they prioritize people's immediate needs and people who are
   easier to serve, rather than facilitating sustainable support. A global
   social policy implication is that specialized interventions to advocate
   for the rights of marginalized people with disability and to demonstrate
   how to engage with them remains a priority while gaps between service
   types persist.},

Abstract = {How do governments in post-conflict settings provide for policing within
   their countries? I argue that leaders respond to both electoral concerns
   and security threats in shaping the geographic provision of policing
   infrastructure. Focusing on Uganda, I contend that the territorial
   expansion of policing has followed a distinct political logic. First, I
   use panel data on police infrastructure to demonstrate increased
   construction in counties with previously lower electoral support for the
   incumbent regime. Additionally, I find that counties with violence are
   more likely to experience increases in construction, but especially in
   areas where the incumbent has more support. Finally, I show that (1)
   proximity to police infrastructure is associated with worse individual
   perceptions of the police and (2) that increased construction of police
   infrastructure has large significant effects on reducing voter turnout
   while increasing vote share for the incumbent president. These findings
   have important implications for post-conflict reconstruction, stability,
   and violence.},

Abstract = {The five `developmentalist' welfare states of East Asia (South Korea,
   Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan) have been presented as
   successful projects of economic progress, positively aligning
   citizen-interests with business objective. Utilising Jessop's
   Strategic-Relational Approach (SRA), we analyse the Central Provident
   Fund (CPF), Singapore's `forced savings' social policy which organises
   housing, healthcare, education and retirement. Through a myriad of
   eligibilities/ineligibilities, Singapore's CPF administers desired
   social behaviours while sustaining a series of inequalities supporting
   certain classed and gendered interests over others. Our analysis breaks
   down the CPF into three social relational orientations: ( 1 )
   heteronormative familial responsiblisation, (2) labour market activation
   and (3) class reproduction. The article highlights the function of CPF
   in institutionalising conservative and pro-market political interests.
   CPF reproduces material inequalities and fashions behaviours conducive
   with the dominant accumulation strategy while discouraging those which
   are not, privileging some interests over others.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article seeks to thematize the intellectual core of Pedro
   Vuskovic's work on the path to development taken by Latin America,
   mainly throughout the 20th century. To do this, his analysis of the
   period of ``import substitution industrialization{''} and the subsequent
   export reconversion of the Latin American economy is described, then
   emphasizing the external and internal transition to the visible crisis
   in that region in the 70s and 80s. In this general framework, the
   relevance obtained by what Vuskovic understands as a kind of general
   pattern of ``concentrating{''} development of Latin American societies
   is observed, which sharpens their relationship of dependency with the
   outside and intensifies the social and political problems in the
   interior of the continent. At the end, the two alternatives described by
   Vuskovic about the historical trajectory followed by Latin America are
   problematized, namely: deepening or breaking of that general pattern of
   development.},

Abstract = {Research has shown that Japan's parallel electoral system altered the
   incentives that parties and their members face when competing for
   lower-house seats, leading to, among other things, more policy-oriented
   and less personalistic elections. What is less well known is how these
   altered incentives affect the decisions of incumbents to stay with their
   current party organizations or exit and join another political party. We
   address this question by using data from the 2017 snap election in
   Japan, specifically, the exit decisions of Democratic Party of Japan
   (DPJ) incumbents. Typically exit decisions involve considerations of
   electoral support, policy, or increased office benefits. Our results
   indicate that policy considerations were a primary factor in DPJ
   members' exit decisions but also that exiting legislators considered the
   risks associated with these decisions, which was molded by available
   party alternatives, each's electoral strength, and a unique feature of
   Japan's electoral rules, the fact that it reduced the electoral risk for
   some but not all incumbents who contemplated switching parties.},

   power. The Ratification Debates demonstrate that disputes between
   Federalists and Anti-Federalists over the pardon power were based on
   their disagreement about separation of powers theory. Because
   Anti-Federalists feared that pardon power could be abused and promote
   monarchy, they insisted on textual restrictions ({''}parchment
   barriers{''}). The Federalists rejected these demands, moving beyond the
   Anti-Federalists' ``pure{''} theory of separation of powers and
   advocating a complex system of institutional checks and balances. This
   approach allowed the Federalists to show how the executive's
   institutional structure not only improved the president's use of pardon
   power but also helped prevent abuses. The president's pardon power is as
   unlimited as the British king's, but the Federalists insisted that it
   could nevertheless be safely granted to a republican magistrate because
   Congress could check misuse via an equally extensive power: impeachment
   and removal.},

Abstract = {The formation of the `yellow-green' government that took office in Italy
   after the general election held on 4 March 2018 looked puzzling to many
   commentators as the two coalition partners - the Five Star Movement and
   the League - appeared to be quite distant on the left-right continuum.
   In this article, we argue that despite being widely used in the
   literature, a unidimensional representation of parties' policy positions
   on the encompassing left-right scale is inadequate to explain the
   process of coalition governments' formation. We focus first on coalition
   outcomes in Italy in the period 2001-18. Our statistical analysis
   including, among other variables, parties' policy distance on the
   left-right dimension performs rather well until 2013 but fails to
   predict the coalition outcome in 2018. To solve the puzzle, we propose a
   two-dimensional spatial account of the Conte I government formation in
   which the first dimension coincides with the economic left-right and the
   second one is related to immigration, the European Union issues and
   social conservatism. We show that the coalition outcome ceases to be
   poorly understandable once parties' policy positions are measured along
   these two dimensions, rather than on the general left-right continuum.},

Abstract = {Political scientists are increasingly using digitized documents from
   archives. This article is a practical introduction to doing digital
   archival research. First, it explains when and why political scientists
   use evidence from archival research. Second, it argues that the remote
   accessibility of digitized records provides new opportunities for
   comparative and transnational research. However, digital archival
   research also risks aggravating five types of biases that pose
   challenges for qualitative, quantitative, interpretive, and
   mixed-methods research: survival, transfer, digitization, and
   reinforcement bias at the level of record collection and source bias at
   the level of record creation. Third, this article offers concrete
   strategies for anticipating and mitigating these biases by walking
   readers through the experience of entering, being in, and leaving an
   archive, while also underscoring the importance of learning the
   structure of an archive. The article concludes by addressing the ethical
   implications to archival research as a type of field research for
   political scientists.},

Title = {Framing Blasphemy as a crime: the curious similarities between the
   secular left and the organization of Islamic cooperation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},

Abstract = {The tensions between free speech and religious sensitivities are an
   ongoing source of political conflict, both within western democracies
   and within the UN human rights system where rivalling states compete to
   define the limits of freedom of expression. Examining the debate on free
   speech and its limits in the context of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in
   Paris in 2015 and the Danish cartoon affair in 2005, this article
   analyzes the discursive similarities between secular critics of
   religious satire and Muslim-majority states in the UN. In both cases,
   censorship is justified on the basis of combating racism, hate speech,
   intolerance and related human rights violations. Instead of applying
   theological doctrines and religious language, the article shows how the
   Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is gradually adopting secular
   and leftist mainstream human rights language in its quest to instal new
   international censorship norms.},
