Abstract = {This article explores how key political parties have operationalised the
   only three economic models discussed politically in New Zealand, since
   2009: green growth (GG); circular economy (CE), bioeconomy (BE). For the
   later, two approaches are distinguished, given the different
   sustainability performance expected: a `natural bioeconomy' (BE-1) and a
   `genetic engineering bioeconomy' (BE-2). Findings indicate that all
   parties and governments have predominantly supported weak and partial
   sustainability operationalisations of these models. The conservative
   National Party conflates resource-intensive capitalism with GG and BE-2.
   The Labour Party's approaches to CE and BE-1 are fragmented and narrow,
   with no overarching national strategies; since retaking power in 2017,
   governmental initiatives remain dominated by the timid GG approach of
   the past. Labour is mildly open towards several types of high-risk
   genetic-engineering, consistent with BE-2. The National Party supports
   BE-2 transitions as wholeheartedly as the Green Party opposes them.
   Surprisingly, Labour's interest in BE-1 and CBE-1 innovations is
   limited, framed only by climate mitigation goals. It is unclear whether
   any political party New Zealand currently understands or wishes to
   implement contemporary conceptualisations of an innovative,
   ecologically-sound circular natural bioeconomy (CBE-1).},

Abstract = {On the campaign trail and at his inauguration, Joe Biden pledged, above
   all else, to be a uniter to restore the soul of America. At the end of
   his first year in office, many campaign promises have been met, but
   unity has not been one. Far from transcending partisanship as promised,
   Biden has embraced the levers of presidential discretion and power
   inherent within the modern executive office to advance partisan
   objectives. He is not just a victim of polarization, but actively
   contributes to it. This is not unexpected. Rather it is the culmination
   of a decades-long reorientation within both major parties: the rise of
   an executive-centered party-system, with Democrats and Republicans alike
   relying on presidents and presidential candidates to pronounce party
   doctrine, raise campaign funds, campaign on behalf of their partisan
   brethren, mobilize grass roots support, and advance party programs. Like
   Barack Obama and Donald Trump before him, Biden has aggressively used
   executive power to cut the Gordian knot of partisan gridlock in
   Congress. Even pandemic politics is not immune to presidential
   partisanship; in fact, it has accentuated the United States'
   presidency-centered democracy, which weakens the public resolve to
   confront and solve national problems.},

Abstract = {Differences in how candidates present themselves to voters is a key
   concern for scholars of campaigns and elections. Candidate
   advertisements, speeches, and websites form the basis of our knowledge
   on the subject, but ignore some of the most pervasive and discernible
   features of political campaigns: campaign logos featured on signage,
   stickers, apparel, buttons, websites, and advertisements. This study
   provides a descriptive examination of gender differences in candidate
   logos from the 2018 mid-term election. It extends our knowledge of how
   women and men present themselves by examining how candidates sell
   themselves in more symbolic terms based on colors, fonts, imagery, and
   slogans. We argue these logo choices reflect candidate brand positioning
   strategies, which are connected to attributes of the rival candidate and
   the preferences of the constituency. We then outline a future agenda for
   how the study of political campaign logos can inform theories of
   political science and brand positioning.},

Abstract = {Even if political theorists rarely read him, Italian political thinker,
   Marsilius of Padua, presents one of the most radical theories of the
   multitude prior to Machiavelli and Spinoza. This article reconstructs
   Marsilius of Padua's political theory of the multitude in his Defender
   of Peace and pays special attention to two main sources from which
   Marsilius frames his theory: Aristotle and Ibn Rushd. Compared to
   Aristotle, Marsilius advances a more epistemic view of the multitude as
   a lawmaker. Marsilius' ideas on the multitude also depend on Ibn Rushd's
   theory of collective knowledge and, to a certain extent, on his position
   on natural law.},

Abstract = {How does hiring of policy professionals, to do the policy work of civil
   society organizations, impact the organizations that hire them? Policy
   professionals constitute a growing group of actors who populate many
   interest groups, working with advocacy and influencing public policy. As
   a group they comprise various types of professionals, displaying
   different backgrounds, identities and motivations. By analyzing
   individual policy professionals, asking questions about their identity
   and motivation to work with advocacy, and then through ethnographical
   observations following their work, this article contributes to the
   understanding of how policy professionals' backgrounds and professional
   identities are connected to organizational strategies and the process of
   professionalization. In so doing, it sheds new light on the dynamics of
   policy production and what professionalization of politics looks like in
   civil society. The article proposes a categorization of policy
   professionals' role orientations in civil society as policy scholars,
   policy lobbyists, policy communicators and policy activists. This
   conceptualization is of analytical value, because the balance between
   these categories affects dynamics within organizations and the work they
   do in relation to advocacy and policy, in tandem with their legitimacy.},

Abstract = {Research dealing with citizens' preferences for different conceptions of
   democracy has grown and diversified greatly. This has resulted in a
   highly fragmented field in which empirical evidence cannot easily be
   integrated into a consistent larger picture. This systematic review
   takes stock of this research to uncover the roots of existing
   inconsistencies and to show how future research can avoid them. It maps
   three decades of research regarding conceptualizations and measurement
   approaches that have been chosen to study citizens' preferences for
   democracy. By systematically carving out the variation in the chosen
   approaches, the review shows why existing research can hardly add up to
   a clear diagnosis regarding what kind of democracy citizens prefer. A
   critical discussion based on this review highlights that cumulative
   research will require a stronger conceptual and methodological
   integration between different strands in the literature.},

Abstract = {How does ministries' capacity to draft legislation affect the political
   output of modern governments? This article combines a novel dataset
   describing the capacity of ministerial bureaucracies to attend to about
   250 distinct policy issues with content-coded data on government
   legislation. The sample consists of Danish, Dutch and German
   governments, jointly spanning the time from 1995 to 2013. The analysis
   reveals three main findings: firstly, issue-specific bureaucratic
   capacity unconditionally increases governments' legislative activity;
   secondly, legislative activity is stifled if bureaucratic capacity is
   spread across different ministries; thirdly, against theoretical
   expectations the productive effect of bureaucratic capacity is not
   positively related to governments' issue salience. The results indicate
   that the design and resources of ministerial portfolios affect policy
   making in western governments. Supplemental data for this article can be

Abstract = {John Rawls and other liberals from the 1960s and `70s are usually
   interpreted as having refurbished the idea of nonviolent civil
   disobedience, as practiced by Gandhi, King, and many others. That
   standard reading has recently provided a launching pad for a growing
   body of critical theoretical reflection that challenges strictly
   nonviolent civil disobedience's privileged normative status. Here I
   offer a revisionist account of both liberal (and especially) Rawlsian
   nonviolent disobedience and recent attempts to supersede it. Recent
   critics occasionally miss their targets: the main differences separating
   Rawls from the critics revolve around competing empirical assessments of
   contemporary liberal societies and rival accounts of political violence.
   Rawls and other liberals, in fact, provided normative space for limited
   forms of ``violent{''} lawbreaking, when resulting typically not in
   injuries to other persons but perhaps damage to property. The debate
   about nonviolent vs. violent political illegality needs to pay closer
   attention to the difficult issue of how best to understand and define
   political violence. Although we may need to provide normative space
   under unjust conditions for limited types of violence (e.g., property
   damage), substantial grounds remain for principally favoring lawbreaking
   that avoids injuring or violating persons.},

Abstract = {Presenting original data from interviews conducted in Iraq between 2013
   and 2019, this paper charts the evolution of conflict related narratives
   of the `other' among members of the Sunni confession immediately prior
   to, during, and after the rise and fall of the Islamic State (IS). It
   charts the evolution of these narratives through three escalatory phases
   (victimhood narratives, divisive narratives, and violent narratives) and
   three de-escalatory phases (nuanced narratives, reconciliatory
   narratives, and unifying narratives). It concludes with reflections on
   the lessons this case can provide for identifying the best moments for
   Conflict Resolution actors to intervene in such violent conflicts.},

Abstract = {Studies on policy monitoring and ministerial survival within coalition
   governments are usually conducted separately. In this study, we bring
   these topics together and argue that the strategy of coalition partners
   to oversee the implementation of one another's policies has surprising
   consequences on the duration of office-holding ministers. Our main
   theoretical insight suggests that the degree to which ministers behave
   as faithful agents of the government depends on their expectations about
   their partners' monitoring behavior, such that when they expect to be
   under high scrutiny, they moderate their drifting behavior. Using
   evidence from legislative information requests on the activities of
   individual ministers over all multiparty cabinets formed in Brazil
   between 1995 and 2014, we demonstrate that: (1) greater policy
   monitoring by coalition partners is observed under more ideologically
   heterogeneous cabinets, and (2) more frequent policy-monitoring efforts
   by coalition partners lead to a lower ministerial replacement within the
   government term.},

Abstract = {Introductory undergraduate courses in American politics often center the
   Constitution and focus on fundamental principles, structures, and
   processes. Unfortunately, this focus allows less space to discuss the
   role that norms play in supporting formal rules and institutions in the
   American political system. As a political science professor teaching an
   introductory course on American politics in 2019 and 2020, I became
   acutely aware of the limitations of this course design. This context
   showcased the ways in which many of these norms are taken for granted by
   many, including American politics scholars. Moreover, it sparked
   conversations among my colleagues about whether we should adapt to the
   moment and update our instruction to place greater emphasis on norms to
   contextualize the present political moment for our students. My answer
   was yes. However, doing so requires instructors to be attentive to
   issues of objectivity, authority, and partisanship. This article shares
   strategies that I plan to implement when I teach this course again. In
   particular, I discuss three guiding pedagogical principles when teaching
   about presidential norms. I then provide discussion questions that
   instructors can use to spark conversations about the relationship
   between adherence to presidential norms and the stability of American
   political institutions.},

Abstract = {Should accountability be introduced to organizations that are learning
   about the right policies to achieve their goals? I develop an agency
   model focusing on the interactions between accountability and an agent's
   intrinsic motivation. More effort by the agent leads to more informative
   policy outcomes and thereby better policy learning. Holding the agent
   accountable for the policy outcomes motivates the agent and thus
   improves policy learning. However, by removing the agent from office
   upon policy failure and thereby taking away his benefit from learning
   through failure, accountability also discourages the agent. This
   negative effect is more substantial when the intrinsic motivation is
   higher. The principal, therefore, refrains from using accountability on
   the agent who is more intrinsically motivated.},

Abstract = {There has been much debate surrounding the classification of the kind of
   regime which developed in Russia following the collapse of communism and
   this has only intensified during the Putin era. This article considers
   whether the concept of bureaucratic-authoritarianism is really
   applicable in the case of Russia. Lilia Shevtsova was the first to
   tentatively state that Russia is a case of
   bureaucratic-authoritarianism. However, to provide more assured
   acceptance or rejection of the concept, this article returns to the
   paradigm's roots. The concept of bureaucratic-authoritarianism was
   developed by Guillermo O'Donnell and thus the characteristics he
   outlined are applied to the case of Russia in the Putin era. Doing so
   allows for a level of precision and depth in concluding that
   bureaucratic-authoritarianism is a relevant paradigm. Confirmatory
   evidence for all seven of the characteristics enumerated by O'Donnell is
   found, suggesting that Russia in the Putin era can be considered a case
   of bureaucratic-authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {When (and why) do legislators quit their jobs? Previous answers to this
   question have focused on retirements. Looking at voluntary resignations
   instead, in this article we argue that leaving Congress to assume an
   elected (executive) office or a position in the (sub)national
   bureaucracy may be a career-advancing move motivated by progressive
   ambition. We document this claim with data from Argentina, where roughly
   12\% of elected deputies leave voluntarily before their term ends, but
   rarely become unemployed. Consistent with expectations, we show that
   resignations tend to follow instances of executive alternation at the
   (sub)national level, and are driven by legislators placed at the top of
   party lists as well as those elected in midterm years.},

Abstract = {Mummolo and Peterson improve the use and interpretation of fixed-effects
   models by pointing out that unit intercepts fundamentally reduce the
   amount of variation of variables in fixed-effects models. Along a
   similar vein, we make two claims in the context of random effects
   models. First, we show that potentially large reductions in variation,
   in this case caused by quasi-demeaning, also occur in models using
   random effects. Second, in many instances, what authors claim to be a
   random effects model is actually a pooled model after the
   quasi-demeaning process, affecting how we should interpret the model. A
   literature review of random effects models in top journals suggests that
   both points are currently not well understood. To better help users
   interested in improving their interpretation of random effects models,
   we provide Stata and R programs to easily obtain post-estimation
   quasi-demeaned variables.},

Abstract = {As cities experience the effects of increasing inequalities, so social
   movements, scholars and even mainstream institutions are once again
   placing Lefebvre's notion of the ``right to the city{''} on the agenda.
   This new popularity often strips the concept of its political meaning,
   namely by approaching Lefebvre's notion as juridical and as an aspect of
   a more general way of proceeding by planning, that has effects in terms
   of what is recognised as part of the political sphere, and of claiming
   the city. We aim to contribute to the debate through the discussion of a
   case study interested in a yearly festive event in central Lisbon.
   Drawing on Henri Lefebvre's lexicon for an interpretation of popular
   involvement with public urban life, the article starts with an account
   of Lisbon's Fordist socio-spatial segregation, and the neoliberal
   deepening of gentrification and profit-making urban regeneration. It
   then focuses on the Cape Verdean performative event Kola San Jon in the
   context of Lisbon's Festas da Cidade, and the active involvement of
   inhabitants of Cova da Moura, a marginalised neighbourhood which has,
   over the years, drawn on cultural and civic activities for reclaiming a
   voice in the public space.},

Abstract = {Scholars agree that two major issues oriented voting behaviours during
   the Italian general election of 2018. The first was the state of the
   economy, which had not yet recovered from the lowest points reached
   during the Great Recession, but had nevertheless exhibited some marginal
   improvement. The second issue originated from another crisis, the
   refugee and asylum emergency, which contributed to increasing the
   presence of foreigners in Italy and the salience of the migration issue.
   The article investigates the impact of these two types of problem on the
   2018 election results by using aggregated objective data at the
   municipal level. It finds confirmation of the two issues' impact on
   retrospective punishment of the incumbent Democratic Party also when
   using spatial regression models distinguishing the direct influence and
   the spill-over effects of the poor state of the economy and an increase
   in the size of the foreign population.},

Title = {AGENT-STRUCTURE RELATIONS: METHODOLOGY OF CONSTRUCTIVISM},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2022},
Number = {4},
Pages = {77-93},
Abstract = {The notion of agent-structure relations is a central concept within the
   constructivist paradigm. A huge portion of the scientific literature
   abroad and in Russia is devoted to constructivism as a methodological
   approach. However, the methods themselves frequently are not disclosed,
   the authors just limit themselves to stating that they meet the
   requirements of the general scientific methods of the social sciences.
   At the same time, the choice of methods, even aspects of them, is quite
   significant for constructivism. The structures are studied mostly
   through meta-history and genealogy. The worldviews of the observer,
   which distort the scientific analysis and its results rather
   significantly, should also be taken into account. The Agent's activity
   is regarded through the study of narratives, discourses and framing.
   This allows researchers the possibility to decrypt, but also analyse and
   study key constructivist themes, including the problems of identity
   which are a priority for the scholars of this school. Constructivist
   pluralism does not simply allow, but also implies that it can fruitfully
   interact with the other theories of international relations. This has
   resulted in the emergence of many mixed eclectic forms like cultural
   constructivism, cultural realism, liberal constructivism, constructivism
   as a critical theory, cultural constructivism etc. However, it seems
   quite important for academics to present some general scheme for
   constructivist study, that will allow a significant deviation from the
   original tenets and allow scholars to further explore their interests
   and fulfil their tasks.},

Abstract = {Thanks to an original fieldwork conducted at the end of the 2010's, the
   article explores the permanencies and changes that have affected the EU
   Press Corps over the past 20 years. If that journalistic grouping
   presents some degree of stability due to the historically rooted working
   routines and the decades some EU correspondents have spent in Brussels,
   some transformations can also be clearly identified. Some of these are
   linked with the deep evolution of the media sector (economic model in
   crisis, growing precariousness of journalists, digitalization, etc.) and
   the rise of new actors on the Brussels media scene (Politico, Contexte).
   Others refer to the changing equilibrium of power within the European
   Union: European Parliament empowerment, rising visibility and centrality
   of the Presidency of the European Council and of European summits,
   political and communication cautiousness of the European Commission. The
   article examines both the permanencies and the transformations of the
   journalistic work in Brussels.},

Abstract = {With a transitional government and in the midst of the COVID-19
   pandemic, Peru held general elections in 2021. Although the acceleration
   of vaccination made it possible to attain more social and economic
   stability, the trend towards instability that began in the past five
   years continued during the first months of Castillo's administration. An
   outsider without a party and without political support faces a
   radicalized but unpopular opposition, which has normalized the threat of
   presidential vacancia. Democracy persists as a consequence of a tie
   between these weak actors: a democracy by default.},

Title = {IMMIGRATION RAIDS AND RACIST STATE VIOLENCE},
Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {33-51},
Abstract = {This article develops an analysis of contemporary immigration raids in
   Britain, arguing that they operate ideologically as well as
   institutionally to sustain the material and political conditions of what
   is a vastly unequal form of social order (that is also a form of racial
   order). It suggests that immigration raids are located within and
   develop understandings of a racial state in contemporary Britain.
   Drawing on ethnographic work at a migrant charity organization, it
   explains the raid process and its impact on individuals and families.
   Raids are rationalized as facilitating removal and more broadly operate
   as part of attempts to generate fear and encourage people to leave
   ``voluntarily.{''} However, this is not achieved in many cases, and this
   article suggests that the real purpose of raids is to dominate and
   oppress illegalized migrants and those who may be vulnerable to
   immigration control, as well as reproducing the justification for
   immigration enforcement. Raids can be understood as inflicting harms and
   as a form of state-sanctioned racist violence which is utilized to try
   severing solidarities between communities. Enforcement leads to
   resistance and the conclusion reflects on resistance to raids,
   demonstrated for example by the 2021 Kenmure Street protest in Glasgow,
   and the solidarities such resistance ferments and sustains.},

Title = {All About Feelings? Emotional Appeals as Drivers of User Engagement With
   Facebook Posts},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {172-184},
Abstract = {Political campaigns routinely appeal to citizens' emotions, and there is
   evidence that such appeals influence political behaviour. Social media,
   an important arena through which political actors communicate with
   voters, provide a rich source of data for investigating not only which
   communication strategies they use but also which of these engage
   followers. Building on political psychology and political communication
   literature, the present study investigates the relationship between
   appeals to specific emotions (fear, anger, enthusiasm, and pride) and
   the engagement that such posts generate on Facebook. We created an
   engagement index sensitive to the Facebook page follower count and
   employed multilevel modelling techniques. We conducted a manual content
   analysis of posts by British political parties and their leaders (N =
   1,203) during the Brexit referendum debate on Facebook. We found that
   engagement with a post substantially increases when appeals to anger,
   enthusiasm, and pride are present. Conversely, there is no relationship
   between appeals to fear and engagement. Thus, the results indicate with
   observational data what we know about the effects of emotions from
   experimental research in political psychology. Emotions of the same
   valence (e.g., fear and anger) have a different relationship with user
   engagement and, by extension, political behaviour and participation
   online. This indicates that to fully understand the role of emotions in
   generating user engagement on Facebook, we must go beyond the positive
   and negative dichotomy and look at discrete emotions. Lastly, British
   political actors used Facebook communication to generate online
   political participation during the Brexit debate.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the incidence of non-response (don't know/no

   of the Centro de Investigaciones Sociologicas (CIS). The study seeks to
   find the profile of people who opt for this option of silence in the
   face of the dichotomous continuum between having left wing or right wing
   ideology. Through a statistical analysis of binary logistic regression,
   the work asks if behind this silence there is a majority proportion of
   people who have an apolitical ideology and/or they abstain in the
   electoral elections. A silence, moreover, that occurs more frequently
   among groups less favored by the world economic system: women, the
   elderly, workers, peasants and people with primary education.},

Abstract = {As a consequence of the incremental complexity of international climate
   governance, particularly within the United Nations Framework Convention
   on Climate Change, States face an increasing demand on specialized human
   resources to participate in different negotiation settings during the
   Conferences of the Parties (cops). We characterize the Argentinian
   delegations between 2012 - 2019, identify the negotiation team and
   analyze the coverage of the team's agenda. Interests regarding climate
   change international politics can be inferred from the participation or
   absence of negotiators within different discussions. This paper reviews
   previous empirical work on delegations in climate change negotiations
   and draws upon qualitative techniques in order to collect original data
   to perform an in-depth case analysis.},

Title = {Waves in Cycle: The protests against anti-contagion measures and

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},

Abstract = {Since the beginning of the pandemic, while progressive movements have
   mainly focused on social inequalities exacerbated by the sanitary
   emergency, a number of protests emerged and quickly became visible that
   initially targeted the policies taken to reduce contagion and
   subsequently focused on the vaccine and vaccination. In the attempt to
   account for the rapid development of these protests, social scientists
   have mostly turned to classical approaches used in the analysis of
   far-right organizations and sects, looking at broad transformations in
   society or at fear and a sense of insecurity at the individual level. In
   this article, we build upon a social movement approach to look at the
   main characteristics of the protests against anti-contagion measures.
   From a theoretical point of view, we point to the importance of
   disentangling the specific waves happening within broader protest
   cycles. Empirically, focusing on the Italian case, we present a novel
   development in protest event analysis looking at the specific forms of
   action, the actors involved, and their claims in two waves of contention
   during the pandemic in Italy, between 2020 and 2021.},

Abstract = {Saint Birgitta of Sweden (1303-1373), one of the most powerful visionary
   women from the late Middle Ages, was celebrated as a prophet and a sibyl
   long into seventeenth century. A common suggestion has been that
   Birgitta's prophetic status was crafted by her supporters after her
   death. My claim, however, is that the construction of the prophet was
   the result of a highly conscious strategy which followed Birgitta from
   the very beginning of her visionary career, and to which both her
   supporters and she herself carefully contributed. We meet the traces of
   such a construction in the earliest hagiographers' accounts, in the
   confessors' ardent supports, and in the many witnesses from the
   canonization process. Yet, the strongest testimonies of the prophet in
   spe, is to be found in Birgitta's own revelations, which is the focus of
   this article.},

Abstract = {New technologies have been a key driver of labor market change in recent
   decades. There are renewed concerns that technological developments in
   areas such as robotics and artificial intelligence will destroy jobs and
   create political upheaval. This article reviews the vibrant debate about
   the economic consequences of recent technological change and then
   discusses research about how digitalization may affect political
   participation, vote choice, and policy preferences. It is increasingly
   well established that routine workers have been the main losers of
   recent technological change and disproportionately support populist
   parties. However, at the same time, digitalization also creates a large
   group of economic winners who support the political status quo. The
   mechanisms connecting technology-related workplace risks to political
   behavior and policy demands are less well understood. Voters may fail to
   fully comprehend the relative importance of different causes of
   structural economic change and misattribute blame to other factors. We
   conclude with a list of pressing research questions.},

Abstract = {In legal literature, the dissemination of false information on the
   Internet is referred to as online defamation. However, Ukrainian
   legislation does not enshrine this term, which creates difficulties with
   respect to legal protection against online defamation. So, the aim of
   the article is to determine the legal remedies for countering defamation
   of public figures on the Internet. The research involved the following
   methods: analysis, case study, graphic methods. The study revealed the
   main contradictions in defamation research and identified unexplored
   aspects of the issue. The legislation of Ukraine and other countries of
   the world with regard to defamation and protection against libel is
   examined. International aspects of providing protection against
   defamation and the researchers' recommendations on how to balance the
   right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy are studied.
   Highlighted in the conclusions are that the study established the need
   to improve Ukraine's legislative framework on defamation issues, make
   changes in educational programs and improve the media literacy of the
   population. Prospects for future research include the study of the means
   of settlement of defamation cases at the international level.},

Title = {UNBALANCED REFORM COMPARATIVE ANALYSISOF CHINA'S AND RUSSIA'S EXPERIENCE},
Journal = {POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Number = {2},
Pages = {49-70},
Abstract = {Transforming a political system is never an easy task. The re-forms that
   launched this process can easily fall into the ``balancing trap{''},
   when a lion's share of political capital is directed to ensure a balance
   of interests of various social groups, which inevitably leads to the
   curtailment of reforms and, as a result, stagnation. The article is
   devoted to a comparative analysis of the approaches of China and Russia
   to solving this problem.
   The essence of the Chinese approach, which is usually referred to as the
   ``policy experimentation{''}, is that reforms are first carried out in a
   separate re-gion, and then, if successful, gradually spread to the whole
   country. However, the key to China's success lies not only in
   experimentation, but also in a variety of reform strategies, the choice
   of which is determined by the specific condi-tions prevailing in a given
   region. Russia also uses this model, which is known as an ``unbalanced
   reform{''} and aimed at spotting areas of least resistance to reforms in
   order to prevent the unification of the efforts of the opponents to
   reforms and direct confrontation between the state and the society.
   However, its Russian version differs remarkably from the Chinese one.
   According to the author, the differences between the Chinese and the
   Russian models of reforms are rooted in the political sphere and are
   associ-ated with the specifics of the electoral and party systems of
   these countries, and most importantly, with the nature of the relations
   in the ``center-regions{''} system. In China, when carrying out reforms,
   the emphasis is placed upon the initiative from below, while Russia
   prefers political instruments that are under the direct control of the
   federal structures.},

Title = {Kelsen's Legal Logic of International Pluralism},
Journal = {AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {62-71},
Abstract = {This paper presents a Kelsenian perspective on international pluralism
   showing that international pluralism is not necessarily the logical
   consequence of sovereignty but bestowed upon states by international law
   through the principle of equality. The paper argues that this leads to
   an improved concept of international pluralism as more than a by-product
   of sovereignty logic. Flowing from Kelsenian legal logic, international
   pluralism and legal cosmopolitanism share the same origin in the
   Grundnorm. Hence, this perspective on international relations appeases
   the perceived conflict between international pluralism and
   cosmopolitanism. Moreover, the paper suggests that the approach provides
   a different framework for analyzing international norms and practices,
   their normative relationship and evolution.},

Abstract = {The authors of the article discuss international humanitarian law (IHL)
   as a normative mechanism for the protection and defense of victims of
   armed conflicts. The problems of IHL due to the loss of effectiveness of
   international legal regulation are pointed out. The aim of the article
   is a broad theoretical-legal and international-practical analysis of the
   transformations of the legal system under conditions of war. The basis
   of this scientific search was a system of methodology, which includes a
   complex of three levels of philosophical, general scientific and
   specifically scientific methods and a group of approaches, conditioned
   by the subject of the research. As a result of the analysis, it was
   shown that the current system of international legal regulation has
   significant drawbacks. The most significant of them is the declarative
   character of the rules, caused by the absence of an effective system of
   accountability and the failure to update the doctrine of IHL rules in
   the light of new challenges and transformations of the political and
   social reality. In addition, the analysis of the organizational and
   administrative problems of the regulation of the law of war indicated
   that the institutional guarantees in a military conflict also need
   revision.},

Abstract = {Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is the result of a
   militarisation of foreign policy that has been evident since 2008. This
   was accompanied by a domestic militarisation process that has
   intensified greatly over the course of the year. Since the failure of
   the planned campaign for quick conquest, the entirety of Russian society
   has been geared towards war. Nonetheless, the country's capability to
   make up for the army's high losses remains limited. The failures in
   Ukraine to date not only reduce Russia's ability to project power in
   other conflicts in the post-Soviet space and beyond. It also undermines
   the regime's legitimacy. But this will not bring an end to the war
   against Ukraine. Rather, the survival of the regime depends on success
   in the war. It will use all means available to conventional and hybrid
   warfare to win.},

Abstract = {The legal regulation for elections to municipal self-government bodies
   in the conditions of the Slovak Republic does not require a minimum
   education of the mayor of the municipality, elected by a system of
   relative majority, the serious consequence of which is the possibility
   of low legitimacy of the winning candidate. Therefore, the main aim of
   the article was to identify an alternative electoral mechanism for
   mayoral election, that would increase the legitimacy of the winning
   candidate, as well as to propose conditions increasing the gain of seats
   by educated mayors, without the need to implement minimum education. The
   proposal for an alternative new electoral system was based on a critical
   analysis of the effects of the current electoral mechanism and with the
   aspiration of creating a winner with greater legitimacy without the need
   for a second round, an alternative voting mechanism was recommended. The
   second level of research accepted the absence of education as a legal
   condition for the exercise of the passive suffrage in the mayoral
   elections, but it was based on the assumption that, in parallel with the
   growing community in terms of population size, the interest in running
   for mayor is increasing. This also increases the probability of electing
   a candidate with the desired prerequisites for such a responsible
   position. From this point of the view, the results of the study
   confirmed the relevance of the need to create a defragmented model of
   local structure as a result of municipal reform.},

Abstract = {My commitment to combining normative concerns with empirical social
   science led, perhaps a bit counterintuitively, to early adoption of
   rational choice political economy. However, it was a modified form of
   rational choice that takes into account ethical and societal concerns.
   This was the approach I applied to considerations of compliance and
   consent with government, what makes a trustworthy government, the
   formation of legitimating beliefs, and finally the construction of an
   expanded and inclusive community of fate as a building block for a new
   moral political economy.},

Abstract = {In September 2022, the Tajik army attacked places along a broad front in
   south-western Kyrgyzstan. It was the largest attack in the conflict over
   the Tajik exclave of Vorukh, in the Batken region. This conflict has
   been waged by violent means on again, off again for over a decade.
   Tajikistan sees the Vorukh basin, which is surrounded by high mountains
   and is known for its fruit farming, not as an exclave, but as an
   integral part of its national territory. However, the narrow strip
   separating Vorukh from Tajikistan is Kyrgyzstan's only link to the city
   of Isfana and the S0101(t0 coalfield in the western part of the country.
   With increasing motorisation, this corridor has become more and more
   important. The conflict is mainly driven by the rapid growth of the
   population in the densely settled Tajik part of the Fergana Valley,
   which is close to the exclave. Tajikistan is choosing a path of violence
   against the backdrop of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,
   which is further weakening Moscow's already battered position of power
   in Central Asia.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {143-154},
Abstract = {This article discusses the International Monetary Fund???s recent effort
   to garner legitimacy by incorporating the reduction of economic
   inequality in its lending programs. It argues that the impact of the US
   as a major shareholder on condition-ality and geopolitical
   considerations beyond objective and measurable economic necessities
   detract from these efforts to expand legitimacy. Using a panel data
   analysis of International Monetary Fund programs between 1980 and 2014,
   the article shows that US-allied left-wing governments receive a larger
   number of labor conditions in their programs compared to non-allied and
   right-wing governments. The article argues that this is part of
   left-wing governments??? strategy of main-taining their alliance with
   the US and demonstrating ideological proximity. In exchange, the US uses
   its influence to secure fewer conditions in total for its allied
   governments. This not only shifts the burden of adjustment on labor
   groups but also harms the Fund???s procedural legitimacy, as conditions
   are not objectively determined. It also has adverse implications for
   outcome legitimacy by distorting economic policies and outcomes and
   increasing income inequality.},

Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {117-164},
Abstract = {This article offers an opening to Central and Eastern Europe (CEE)
   situation and attacks against the judiciary in this region since 2010.
   The focus is not primarily on historical path dependence like the rest
   of this issue. Instead, the focus aims at the nature of attacks on the
   judiciary. Such attacks have appeared in CEE and the US in recent years.
   Its interest lies in explaining similar patterns visible in the
   judiciaries of CEE. Particularly, it looks at the current conditions in
   the Czech judiciary, political interven-tions in Poland since 2015 and
   in Hungary since 2010, and undermining of trust towards judiciary in the
   U.S., where attempts for delegitimizing the judiciary have happened
   since 2016. The article draws on simi-larities of attacks of
   authoritarian governments and responses of judiciaries. The authors
   highlight similari-ties and diversities of CEE countries 30 years after
   the fall of the communist regime and a path of these resemblances and
   varieties.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research was to determine Sweden's positive
   experience in the field of social protection. To achieve this goal,
   general and special scientific research methods were used, in particular
   the system functional method, the method of hermeneutics, dialectical
   and statistical methods. The authors assume that the Scandinavian model
   of social protection (Sweden, Norway, Finland) differs from other
   European countries by a more developed social security system. In
   Scandinavian countries the state model of social protection prevails.
   The concept of ``social protection{''} in these countries has been
   transformed into the concept of ``social welfare{''}. This model
   includes a compulsory social policy, a state-regulated income level and
   the egalitarian and general nature of social benefits and assistance. It
   is concluded that the fundamental principle of the Swedish social model
   is its universality: it covers all segments of the population. For this
   reason, its study is particularly relevant. The article reveals the
   characteristics of social protection against unemployment in Sweden.
   Special attention is paid to the protection of children's rights and
   aspects of family policy and gender equality.},

Abstract = {The State is an institution that should be considered as a complex
   multilevel system, whose managerial effectiveness depends to a large
   extent on the professional training of its human resources. The purpose
   of this article is to investigate and reveal the specificities of the
   process of professionalization of the public service in the context of
   global challenges and modern social changes. In the study, the essence
   and understanding of the concept of professionalization was considered,
   which made it possible to distinguish such approaches as: scientific,
   normative and legal, professional and educational. The main functions of
   professionalization of the public service are defined. It is noted that
   the public service professionalization system has a relationship with
   the environment, so it maintains the balance and order of its internal
   environment and resists chaos. Professionalization is studied as a
   process in the conditions of global challenges and modern social
   changes. It is concluded that, considering the professionalization of
   public service as a process in the conditions of global challenges and
   modern social changes, it is necessary to take into account the opinions
   and positions of professionals to achieve the best results in this
   field.},

Abstract = {Studies have reported alarmingly high rates of traumatic experiences for
   refugee populations. While nearly all refugees experienced trauma in
   their country of origin, a vast majority of those seeking protection
   abroad also face (extreme) violence during their journeys and once in
   the country of destination. By concentrating on the migratory
   experiences of about 300 unaccompanied minors that we approached in
   Libya, Italy, Greece, and Belgium, this article analyses how different
   forms of violence are inflicted on these young migrants while moving to
   Europe. By concentrating on personal accounts of (recurrent)
   interactions with the EU migration and border management tools, we
   reveal the structural violence within the day-to-day governance of
   migration. Often framed as unintended or accidental, the article
   discusses how violence is instead ubiquitous, as it is systematically
   inflicted on migrants???including unaccompanied minors???in the form of
   repeated series of violent events or ???loops of violence.???
   Importantly, such manifestations of violence are perpetrated by key
   institutional and non-institutional actors in the ???migration
   industry??? who are (in)directly involved in managing migration both
   inside and outside of the EU. Conceptually, we rely on K. E. Dempsey???s
   political geography of the different typologies of violence within
   Europe???s governance of migration and asylum and use it to concentrate
   on key transitional phases/fractures in migratory trajectories???i.e.,
   as unaccompanied young migrants (try to) cross international borders and
   legal boundaries.},

Abstract = {Does oil wealth promote or inhibit prospects for civil war? Empirical
   evidence relating oil to civil war onset is mixed, and depends on the
   aims of the rebellion: although separatist civil wars (in which rebels
   aim to create an autonomous region or independent state) occur more
   frequently in oil-rich regions, oil-rich countries experience fewer
   center-seeking civil wars (in which rebels aim to capture the capital
   city). This article provides a new theoretical framework in which the
   challenger strategically chooses its civil war aims. I first incorporate
   strategic civil war aims into a formal bargaining model with commitment
   problems. Then, I derive two countervailing theoretical effects of
   economic activities, such as oil production, that provide an easy source
   of government revenues: a conflict-suppressing revenue effect (more
   money for the government) and a conflict-enhancing predation effect
   (more for the rebels to capture). Finally, I highlight two reasons that
   the magnitude of the oil predation effect is larger for separatist than
   for center-seeking challengers, which connects the theoretical
   implications to the motivating empirical pattern. First, a strategic
   selection effect for ethnic minorities: governments face more severe
   commitment problems toward small ethnic groups - who prefer separatist
   over center-seeking civil war. Second, a geography of rebellion effect:
   oil-funded repression more effectively deters center-seeking challenges
   than peripheral insurgencies.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic imposed new constraints on empirical research, and
   online data collection by social scientists increased. Generalizing from
   experiments conducted during this period of persistent crisis may be
   challenging due to changes in how participants respond to treatments or
   the composition of online samples. We investigate the generalizability
   of COVID era survey experiments with 33 replications of 12 pre-pandemic
   designs, fielded across 13 quota samples of Americans between March and
   July 2020. We find strong evidence that pre-pandemic experiments
   replicate in terms of sign and significance, but at somewhat reduced
   magnitudes. Indirect evidence suggests an increased share of inattentive
   subjects on online platforms during this period, which may have
   contributed to smaller estimated treatment effects. Overall, we conclude
   that the pandemic does not pose a fundamental threat to the
   generalizability of online experiments to other time periods.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the process of transformation of the concept of
   violence in the political and social theory of the 20th - 21st
   centuries. The authors document a tremendous growth of interest in this
   phenomenon despite the absence of a coherent metatheory and attempt to
   trace possible reasons for the appearance of the latter. For this
   purpose, they distinguish two analytical categories - ``classic{''} and
   ``new{''} violence - and consider both concepts in terms of the
   specifics of the action, the object and subject of violence, as well as
   the prevailing models of theoretical explanation.
   Such simplification allows to trace transformations that the category of
   violence has gone through: the transition from a fundamentally
   observable action to a concealed one; from the state, group or person as
   subjects of violence to an impersonal structure; from capturing
   subject's experience to its ``loss{''}; from a functional explanation of
   violence to a dysfunctional one. According to the authors, these changes
   in the conceptualization of violence mean a significant expansion of the
   concept and a simultaneous blurring of its boundaries, which ultimately
   leads to the loss of its discrimination ability. After having diagnosed
   the reinvention of the concept, they highlight three potential
   solutions: to think about violence as a stable concept, in which the
   constitutive elements do not change, but their semantic content does; to
   interpret new conceptualizations of violence as additions to rather than
   replacements of the previous statements; and, finally, to recognize the
   possibility of the coexistence of several understandings of violence.},

Abstract = {What are the most important ministries in Honduras? And why are
   important ministries important? To answer these questions, this study
   offers an analysis of the importance of the Honduran ministerial
   portfolios from 1982 to 2020. For this, this study follows the
   theoretical proposal of Camerlo and Martinez-Gallardo that suggests
   distinguishing four key dimensions (policy management public,
   discretionary allocation of resources, political capacity and
   organizational capacity). The findings of this research showed that the
   ministerial relevance in this country is linked to those portfolios
   that, in addition to having strategic value and impact, potentially have
   the possibility of having discretionary funds to develop clientelistic
   policies that have allowed traditional parties stay in power throughout
   the period analyzed.},

   Social Justice Struggles in Sweden},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {534-553},
Abstract = {Based on interviews with legal practitioners working with or within
   anti-racist social justice movements in Sweden, we explore some dilemmas
   and paradoxes that appear when social movements pursue struggles for
   anti-racist social justice through the legal arena. How do the
   interviewees understand and critically relate to legal practices in
   contemporary anti-racist social justice struggles? What are the
   conditions of engagement of these organisations in the legal arena and
   how do they impact social justice struggles in Sweden? What are the
   stakes in the legal practices of these movements? Rather than a
   strategically chosen tool for social justice, legal practice could be
   understood as a kind of self-defence, as resorting to law is often a
   response to an unjust legal system, oppressive treatment by the state or
   disadvantage and deprivation. The interviewees' reflections on their
   legal practices are informed by a fundamental ambivalence between the
   ideological commitment in the critique of law and their position from
   which it is impossible to ignore the legal arena. Instead of taking a
   clear stance for or against the law as a tool for social justice
   struggles, we have attempted to understand what are the methods and the
   effects of legal practice that grow from this ambivalence. The accounts
   of our interviewees indicate that both practical strategies and ways of
   accounting for these aim at subverting and challenging the law while at
   the same time using it. Throughout the analysis we have conceptualised
   these strategies as decentring, re-politicising and redistribution.},

Abstract = {Social choice theory demonstrates that majority rule is generically
   indeterminate. However, from an empirical perspective, large and
   arbitrary policy shifts are rare events in politics. The uncovered set
   (UCS) is the dominant preference-based explanation for the apparent
   empirical predictability of majority rule in multiple dimensions. Its
   underlying logic assumes that voters act strategically, considering the
   ultimate consequences of their actions. I argue that all empirical
   applications of the UCS rest on an incomplete behavioral model assuming
   purely egoistically motivated individuals. Beyond material
   self-interest, prosocial motivations offer an additional factor to
   explain the outcomes of majority rule. I test my claim in a series of
   committee decision-making experiments in which I systematically vary the
   fairness properties of the policy space while keeping the location of
   the UCS constant. The experimental results overwhelmingly support the
   prosociality explanation.},

Abstract = {The objective of the research was to determine the scope and meaning of
   ``administrative and legal regulation{''} and its components. The main
   purpose of the administrative and legal regulation of the economic
   security of the state is to ensure the implementation and protection of
   the economic rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests of natural and
   legal persons. The methodology was based on the analysis of documentary
   materials for the regulation of the economic security of the state. They
   emphasize in the conclusions that, in its essence, the administrative
   and legal regulation of economic security must be considered in two
   aspects: 1) as a set of rules that regulate public and administrative
   relations in the field of economic security; 2) as a systemic organizing
   influence of state bodies specially authorized in economic and social
   relations through norms ``objective and subjective{''} and other legal
   means, mainly of an administrative nature, for the purpose of their
   protection, improvement and creation of the appropriate conditions for
   further development in the context of ensuring national security.},

Abstract = {The Ukrainian market for literature for children and adolescents has
   undergone a fundamental change since 1991. It has overcome Soviet taboos
   and traumas, mastered economic crises, and confronted the distortion of
   competition from Russian competition. By means of biographies, series on
   Ukrainian history and culture, as well as high-quality illustrated
   books, this market has tapped into a new readership. But print runs
   remain small, the assortment limited. There is a need to catch up.
   Development is being hampered by weak purchasing power and the war. At
   the same time, the war is drawing the attention of foreign publishers of
   children's books to Ukraine and Ukrainian topics.},

Abstract = {Poland was the first country in Central Europe to start dismantling the
   political system of `real socialism' in 1989 and has become a pioneer of
   democratic and market reforms. After 10 years it was admitted to NATO
   and after 15 years to the European Union. Then, gradually, populism,
   nationalism and Euro-skepticism began to grow in Poland, which was
   evident in the years 2005-2007, during the first edition of rules of the
   conservative-nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party. After the next
   eight years of the pragmatic approach of the Polish governments towards
   European integration, the PiS assumed full power in the country in 2015.
   The new president and the PiS government began systematic changes in
   domestic and foreign policy. Populism, illiberalism and authoritarianism
   began dominating in Polish internal politics, and nationalism and
   Euro-skepticism in foreign policy. The most important new phenomena in
   the foreign policy of the PiS government are: (a) the bi-lateralization
   and militarization of security policy based on the strategic partnership
   with the US; (b) Euro-skepticism: anti-Brussels posturing and disputes
   with Germany and France; (c) Poland's nationalistic and great-power
   approach to Russia; and (d) Three Seas Initiative as a dream of Poland's
   greatness. The consequences of this Poland's politics are detrimental to
   itself and to the international environment. It has reduced the
   importance of Poland as a state in Europe and the world. The world's
   perception of Poland is increasingly unfavorable among democratic
   countries, and more favorable among other illiberal countries. But it is
   not favorable with all illiberal countries, because the nationalism that
   accompanies Polish illiberalism makes it impossible to improve relations
   with other not fully democratic or downright undemocratic countries,
   especially Poland's eastern neighbors. Poland's foreign policy is facing
   serious challenges, some of which Poland created on its own and is
   unable to address effectively. This means that there is a growing
   problem of incompatibility between Poland's policies and the changing
   international order.},

Title = {A SYSTEMIC CRISIS: POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE 1989 TIANANMEN SQUARE

Abstract = {The article attempts to revise the understanding of the nature of
   China's 1989 Tiananmen Square crisis and its consequences in the context
   of comparison with Soviet/Russian history of 1980-1990s. Several dozens
   of studies and op-ed pieces focused on the problem earlier (especially
   in Russian-language literature) but these papers lacked Chinese sources,
   intended to liken the Tiananmen Square crisis to the Russian agenda, and
   simplified complicated cause-effects relations of the Chinese historical
   process. As a result, the conclusions are limited to the question of the
   necessity of a decisive crackdown on any turmoil or political
   manifestation as a sole tool to protect one nation's stability and
   prosperity. China's stability and prosperity after the Tiananmen Square
   Crisis should not be seen as a result of crackdowns. Paradoxically,
   despite the conservatives' victory in 1989, China got back to the path
   of reforms several years after the Tiananmen Square events. It can be
   attributed to the complex set of internal and external factors, and the
   freezing of China's political reforms was just one of them. Moreover,
   the process was facilitated not only by overcoming its political crisis
   but also by observing the revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe. Faced
   with the threat of being ousted from power, China's elites consolidated
   - a factor that became crucial for the implementation of systemic market
   reforms in the 1990s. The author concludes that a similar situation was
   observed in post-Soviet Russia in 1998-2000: the Russian financial
   crisis and several events including Second Chechnya Campaign became the
   `backbone crisis' of Vladimir Putin's presidency.},

Title = {The relationship between level of education and household income in the
   justification of political violence in the EU. the moderating effect of
   poverty at the country level},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},

Abstract = {Several studies show that political violence justification (PVJ) is
   associated with unfavourable social and economic characteristics such as
   poor education, low income, and poverty at the national level. However,
   the mechanisms by which these factors interact remain unclear. This
   study aims to find out whether poverty at the country level (contextual
   poverty) moderates the relationship between individuals' educational
   level and household income, and PVJ in the European Union (EU). We
   perform an analysis using a dataset of 15.347 individuals from twelve EU
   countries who participated in the European Values Survey, 2017. Logistic
   regressions models with interaction terms were used to analyze factors
   related to PVJ. Our findings are twofold. First, we find no evidence of
   educational level and PVJ's relationship in countries with medium levels
   of contextual poverty. In contrast, in countries with low levels of
   contextual poverty, individuals with medium educational level were
   associated with higher PVJ. Second, individuals living in countries with
   lower levels of contextual poverty and higher household income were
   associated with higher PVJ. We conclude that more individuals tend to
   justify political violence in countries with lower contextual poverty
   levels-individuals with medium educational level and higher household
   income. To our knowledge, this is the first study to find evidence that
   education and socioeconomic status may amplify PVJ in the EU.},

Title = {Do competitive districts get more political attention? Strategic use of
   geographic representation during campaign and non-campaign periods},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {MPs are elected as delegates of their electoral district to represent
   their constituents' interests. Geographical representation is considered
   a central quality indicator for legislative systems. Yet whether the
   strategic use of geographic representation is affected by tactical
   campaign considerations has received less attention. The availability of
   social media data on a fine-grained level allows us to fill this gap by
   studying the following question: To what extent do politicians
   strategically use geographic representation during electoral campaign
   and non-campaign times? I combine literature comparing campaign and
   non-campaign periods with studies on strategic incentives for MPs to
   geographic representation. Empirically, I rely on quantitative
   text-analytical tools to study German politicians' tweets from the
   entire 19th legislative period (2017-2021). My findings have important
   implications for the geographic representation literature as they imply
   that MPs use geographic ref-erences strategically, especially during
   campaign periods. Prospective competitive districts receive
   substantially more political attention already during non-campaign
   periods, yet further amplified during electoral campaigns.},

Abstract = {Lobbyists often target legislators who are aligned with them rather than
   opponents. The choice of whom to lobby affects both what information
   becomes available to legislators and how much influence special interest
   groups exert on policies. However, the conditions under which aligned
   legislators are targeted are not well understood. We investigate how the
   pressure to conclude policies quickly affects the strategic decision of
   whom to lobby. We derive conditions on the cost of delaying policies and
   on the distribution of legislators' preferences for lobbyists to prefer
   targeting allies. We show that the use of allied intermediaries has
   important implications for the duration of policymaking and the quality
   of policies. Counterintuitively, an increase in time pressure can
   increase the duration of policymaking and a longer duration does not
   always lead to better informed policies.},

Abstract = {Many scholars and policymakers see rising debt burdens in the
   industrialised world as the product of ageing populations. Prominent
   theoretical models of government debt accumulation - used to justify
   fiscal rules and austerity measures - explicitly assume that support for
   debt reduction decreases with age. While such models have been
   influential, the fundamental relationship between age and preferences
   for debt has not been tested empirically. We test this argument but
   further theorise that the relationship between age and debt preferences
   is non-linear. While the elderly have a clear preference for ignoring
   debt burdens, we add that the young should also prefer to delay
   reckoning with high national debts given their low income and
   expectations of higher future earnings. Using survey data (N = 112,689),
   we find that age does have a small to modest non-linear impact on
   concern for national deficits and debt burdens. Middle-aged respondents
   are most concerned about debt reduction, while the young and old view
   reducing government debt as less of a policy priority. Notably, the
   relationship is strongest in countries with more generous old-age
   benefits.},

Abstract = {Karl Popper characterizes the open society as a civilization that allows
   egalitarian conversation, distinguishes the facts of nature from
   normative values, eschews a foretold historical trajectory, avoids a
   binary contrast of wholly right to wholly wrong, and in consequence,
   shores up a constitutional and democratic polity. Critics have pointed
   that Popper himself occasionally endorses a moralistic view of nature, a
   foretold historical plot, a binary form of presentation, and a
   constrained view of democracy. I argue that these apparent anomalies in
   Popper's outlook are interlinked in the same way that Popper expects
   them to be in the closed society and are presented in the binary fashion
   he ascribes to the closed society. The open society derives its
   perception of politics from a structured understanding of nature and
   history and divides the field into two opposing camps that are
   simultaneously political, moral and ideological, disallowing third
   options, such as political realism.},

Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},

Volume = {23},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Democratic accountability relies on voters to punish their
   representatives for policies they dislike. Yet, a separation-of-powers
   system can make it hard to know who is to blame, and partisan biases
   further distort voters' evaluations. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
   precautionary policies were put into place sometimes by governors,
   sometimes by mayors, and sometimes by no one at all, allowing us to
   identify when voters hold out-party versus in-party politicians
   responsible for policies. With a survey spanning 48 states, we test our
   theory that attitudes toward policies and parties intersect to determine
   when selective attribution takes place. We find that as individuals
   increasingly oppose a policy, they are more likely to blame whichever
   level of government is led by the out-party. This is most pronounced
   among partisans with strong in-party biases. We provide important
   insight into the mechanisms that drive selective attribution and the
   conditions under which democratic accountability is at risk.},

Abstract = {In the light of a series of right-wing populist successes, some
   observers concluded that there is a kind of populist contagion going on
   and that the global wave of radical right populism (RRP) has finally
   reached Latin America. Yet, a premature categorization based on outward
   similarities eventually leads to omitting important differences. The aim
   of this article is a typological assessment of four recent cases of
   right-wing populism in Latin America-Jair Bolsonaro (Brazil), Jose
   Antonio Kast (Chile), Guido Manini Rios (Uruguay), and Javier Milei
   (Argentina)-to clarify their correspondence with Cas Mudde's concept of
   RRP. The questions to be addressed are the following: Are these four
   leaders and their parties radically right? Are they right-wing in
   cultural terms (nativist and authoritarian)? Are they populist? And do
   they have sufficient features in common to speak of a right-wing
   populist wave?},

Abstract = {Hurricane Camille, a devastating Category Five hurricane which hit the
   Gulf Coast of the U.S. in August, 1969, prompted a reassessment of U.S.
   disaster relief policy. The American National Red Cross, which had
   played the dominant role in disaster relief for individuals in the U.S.
   since the turn of the century, saw its role in disaster relief
   challenged on a number of fronts. Facing failures in its response to
   Camille, financial challenges in meeting every-more-costly disasters in
   the post-World War Two era, and rising expectations of both adequacy and
   equity on the part of disaster victims, the non-governmental agency
   ultimately found its role diminished by both the expansion of federal
   disaster relief programs and by the increasing prominence of disaster
   programs performed by other voluntary agencies such as the Salvation
   Army and the Mennonite Disaster Service.},

   itself already produces at least three interwoven paradoxes: 1) paradox
   of addressee; 2) pa-radox of receiver; and 3) paradox of demand. Those
   paradoxes point to the exi-stence of trauma inside the culture that
   becomes tangible in the time of crises and is reflected, among other
   things, as the awareness of the split in subject (Jacques Lacan). This
   awareness of the split as `extimate' experience broad-ens the binary
   interpretation of cultural trauma proposed by Jeffrey Alexan-der, who
   situates trauma between the event and its representation, in which the
   representation is the source of trauma, not the event itself. The
   presented cases point to the conclusion that the event itself is already
   symbolic and, hence, representational, but in the inverse sense, as an
   object that is missing in the symbolic or Lacanian algebra as ``object
   a{''} that is the source of trau-matic repetition.},

Abstract = {What explains the success of the Bhartiya Janta Party in the 18th Uttar
   Pradesh Vidhan Sabha election? Hindutva gets the due credit but the
   socio-political dynamics beneath Hindutva is often sidelined in
   political discussions. What makes Hindutva appealing? Is Hindutva a
   fixed ideology or an ever-evolving one? How does Hindutva correspond
   with the lived realities of people? How does Hindutva plug the
   alternative discourse of Social Justice? How does Hindutva redefine
   Dalit politics? While exploring these questions, the article seeks to
   shift the discourse from the site of culture-identity-ideology to the
   site of social and political-economic changes. While tracking the
   trajectory and nature of Hindutva politics, the article also indicates
   some of the trends that emerged during this election. Based on
   qualitative data, the article argues that it was essentially the dynamic
   nature of Hindutva that outwitted social justice politics.},

Abstract = {Historically, the U.S. strategy in the Black Sea region has been stable,
   limited, and not ambitious as American administrations prioritized
   certain foreign policy objectives over other interests. This careful
   strategy was transformed during the Clinton Administration in the
   mid-1990s as the U.S. started following an extensive foreign policy
   framework, which included all American national interests, formulated by
   Bruce Jentleson in his 4Ps framework: power, peace, prosperity, and
   principles. The article argues that this transformation was problematic
   because of two obstacles -the illusion of the unipolar moment and the
   growing polarization in American domestic politics- which prevented the
   U.S. from following an effective policy in the Black Sea region.},

Abstract = {Dystopia, just as utopia, has always been immersed in political visions:
   utopia as an ideal society and dystopia as its opposite: `bad place' - a
   futuristic, usu-ally very near future, an imagined universe in which
   oppressive social control rules. However, utopia and dystopia cannot be
   absolutely separated, there is a constant threat of replacing good place
   by bad place, very often leading to the conclusion that every utopia
   either leads to dystopia or already is dystopia. Today, it often seems
   that the dystopian future has already arrived, the reality itself evokes
   dystopian imagination: the global warming and the catastrophes, the
   monstrous underside of various technologies that would ultimately
   over-power us - humans. Furthermore, both utopia and dystopia are
   narratives about how to govern the commons. Whereas in the past the
   commons appeared in different utopian visions of good governing, today
   most often the commons fleshes out in disfigured forms of dystopian
   narratives. In this essay I analyze dystopian imagination as a traumatic
   symptom of the commons, expressed in different narratives of the crisis
   of capitalism (the Anthropocene, the global monsters, the uncanny
   weather, metaverse, neo-or techno-feudalism).},

Abstract = {The transition from economic protectionism to free trade in the
   late-1950s saw the Irish government embark on a project to improve the
   state's image abroad. Up to that point, the state had endured a
   tempestuous relationship with British newspapers and the adoption of
   free trade necessitated a new rapport to encourage positive coverage of
   the industrialisation project. The key components of this strategy were
   the courting of British newspapers through state sponsorship of special
   supplements, facilitating visits by British journalists to industrial
   sites, and providing interview access to senior ministers. Such actions
   constituted the state's first exercise in nation branding and
   represented a sea change in how it interacted with British media. This
   article offers an analysis of this project to project an image of a
   modern, industrial Ireland for overseas consumption. It finds that the
   project was only partly successful: while much coverage highlighted the
   state's economic modernisation, this was often accompanied by commentary
   that was critical of the lack of social change. It also finds that the
   tensions present in this initial nation branding project also
   characterised later nation branding projects.},

Abstract = {What explains South Korean public perceptions of the US military
   presence in their country? Most estimates place South Korea's share of
   the military costs at around 41\%. In 2020, the Trump administration
   pushed for South Korea to pay five times more than previous agreements,
   while the Biden administration in 2021 ultimately settled on a 14\%
   increase. However, previous research has not directly tackled whether
   the public is cost-sensitive to the US presence nor what percentage of
   the costs the public deems as fair. Through original survey data with an
   embedded experiment, we identify that public support of the need for
   American military assistance declined when framed in terms of demands
   that South Korea pay more. However, we find that the perceived
   appropriate cost share and overall views of the US military presence
   were not influenced by demands for a higher cost-share.},

Abstract = {Territorial claims with an ethnic or identity component have been
   recognized as one of the most enduring and intractable sources of
   international conflict. Building on previous research which recognized
   the role of issue indivisibility in making compromise more difficult,
   this article focuses on the management of territorial claims with an
   identity or ethnic component. Utilizing the latest Issue Correlates of
   War (ICOW) dataset, the frequency, success, and qualitative content of
   negotiations over territorial claims are analyzed. The newest version of
   the ICOW dataset expands the spatial domain of Hensel and Mitchell's
   previous work that included the Americas and Western Europe, expanding
   this domain to include the entire world, and more closely examines the
   role of concessions in the negotiations process. The results support the
   contention that issue indivisibility hampers compromise behavior and
   negotiation success in identity-based territorial claims. Negotiations
   are less likely to occur, but surprisingly, more likely to succeed.
   Successful agreements are also more likely to see major concessions and
   territorial change. Identity-based claims are also less likely to end
   through compromise outcomes like negotiations, and more likely to
   terminate through unilateral action and violence. The results suggest
   that identity claims are punctuated by rare bouts of significant
   negotiations-much of which is driven by conquest, violence, and
   unilateral action. Related ArticlesAyelet, Harel-Shalev. 2009. ``Lingual

Abstract = {Do the styles politicians use influence how voters evaluate them, and
   does this matter more for women than for men? Politicians regularly use
   anecdotal arguments, emotional appeals and aggressive attacks when
   communicating with voters. However, that women politicians have been
   branded as `nasty', `inhuman' and `unfeminine' suggests that these
   strategies may come at a price for some. I report on a novel survey
   experiment assessing whether voters are biased in their perceptions and
   evaluations of politicians' communication styles. By manipulating
   politician gender and argument style, I assess, first, whether
   politicians incur backlash when violating gender-based stereotypes and,
   secondly, whether differential perceptions of the styles themselves
   explain this backlash. I find that style usage has important
   consequences for how voters evaluate politicians but that this is not
   gendered. These results have important implications, as they suggest
   that women politicians may not need to conform to stereotype-expected
   behaviours in order to receive positive voter evaluations.},

Abstract = {What can American partisan affect groups tell us about different models
   of partisan affect over a recent snapshot in time? Moreover, what
   implications do these groups have for political trust over that same
   snapshot in time? Results from the 2020 and 2016 American National
   Election Studies suggest that most partisans feel positively toward
   their inparty and negatively toward their outparty
   (Classically-Polarized)-consistent with classical approaches to
   affective polarization. However, some feel negatively toward their
   inparty and outparty (Double-Dislikers)-more consistent with negative
   partisanship models. Finally, some feel positively toward their inparty
   and outparty (Double-Likers). Despite recent work suggesting increasing
   outparty and inparty animosity, which implies growth in Double-Dislikers
   and the Classically-Polarized, only the Classically-Polarized grew
   between 2016 and 2020. Regarding political trust, compared to the
   Classically-Polarized, Double-Dislikers are associated with less
   political trust, whereas Double-Likers are associated with increasingly
   more political trust, suggesting substantive reasons for focusing on
   each group.},

Year = {2024},

Number = {2},

Abstract = {Asians in the United States have traditionally been treated as a
   monolithic group, both in public discourse and political science
   research. How unifying is the pan-ethnic label in practice? Using a
   survey experiment, I measure changes in the importance of one's Asian
   and national origin identities in response to identity-based threats. I
   innovate on previous designs by using identity threats that differ in
   the group that (1) is the intended target and (2) is actually
   discriminated against, reflecting a common experience where Asians are
   mistaken for a different background. Experimental results from a sample
   of 2000 Asian respondents show that national origin identity becomes
   more salient in the face of identity threat, whereas Asian identity does
   not. Additionally, whether one's national origin identity becomes more
   salient depends on the type of identity threat. These results suggest
   that Asians' sense of pan-ethnic identity is not conditional on their
   national origin identity, with implications for the expected effects of
   identity primes in electoral and political contexts, as well as for
   research designs relying on such identity primes.},

Abstract = {The paper provides an overview of the contribution of Croatian
   researchers, primarily scientists and associates from the Faculty of
   Political Sciences, Uni-versity of Zagreb, to research and teaching of
   political communication, po-litical marketing and public relations in
   Croatia. All three disciplines belong to the field of strategic
   communication, which refers to a purposeful use of communication by
   individuals, organizations, institutions or states aimed at achieving
   their strategic goals. The paper shows how Croatia, despite its be-lated
   enrolment in the market communication, quickly caught up with
   interna-tional research and academic trends in the field. The role of
   the Faculty in this process was the one of a pioneer and a leader.
   Researchers from the Faculty, as well as other Croatian scientists, have
   been contributing to the conceptualiza-tion and comparative analyses of
   contemporary election campaigns, as well as to the research of the
   phenomena of Americanization, personalization, pack-aging of politics,
   populism, celebrity populism, disinformation, e-democracy, cyber
   politics and others. In the field of public relations, particularly
   note-worthy are contributions related to image, identity and nation
   branding, crisis communication, strategic communication in tourism and
   evaluation in public relations.},

Abstract = {This article fills a gap in existing research by focusing on the
   political representation of denizens-legal residents not holding
   citizenship of the country and thus generally excluded from legislative
   politics. The empirical research on the effects of the presence of
   under-represented groups in representative bodies indicates that ``who
   represents{''} (descriptive) is as important as ``what is being
   represented{''} (substantive). In this article, we analyze the extent to
   which an elected body of denizens (KAV) in the German city of Frankfurt
   provides a descriptive and substantive representation. We find that in
   Frankfurt, the body elected by denizens to represent denizens does not
   represent denizens. In providing inference about the descriptive and
   substantive representation of denizens in KAV, our research contributes
   to broadening the study of representation by focusing on an understudied
   group, non-traditional venues, and claim-making as a form of
   representative politics.},

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Politics and science have become increasingly intertwined. Salient
   scientific issues, such as climate change, evolution, and stem-cell
   research, become politicized, pitting partisans against one another.
   This creates a challenge of how to effectively communicate on such
   issues. Recent work emphasizes the need for tailored messages to
   specific groups. Here, we focus on whether generalized messages also can
   matter. We do so in the context of a highly polarized issue: extreme
   COVID-19 vaccine resistance. The results show that science-based, moral
   frame, and social norm messages move behavioral intentions, and do so by
   the same amount across the population (that is, homogeneous effects).
   Counter to common portrayals, the politicization of science does not
   preclude using broad messages that resonate with the entire population.},

Title = {Simulating the US National Security Interagency Process: Solid
   Foundations and a Method of Assessment},

Abstract = {An active learning approach to the study of US national security
   decision making decision making can be achieved through the use of an
   in-class role-playing simulation. This article considers the importance
   of solid foundations for simulation design: (1) simulation preparation
   should be linked to class materials and learning outcomes, but also
   stand on its own; and (2) success in mirroring reality requires a
   careful, even rigid, simulation structure. This article also provides a
   methodology for assessing the simulation's impact on two separate
   issues: (1) student knowledge of the national security interagency
   process (based on a knowledge quiz given three times during the
   semester); and (2) student perception of the difficulty of making of
   national security decisions (based on a questionnaire given three times
   during the semester). Students were assigned roles within the national
   security bureaucracy, and presented with a challenge-the possibility of
   large-scale Iranian intervention in the Syrian Civil War. The assessment
   of student knowledge is still a work in process, complicated by
   logistical factors. The assessment of student perceptions of difficulty
   of decision making, however, yielded interesting preliminary results
   that should be replicated to make any conclusions more robust: Students
   began the course with a perception that national security decision
   making is highly complicated and difficult. Following lectures and
   readings, the perception of difficulty decreased significantly. However,
   the simulation increased student perception of decision making
   difficulty dose to its original level. These results suggest that
   simulations are important for capturing complexities within decision
   making that lectures alone cannot.},

Abstract = {NATO has reaffirmed crisis management as one of its `core tasks, even as
   it strengthens collective defence amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and
   specifically refers to the need to learn from Afghanistan. Henrik Larsen
   argues that NATO needs to face the uncomfortable realities that can
   explain the failure of its most ambitious and deadliest operation in its
   history. Given that the Afghanistan experience makes a strong case
   against crisis management, he argues that NATO should refine its
   definition: `crisis' synonymous with the prevention of inter-state
   conflict rather than diffuse threats such as global terrorism; and
   `management' synonymous with over-the-horizon rather than open-ended
   operations or the supply of weapons like the case of Ukraine.},

Abstract = {Political alignment with the United States became an essential aspect of
   Brazilian foreign policy once Jair Bolsonaro came to power in Brazil.
   While close ties to Washington had already been established since the
   interregnum period of the Temer government, far-right ideological
   synergies between Bolsonaro and Donald Trump became more highly visible.
   A common anticommunism stance inter-linked with antiglobalism reflected
   commonalities in regional politics and a pronounced strengthening of
   defense and security ties. Yet, Bolsonaro-Trump common worldviews did
   not spill over in Brazilian international economics. While political
   relations with the United States took on major importance, Brazil's
   investment and trade ties with China were maintained and even expanded.
   This article focuses on Brazil-United States relations during the
   Bolsonaro-Trump years. To make sense of this link, two elucidatory paths
   are drawn-a comparative historical overview that traces previous moments
   of bilateral ideological synergies to evaluate the exceptional character
   of Bolsonaro-Trump bilateralism; and contextualization within the
   process of redistribution of world power intertwined with the rise of
   China, which has deeply affected the leadership capacity of the United
   States.},

Abstract = {The US Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health ended
   the federal right to an abortion, first pronounced in the 1973 case Roe
   v. Wade. Dobbs has immediate implications for American women, but it
   also exposes a growing hostility by the court to the doctrine of
   `substantive due process' on which many other federal rights rely. This
   article argues that the court's weakening of substantive due process is
   a direct challenge to the constitutional transformation wrought by the
   Fourteenth Amendment following the Civil War. The amendment asserted a
   national standard of fundamental rights, profoundly rebalancing power
   away from the states. Should the Supreme Court extend the logic of
   Dobbs, the national basis for many substantive due process rights will
   be removed. The court is reviving a kind of states' rights
   constitutional thinking hitherto unseen by the current generation of
   Americans.},

Abstract = {Although a basic income (BI) has already been widely debated, the
   COVID-19 crisis further intensified the discussion about this periodic
   cash payment that is unconditionally delivered to all. However, it
   remains unclear whether the crisis spurred a wave of public support for
   its introduction. To investigate this, we aim to answer two research
   questions: (1) How did support for a BI evolve in reaction to the
   COVID-19 crisis? and (2) To what extent did the evolution in support
   differ across regional contexts and social groups with varying levels of
   deprivation? We rely on a natural experiment by analysing data from the
   Belgian National Elections Study that was collected both before and
   during the pandemic. The results indicate an increase in support for a
   BI due to the pandemic, although it seems short lived and not
   necessarily specific to a BI. Importantly, however, the increase in
   popularity is only observable in the high-unemployment French-speaking
   region of Belgium and among relatively deprived groups.},

Abstract = {More than one year since its coup, the Myanmar military has neither
   established effective control of the territory nor crushed online
   dissent. What factors have enabled the resistance forces to deny the
   consolidation of military rule? We address this question by building a
   novel theoretical framework that incorporates the role of long-standing
   digitalized pro-democracy activism and by conducting a mixed methods
   analysis that includes an original, largely representative sample of
   public Facebook posts in post-coup Myanmar. We find that the development
   of online and hybrid pro-democracy activism against digital abuse and
   other illiberal policies under previous quasi-civilian governments
   enabled anti-coup resistance forces to thwart the military's attempt at
   authoritarian revival in 2021. Our research findings deepen
   understanding of Myanmar's post-coup contestation dynamics as well as
   other cases of unpopular autocratization in the digital age.},

Abstract = {This study classifies the forms of government present in all the
   countries worldwide. We examined the constitutions of 195 countries and
   prepared a template that allows us to determine the form of government
   of any given country. The study contributes to the literature in several
   ways. First, we support Shugart and Carey's claim that the
   president-parliamentary and premier-presidential forms are main types in
   themselves and not subtypes of semi-presidentialism. Second, based on
   some fundamental differences, we divided the assembly-government form
   into two subtypes, namely assembly-independent and assembly-dependent,
   the latter being introduced as a new subtype. The third significant
   contribution is to coin a new form of government named semi-monarchial,
   which is positioned between parliamentary and monarchy forms. Lastly,
   the study reveals that the most preferred form in the world is
   parliamentary (57), followed by presidential (43), premier-presidential
   (31), president-parliamentary (28), assembly-government (13),
   semi-monarchial (8), and monarchy (4).},

Abstract = {The Yemeni conflict is complicated due to the numerous internal crises
   and disputes in the country. In addition, the external correlations and
   their linkages to the internal actors have increased the intensity of
   the conflict. There is a need to identify these internal and external
   actors and analyze their role, impact, strengths, and weaknesses. This
   study identifies the internal and external actors of the conflict in
   Yemen, then examines their roles and impact and shows that the conflict
   resulted from internal conflicts between local actors and took on
   different dimensions through regional and international interventions.
   The political, ideological, and self-interest differences are the causes
   of the disunity among the elites and the political and military forces,
   and in turn, they led to the exacerbation of the conflict and the
   negative role in peacemaking.},

   Often Fail},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Abstract = {Politicians and social activists frequently employ media designed to
   ``change hearts and minds{''} by humanizing out-groups. These messages,
   it is assumed, lead to empathic concern, which motivates individuals to
   reconsider punitive policy attitudes. How effective is this approach?
   Using two experiments, we find that while media messages humanized
   Latinos for all respondents, the treatment messages produced the largest
   empathy response among those with the most positive prior attitudes. A
   key intended target of the media messages-those with the highest
   pretreatment antipathy toward the out-group-reported a dramatically
   lower increase in empathy. In a second study, we show that unpleasant
   affect from dissonance is one important mechanism driving these
   differential results. In both studies, treatments designed to provoke
   increased empathic concern produced little change in policy attitudes.
   Thus, changing hearts using empathy-inducing media is a complex task,
   making the ability to change minds elusive.},

Abstract = {Shifts in late-counted votes often spark unfounded claims of electoral
   fraud. These claims exploit the early-count mirage: the expedient
   illusion that, absent fraud, an early advantage will persist. We
   characterize the early-count mirage and evaluate associated fraud claims
   in four disputed elections, focusing on the case of Bolivia in 2019.
   When late-counted votes delivered a narrow victory for the incumbent,
   fraud accusations followed-with dramatic political consequences. But we
   find that the vote-share trend can be explained without invoking fraud
   and that the allegedly suspicious shift in late-counted votes was
   actually an artifact of methodological and coding errors on the part of
   electoral observers. We document similar patterns in the other three
   cases. The details are context specific, but the core insights are
   general: time trends from legitimate vote-counting processes are far
   more varied-and errors in influential analysis far more frequent-than
   election skeptics allege.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The negative ``Trump Effect{''} on international students has attracted
   wide media and scholarly attention. Surprisingly, the best existing
   evidence remains anecdotal and case-based. In this study, we fill this
   important gap. We employ a difference-in-differences (DID) design to
   estimate the Trump effect for the US vis-a-vis various control groups:
   top 5, top 10, top 20, and all other countries that compete with the US.
   We find a statistically significant and negative Trump effect that
   drives international students from the US to competing destinations.
   Relative to the top five competitors, about 12\% fewer students came to
   the US during the first 3 years of the Trump Presidency. The average
   treatment effect is statistically significant across the top 5, top 10,
   and top 20 destination groups but not for the group of all other
   destinations as a whole. Pairwise DID estimates between the US and 91
   individual countries further indicate that the Trump effect is primarily
   driven by 26 host nations. These findings contribute to our
   understanding of Trump effects, student flows, and migration.},

Abstract = {Drawing on a Gramscian Regulation Approach and Harvey's accumulation by
   dispossession thesis, this article discusses the structural and
   hegemonic mechanisms of the neoliberal transformation of Sweden's
   welfare sectors. Providing new longitudinal data on welfare
   retrenchment, corporate governance, wealth shares, and private economic
   power, the article further analyzes how the transformation of the
   Swedish post-war universal welfare model is related to class struggle
   and accumulation regime change in the Swedish economy. Following a
   decade-long countermobilization of Swedish capital and a severe economic
   crisis in the early 1990s, neoliberal economic common sense was cemented
   among social democratic policy elites that manifested itself in an
   institutionalized austerity polity, leading to a slow but steady
   dismantling of the Swedish welfare project. Roughly a fifth of employees
   in the three largest welfare sectors work in private welfare companies
   that generate tax-financed profits on politically created welfare
   markets. Welfare profits are in turn defended by a welfare-industrial
   complex and undergirded by a hegemonic bloc consisting of capital elites
   and sympathetic policymakers. In the virtual absence of vocal
   antihegemonic forces, many social democratic leaders have limited
   criticism against welfare profits throughout the last decades. On the
   contrary, austerity measures practiced by Swedish social democrats have
   thereto led to deteriorating social cohesion and spawned distrust among
   core social democratic voters.},

Abstract = {Partisan voters tend to seek political news from media sources that
   match their predispositions. Scholars and pundits often attribute this
   partisan media sorting to psychological biases, and they typically
   assume that it leads voters to make worse decisions at the ballot box.
   To reinterpret this evidence and provide an alternative explanation, we
   develop two formal models of media choice-one in which voters only want
   to hear good news about their party and another in which voters only
   care about making good electoral decisions. Both models predict partisan
   media sorting, so sorting does not constitute evidence that voters are
   poorly informed or that they are driven by psychological biases.
   However, the models do produce competing predictions about when voters
   will consume more or less news and about whether signals from the news
   should influence vote choices. Reassessing the empirical literature, we
   find some support for both explanations.},

Abstract = {Despite increasing access to high quality television (TV) series in the
   golden age of television, political scientists (and especially scholars
   of comparative politics) have not systematically considered the
   possibilities that television series might offer for instruction. This
   article aims to fill this gap by illustrating the opportunities for
   teaching political science using TV series and outlining ways of
   integrating television series into the classroom using selected clips,
   screening full episodes, or using an entire series as a text. We then
   illustrate these methods by discussing ways that television series might
   be used in a typical introductory course on European politics.},

Abstract = {The ``rise of global populism{''} has become a primary metanarrative for
   the previous decade in advanced industrial democracies, but I argue that
   it is a deeply misleading one. Nativism-not populism-is the defining
   feature of both radical right parties in Western Europe and of radical
   right politicians like Donald Trump in the United States. The tide of
   ``left-wing populism{''} in Europe receded quickly, as did its promise
   of returning power to the people through online voting and policy
   deliberation. The erosion of democracy in states like Hungary has not
   been the result of populism, but rather of the deliberate practice of
   competitive authoritarianism. Calling these disparate phenomena
   ``populist{''} obscures their core features and mistakenly attaches
   normatively redeeming qualities to nativists and authoritarians.},

   in Israel's standing in the Middle East. The accords created a positive
   atmosphere that helped promote regional cooperation in security and the
   economy. This positive change does not, however, provide an answer to
   some of the fundamental challenges that Israel is facing, which cast
   their shadows on the entire region, such as the Iranian threat -
   Tehran's regional ambitions and its efforts to gain nuclear
   capabilities; but first and foremost, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
   which is getting further and further away from a solution, and may flare
   up and damage regional stability and hinder the progress in Israeli-Arab
   relations, which was achieved following the signing of the Abraham
   accords.},

Abstract = {The violent conclusion of Trump's 2017-21 presidency has produced
   sobering reassessments of American democracy. Elected officials' actions
   necessarily implicate public opinion, but to what extent did Trump's
   presidency and its anti-democratic efforts reflect shifts in public
   opinion in prior years? Were there attitudinal changes that served as
   early-warning signs? We answer those questions via a fifteen-wave,
   population-based panel spanning 2007 to 2020. Specifically, we track
   attitudes on system legitimacy and election fairness, assessments of
   Trump and other politicians, and open-ended explanations of vote choice
   and party perceptions. Across measures, there was little movement in
   public opinion foreshadowing Trump's norm-upending presidency, though
   levels of out-party animus were consistently high. Recent shifts in
   public opinion were thus not a primary engine of the Trump presidency's
   anti-democratic efforts or their violent culmination. Such stability
   suggests that understanding the precipitating causes of those efforts
   requires attention to other actors, including activists and elites.},

Abstract = {The European sovereign debt crisis resulted in policies of fiscal
   austerity and economic downturn in Greece, marked by a prolonged period
   of recession and high unemployment. This article explores the social
   impact of the economic crisis, focusing on its effects on altruism using
   new household-level survey data and quasi-behavioral outcomes. We focus
   on the effects of joblessness, the most severe form of economic hardship
   imposed as a result of the crisis. Our findings reveal a strong
   relationship between job loss in the household and decreased altruism.
   We provide experimental evidence of these effects and of in-group bias
   in charitable giving as a result of joblessness. Our results show that
   joblessness intensifies survey respondents' preferences for national as
   opposed to foreign charities.},

Abstract = {With every referendum, the question of whether and how approval quorums
   affect political participation gains importance but remains largely
   unexplored. Although the approval quorum limits direct-democratic
   referendums in Germany, while also being widespread in other countries,
   research has focused on analyzing the participation quorum instead. We
   argue that approval quorums, too, provide incentives for citizens and
   collective actors to boycott the vote. In this paper, we, therefore,
   analyze the influence of approval quorums on turnout in referendums
   based on an analysis of citizen-initiated referendums at the state level
   in Germany. Besides comparing referendums with and without approval
   quorums, we carry out regression analyses to calculate the correlation
   between quorum levels, the salience of the referendum questions, and
   voter turnout. In line with our theoretical expectations, our results
   indicate a robust negative correlation between the level of approval
   quorums and turnout in referendums-particularly in low-salience
   referendums-which, however, is rarely significant.},

Title = {Performing Crisis? Trump, Populism and the GOP in the Age of COVID-19},
Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 23},
Abstract = {Although populist figures are often thought to thrive during crises that
   allow them to `perform' decisive leadership, the US experience under
   Donald Trump during the COVID-19 crisis demonstrates that the opposite
   may sometimes occur. Despite its scientific and medical prowess, the US
   suffered more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country in the
   world during the first year of the pandemic, and this abysmal
   performance was largely attributable to a failure of government. Fixated
   on the pandemic's economic effects and its potential political fallout,
   the Trump administration's framing of the crisis tried to minimize the
   public health emergency, externalize blame through a focus on the
   Chinese scapegoat and accuse the media and Democrats of hyping the
   pandemic to undermine Trump's presidency. In responding to the pandemic,
   Trump and his allies cast doubt on scientific and medical expertise that
   called for more aggressive testing, mask wearing and social-distancing
   measures. Trump delegated responsibility for crisis management to
   subnational governments and the private sector, and he politicized their
   efforts to regulate social behaviour in the public interest,
   intensifying partisan polarization.},

Abstract = {Political scientists frequently interpret the results of conjoint
   experiments as reflective of majority preferences. In this article, we
   show that the target estimand of conjoint experiments, the average
   marginal component effect (AMCE), is not well defined in these terms.
   Even with individually rational experimental subjects, the AMCE can
   indicate the opposite of the true preference of the majority. To show
   this, we characterize the preference aggregation rule implied by the
   AMCE and demonstrate its several undesirable properties. With this
   result, we provide a method for placing bounds on the proportion of
   experimental subjects who prefer a given candidate feature. We describe
   conditions under which the AMCE corresponds in sign with the majority
   preference. Finally, we offer a structural interpretation of the AMCE
   and highlight that the problem we describe persists even when a model of
   voting is imposed.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {76},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Generally, public (and private) policymakers adopt policies-laws, rules,
   and procedures-that encumber groups with negative social constructions
   and low political capital. Sometimes, however, they adopt policies
   beneficial, not burdensome, to them. We examine beneficial policy
   adoption for one disadvantaged group-U.S. citizens with criminal
   records. Our focus is the adoption of ``Ban the Box{''} (BTB) policies
   that embargo criminal records questions on job applications and defer
   them during hiring by employers. We leverage extant data on annual BTB
   policy adoptions, novel annual city-level data on community organizing
   groups and descriptive representation (i.e., race and gender), and event
   history analysis for a sample of 256 U.S. cities to provide a
   comprehensive understanding of the city contexts associated with the
   spread of BTB policy adoptions by cities across the U.S. between 2004
   and 2019. Although descriptive, the findings deepen and broaden the
   scholarship about the roles of civil society organizations and
   descriptive representation for beneficial policymaking for disadvantaged
   groups and the connection of interests and representation for abolishing
   some punitive policy designs by public (and private) actors.},

Abstract = {In parliamentary democracies, the logic of delegation from voters to
   government requires that political parties control government actions.
   Recruiting government personnel through the party organisation is the
   primary mechanism for parties to retain such a dominance over the
   government. Existing research has examined secular trends and
   cross-sectional variance in ministers' party ties, mostly focussing on
   appointments of party members to government office. By contrast, this
   article centres on the appointment of members of the party elite as a
   yardstick for party control over government. It explores short-term
   variance in the `partyness' of appointments, arguing that
   performance-related shifts in the intra-party power balance condition
   party elites' access to ministerial office. Utilising data on
   ministerial appointments in Austria (1945-2017; n = 603), the article
   demonstrates that successful party leaders can relax party control by
   minimising appointments of party elite members, while relatively
   unsuccessful leaders have to compensate party elites with government
   jobs.},

Abstract = {Beijing's quest for a more prominent role in a changing international
   order requires greater ability to shape global rules and norms in
   emerging strategic domains like cyberspace. Cross-border data flows, an
   important driving force behind the digital economy, give rise to growing
   concerns about potential threats to national security and individual
   privacy. In contrast with the Western approach that focuses on maximum
   data freedom, China's proposal for cross-border data governance
   prioritizes security, order, and development. Contrary to outside
   expectations that Beijing's restrictive data policies allow little room
   for international alignment on data security governance, China has shown
   sufficient flexibility and open-mindedness in major international
   initiatives for norm setting and institution building. Moreover, Beijing
   insists that as a global common, cyberspace should not become a new
   battlefield of great power competition, but instead help advance the
   shared interests of developing nations.},

Abstract = {Do voters use information about and preferences over who will form
   government in their vote choices? Voters might have preferences over
   both which party wins the most seats and what type of government that
   party can form, which they can use to inform their vote choice. To
   answer this question, we examine the influence of preferences over
   government types and compare them to trends in party support in the 2019
   Canadian federal election. Using rolling, daily cross-sectional survey
   evidence from the Canadian Election Study, we find that preferences over
   government type are strongly related to vote choice and that this
   relationship depends on the perceived viability of the preferred party.
   We also find that this relationship differs outside and within Quebec:
   outside Quebec, only the Liberal Party suffers among voters preferring
   minority governments, while within Quebec, the Liberal Party, New
   Democratic Party and Conservative Party all struggle to hold on to
   voters who prefer minority governments.},

Abstract = {Individuals sometimes do not ``vote their beliefs{''} but rather to
   affirm their partisan affiliation. We design an experiment to determine
   the conditions under which voters engage in partisan expressive voting.
   Democrats and Republicans are asked to vote on the answers to factual
   questions about politics and are rewarded if the majority of their group
   answers correctly. To evaluate both compositional and audience effects,
   we vary the number of affected co-partisans and public dissemination of
   vote totals. We find that voters are more expressive as the numbers of
   co-partisans in either the population or the voting pool increase,
   despite the potential costs of such behavior for co-partisans. Our
   results thus indicate that large majorities will sometimes produce
   outcomes that all could regret.},

Abstract = {Police, like other bureaucratic agencies, are responsible for collecting
   and disseminating policy-relevant data. Nonetheless, critical data,
   including killings by police, often go unreported. We argue that this is
   due in part to the limited oversight capacity of legislative bodies to
   whom police are accountable. Although many local assemblies lack the
   means for effective oversight, well-resourced state legislatures may
   induce transparency from state and substate agencies. This argument is
   evaluated in two studies of police transparency in the United States.
   First, we examine the compliance of 19,095 state, county, and municipal
   police agencies with official data requests over five decades, finding
   strong positive effects of state legislative capacity on transparency.
   Second, we examine the accuracy of transmitted data on killings by
   police, finding that lethality is systematically underreported in states
   with lower-capacity legislatures. Collectively, our study has
   implications for research on policing, legislatures, agency control, and
   analyses of government data.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the political and historical roots of collective
   action problems around community policing in Hout Bay, South Africa.
   Utilizing a social capital approach, it argues that party politics has
   exacerbated a racialized politics of public goods provision in the
   community, with implications for the local governance of security. Using
   original data from semi-structured interviews and secondary sources, the
   paper analyzes the community's environment of social capital, the
   influence of local and provincial party agendas on inter-group relations
   there, and its ultimate impact on community policing in Hout Bay.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the curation of the history of Soviet repressions
   at the temporary exhibitions organized by the International Memorial NGO
   in Moscow from 2011 to 2021. Compared with other Russian museums,
   Memorial relies mainly on family archives and family memories. The
   repressions are treated as a collective experience that affected not
   only victims, those executed or imprisoned, but also their relatives and
   descendants. Seen from this perspective, the carceral past is directly
   linked to today's population. The article explores the various ways in
   which Memorial draws on families' memories of repression to create a
   museum statement.},

Abstract = {Many partisans identify with social groups more typically associated
   with the opposing party. When both social and partisan identities are
   made salient in a political environment, this can complicate how people
   discuss politics and form opinions, as they confront multiple, often
   competing frames for interpreting political issues and events. This
   study examines how individuals negotiate cross-cutting frames from
   partisan and LGBT groups when communicating about political events that
   make both identities salient. Using a quantitative text analysis of
   tweets following major political events, the study compares
   communications from accounts associated with LGBT Republican groups to
   those from accounts related to other LGBT, Democratic, and Republican
   groups. The results show that after events that make LGBT and partisan
   identity salient, users associated with LGBT Republican groups depart
   from other Republican-associated users in their communications and are
   uniquely likely to adopt frames in their communication that are
   associated with both LGBT and Republican interests. The findings have
   implications for theories of framing effects, cross pressure, and the
   boundaries of partisanship's influence on behavior.},

Abstract = {Since winning the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, the Qatari government
   has channelled billions of dollars into infrastructural development to
   prepare for the tournament, which has ramped up the country's already
   high reliance on migrant labour. The international spotlight on migrant
   labour abuse has also become more intense as the date of the event
   approaches. Yet, human rights discourses surrounding World Cup 2022
   continue to paint a simplistic and incomplete picture of migrant labour
   in the Gulf, where racism and its correctives are defined through the
   white gaze, with undercurrents of Orientalism and Islamophobia. In
   contrast, we offer a historical and transnational framework for
   understanding contemporary racialised labour and immigration systems in
   the Gulf. Effectively improving everyday life for migrant workers in the
   Gulf requires engaging both local stakeholders and the multiple actors
   and institutions-both inside and outside Qatar-involved in reproducing
   these systems.},

Abstract = {Indonesia has a long history of racism towards its Chinese population
   dating back to colonial times. Its population has suffered through
   discriminatory policies and a series of racist riots, some sponsored by
   the state. This article examines the transformation of racism towards
   the Indonesian Chinese by summarising the past, before investigating
   recent developments. While the Chinese have enjoyed unprecedented
   political freedom since the fall of the racist New Order regime, they
   have been witnessing worrying developments, including: continuing racist
   attitudes of some officials and political elites; a proliferation of
   Shariah-inspired bylaws in the regions; and lastly, unresolved
   grassroots racism. Grassroots racism has become more difficult to tackle
   as it has intertwined with religious issues, making being anti-Chinese
   justifiable. This article suggests that a counter-narrative from Islamic
   moderate civil organisations would be needed to redress the religious
   sentiment in native Chinese relations.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries introduced measures
   to restrict mobility, both cross-border and internal. Nevertheless,
   people employed in certain sectors and designated as `essential workers'
   were allowed to bypass these mobility restrictions. In this article, I
   take essential workers' seemingly paradoxical assemblage of rights and
   value as a fruitful entry point to scrutinize both the tensions present
   in citizenship arrangements governing mobility and people and the
   contradictions of today's labor and migration politics. Expanding on
   these contradictions, I argue that what appear to be ambiguities of
   citizenship - ambiguities which became more visible during the COVID
   pandemic - can actually be seen as contradictions inherent to
   citizenship itself. These ambiguities and contradictions reveal the
   coloniality in today's nation states and their citizenship regimes. In
   short, we can relate them to colonial forms of power producing
   governable subjects and regulating mobility closely connected to
   processes of accumulation.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to test political engagement messages
   (voter registration and voter mobilization) effectiveness with younger
   adults using psychological reactance theory as a guiding framework. Two
   online survey experiments using a 2 (message frame: gain- vs.
   loss-frame) X 2 (social norm: positive vs. negative) factorial design
   found that in the context of voter registration, consistent with prior
   research, both a loss-framed message and a positive norm message
   elicited greater freedom threat and reactance. However, these findings
   were not replicated in the context of voter mobilization. Across both
   topics, the arousal of reactance was associated with diminished
   behavioral intention (either for registering to vote or for voting).
   While the social norms approach has been found effective in mobilization
   campaigns, findings from this study demonstrate that an implicit threat
   to one's freedom (in the form of a positive social norms message) can
   elicit reactance among non-registered voters. This research suggests
   that political marketers should be aware of the potential for reactance
   to messages promoting voter registration among non-registered voters and
   be aware of potential backlash effects of loss-framed and positive
   norm-based messages in voter registration communication.},

Abstract = {The anti-gender movements began in the West but have thus far been most
   influential and governmentally supported in Hungary, Poland and Russia.
   Anti-genderism has served multiple functions to entrench what proponents
   label as traditional values, while promoting specific class and
   racialised interests in the cloak of rejecting both the communist past
   and Western European political and social expectations. Why did
   anti-genderism develop and become pronounced in otherwise different
   post-communist countries? This article traces the origins of these
   movements based on news coverage and scholarly sources, arguing that
   anti-gender movements signal authoritarian trends and thus matter deeply
   for open, democratic societies. The Hungarian, Polish and Russian cases
   offer similar but distinct variations in the political trajectory of
   their respective movements, highlighting the feedback between
   conservative, expressively patriarchal, and populist forces and their
   embracing of anti-genderism.},

Abstract = {In spite of significant gains in recent elections, women's
   under-representation in U.S. politics remains an empirical fact.
   Scholars have identified the persistent gender gap in political ambition
   as a key component. Research to date has focused on explaining the
   gender gap in political ambition by identifying gender differences in
   factors such as self-assessed qualifications, recruitment experiences,
   risk aversion, and competitiveness. The conventional wisdom emerged that
   because of these gender differences, potential women candidates need
   more encouragement than men to overcome reservations about running for
   office. These propositions remain largely untested. Using an innovative
   experimental design that allows us to directly examine how individuals
   respond to information about candidate qualifications in real time, we
   make several substantive contributions to understanding the role of
   gender in the decision to run for office. First, we find that women are
   highly responsive to information about their qualifications to run for
   office, in some cases more so than their male counterparts. In doing so,
   we shine a spotlight on how men often ignore information about their own
   unsuitability to run for office. We also find that being presented with
   multiple chances to run for election has a positive, but limited effect
   on women's political ambition.},

Abstract = {Researchers remain divided over the cause of Bernie Sanders' strong
   appeal in recent Democratic primaries, alternately positing identity or
   ideology as decisive drivers of Sanders support. Using data from 2020
   Nationscape, we conduct linear probability models that show how
   identity, ideology, and their interaction all explain Sanders support.
   Demographically, we find that Sanders voters are disproportionately
   young, Hispanic, and Independent. Sanders voters also differ
   significantly from other Democratic primary voters across several
   ideology variables, and are especially supportive of policies that were
   central to Sanders' campaign, such as providing government-run health
   insurance to all Americans. Finally, we demonstrate that age cohort, the
   most important predictor of Sanders support, has an effect that is
   highly dependent upon key ideology variables. Overall, those who did not
   vote for Sanders in the 2020 Democratic primary are quite
   demographically and ideologically distinct from those voters that ``felt
   the Bern.{''}},

Abstract = {The work establishes the objective of analyzing the influence that
   foreign policy has on the international participation of subnational
   actors. In the first place, the conceptual articulation of national
   foreign policy and subnational participation is briefly developed with
   the aim of making explicit the link between both. Likewise, it is
   proposed to analyze the influence of subnational actors in the process
   of formulation and execution of the foreign policy of the national
   state. Secondly, the realization of articulation in the Argentine case
   is investigated, pointing out some of the internal and external
   processes that influenced subnational international actions, emphasizing
   foreign policy at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the
   21st. Finally, the reflections on the subject anchored in the Argentine
   case are established.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to present a comprehensive review of how the
   Colombian jurisprudence has adopted and used the conventionality
   control, both in the Constitutional Court and in the Council of State.
   In the first place, it explains the evolution of the notion of
   conventionality control developed by the Inter-American Court of Human
   Rights and the obligations that have come from its development.
   Secondly, it discusses the most important decisions on the matter made
   by the Constitutional Court, which has been reluctant to apply the
   control of conventionality. This situation will be contrasted with the
   jurisprudential developments of the Council of State, where the notion
   has had a direct application as a decision-making mechanism. Finally,
   this study presents a reflection on the importance of domestic courts
   adopting this notion when making decisions to ensure compliance with the
   Inter-American Convention on Human Rights.},

Abstract = {The German Federal Government proposed, in 2020, the Bill for the
   Strengthening of Integrity in the Economy, that provides for sanctions
   to organizations. The proposal has a blurred model of liability, whose
   argumentative references and legal nature have been questioned. This
   article analyzes the Bill and concludes that the Bill intends to
   institute criminal liability for organizations, adopting an inconsistent
   model of liability based on the argumentative references of the
   organizational fault and the act of connection.},

   developments and determinants of parties' issue prevalence: Evidence for
   the right-wing populist `Alternative for Germany'},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},

Abstract = {We make use of party press releases and Wikipedia page view data to
   study issue dynamics and its determinants of a relatively young
   right-wing populist party. By applying structural topic models, we
   analyse 2262 press releases of the `Alternative for Germany' (AfD) from
   2013 until 2019. The findings reveal, first, that European integration,
   EU economic policy, and migration are prevalent topics, but that a
   change occurs over time so that the focus on economic policy decreases
   as the focus on migration policy increases. In addition, we show - by
   using novel data that provides information on the number of daily hits
   of entries in the German Wikipedia - that the AfD took the attention
   into account that people attached to European integration and migration
   issues when preparing their press releases. The results support the
   findings of existing studies and imply that the content of press
   releases can be used for measuring changes in the policy profile of
   parties during a legislative period when normally no manifestos are
   published, and that the interest in Wikipedia articles can serve as a
   proxy for the dynamics of issue salience among the population.
   Furthermore, the findings indicate that a combination of these two data
   sources is a fruitful approach for studying the determinants of
   short-term issue dynamics.},

   Populism at the service of opposing nationalist agendas},
Journal = {REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CIENCIA POLITICA-RECP},
Year = {2022},
Number = {59},
Pages = {13-42},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article aims to analyze the different ways of articulating
   nationalist demands in populist terms in the context of the 2021 Catalan
   elections. To this end, a content analysis has been carried out on the
   messages posted on Twitter by both the main Catalan nationalist parties
   and Vox, during the electoral campaign of the Catalan elections. Results
   show that Vox???s nation-alism is not limited to the center-periphery
   conflict within the Spanish state: Vox claims to defend the unity of the
   Spanish nation against peripheral nationalism as its main concern; but
   it also defends the identity and security of the Spanish people against
   ??the migratory invasion?? and ??the Islamization?? of the country; as
   well as Spaniards??? autonomy and sovereignty against certain
   globalizing tendencies. On the other hand, Catalan nationalist parties
   exclusively contextualize nationalism around the center-periphery
   conflict. Nationalist demands of both types of actors are articulated in
   populist terms when the interests of the nation-people are pitted
   against certain elites and institutions considered to be privileged,
   corrupt and antidem-ocratic. In this sense, the analysis shows that
   populism is subordinated to nationalism as the ideological core of these
   formations. We argue that attacking the ??national other?? by denouncing
   the corrupt practices and abuses of power carried out by its elites and
   institutions, as well as the violent behavior and extremist attitudes of
   some of its members (??fascists??, ??sepa-ratist street terrorists??,
   etc.), can facilitate the democratic legitimization of nationalist
   discourses compared to other discursive strategies that explicitly
   discriminate and exclude groups with a different national identity.},

   within the Central City was analyzed. The supply of housing increased,

Abstract = {Pedagogy and its definition needs to be rethought from its cause, that
   is, the ``why{''}, and felt from a poetic perspective, after which its
   enunciation is never neutral or exempt from ideology. This text tries to
   reflect by recovering some of the classic descriptions and those more
   recent, from a wide investi-gation around it. The objective has been to
   recognize and question the contextualized and opposing definitions,
   considering a theoretical inquiry, the product of a recognition linked
   to the expertise given by the pedagogical task as educational actors,
   which leads us to dialogue with various authors. In addition, it
   proposes a route to broaden the path through hegemonic and subalternized
   thinkers and currents, from a vital review that recovers the challenges
   of multiple gender perspectives and the sensitive gaze on a critical
   (and revolutionary) pedagogy of permanent construction. Hence, we refer
   to the Poiesis of pedagogy as the path for a productive, manufacturing,
   loving, comprehensive, social, cultural and political activity; What to
   say about Gabriela Mistral (2017), we will have to assume the deliberate
   praxis that is incumbent on the pedagogue and positions him from a free,
   ethical, aesthetic and spiritual perspective.},

Abstract = {Accepting defeat in political decision-making is crucial for the health
   of democracies. At the same time, being a good loser is challenging. How
   can citizens be motivated to be gracious about various types of
   political loss? In this paper, we study whether political leaders can
   play an important role in boosting the perceived quality of
   decision-making processes among losers in policy conflicts. We propose
   and test the impact of a simple intervention post-decision: good loser
   messages delivered by co-partisan leaders that remind citizens about the
   rules of the game. Three survey experiments on probability samples of
   the Norwegian and Swedish population (total n = 4700) show that good
   loser messages can indeed boost the process evaluations of policy
   losers. These findings emphasize the potential of procedural messaging
   to build loser's consent between elections.},

Abstract = {This article understands COVID-19 as an eruptive event with severe
   effects on many policy fields beyond (public) health. Based on this
   assumption, we consider the pandemic as a catalyst for policy change
   across policy fields. For that reason, we suggest a new approach for
   conceptualising eruptive events as triggers that provoke far-reaching
   change and spillover effects in fields of policymaking. These are
   characterised by a complex problem structure - conceived of as clusters
   of trigger points - in need of intersectoral policymaking. Our approach
   suggests a mechanism of multi-dimensional spillover that initiates new
   dynamics to gridlocked policy processes by acting with regard to the
   most pressing trigger points. To test the concept, we take an
   explorative look at public health, educational policy and food and
   agricultural policy in Germany. The examples demonstrate how the concept
   of problem-related trigger points and spillover effects can be applied
   to analyse policy change across policy areas in pandemic times and
   beyond.},

Abstract = {Drag has long been part of the LGBTQ rights movement. Drag performers
   play an important role as community leaders and political activists.
   Today, drag performers are also popular celebrities in the rest of
   society. This article explores the role of drag performers as community
   leaders and celebrities in the context of the 2020 presidential
   election. To understand this, we interviewed drag performers about their
   experiences using drag to mobilize voters. Research shows that Get Out
   The Vote (GOTV) efforts are more successful if they are led by
   volunteers and include trusted messengers while still being unexpected
   in some way. Drag performers are community leaders and volunteers and,
   when speaking about politics, deliver unexpected-and thus
   memorable-messages. The drag performers that we interviewed demonstrate
   the potential for drag artists to be effective GOTV messengers, in both
   the LGBTQ community and society more broadly.},

Abstract = {The West produces a lot of strategic thinking, most of it ad hoc
   responses to present stimuli not only rarely analytically or
   strategically useful but often damaging existing and useful strategic
   theory as a consequence. Lukas Milevski applies resilience to strategic
   theory and contrasts it with its opposite, social utility. Resilience is
   explained and applied to the particulars of strategic thought. The
   social utility of ad hoc theory is recognised, notably in attracting
   attention, which even militaries need to do. The tension between
   conceptual resilience and social utility should be reflected in
   strategic education so that the advantages of both are maintained.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether younger generations are more likely to
   associate their support for European unification with cultural, rather
   than economic issues. The EU has changed from an `economic community' to
   a `political union.' Because most citizens form relatively stable
   orientations during their `impressionable years,' we expect recent
   generations to be more likely to view European unification through a
   cultural lens. An analysis of 12 waves of panel data from the
   Netherlands finds the strongest correlation between EU support and
   cultural attitudes among the newest generations. However, these
   generations are not less likely to associate EU support with economic
   attitudes. Moreover, between 2007 and 2019, Euroscepticism became
   increasingly associated with cultural attitudes among all generations
   and age groups. These findings indicate that EU support has become more
   strongly aligned along a cultural dimension and that this realignment
   will become more pronounced as newer generations replace earlier ones.},

Title = {Parties' attack behaviour in parliaments: Who attacks whom and when},

Abstract = {Various research have been directed towards investigating the behaviour
   of political parties engaging in attacks. However, this topic has
   predominantly been studied in campaigning venues while focusing only on
   the attacker (parties that are attacking). This study contributes to the
   existing literature by (i) studying attack behaviour in the
   parliamentary venue, and (ii) analysing the interactions between both
   the attacker and the target. To this end, this paper uses longitudinal
   data on attacks during question time sessions in the parliaments (2010
   to 2020) of Belgium, Croatia and the United Kingdom. More specifically,
   I investigate the conditions that make parties engage in mutual attacks.
   These conditions can be characterised along three dimensions: time
   (proximity to elections), status (government vs. opposition), and
   ideology (close vs. distant). The results confirm the overarching
   argument that: (i) more attacks in parliaments happen closer to election
   day; (ii) opposing parties are more likely to attack the government
   rather than vice-versa; (iii) governing parties equally attack the
   opposition and themselves; and finally, (iv) the larger the ideological
   distance between parties, the more likely attacks happen (with
   mainstream parties engaging equally in attack behaviour compared to
   radical parties). As such, these findings contribute to our
   understanding of attack strategies between parties in regular day-to-day
   politics.},

Title = {Macroeconomy and macropartisanship: Economic conditions and party
   identification},
Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {700-719},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {``It's the economy stupid{''}-is the phrase that captures the ubiquity
   of economics in determining election outcomes. Nevertheless, while
   several studies support the premise of economic voting, a constant
   critique of valence economic models is that partisan bias contaminates
   voters' economic perceptions, thus invaliding any independent effect of
   economic opinions on the vote. Here, we test whether partisanship may
   itself be endogenous to the macroeconomy. Aggregating data from the
   Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES), supplemented with
   European Social Survey (ESS) data to bolster the time analysis, we focus
   on macropartisanship and find a drop-off of party identifiers for
   governing parties in tandem with the economic downturn, specifically
   from rising unemployment. More generally, macropartisanship responds to
   economic conditions, suggesting that the endogeneity concern between
   party attachment and valence economic conditions is not unidirectional.
   That is, while economic perceptions may be influenced by party
   identification, party identification can be influenced by economic
   conditions.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe and interpret the main objectives
   of the educational policy of the central elites of the Liberals in the
   region of Greek Macedonia during the period 1915-1924 concerning the
   process of assimilation and especially the cultural assimilation, the
   structural integration and the psychological identification of the
   so-called xenophone or allophone population. We investigate the Glinos
   Foundation Archive using CDA techniques in combination with the
   historical interpretative method. An assimilation process with mild
   practices took place, while the achievement of national homogenization
   through literacy via the demotic Greek language teaching was considered
   as the main goal.},

Abstract = {The US Congress is unrepresentative of the people it serves, and
   reforming campaign finance law may be a path toward a more
   representative institution. We examine public opinion toward allowing
   candidates to use campaign funds for child care, theorizing gender
   conditions support due to the unequal burden child care places on women.
   Using an experiment, we find people are more supportive of candidates
   using campaign funds for child care when the hypothetical candidates are
   women. Women respondents are especially likely to vary their support for
   the policy based on candidate gender. This project is the first to
   explore public support for allowing candidates to use campaign funds for
   personal expenses, contributing to our understanding of support for
   reform that could transform the types of candidates willing to run.},

Abstract = {One of the critical questions for the future of the Metaverse is whether
   it will be global and singular -or multiple, company or country based.
   This question is yet to be answered, but unique metaverse universes,
   which will be built based on regional integrations rather than McWorld
   monopolization, will gain value in the future for the healthy operation
   of the Metaverse. The Organization of Turkic States (OTS), which was
   developed into an international organizational structure through the
   initiative of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last year, offers a
   form whose effectiveness is increasing daily in the global system, in
   keeping with the 2040 Vision of the Turkic World. Under Turkiye's
   leadership, the Turkoverse, a unique Metaverse universe in which the
   members of the OTS will interact, can be built. By integrating the
   capital cities of the member states into this structure, their
   geographical distance will be eliminated, and the free movement of labor
   and money within the Turkic World will be possible. Ultimately, this
   step will protect Turkiye and other Turkic states from uncertainties
   about the future of the larger Metaverse. This paper investigates the
   extent to which the Metaverse is the next big thing in diplomacy and how
   Turkiye can impact the formation of a new norm that will eventually
   affect the global system.},

Abstract = {Russia's invasion of Ukraine seems to have led, with very few
   exceptions, to greater cooperation among members of the Western alliance
   and brought the transatlantic partners closer to one another. As a
   result, NATO, which has undergone several changes since the end of the
   Cold War, has regained its key role as the cornerstone of the West's
   collective security interests. In its enhanced position, NATO also
   appears to be emerging as the champion of the liberal order as well as
   the universal values embraced by transatlantic partners. Yet, it may
   also be facing new challenges both from within, particularly in the case
   of a prolonged conflict in Europe, and from China, which is
   demonstrating increasing rivalry to the West.},

Abstract = {In this article, we investigate elected representatives' attitudes to
   citizen participation and the design of participatory arrangements. We
   distinguish between citizenship-oriented and governance-oriented
   attitudes. Whereas citizenship-oriented attitudes imply designing
   participatory arrangements to safeguard the democratic values of
   equality, transparency and inclusion, governance-oriented attitudes
   imply designing participatory arrangements to support elected
   representatives in their roles. Based on unique data from a web-based
   survey sent to all local councillors in Norway, we found that although
   Norwegian local councillors tend towards citizenship-oriented rather
   than governance-oriented attitudes to citizen participation, there is
   great variation between councillors in this respect. Analysing strategic
   and ideological explanations, we found that right-wing politicians tend
   to hold more governance-oriented attitudes than left-wing politicians
   do. Strategic considerations seem to have no effect on councillors in
   power in this regard.},

Title = {Citizens' preferences for liberal democracy and its deformations:
   evidence from Germany},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {This paper sheds light on the prevalence and the correlates of citizen
   support for liberal democracy and four of its deformations: a populist,
   a technocratic, a post-democratic, and a majoritarian-relativist
   conception of democracy. Using original survey data from a
   representative German online panel, the findings provide systematic
   evidence on the multifaceted nature of citizens' democratic preferences.
   Only few citizens are, for instance, populist without also being liberal
   democrats, and many endorse two or more deformations of liberal
   democracy simultaneously. Yet, these forms of overlap are not arbitrary
   but conform to conceptually posited relative affinities between these
   deformations. The examined conceptions of democracy furthermore differ
   in their associations with political support, ideology, education, and
   political interest. In addition to offering novel empirical insights,
   the findings also highlight why some measures may underestimate the
   complexity of democratic preferences.},

Abstract = {In the field of international relations, we tend to apply the premises
   of political realism to our understanding of transnational criminal
   organizations (TCOs) in the USA and Latin America. In this perspective,
   TCOs are regarded as autonomous state-like actors or insurgent groups
   seeking political and ideological domination over the nation-state. This
   view is reinforced by notions of the ``weak{''} or ``failed state{''} in
   which TCOs are seen to be mounting a successful challenge to
   nation-states for control over governance. I contend that this view
   reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of TCOs, which are disinclined
   toward political and ideological domination and inherently dependent
   upon the state for their functioning and survival. The state in turn
   receives certain benefits through what becomes a kind of partnership
   with TCOs, one which actually strengthens both at the expense of civil
   society. Whereas political realism features the use of the military as a
   chief strategy for dealing with TCOs, an alternative view, which
   acknowledges interdependence between the state and TCOs, highlights the
   importance of strengthening civil society and the democratic norm as a
   more effective strategy for weakening the power and influence of TCOs.},

Abstract = {Three countries-Turkey, Thailand, and Brazil-exemplify the rise of
   neoliberal populism as a response to the crisis created in peripheral
   social formations by their integration into global capitalism. This
   essay thus begins by examining the social dimensions of neoliberal
   populism: namely, the formation of its social base, its policies of
   economic inclusion, and its organic relations with revisionist
   capitalist groups. Since these countries have undergone political crises
   resulting in regime changes with different authoritarian patterns, the
   essay then deals with three domains of struggle in which the specific
   dynamics of each country and the strategies and capacities of neoliberal
   populist parties can be decisive: political struggles with and among
   intrastate actors, the strategies followed by segments of capital and
   neoliberal populist parties, and the capacity of such parties to hold
   broad class coalitions together.},

Abstract = {The received wisdom on executive-legislative relations in multiparty
   presidential systems is that the size of the president's majority in
   Congress is the key factor explaining governance patterns, particularly
   the president's legislative success. However, in many cases presidents
   enjoying a nominal majority have been unable to pass legislation and
   have faced institutional instability. The article departs from a
   conventional definition of divided government and focuses on the
   preference incongruence between the governing coalition and the floor of
   Congress. It argues that the ideological distance between the floor and
   the coalition is a key factor explaining the president's cost of
   governing (which includes factors such as the distribution of cabinet
   portfolios and budgetary transfers to coalition partners). The article
   provides an empirical test with data from Brazil that find that the
   greater the ideological incongruence, the higher the cost of governing
   for the president.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the political activism of youth of migrant
   descent mobilizing to achieve access to citizenship rights in Italy.
   Specifically, it focuses on the mobilizing practices and discursive
   strategies they employed throughout the 2017 campaign to reform the
   Italian citizenship law. By means of participant observation and
   in-depth interviews with representatives of the main groups involved in
   the campaign, the study shows that the so-called `new Italians' claimed
   recognition and inclusion into the nation by relying on the idiom of
   legal rights and by using a language that rested upon the notion of
   deservingness and exceptionality. It also suggests that the youth
   constituted themselves as political actors by means of political
   engagement, as they performed acts of citizenship through which they
   enacted their right to that status even in absence of formal legal
   recognition. By putting studies on youth activism in conversation with
   critical citizenship literature, critical race theory and social
   movement scholarship, this study discloses how the `new Italians'
   advocated for their rights, creating and appropriating their space
   within the discourse on nation.},

Abstract = {How do people explain persistent inequality between whites and blacks?
   Research has focused on two dimensions of explanation, or attribution:
   internal (regarding shortcomings in black motivation and capability);
   and external (regarding the socioeconomic context). We argue that a
   third type of attribution - cultural - augments internal attributions,
   making them more compelling. A survey-based experiment with a white
   sample showed that internal attributions elicited greater agreement when
   framed in cultural terms - that is, when black character and behavior
   were linked to a distinct black culture. High knowledge participants
   responded more strongly to framing than low knowledge participants.
   Culturally framed internal attributions predicted issue attitudes more
   powerfully than traditional internal attributions. The results indicate
   that we should change how we conceptualize and measure public beliefs
   about racial inequality.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to understand one of the most important problems in
   the contemporary discourse of modern development, that of management,
   control, collection and trade of medicinal plants in India. The
   tremendous growth in the market for herbal medicines since the 1990s has
   prompted large-scale industrial production of these medicines by big
   pharmaceutical corporations. This relies on medicinal plants mostly
   derived from the wild, and while their market has grown enormously, it
   has also led to their over-harvesting, without any concomitant efforts
   at regeneration. This article offers to analyse the political aspect of
   the existing market supply chain of medicinal plants in India. This
   study specifically focuses on problematizing the complex power
   structures in the market supply chain of medicinal plants, with
   reference to the knowledge of production that guides the corporations.
   In order to manufacture herbal products on the basis of large-scale
   centralized production systems, the corporations privilege their
   `knowledge' of harvesting, production and distribution over that of the
   collectors. The collectors are usually part of communities that have
   built up their knowledge of accessibility and medicinal properties of
   these medicinal plants over centuries of care, experience and
   innovation. It is when these two knowledge systems clash, in the larger
   context of political economy of development and the public policies of
   the state, that the degradation of nature becomes inevitable.},

Abstract = {This article explores how civil society organizations survive multiple
   regime changes. This is a case study of Junak, a Czech scouting
   organization, that experienced the shift from democratic capitalism to
   authoritarian communism and back again. I build on archival and
   interview data to test how new institutional concepts of the regulative,
   normative, and cultural-cognitive institutional pressures fare when
   applied to organizational survival across regime change. I found that
   Junak responded to institutional pressures through a multiplicity of
   responses, including isomorphic, ceremonial, and innovative changes as
   well continuity of selected attributes. During communism, ceremonial
   change prevailed, helping the CSO to preserve some of its organizational
   aspects. After 1989, Junak opted for a combination of change and
   continuity. This case study raises new questions about voluntarism in
   Central and Eastern Europe during authoritarianism and its impact on
   civil society and its organizations after 1989.},

Abstract = {Despite nearly three diplomatic decades of tracks and negotiations, the
   Georgian-Abkhaz and Moldovan-Transnistrian conflicts have remained
   unresolved. While the article identifies that a part of the
   intransigence of the conflict parties' positions exists in the effect of
   different layers of competing narratives that have created static
   positions, I argue that still more attention needs to be paid to the
   layers of the competing narratives by addressing two underlying themes:
   imagined victimhoods and alienated identities. The article thematises
   subtle and hidden aspects that have accompanied the negotiations but
   have not been addressed clearly, yet hold the potential for change.},

Abstract = {This article presents evidence for a secular increase in political
   engagement in political theory from 1974 to 2019 and analyzes the
   implications of this growth. Analysis of 385 theory articles published
   across three periods (i.e., 1974-1976, 2005-2007, and 2017-2019) found a
   near doubling in topicality among theory articles published in Polity,
   American Political Science Review, and Political Theory since the 1970s.
   This change has been substantial, statistically significant, and
   previously unnoted in the literature. I suggest that the shift toward
   topicality entails and is entailed by the production of ``real
   events{''} amenable to and consistent with the theoretical approaches in
   which successive generations of theorists have been trained. Finally, I
   explain this shift toward topicality with respect to theory's
   responsiveness to real events and to rising levels of
   professionalization within the field.},

Abstract = {How do non-state armed groups (NSAGs) survive and even thrive in
   situations where state armed groups (SAGs) collapse, despite the
   former's often greater material adversity? We argue that, optimizing
   under their different constraints, SAGs invest more in technical
   military training and NSAGs invest more in enhancing soldiers' intrinsic
   payoffs from serving their group. Therefore, willingness to contribute
   to the group should be more positively correlated with years of service
   in NSAGs than in SAGs. We confirm this hypothesis with lab-in-the-field
   and qualitative evidence from SAG and NSAG soldiers in Nepal, Ivory
   Coast, and Kurdistan. Each field study addresses specific inferential
   weaknesses in the others. Assembled together, these cases reduce
   concerns about external validity or replicability. Our findings reveal
   how the basis of NSAG cohesion differs from that of SAGs, with
   implications for strategies to counter NSAG mobilization.},

Title = {Protest and Electoral Breakthrough: Challenger Party-Movement
   Interactions in Germany},

Abstract = {This paper studies party-movement interactions in Germany, focusing on
   Die Linke and the AfD, the two most recent additions to Germany's
   multi-party system. The electoral rise of both challenger parties went
   along with mass protests, opposition to Hartz IV in the mid-2000s and
   anti-Islamic PEGIDA mobilisation in the mid-2010s. We shift the emphasis
   from how social movements turn into political parties, including
   significant organisational and personal overlap, to more indirect ways
   of how protest and electoral politics interact. Specifically, we
   identify a process composed of two interrelated mechanisms: an external
   politicisation spiral and an intra-party innovation spiral. We show how
   mass protest triggers both discursive shifts in the public sphere and
   internal strategic realignment, providing an opportunity for parties to
   ride the wave, secure their competitive advantages, and mobilise on the
   protestors' grievances in the electoral arena. In such a way, challenger
   parties can take advantage of street protests even when they do not
   directly emerge from a movement. Methodologically, the article is based
   on a paired comparison, relying on survey data and an original protest
   event analysis that provides novel data on anti-Hartz IV and PEGIDA
   protest mobilisation in Germany.},

Abstract = {In this article, I explore the relationship between the supersession
   thesis and the rights of future people. In particular, I show that
   changes in circumstances might supersede future people's rights. I argue
   that appropriating resources that belong to future people does not
   necessarily result in a duty to return the resources in full. I explore
   how these findings are relevant for climate change justice. Assuming
   future generations of developing countries originally had a right to use
   a certain amount of the carbon budget, changing circumstances could
   result in rights-supersession. Consequently, members of future
   generations of industrialized countries may be allowed to use part of
   the share of the carbon budget belonging to developing countries.},

Abstract = {Four bullfighters stood as MPs in the April 2019 Spanish general
   elections: Miguel Abellan and Salvador Vega for the PP; and Serafin
   Martin and Pablo Cipres for Vox. None was elected, although Abellan and
   Martin came close. The former's allegiance was rewarded with his
   political appointment by the PP's Isabel Diaz Ayuso as Director-General
   of Madrid's Centre for Taurine Activities. Bullfighters throwing their
   hats into the political arena is inextricably linked to the escalation
   of Spain's cultural wars and critically interrogating the ongoing
   controversies surrounding the future of bullfighting constitutes a
   privileged lens through which to view increasingly visible fissures in
   the post-Franco constitutional order. Using archival materials and
   ethnographic research alongside an interview conducted with Abellan,
   this article explores the interrelationship of bullfighting with the
   Catalan secessionist vote as well as its currency in the struggle
   between Vox and the PP for the conservative vote.},

Abstract = {Scholars have extensively studied how the European Court of Justice
   (ECJ) interacts with Member State courts. The ECJ's behaviour vis-a-vis
   international tribunals remains, however, underexplored despite its
   salience for EU global actorness. The ECJ does at times condone and at
   other times reject cooperation with international tribunals in that it
   either authorises or prohibits EU and Member State participation in
   relevant regimes. What drives ECJ behaviour? While intuitive, European
   law fails to fully account for it. This study draws on models of bounded
   discretion to explain ECJ behaviour in external judicial politics. It
   argues that two factors - namely jurisdictional overlap between the
   European legal order and international tribunals as well as the
   centrality of these tribunals in global governance - decisively
   influence the preferences of the ECJ, Member States, the European
   Commission and Parliament and thus delimit the range of politically
   viable rulings and shape ECJ behaviour.},

Abstract = {Social influence among people is widely understood to be a universal
   component of the human experience. However, studies of political
   behavior have generally approached social influence as specific to a
   type of behavior, such as voting, in a particular national context.
   There are good reasons to expect that social influence is observable
   across diverse behaviors and national contexts. In this study, we test
   this expectation using a two-wave panel survey of national samples in 19
   countries. We employ autoregressive models that address some of the
   endogeneity challenges associated with attempts to measure social
   influence with survey designs. Our measure of social influence is
   predictive of diverse political behaviors in many countries with average
   effects comparable in size to important standard predictors of behavior.},

Title = {Ethiopia: Bertussa, the Indigenous Governance and Conflict
   Resolution Mechanism of the Sheko Community},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Number = {39},
Pages = {3-20},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Conflict is an inevitable phenomenon in human relationships. Cognizant
   of the inevitability of conflict in human interaction, the most
   important issue needed to be emphasized is the way how conflict can be
   resolved before it becomes violent and destructive. The objective of
   this study is to explore ``bertussa{''} the indigenous governance and
   conflict resolution mechanism of the Sheko community of Ethiopia.
   According to the objective, the study followed a qualitative research
   approach and used a case study research design. Data were collected
   through key informant interviews and FGD. A deductive thematic analysis
   technique was used to analyze data. The study found that the bertussa
   institution is the well-respected institution of conflict resolution
   playing an irreplaceable role in maintaining peace and social cohesion.
   Bertussa is hierarchical in its structure and it includes the Koynab
   (the King) at the top, Komtu. (Clan leaders), and, at the bottom,
   socially respected individuals called Yab babu (local elders). In the
   tradition of the Sheko community, conflicts that are believed to be less
   violent are settled at the yab babu (local elders) level. Whereas,
   reconciliation of homicide issues and conflicts which are serious and
   complex are mostly addressed by the komtu (clan leaders) with the help
   of a person known as burjab who is believed to have spiritual power. In
   the Sheko community, the reconciliation process ends with the
   performance of symbolic ceremonial practices which imply the healing of
   the discontent among the disputants. Though this institution has strong
   acceptance from the community, it lacks due focus from the local
   government and it is not formally recognized.},

Abstract = {Infrastructure development has experienced a political renaissance in
   Africa and is again at the centre of national, regional, and continental
   development agendas. At the same time, China has been identified by
   African policy-makers as a particularly suitable strategic partner. As
   infrastructure has become a main pillar of Sino-African cooperation,
   there has been growing analytical interest on the role of African actors
   in shaping the terms and conditions and, by extension, the
   implementation of infrastructure projects with Chinese participation.
   This follows a more general African ``agency turn{''} in China-Africa
   studies, which has shifted the research focus on the myriad ways in
   which African state and non-state actors shape the continent's
   engagements with China. This article is situated within this growing
   body of literature and explores different forms of an African state
   agency in the context of Tanzania's planned Bagamoyo port, Ethiopia's
   Adama wind farms, and Kenya's Lamu port. We posit a non-reductionist and
   social-relational ontology of the (African) state which sees the state
   as a multifaceted and multi-scalar institutional ensemble. We show that
   the extent and forms of state agencies exerted are inherently
   interrelated with and, thus, highly contingent upon concrete
   institutional, economic, political, and bureaucratic contexts in which
   African state actors are firmly embedded. In doing so, we make the case
   for a context-sensitive analysis of various spheres of a state agency in
   particular conjunctures of Sino-African engagement.},

Abstract = {What is the impact of major-power intervention on civil-war onset? A
   considerable hurdle to answering this question is gauging expectations
   about future intervention on the eve of conflict. We tackle this
   challenge by developing a unified theoretical and empirical model of
   civil-war onset and subsequent intervention. Our model allows for
   strategic interdependence among interveners, and our empirical strategy
   enables estimation of intervention expectations from equilibrium
   behavior. We fit the model to civil war and intervention data from the
   second half of the twentieth century and find that major-power
   intervention is primarily characterized by strategic
   complementarities-for example, cost sharing among allies or competition
   for control among rivals-rather than free-riding incentives. Through
   counterfactual experiments, we show that commitments to decreased
   intervention would raise the risk of civil war worldwide, whereas
   increased intervention would have little effect. Our results suggest
   that coordination among major powers is maximally deterring civil
   conflict.},

Abstract = {Yucatan state's homicide level has remained low and steady for decades
   and criminal violence activity is low, even while crime rates in much of
   the rest of the country have increased since 2006. In this research
   note, we examine five main theoretical explanations for Yucatan's
   relative containment of violence: criminal competition, protection
   networks and party alternation, vertical partisan fragmentation,
   interagency coordination, and social cohesion among the Indigenous
   population. We find that in Yucatan, interagency coordination is a key
   explanatory variable, along with cooperation around security between
   Partido Revolucionario Institucional and Partido Accion Nacional
   governments and among federal and state authorities.},

Abstract = {With the advent of blockchain technology and smart contracts, the
   finance, business, and legal industries have witnessed a drastic shift
   in their modus operandi. A smart contract does not necessarily mean and
   include a legally binding contract as it is under the legal regime but
   is instead a computer software built on blockchain technology, which is
   competent to self-execute its functions, as well as self-enforce its
   results. Smart contracts with the help of complex algorithms have raised
   the efficiency of conducting business online. Consequently, disputes
   pertaining to smart contracts have also increased. The utilization of
   smart contracts in the legal industry has assisted businesses in
   maintaining the efficiency gained in the initial phase of the process
   and resolving their smart contract and/or other disputes expeditiously.
   The pivotal question that knocks on our door is whether a decision
   rendered by an autonomous computer program is binding on the parties,
   specifically an award rendered in a smart contract arbitration? This
   article explores rudimentary knowledge pertaining to blockchain and
   smart contracts, and analyses the validity of smart contract dispute
   resolution mechanisms and their role in enhancing business dispute
   resolution efficiency. Lastly, it sheds light on the legitimacy of smart
   contract arbitration under the international conventions which regulate
   international commercial arbitration.},

Abstract = {Many now believe a segregated online news market has led to increased
   polarization in the United States. Indeed, experimental studies in
   political science and psychology show that partisans are more interested
   in reading attitude-reinforcing information. Yet, observational studies
   of web browsing behavior have thus far found limited differences between
   Democratic and Republican online news consumption. We present two new
   pieces of evidence showing how partisans selectively approach congenial
   news online. First, using a data set of web-browsing histories from the
   2016 US general election (August-November 2016), we show that Democrats
   (Republicans) split their news consumption between left-leaning
   (right-leaning) sources and moderate/mainstream sources. Most partisan
   convergence occurs at portal sites-such as Yahoo and MSN-that specialize
   in nonnews and nonpolitical content. Second, using high-profile scandals
   from the 2016 election (Access Hollywood and the Comey letter), we show
   that partisans consume more news when an event benefits their preferred
   candidate.},

Abstract = {Academics and practitioners are increasingly interested in deliberative
   minipublics and whether these can address widespread dissatisfaction
   with contemporary politics. While optimism seems to prevail, there is
   also talk that the use of minipublics may backfire. When the government
   disregards a minipublic's recommendations, this could lead to more
   dissatisfaction than not asking for its advice in the first place. Using
   an online survey experiment in Belgium (n = 3,102), we find that,
   compared to a representative decision-making process, a minipublic tends
   to bring about higher political support when its recommendations are
   fully adopted by the government, whereas it generates lower political
   support when its recommendations are not adopted. This study presents
   novel insights into whether and when the use of minipublics may
   alleviate or aggravate political dissatisfaction among the public at
   large.},

Abstract = {Since its launch in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) quickly has
   become the cornerstone of foreign policy for the People's Republic of
   China (PRC) under Xi Jinping's leadership to project China's new-found
   economic influence through networks of infrastructure, trade, and
   investment deals. Considerable scholarship about the BRI has focused on
   China's motivations, domestic politics, strategic culture, policy
   instruments, and the perceptions, effects, and implications across
   various countries and regions. While competing IR paradigms and levels
   of analysis have been applied to analyze the BRI and its impact, little
   research has examined the complex causal mechanisms of the BRI in a
   comprehensively visualized and rigorous way. How, for example, does the
   BRI look in the context of power transition theory? Is this time-honored
   theory, which focuses on the dynamics of capabilities, able to explain
   the characteristics of BRI, notably its impact upon policies and
   outcomes at the regional and international levels? Through the prism of
   systemism, this paper seeks to answer such questions. The systemist
   approach, which emphasizes the graphic portrayal of cause and effect, is
   well suited to the task of comparing and evaluating theoretical
   arguments about developments such as the BRI. A visualization of power
   transition theory is used to obtain insights about the likely direction
   of China's BRI in terms of the USA and China as leading states and
   rivals faced with the challenge of managing conflict short of war in
   East Asia.},

Abstract = {Governments rely on citizen compliance for official rules to be
   effective. Yet achieving compliance is often tricky, particular when
   individual costs are high. Under what conditions will citizens
   voluntarily respect collective rules? We explore public compliance with
   SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) restrictions, focusing on the role of political
   trust. We anticipate that the effects of trust on compliance will be
   conditional on the presence of other factors, notably fear of infection.
   Low levels of fear may provide room for trust to shape compliance; yet
   high levels of fear may `crowd out' the role of trust. We hypothesize
   that, at the pandemic's outset, compliance was likely to be shaped more
   by fear than by trust. Yet as the pandemic progressed, the impact of
   fear on compliance was likely to have weakened, and the impact of trust
   to have strengthened. These hypotheses are tested using longitudinal
   data from Austria, Germany, and the United Kingdom.},

Abstract = {Previous studies of electoral authoritarianism identified that
   manipulations demobilize opposition supporters. Yet, less is known about
   whether radicals are more prone to abstention than moderates in
   manipulated elections. To answer this question, we disentangle two
   mechanisms of demobilization effect-the efficacy mechanism and the
   electoral supply mechanism-that have different expectations on the
   turnout rate of radicals and moderates. Our research leverages the
   disqualification controversy in Hong Kong in 2016, after which radical
   candidates who advocate self-determination or independence were filtered
   out from the electoral market. Using both aggregate-level and
   individual-level data, our analysis shows that a substantive
   demobilization effect exists. Crucially, we find that radicals and
   moderates are demobilized to a similar extent, and the decreases in
   perceived electoral fairness and importance of voting are similar
   between the two factions. These findings suggest that the efficacy
   mechanism is a more plausible explanation of the demobilization effect.
   Overall, this study extends our understanding of voting behavior and
   political attitude of opposition supporters in face of autocratization.},

Abstract = {In this study we conduct a least-likely case study in order to assess
   the analytical power of the ideational approach to populism. We do so by
   testing the direct and conditional effects of populist attitudes on vote
   choices in Argentina. We examine whether populist attitudes are
   associated with the Peronist vote, as more essentialist interpretations
   would lead us to expect, or, on the contrary, linked to vote for right
   parties, an expectation that is more consistent with thin-ideological
   approaches. Our data consists of an original online survey carried out
   in September 2020, a specific juncture at which the Peronist government
   had to deal with widespread popular discontent caused by intense
   economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings reveal that
   populist attitudes are positively associated with voting for right
   parties and that the effects of such attitudes are conditioned by
   ideological preferences. These results underscore the explanatory power
   of ideational approaches to the electoral activation of populist
   attitudes.},

Abstract = {The impact of campaign spending, generally greater for challengers than
   for incumbents, is conditioned by electoral rules and
   incumbency-normally seen as a dichotomous condition. But when an
   electoral reform changes the composition of districts, a legislator is
   an incumbent only in the section of the new district. In Chile, the 60
   open-list proportional representation 2-member districts used until 2013
   were combined to create 28 open-list PR districts for the 2017 election,
   thus making some legislators enjoy a higher degree of incumbency. With
   data from 1430 candidates in the 2013 and 2017 legislative elections, we
   report a nonlinear positive effect of campaign spending on electoral
   success in all district magnitudes. Campaign spending has a higher
   impact as the number of open seats increases and a stronger effect for
   incumbents whose old districts comprise a larger share of the new
   districts. Campaign spending matters differently for challengers and
   incumbents given the moderating effect of district magnitude, the number
   of open seats and the percentage of incumbency.},

Abstract = {Most Americans think that the country is politically divided and
   polarization will only get worse, not better. Such perceptions of
   polarization are widespread, but we do not know enough about their
   effects, especially those unrelated to political variables. This study
   examines the consequences of perceived polarization for levels of social
   trust in the United States. Trust in fellow citizens is the backbone of
   a well-functioning democracy, given its role in promoting social
   cohesion and facilitating collective action. Using nationally
   representative panel data, as well as an original survey experiment, I
   find that perceived polarization directly undermines Americans' trust in
   each other. A belief that members of society share common values fosters
   social trust, but perceptions of partisan divisions and polarization
   make people less trusting of their fellow citizens. Due to perceived
   polarization, people are less likely to believe that others can be
   trusted to do the right thing, which in turn decreases their willingness
   to cooperate for good causes. I discuss the implications of these
   findings for society's ability to work together toward common goals.},

Abstract = {Although they fall outside of the traditional sources of international
   law, the Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions
   (Paris Principles) have enjoyed an authoritative value in international
   human rights law. International human rights bodies have increasingly
   permitted Paris Principles-compliant national human rights institutions
   (NHRIs) to participate in their activities not as part of the state but
   in the institutions' own capacity, and have required states to establish
   NHRIs or strengthen existing NHRIs in accordance with the Paris
   Principles. How, then, are the Paris Principles interpreted? This study
   critically analyses the three principles governing the interpretation of
   the Paris Principles - the dynamic interpretation principle, the
   normative gradation principle, and the overall evaluation principle -
   through a comprehensive examination of the practice of the Global
   Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), and makes
   recommendations for their improvement and consolidation.},

Title = {Per aspera ad astra-A political science analysis of the acceptance of
   the gender star by the German public based on an online survey},

Abstract = {The use of gender-equitable language has been the subject of intense
   debate in Germany for years. First, this article shows how the topic of
   gender-neutral language was actively used in the election campaign for
   the 2021 Bundestag elections, especially by the AfD (Alternative for
   Germany) party, which presented it as a cultural battle against a
   misguided ideology. The main analysis then focuses on the acceptance of
   a heatedly discussed form of gendered language, namely the use of the
   gender star. Before the actual survey started, more than 10,000
   participants in an online survey could choose whether they wanted the
   questionnaire to be presented with a gender star or not. This form of
   comparatively unconscious questioning of the characteristic of interest
   minimizes the danger of priming effects and social desirability.
   Overall, about 21\% of the respondents chose the gendered version, 75\%
   preferred the version that used the generic masculine, and 4\% did not
   make a choice. The statistical analysis showed that willingness to read
   the version with the gender star was closely related to political
   attitude patterns: People who were generally more in favor of state
   intervention chose it more often, as did more people with left-wing and
   alternative ecological orientations. These effects also largely overrode
   differences in voting intention. For example, after these basic
   political attitudes were controlled for, no difference was detectable
   between people with Christian Democratic Union and AfD voting
   intentions. The political attitude effects were also stronger than all
   other controlled third-party factors: Women and younger, more highly
   educated, and wealthier participants, as well as people from large
   cities, were also more likely to vote for the gender star variant. This
   suggests that the issue of gender activates deep-seated
   identity-politics attitudinal patterns and that it thus has great
   potential for political conflict in the future.},

   Anti-Corona Mobilisation in Germany},

Abstract = {How do political parties respond to street protest by political
   outsiders widely considered to be `pariahs' (i.e. radical or extremist
   actors)? Bridging the literature on responses to `populist' radical
   right parties with insights from social movement studies, we propose a
   theoretical model that conceptualises potential party responses to
   pariah protest. Innovatively, our typology distinguishes between a set
   of formal and substantive responses to street mobilisation. Empirically,
   we apply this model by providing the first systematic study of how
   political parties have responded to the `anti-Corona' protests of
   Querdenken, contributing to social science research on the politics of
   the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysing the critical case of Germany, we
   underline the stark difference between how the populist radical right
   AfD and all other Bundestag parties respond to anti-Corona mobilisation,
   showing how political protest may sharpen the polarisation of party
   politics. Moreover, we highlight the more nuanced but still important
   differences in responses by established German parties. Theoretically,
   the article provides an analytical framework valuable in times of
   increasing street mobilisation by radical and extremist actors.
   Methodologically, our analysis relies on a systematic media analysis of
   articles from two major German newspapers. Empirically, it contributes
   to our understanding of the difficult but crucial relationship between
   the German protest and party arena during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {In the opening lines of Ruling the Void Peter Mair states that `{[}t]he
   age of party democracy has passed'. In his eyes political parties are
   failing and with them democracy itself. This paper addresses Mair's
   concerns about the state of democracy. We review the latest evidence on
   how democracies have been innovating over the past twenty years or more,
   with particular attention to reforms that seek to bring citizens into
   the heart of discussions about constitutional and institutional reforms
   and significant policy issues. We show how deliberative mini-publics are
   becoming a more common feature of democratic government today, and, in
   some instances, how they are being embedded into the democratic system.
   We assess the implications for the state of state of democratic
   government today.},

Abstract = {Despite being the most tangibly impacted by the first-order effects of a
   warming climate, much of Australia's agricultural regions have remained
   relatively conservative in their views on climate change and the need
   for adaptation. This paper aims to understand how the experience of an
   extreme climate event like the 2017-2020 drought might shift opinions
   and values on these issues within agricultural communities. Through
   in-depth interviews with 20 graziers across Northwest NSW during the
   worst days of the drought, we found that various psychological lock-ins,
   historical memories of resilience, and local cultural values appeared to
   be undermining the perception of their vulnerability, while enhancing
   perceptions of their ability to endure. Such discursive constructions
   appear to explain why a jarring climatic event like the 2017-2020
   drought was failing to produce a noticeable shift in their views.},

Abstract = {Given decades of military rule and a tightly moderated national public
   sphere, political participation in Pakistan historically has been
   extremely constrained and shallow. In contrast, drawing on my
   ethnographic research conducted from 2013 to 2019, I present the case of
   the dera, a gathering place for men in villages, where surprisingly
   there is a measure of public debate. Such spaces have typically been
   ignored because they are informal and hidden within personal networks.
   In spite of its informality, I show how the dera has considerable
   influence over village life. While individuals who manage deras do not
   have formal authority, they frame local debates, influence social
   customs and rules within the village, and importantly mediate the
   relationship between villagers and state representatives. Unlike the
   Habermasian public sphere, interactions within the dera often contribute
   to uncivil discourse, fractious interactions, and scandal. I argue that
   exploring such uncivil dynamics of public life can contribute to an
   understanding of public participation in Pakistan more broadly,
   especially highlighting the exclusion of the subaltern or marginalized
   populations. Beyond Pakistan, I make the case for how decoupling of the
   public sphere from the state can reveal interstitial spaces such as the
   dera and the local gatekeepers who manage such spaces, as well as
   elucidate how micro public spheres influence participation in formal
   political institutions.},

Abstract = {The rise of far-right parties across Europe and their entrance into
   government at the local, if not regional or national, levels pose
   challenges for established civil society actors. This article draws on
   early findings from an ongoing research project in order to present two
   case studies of far-right local governments in small industrial towns in
   France and Italy: Hayange and Sant'Agata Bolognese. Keying in on these
   local administrations' approaches to civil society and drawing on
   semi-structured interviews with local politicians and trade union
   actors, the article identifies preliminary patterns in far-right local
   government relations with civil society organizations (including trade
   unions), including a bypassing or outright attacking of established
   associations deemed hostile (especially left-wing ones) in favor of
   those deemed politically more palatable. This exclusionary and partisan
   approach to civil society notably coexists alongside other aspects of
   far-right local governance centered on a performatively enacted claim to
   serve the entire community, most notably with the highly visible
   provision of non-excludable public goods such as public fountains and
   rotaries. These considerations provide a basis for ongoing and future
   work on far-right interventions in different areas of civil society, in
   different countries, and in light of a broader spectrum of actor
   perspectives.},

Abstract = {We examine the democratic legitimacy of popular referendums asking
   whether they should be understood as bypassing or complementing
   representative institutions. To answer this question, we focus on the
   distinction between legislative referendums and consultative ones,
   noting that even though referendums of the latter kind are by far more
   prevalent from an empirical point of view, their specific role in
   democratic decision-making remains under-theorized in the existing
   literature. We therefore focus on consultative referendums as a possible
   way of reconciling the referendum procedure with representative
   democracy. First, we clarify the specific conception of representative
   democracy that underscores our study; second, we develop the idea that
   consultative referendums are to be understood to specify the political
   mandate of elected representatives; finally, we apply the results of
   this conceptual work to the case of the Greek bailout and the Brexit
   referendums, aiming to dispel some lingering misconceptions concerning
   the normative implications of their results and thereby clarifying the
   normative significance of our theory.},

Abstract = {Through a multiple case study with a narrative design, we identify and
   describe some counter-hegemonic experiences of teachers in Chile, at the
   school and collective organization levels. For this purpose, teachers
   from a public school and teachers who adhere to two protest
   organizations are interviewed. The results show little articulation
   between both levels, and greater confrontation with capitalism in the
   second case. This article discusses the possibilities and implications
   of this articulation.},

Abstract = {In the spring and summer of 2020, a remarkable number of Americans
   participated in a remarkable number of protests in support of Black
   Lives Matter. How did the general public understand these protests, and
   where does support for the movement stand overall? We answer this
   question by drawing on several national surveys from 2020 and then
   examining the results of a framing experiment we conducted in June 2020.
   We structure the story we find in two parts-the partisans and the
   persuadables-both of whom are important to understanding public views of
   Black Lives Matter. Democrats and Republicans differ strongly in their
   views of the movement but are similar in the firmness of those views,
   which did not change in response to our framing experiment.
   Nonpartisans, in contrast, were more persuadable, though their reactions
   to some of our frames were conditioned by racial resentment. We conclude
   by setting the movement in historical context and assessing its impact,
   which we describe as complicated and contradictory but consequential.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the foundational epistemic racism/sexism in the
   knowledge structures of the westernized university. It argues that the
   epistemic privilege of Western man in the knowledge structures of
   Westernized universities is the result of four genocides/epistemicides
   in the 16th century: against the Jewish and Muslim population in the
   conquest of Al-Andalus, against the indigenous peoples in the conquest
   of the American continent, against kidnapped and enslaved africans in
   the American continent and against burned alive women accused of being
   witches in Europe. Which were the historical processes that produced
   knowledge structures founded on epistemic racism/sexism? Since the
   Cartesian legacy has had such an influence on Western knowledge
   structures, the article begins with a discussion of Cartesian
   philosophy. The second part deals with the conquest of Al-Andalus. The
   third on the conquest of the American continent and its implications for
   the population of Jewish and Muslim in 16th century in Spain, as well as
   for the African population forcibly removed from Africa and enslaved on
   the American continent. The fourth part deals with the
   genocide/epistemicide against Indo-European women burned alive by the
   Christian church on charges of witchcraft. The last part deals with
   Enrique Dussel's ``transmodernity{''} project and what it means to
   decolonize the westernized university.},

Abstract = {This article studies how the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP) is
   reconfiguring social and economic policy-making in the European Union
   (EU). The MIP was meant to tackle competitiveness-based imbalances but
   today addresses a broader range of social concerns. Scholars agree this
   fits in a trend of depoliticizing governance through tools of
   performance management. But they disagree whether this marks the
   `socialisation' or `neoliberalization' of governance. We contribute to
   this debate by drawing attention to the politics of performance
   management in the context of neoliberal European integration. We argue
   performance management has been driven by two tensions: i) macroeconomic
   divergence and intergovernmental dissensus and ii) EU institutions'
   contradictory technical responsibilities and political ambitions. We
   conclude that the expansion of social indicators in the MIP has
   undermined the coherence of `neoliberal' regulation. However, its
   connection with a project of the European Commission's empowerment means
   it is unlikely to improve prospects for greater social protection.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this article is to highlight the importance of the
   emotional component in explaining the electoral support for a far-right
   party, such as Vox. To this aim, the components of the vote for this
   formation are analyzed, paying special attention to those of an
   emotional nature (presence and intensity of different types of emotions
   in Vox voters), in the last two general elections -Congress of
   Deputies-, of April and November 2019. We use a quantitative
   methodological approach, based on survey datasets produced by the
   Political Research Group (EIP) of the University of Santiago de
   Compostela. The main results presented in this work allow us to conclude
   the existence of a highly emotional profile among Vox voters, that is
   expressed in a positive sense towards their own leader and their party.
   This emotional component also manifests towards the leaders and parties
   that compete with Vox, although in a positive sense towards right and
   center-right leaders and parties (PP and Ciudadanos) and in a negative
   sense towards those located on the left or the center-left (UP and
   PSOE). Moreover, the multivariate analysis shows the relevance of the
   emotional component in the explanation of the vote for Vox in the
   electoral processes, expressed through feelings of hope triggered by its
   leader (Santiago Abascal) and feelings of fear triggered by the PSOE
   leader (Pedro Sanchez) among Vox voters.},

Abstract = {The rise of the Far Right has been a steady global phenomenon,
   illustrated by political leaders such as Narendra Modi, Geert Wilders
   and Jair Bolsonaro. One of the main facilitators of this rise is Russia,
   supporting Far Right campaigns and movements in various regions of the
   world. Moreover, the Far Right parties around the world look to Russia
   as a beacon of hope, enticed by the messaging of Russia Way, Russia's
   state-run international news network, and other curated social media
   platforms. While some argue that Russia's support of the Far Right is an
   extension of its domestic values, we posit that this support is mainly
   to serve Russia's strategic foreign policy and that the Far Right
   ideology has little to do with Russia's domestic values and policy. In
   fact, Russia's domestic stability depends on values that are contrary to
   classic understandings of the Far Right. Given the multi-ethnic and
   multi-religious composition of the Russian Federation, the classic
   parameters of Far Right discourse would undermine the stability so dear
   to Putin. To support our propositions, we use comparative case studies
   of Russia's messaging abroad in Germany and the U.S. We then contrast
   this messaging and support with Russia's domestic rhetoric. In all
   cases, we engage in a systematic analysis of relevant documents,
   transcripts of elite speeches and media.},

Abstract = {While official science has given its answer to the question on the
   origin of the Coronavirus (animal to human transmission), alternative
   theories on human creation of the virus - purposely or inadvertently -
   have flourished. Those alternative theories can be easily located among
   the family of conspiracy theories, as they always assume some secretive
   activity of some groups acting on their self-interest and against the
   good of the many. The article assesses the prevalence of these beliefs
   during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, studies its development during
   the pandemic, and investigates its potential determinants. In
   particular, it analyses the relationship between beliefs in alternative
   theories on the origin of the virus and political orientation, by
   arguing that the association cannot be attributed to (politically)
   motivated reasoning, as the issue has not been highly politicized in the
   Italian context. Alternatively, the article suggests that the main
   factor driving beliefs in alternative accounts on the origins of the
   virus is institutional trust. Political orientation moderates its
   effects, depending on specific conditions (e.g. cue taking, position of
   the supported party either in government or opposition), and eventually
   reinforcing scepticism towards epistemic authorities for those with low
   trust in institutions. Data come from the ResPOnsE COVID-19 survey,
   carried out with daily samples from April to July 2020 (N > 15.000) to
   monitor the development of the Italian public opinion during the
   Coronavirus pandemic.},

Abstract = {Political parties use the internet, and social media in particular, for
   fundraising, advertising, and mobilizing to achieve desirable ends.
   Local parties are first and foremost organizations, and so as they make
   their decisions, they have to use their resources wisely. Through our
   analysis of over 6000 county-level Democratic and Republican parties in
   the United States, we find a high degree of variation in the use of
   social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) by parties. In
   explaining this variation, we focus on parties as organizations and so
   find the choice to use social media and their overall activity on it
   reflects the resources available to the party organization, as well as
   the size of potential audience and the competitiveness of their
   political environment. Although these variables explain local Democratic
   parties better than they explain local Republican parties.},

Abstract = {Digital platforms and application software have changed how people work
   in a range of industries. Empirical studies of the gig economy have
   raised concerns about new systems of algorithmic management exercised
   over workers and how these alter the structural conditions of their
   work. Drawing on the republican literature, we offer a theoretical
   account of algorithmic domination and a framework for understanding how
   it can be applied to ride hail and food delivery services in the
   on-demand economy. We argue that certain algorithms can facilitate new
   relationships of domination by sustaining a socio-technical system in
   which the owners and managers of a company dominate workers. This
   analysis has implications for the growing use of algorithms throughout
   the gig economy and broader labor market.},

Abstract = {In environments of seemingly intractable conflict, how should we
   understand the role of state capacity building and security-sector
   reform in transitions to peace? Prevailing wisdom suggests that a strong
   state security apparatus mitigates cyclical violence and aids in
   transitions to predictable, rule-governed behavior. Yet growing
   attention to police brutality in institutionalized democracies calls
   this assumption into question. Drawing on a multiyear study of war
   making and state making in eastern DR Congo, this article interrogates
   logics of police capacity building, analyzing how and why reform efforts
   intended to bolster the state's monopoly on violence frequently fail to
   curb the unrest they seek to disrupt. I argue that enhancing the
   coercive capacity of the police can entrench a wartime political order
   that makes peace more elusive; when police deploy the image of the state
   toward destabilizing ends they reinforce the institutions of everyday
   war, undermining the stability a monopoly on violence is intended to
   build.},

Abstract = {Is Boris Johnson's government suffering from the degenerative tendencies
   of long-serving government as identified by Timothy Heppell? For his
   2008 study, Heppell identified five symptoms of governing degeneration,
   namely: governing competence; leadership credibility; ideological
   division; abuses of power; and a renewed opposition/sense that it is
   time for a change. This approach was tested by Heppell on the
   longstanding Conservative administrations of 1951-64 and 1979-97, and
   the Labour administration between 1997 and (at the time of original
   publication) 2008. Thus, my hypothesis asks whether the similarly
   long-serving Conservative government from 2010 to-date might be
   exhibiting signs of similar governing degeneration on each of Heppell's
   criteria. I ask whether the Conservatives under Boris Johnson appear to
   lack the clear direction of travel and purpose that characterised the
   final period of the Macmillan/Home, Major, and Brown premierships.
   Whilst it is by no means the aim of this article to produce an electoral
   prediction, there is evidence to suggest the current Conservative
   administration has met the level of governing degeneration that affected
   the last years of the longstanding administrations evaluated by Heppell.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the analysis of public controversies around violence, this
   article examines the construction of ``extremism{''} in Spain. We
   explore how differences in public understanding of the limits of the
   (un)acceptable end up normalising the far right. Our article examines
   four public controversies: a public debate on terrorism glorification;
   an episode of collective violence; the deployment of violent speech in
   social media by a group of retired military personnel; and an episode of
   anti-Semitic speech in a Francoist memorialisation. We argue that the
   singularities of each country's political culture play a role in the
   understanding of extremism, so while certain political expressions are
   constructed as extreme, others remain in ``the realm of the normal{''}.
   Our findings shed light on the process in which far-right discourse is
   softened and clarifies some challenges faced by Preventing Violent
   Extremism (PVE) paradigms.},

   replaced by counterterrorism (CT) legislation in 2003, there have been
   five terrorism convictions. However, none was related to ERW violence,
   despite the existence of numerous ideologically motivated crimes
   committed by groups and individuals occupying this side of the political
   spectrum. In this study, we aim to understand the reasons behind such
   penal selectivity in contemporary Portugal by comparing two legal files:
   the first case sentenced according to the Portuguese CT Law, whose
   defendant was a Spanish national, and member of Euskadi To Askatasuna
   (ETA); and the first case of ERW violence sentenced after the
   introduction of the Portuguese CT Law, in which 36 alleged skinheads
   were sentenced for racial discrimination and incitement to hatred and
   violence, as expressed in section 240 of the Portuguese Criminal Code.
   We discuss how the Portuguese case can contribute to the international
   debate regarding the criminalisation of ideologically motivated
   violence.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A large literature on authoritarian elections suggests they allow
   autocrats to signal strength while also acting as focal points for
   opposition. These theories rest on the assumption that authoritarian
   elections attract the public's attention, but we know little about how
   attention shifts in these elections and toward whom. We expect that
   elections should increase the salience of both autocrats and their
   opponents, and we argue that opponents may gain nearly as much attention
   as autocrats despite restrictions inherent to these political systems.
   We confirm these patterns using Google Trends search data, which shows
   that opponents experience average boosts almost as large as those for
   autocrats. These increases are substantively large enough to indicate
   that opponents, who are typically starved of attention, attract similar
   public interest during election periods as autocrats do in non-electoral
   periods. The findings contribute to understanding how elections create
   opportunities but also risks for autocrats.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {116},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Why are online discussions about politics more hostile than offline
   discussions? A popular answer argues that human psychology is tailored
   for face-to-face interaction and people's behavior therefore changes for
   the worse in impersonal online discussions. We provide a theoretical
   formalization and empirical test of this explanation: the mismatch
   hypothesis. We argue that mismatches between human psychology and novel
   features of online environments could (a) change people's behavior, (b)
   create adverse selection effects, and (c) bias people's perceptions.
   Across eight studies, leveraging cross-national surveys and behavioral
   experiments (total N = 8,434), we test the mismatch hypothesis but only
   find evidence for limited selection effects. Instead, hostile political
   discussions are the result of status-driven individuals who are drawn to
   politics and are equally hostile both online and offline. Finally, we
   offer initial evidence that online discussions feel more hostile, in
   part, because the behavior of such individuals is more visible online
   than offline.},

Abstract = {Constitutions empower people to ask judges for binding orders directing
   state agents to remedy rights violations, but state agents do not always
   comply. Scholars propose that by making it easier to observe
   noncompliance, courts can leverage public pressure for compliance when
   it exists. Yet, exposure to information about noncompliance might lead
   individuals to accept high levels of noncompliance and reduce support
   for judicial remedies. We estimate the rate of noncompliance with
   judges' orders via a rigorous tracking study of the Colombian tutela. We
   then embed this rate in three survey experiments fielded with online
   national quota samples. We show that people find the noncompliance rate
   in the tutela highly unacceptable regardless of a variety of mitigating
   factors. We also show that public reactions to this information depend
   on prior expectations, a finding that stresses the importance of
   scholarship in cognitive psychology for studies of compliance in law and
   politics.},

Abstract = {We show that behind decades of disagreements over how to classify regime
   types, there is an unexpectedly strong consensus about which countries
   have been democratic in which years. We match many-valued
   classifications of democracies and autocracies to binary
   classifications, by finding the cutpoint that dichotomizes each
   many-valued measure so that it matches each binary measure as closely as
   possible. Despite the sharp differences between these datasets, we find
   identical or nearly identical optimal cutpoints for almost every major
   classification. This is evidence of a strong underlying agreement
   between the classifications. We show that the many-valued measures, when
   dichotomized in the optimal way, can replicate major results in the
   study of democracy. We also examine which sorts of countries are counted
   as democracies in this consensus, and we show that countries where
   national elections have never produced a turnover between parties are a
   particular focus of disagreement.},

Abstract = {Democracy is in decline worldwide, primarily because voters elect
   candidates harboring antidemocratic aspirations. Scholars argue that
   elections animate the democratic spirits of winners and deflate those of
   losers, but what about contests ending in the victory of authoritarian
   candidates? To answer this question, we consider the dynamics of
   commitment to democracy in Brazil's 2018 presidential campaign. Drawing
   on AmericasBarometer data and an original five-wave panel survey, we
   confirm that Jair Bolsonaro's campaign attracted skeptics of democracy.
   Although his election and inauguration boosted his supporters'
   allegiance to the political system, it also exacerbated their tolerance
   for institutional ruptures such as executive-led coups. Meanwhile,
   election losers retained their democratic commitments. As a result, the
   authoritarian victory narrowed preexisting winner-loser gaps in support
   for the political system, but widened gaps in tolerance for certain
   antidemocratic maneuvers. Thus, authoritarian electoral victories can
   foster short-term satisfaction among democracy's critics while abetting
   future instability.},

Abstract = {Several theories have been created to explain party unity in Congress,
   but previous studies have generally assumed the same factors affect
   party unity for both parties. Given the differences between the two
   parties (the ideological heterogeneity of their electoral coalitions,
   how the party's electoral coalitions view partisanship, etc.), this
   assumption may limit our understanding of the sources of party unity. In
   this paper, I test three theories of party unity (cartel theory,
   Conditional Party Government, and Strategic Party Government) on
   separate panels for the two parties. I find cartel theory helps explain
   party unity for both parties, but, unlike what has previously been
   argued, I find this is not entirely due to Reed's Rules. I further find
   Conditional Party Government better explains party unity for the
   Republicans, while Strategic Party Government better explains party
   unity for the Democrats. I provide theoretical reasons for these
   findings and how they may impact future research.},

Abstract = {State-owned capital investment into so-called illiberal democracies in
   Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) has risen to become a more significant
   feature of CEE political economies, although knowledge of the impact of
   such transnational flows on illiberal capitalist development remains
   limited. This article analyses this form of capitalist relation by
   contributing to and consequently fusing two strands of burgeoning
   academic literature: (1) the political economy of illiberalism and (2)
   state capitalism. The result is an expansion of the purview of each: the

Abstract = {What explains popular support for political violence in the contemporary
   United States, particularly the anti-institutional mob that attacked the
   U.S. Capitol in January 2021? Recent scholarship gives reason to suspect
   that a constellation of beliefs known as ``Christian nationalism{''} may
   be associated with support for such violence. We build on this work,
   arguing that religious ideologies like Christian nationalism should be
   associated with support for violence, conditional on several individual
   characteristics that can be inflamed by elite cues. We turn to three
   such factors long-studied by scholars of political violence: perceived
   victimhood, reinforcing racial and religious identities, and support for
   conspiratorial information sources. Each can be exacerbated by elite
   cues, thus translating individual beliefs in Christian nationalism into
   support for political violence. We test this approach with original
   survey data collected in the wake of the Capitol attacks. We find that
   all the identified factors are positively related to each other and
   support for the Capitol riot; moreover, the relationship between
   Christian nationalism and support for political violence is sharply
   conditioned by white identity, perceived victimhood, and support for the
   QAnon movement. These results suggest that religion's role in
   contemporary right-wing violence is embedded with non-religious factors
   that deserve further scholarly attention in making sense of support for
   political violence.},

Abstract = {The 2015 Prevent Duty requires public sector workers, by law, to show
   ``due regard{''} in the need to prevent vulnerable individuals from
   becoming engaged in terrorism and extremism through safe-guarding
   mechanisms. For the education sector, this also mandated the promotion
   of Fundamental British Values. With an increasing rise in concerns over
   the Far-Right, the Prevent duty has come under increasing scrutiny as to
   its appropriateness and applicability to prevent ``all forms{''} of
   extremism and terrorism, beyond those which have long been the focus of
   the UK government - Islamist-inspired threats. Yet, the role of British
   Values in this puzzle has yet to be addressed. This research reveals how
   British Values are positioned within the education system as the
   antithesis to all forms of extremism and terrorism and embedded within
   classroom pedagogy. It finds that there are questions over the promotion
   of an agenda which echoes in-group/out-group constructions of
   (ethnonationalist) acceptability found within Far-Right ideologies,
   through notions of Britishness. Further, it examines the ecological
   agency of educationalists in responding to such concerns through the
   enactment of policy to ``re-package{''} the agenda whilst simultaneously
   revealing the limitations placed on such actions by governance
   processes, curriculum limitations and wider discourses of exclusionary
   politics.},

Abstract = {To construct a dialogue between Marx and Heidegger, this essay reads the
   first volume of Capital together with Heidegger's writings on
   technology, contending there is a common concern over the impoverishment
   of things and, more precisely, of their qualitative consistency that
   occurs under the sway of capitalism/modern technology. Regarding Marx,
   the essay argues for reading Capital in an ontological key, thereby
   placing it in the same philosophical register as Heidegger, and for
   conceiving it as a description of the impoverishment of beings, the
   reduction of their being to value. The essay then takes Heidegger's
   writings on technology as corresponding to Capital, arguing that modern
   technology also leads to the same ontological Durftigkeit. Finally, the
   essay succinctly sketches what Heidegger's poietic way out of this
   situation might be, which in essence coincides with Marx's position.},

   study, two main tendencies of the literature are identified: one
   conceptual and formulator, and another more exclusive, political and
   technical, as well as an apparent technical consensus on some basic
   elements of security and defense policies. In view of this, a functional
   proposal is put forward to increase knowledge, rationalize resources and
   harmonize and improve the construction and implementation of security
   and defense policies.},

Abstract = {Does the Fourth Industrial Revolution deserve the status it is given? Is
   the digital revolution promoting a new stage of economic prosperity?
   What does it mean for the organisation of work and employment? We make a
   selective review of the most significant positions on technology. The
   theory of the long waves of accumulation, suggested by Ernest Mandel, is
   the theoretical framework which we try to answer these questions from.
   The inauguration, on a world scale, of a new expansionary long wave due
   to of this digital revolution is in question, in light of the evolution
   of accumulation, profitability or productivity, and considering the
   biophysical limits that industrial productivism is encountering.},

Abstract = {This article starts from the observation of the lack of conceptual rigor
   regarding the pair left-right, despite its wide use. Through the
   evaluation of the bibliography that encompasses different theoretical
   and ideological orientations, it is finds in Lenin a consistent criteria
   for the establishment of its parameters can be identified. In addition
   to that original pair, the article also tackles the ``new right `` as a
   classification that is widely used, though without clear contours. The
   article points out the distinctive characteristics of what can be
   defined as the ``new `` and the ``old `` right, seeking to contribute to
   the proper analysis of the phenomenon. Finally, it proposes that there
   is a specific aspect of the ``new `` right to which ``bolsonarism `` is
   linked, and it defends the adequacy of the term ``neo-fascist `` as a
   means of referring to the contemporary expression of such political
   phenomenon.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This article is the result of a joint construction resulting from the
   shared experience of vulnerable people affected by the public policies
   that have implemented the minimum vital income (MVI) ???as applicants
   and/or recipients??? and citizen platforms for the defense of
   citizens??? rights that have accompanied them in the process. The MVI is
   a benefit aimed at preventing the risk of poverty and social exclusion
   of people who lack basic economic resources to cover their basic needs.
   This benefit is aimed at very specific groups and subject to a series of
   requirements. In conversation with the co-signers of the article, the
   following pages focus on the need to propose a view that, beyond the
   regulatory framework and media discourse surrounding the insertion
   income policies, focuses on the administrative procedures and
   bureaucratic practices that shape the daily management of these
   benefits, giving rise to situations of openness or closure that
   condition access to social rights. Insofar as the IMV is configured as a
   nascent subjective right, its implementation constitutes a privileged
   place from which, precisely, to analyze the regulatory and bureaucratic
   deployment that accompanies it, as well as the political uses that have
   been made of it.},

Abstract = {The monograph by P.V. Oskolkov ``Essays on ethnopolitical studies{''}
   (Moscow: Aspect Press, 2021) is devoted to recent developments and the
   current state of the ethnopolitics academic literature. Referring to a
   wide range of ethnopolitical studies, the author focuses on the
   categorical apparatus and characteristics of its methodological
   framework. The author considers issues such as the nation and ethnicity,
   nationalism and the national state, ethnopolitics and language, ethnic
   voting and party politics. He employs a wide range of research
   approaches and theoretical solutions to explain their nature, dynamics,
   variability. P. Oskolkov outlines and concretizes ethnopolitical studies
   as a social and interdisciplinary field of knowledge. This monograph is
   interesting on account of the critical review of concepts that it
   offers, the theories it expands on and its illustrative content. It also
   vividly and succinctly explains the nature of the discussed
   ethnopolitical phenomena.},

Title = {THE EU'S ENERGY POLICY AND ITS DRIVING FORCES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {67-79},
Abstract = {The energy crisis, which the EU faces since Autumn 2021 and especially
   dramatically since March 2022, has once again brought up the issue of
   stable and affordable energy supply. The mechanisms of crisis management
   at the EU's disposal did not allow it to react to the situation
   effectively, although the new energy resources price spike was caused by
   `old' reasons, known to the EU from its experience of 1970-1980s: the
   resources deficit and political instability in the supplier region. What
   was new was that paradoxically, the EU energy policy, instead of
   preventing or at least smoothing the crisis, made it worse. The authors
   consider the driving forces that stand behind the development of EU
   energy policy and, proceeding from that, explain why, with a chronic
   energy resources deficit, the EU was steadily abandoning its long-term
   contracts with suppliers and calling on its member states to proceed
   with a nuclear phase-out. Why, under the conditions of post-pandemic
   energy growth of demand on the world market and an unprecedented price
   spike, it took these seemingly illogical steps: it refused to start the
   newly built gas pipeline Nord Stream-2 and was keen to buy costly LNG
   from alternative suppliers and to continue the development of unreliable
   and expensive renewable energy while gas prices on the spot markets kept
   breaking the records. To define the driving forces of the EU's energy
   policy both international relations (realism, liberalism, social
   constructivism and neo-Marxism) and European integration theories
   (intergovernmental approach, institutionalism, neofunctionalism and
   communication theory) are applied to cover each aspect. Rational
   approaches such as realism and liberalism, as well as neofunctionalism
   and some other theories do not yield any insights into the driving
   forces and practical steps taken by the EU during the 2021-2022 energy
   crisis. Theories, which have social approach at their basis - social
   constructivism, neo-Marxism, etc., offer a more logical explanation of
   the EU's decisions.},

Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},

Volume = {57},

Pages = {56-83},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article investigates three explanations for electoral support for
   the far right - `cultural backlash', `economic grievances' and `protest
   voting' - in a novel way. Our main contribution is that we contrast
   far-right voters with voters of centre-right parties, traditional
   left-wing parties and abstainers. Equally innovative is the comparison
   between mature and post-communist democracies. Using European Social
   Survey data (2014-16), we conclude that anti-immigration attitudes are
   most important in distinguishing far-right voters from all other groups.
   Yet, these differences are significantly smaller in Eastern Europe.
   Furthermore, far-right voters are not the so-called socioeconomic
   `losers of globalization': this is only true when compared with
   centre-right voters. Concerning protest voting, distrust of
   supranational governance particularly enhances far-right voting.
   Overall, our study concludes that more fine-grained distinctions pay off
   and avoid misleading generalizations about `European far-right voters'
   often presented in public debates.},

Abstract = {The paper analyses the relative competitiveness of the Slovak Republic
   and examines in which product groups the country has a comparative
   advantage compared with the rest of the world. The most commonly used
   method of calculating the country's comparative advantage is the
   indicator of revealed comparative advantage. The aim of the paper is to
   analyse the current comparative advantages of the Slovak Republic
   through the calculation of the RCA indexes. The application of the
   Slovak and worldwide export data to RCA index allows us to identify in
   which sectors Slovakia has got the comparative advantage and is
   competitive at global level. The analysis of these industries also
   allows us to identificate the threats to the future economic development
   of Slovakia.},

Abstract = {This research studies the historical process of the social movement for
   the linguistic officiality in the Principality of Asturias from 1974 to
   the present. The research, of a qualitative nature, uses the theoretical
   framework of both, Peace and Civil Resistance Studies as well as
   Sociolinguistics, with the aim of building a bridge between both
   disciplines. As a data collection method, mainly use the bibliographic
   review and the realization of 5 qualitative and semi-structured
   interviews. The results show a large number of resistances and
   peacebuilding processes that can be added within a process of nonviolent
   transformation of the linguistic and cultural conflict found in the
   Principality. These processes are characterized by various factors,
   among them, a generational change that has allowed the entry of new
   cultural processes dedicated to the fight for the dignity of the

Title = {Las Vidas Negras Importan: Centering Blackness and Racial
   Politics in Latin American Research},
Journal = {ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {341-356},
Abstract = {Racial disparities in Latin America exist in poverty levels, income,
   education, infant mortality, political representation, access to social
   services, and other key indicators. However, researchers in comparative
   politics face an uphill challenge to prioritize racial politics in
   studies of democratization, democratic consolidation, representation,
   and even social movements and inequality, despite racial hierarchies
   being quite harmful to democracy in Latin America. This article argues
   for the centering of Black politics and racial hierarchies in Latin
   American politics and highlights recent literature to map just how that
   can be done. More than adding race as a variable or a control, we must
   understand racial identification and anti-Black racism in Latin America:
   how they operate, and how they influence, complicate, motivate, affirm,
   and inspire politics. In this article, I address (a) why we should
   center racial politics in Latin American politics, (b) how comparative
   racial scholars have centered Black politics, (c) the methodologies
   necessary to accurately measure racial identification, and (d) recent
   research that examines the interplay between racial self-identification,
   Black group consciousness, and voting behavior.},

Title = {Prosociability and violence in primary schools in Mexico},
Journal = {REVISTA DE PAZ Y CONFLICTOS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-DEC},
Abstract = {This article presents the main results of the implementation of a
   multicomponent model to promote prosocial skills and prevent violence in
   some marginalized primary schools located in the states of Sonora and
   Chiapas in Mexico. Mixed methods were used in the research, the
   quantitative phase was developed through a quasi-experimental design; in
   the qualitative one, participatory action research was facilitated. The
   main findings indicate an increase in the practice of prosocial skills
   in the participants and a reduction in school violence. For example: the
   p-value obtained in the repeated measures analysis shows an increase
   (statistically significant) in the level of prosociability of the
   students; this trend is practically identical in both cities (p.0.072).
   There is a difference in the degree of initial and final prosociability
   (p = 7.905 x 10-33), which shows a notable increase in the prosocial
   skills of the project participants. The intervention had an impact on
   the maintenance of school climates of cordiality, greater participation,
   development of empathy, assertiveness, better management of emotions and
   practice of conflict resolution techniques, which in short contributed
   to the increase of friendship networks and the improvement of the
   educational use.},

Abstract = {The article has as an investigative proposal analyzes the tendency of
   confluence of the Law language with of Public Policies in contemporary
   constitutionalism. It is based on the assumption that public policies,
   developed in the context of economic and social programs, have invaded
   the field of law in several areas. It follows the theoretical framework
   of the Law and Public Policy Approach (DPP) in which public policies are
   seen as a set of normative and administrative activities aimed at
   improving and incremental transformations in services and utilities
   offered by the state, or to solve real problems, related promoting and
   enjoying rights. To face the phenomenon of public policies as
   legal-organizational exteriorization of the multiplicity of decisions
   and/or actions under the control of the government or the Legislative
   Power, modeling with legal frameworks and cycles of sublegal activities
   destitute to the achievement of constitutionally appreciable objectives.
   And it analyzes how a Public Policy language turns out to be potentially
   instrumentalizing the 1988 citize's constitutional project, in the
   Brazilian context. In relation to the methodology used, the dialectical
   method is adopted as a method of approach, through which this work
   undertakes a dynamic interpretation of the analyzed reality, between the
   production of specialized scientific literature and as corresponding
   contextual-conjectural situations. Among the main results are the
   identification of the contributions of several authors who have already
   investigated the theme of public policies, with an impact on the legal
   literature. The present article, therefore, has the ability to present
   the potential of the confluence between Law and Public Policies and to
   prepare the ground for a detailed mapping of the effective innovations
   and improvements in legal dogmatics brought by this approach, guiding
   future research in this direction, with complementary paths
   methodological.},

Abstract = {The pandemic has brought with it innumerable conflicts and debates about
   fundamental rights and public freedoms and their limitation on the
   occasion of the protection of public health and the life and integrity
   of the community, a general interest enshrined in articles 15 and 43 of
   the Constitution. Among those, compulsory vaccination has been gaining a
   very relevant interest, especially since the arrival of the first
   vaccines against Covid-19. This paper addresses the debate on compulsory
   vaccination from a constitutional perspective, distinguishing between
   two concepts such as compulsory and forced vaccination. The individual
   rights involved in one and the other are very different.},

Abstract = {The article addresses the micro-processes of the PJSC PIK's lobbying
   activity in the context of the political and managerial dynamics in the
   global (world) city of Moscow. The study introduces and substantiates
   the concept of ``spatial conversion{''} as a cyclical process of
   considering and incorporating individual and group interests of
   individual top managers and business organizations as political
   stakeholders in the framework of their activities for the generation of
   political rent and maximizing economic profit. The first part of the
   paper analyzes the impact of the international context, its conditions
   and factors on the implementation of construction policy and lobbying of
   large developers. The article distinguishes between the terms
   `'lobbying'' as a micro-political activity carried out by non-government
   stakeholders and `'lobbyism'' as a system of functional interest
   representation in a specific area.},

Abstract = {From a documentary methodology, the objective of the article was to
   analyze the administrative and legal regulation of space tourism and the
   characteristics of this form of tourism as a type of space activity. In
   legal perspective, space tourism as any type of relationship must be
   regulated, including in the administrative and legal sense, because the
   role of the State in the regulation of these relationships is of
   particular importance and, in our opinion, requires special attention
   and legal analysis. A characteristic feature of the administrative and
   legal regulation of space tourism is that one of the participants in
   these relations are corporations that develop the space industry,
   including space tourism, and the state creates a legal basis for the
   development of these relations and if it applies to the developed space
   industry, invests in this activity and promotes development in all
   possible directions. Therefore, we believe that special attention should
   be paid to the administrative and legal regulation of space tourism. It
   is concluded that the administrative and legal regulation of space
   tourism is a deliberate influence of the norms of administrative law on
   the regulation of social relations arising in the field of space
   tourism.},

Title = {MANAGING LIBERAL DEMOCRACY - INFLUENCE OF SECRET ELITE NETWORKS IN U.S.

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to contribute to research on the role of elite
   networks in democracies. The specific research topic is an attempt to
   measure (for the first time) the influence of different elite networks
   on U.S. government administrations from 1901 to 2021. The strategy is
   based on the identification of U.S. government officials, who were also
   members of secret elite networks during their time in office. To this
   end, each government position received an influence value based on its
   importance. If an official in this position was also a member of an
   elite network, then the influence of the position is counted towards the
   influence of the network. The total influence of a network is divided by
   the total influence of all government positions in order to receive its
   relative influence score in a given administration. The results show
   that Freemasons had a strong influence on most U.S. governments until
   1953, whereas the Anglo-American Network, with its most prominent arm,
   the Council on Foreign Relations, became the dominant force from
   Eisenhower onward. Only Nixon's first cabinet and Donald Trump
   constituted exceptions thereafter, relying less heavily on this network.
   The implication of this study is that it is impossible to understand
   American history or World history in the last 120 years without also
   analyzing the role and interests of elite networks, given their
   consistent and surprisingly high level of influence, as revealed by this
   study.},

Abstract = {To learn about the effects of corporate campaign contributions, we study
   the potential influence of the insurance industry in US state politics.
   The insurance industry is one of the biggest players in state politics,
   and we have collected new data on objective measures of the industry's
   performance in each state over time. We exploit within-state changes in
   campaign finance regulations which can significantly restrict the
   ability of corporate contributors to give money and potentially
   influence elected officials. Across a range of outcomes and campaign
   finance reforms, we find little evidence that the ability to make
   corporate campaign contributions benefits the insurance industry in a
   state. Some results suggest that the ability to make campaign
   contributions may benefit the insurance industry in states with elected
   insurance commissioners, but overall, campaign contributions appear to
   have a little distortionary effect even in a setting where we would most
   expect to find it.},

Journal = {ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {175-196},
Abstract = {The global movement for racial justice and the rise of anti-Asian hate
   at the height of the pandemic have called new attention to race and
   racism in international politics. Although critical theorists have
   decried the ``norm against noticing,{''} other scholars of international
   relations have long sidestepped the possible role of race in shaping
   contemporary international affairs. New studies of hierarchy in
   international relations open the door for new understandings of race in
   world politics. We propose an analytic framework for the relationship
   between racial hierarchy, international law, and foreign policy,
   demonstrating that race can help explain patterns of interstate
   interactions that sustain an unequal global order. Positing two faces of
   racism in international relations, we examine how race biases
   international law in practice and affects the assessment of foreign
   threats and national interest. We discuss key methodological challenges
   in empirical research on race in international relations, focusing on
   issues of measurement, aggregation, and causation.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a survey carried out in December
   2020 in which a questionnaire was answered by Basque university youth on
   the topic of the legitimization of ETA terrorist violence. Contrary to
   previous surveys, this study was carried out after the official
   dissolution of ETA in 2018. 1,067 valid responses were obtained from
   young women and men between 18 and 25 years old residing in the Basque
   Country. The results confirm that most of the answers reject the use of
   violence as a political tool, but the youngest generations and those who
   identify themselves as only Basque express less forcefulness and less
   determination in the delegitimization of the existence of ETA.},

   Church's social doctrine saw, in the first half of the 20th century,
   such transformations to lead to a progressive subsumption of women's

   possible to show how the transformations that have taken place have been
   ambiguous in character, with the basic ontological notion of the two
   sexes remaining substantially unchanged, to the point of envisaging, for
   female citizens called to vote, a clear distinction between the active

Abstract = {Measured by its political objectives, Russia lost the war in Ukraine
   when its invading army had to withdraw from the northern theatre of war
   around Kyiv in March 2022. The northeastern campaign around Sumy and
   Kharkiv also ended with the withdrawal of the aggressor's troops in
   September. In the east and south, the campaign, which had been planned
   as a war of movement, turned into trench warfare and a war of attrition,

   FRIENDSHIP TO INCIPIENT RIVALRY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2022},
Number = {1},
Pages = {7-18},
Abstract = {The period from the American War of Independence (1775-1783) to the sale
   of Alaska (1867) was the longest period of friendly relations in
   US-Russian history. This was hardly a period of close ties, however, or
   what we would now call partnership. Each country was of marginal concern
   to the other. The gulf in values was profound and unbridgeable, even if
   the two powers insulated relations from ideological disputes.
   Geopolitical tension was absent because the two countries largely
   operated in separate spheres. Where they did interact, friction did not
   erupt into serious conflict, because Russia was willing to accommodate
   American expansionism rather than risk escalation in regions that were
   far from vital. The benefits that each country derived from the other
   were minimal and never arose from extensive collaboration. Rather they
   were the consequence of each country's refusal to take sides against the
   other in conflicts with third powers, including the War for
   Independence, the Crimean War,and the American Civil War. If relations
   were friendly, it was because there was no compelling reason to be
   rivals. The situation changed dramatically in the last decades of the
   19th century, as the United States experienced an unprecedented period
   of rapid growth in wealth and power while Russia entered a prolonged
   period of imperial crisis. American ideological and geopolitical
   ambition eventually turned distant friendship into an incipient rivalry.},

Abstract = {Wearing face masks to combat the spread of COVID-19 became a politicized
   and contested practice in the United States, largely due to
   misinformation and partisan cues from masking opponents. This article
   examines whether Public Service Announcements (PSAs) can encourage the
   use of face masks. We designed two PSAs: one describes the benefits of
   using face masks; the other uses a novel messenger (i.e., a retired US
   general) to advocate for them. We conducted two studies. First, we aired
   our PSAs on television and surveyed residents of the media market to
   determine if they saw the PSA and how they felt about wearing face
   masks. Second, we conducted a randomized experiment on a diverse
   national sample. Both studies suggest that exposure to our PSAs
   increased support for face masks and induced greater compliance with
   public health advice. These findings have implications for how
   governments might fight pandemics.},

Title = {Making Polar and Ocean Governance Future-Proof},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {60-69},
Abstract = {Governance institutions of the polar regions, as well as global oceans,
   may hold room for improvement in terms of effec-tiveness but, on the
   whole, their existence can be regarded as a success story. The
   arrangements managed to pool respon-sibility for regional resources amid
   Cold War geopolitics, mostly by delegating discussions to science
   committees. Changing global climate, however, provides considerable
   challenges to these governance arrangements. It begs the question of how
   the success story can be continued into the future. After sketching the
   emergence of polar and ocean governance and their core organizational
   principles during the 20th century, this article identifies some of the
   challenges linked to global warming that have been altering the context
   of governance fundamentally. The article discusses emerging issues that
   war-rant attention, but which may be difficult to accommodate in present
   governance networks. Ultimately, the article argues that anchoring
   principles of ???responsibility??? that take into account the relational
   quality of polar and ocean spaces is key to any institutional design
   that seeks to take governance arrangements into the 21st century and
   beyond.},

Abstract = {Using the Regional Security Complex Theory (RSCT) and qualitative
   methodological approach, this article examines the impact of the Boko
   Haram insurgency on the various sectors and arenas of security as
   proposed by proponents of the Copenhagen School of Security Studies.
   Findings of the article suggest that the presence and activities of this
   terror group have impacted the various arenas of security and have also
   created dire sub-regional and regional implications in spite of the
   various counter-measures designed by sub-regional and regional actors to
   counter the threat posed by the terror group. Therefore, to address this
   challenge, the article offers practical recommendations to critical and
   relevant actors involved in countering the presence of this group at the
   various political, military, societal, economic, environmental,
   sub-regional, and regional levels.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2022},
Number = {1},
Pages = {86-101},
Abstract = {Regardless of current globalization and localization processes, national
   languages are still regarded in political and linguistic discourses as
   occupying a place of choice in the language hierarchy. Globalization as
   a process is generating new levels of language scaling, opening a new
   horizon for language policies. It is considered that ``global
   languages{''} correspond to the postnational language level. A global
   language is one used for global communications. English is currently the
   only global language. Other languages with a considerable influence are
   called areal languages. The latter are languages of certain regional
   powers and civilization spaces. Areal languages are defined on the basis
   of D. Crystal, A. de Swaan and B. Kachru's theoretical models. Findings
   are reached by applying comparative methods to supranational languages,
   which became the material of the study. Actual language areal policy is
   studied through the example of French language policy. Areal languages
   include a special form of language policy distinct from the national
   one. Areal language policies functionally (but not substantially)
   reproduce the strategy of ancient sacred languages. Their task is to
   include or ``convert{''} new speakers beyond the pivot states. Areal
   languages mostly challenge the world language and to a lesser degree
   they compete with each other. Areal language policies are carried out on
   status, corpus and language acquisition levels of planning. Status
   planning is fundamental in an areal language policy and its goal is
   prestige and attractiveness leading to an extension of a language and
   its culture. Corpus planning means preservation of the language space
   and it is realized in the forms of mono- and pluricentrism. Acquisition
   planning implies creating international communities, educational
   networks and significant content in mass media.},

Abstract = {False information, as well as the actors who spread it, have the power
   to promote negative narratives about society and discredit the work of
   serious media, non-governmental organizations, etc. Concerns are growing
   around the world that international NGOs and civil society organizations
   are vulnerable to online attacks and disinformation campaigns. These
   attacks are aimed at instilling fear and confusion, stigmatizing civil
   society, disparaging targeted organizations and their leaders, or
   promoting inaccurate views. The deliberately misleading nature of false
   information can make it difficult to study and analyze this issue. After
   studying the available professional sources, we can state that most of
   the studies carried out so far focus on three aspects, namely (1)
   identification of forms of false information and false content, (2)
   causes and dynamics of their spread, especially on social networks, and
   (3) impact to public opinion. An objective of this article was to
   characterize and clarify all three aspects, while we have tried to apply
   them to a specific case in the second part of the paper, specifically
   Russian-Ukrainian war. The main cause, or the motive of the primary
   creators of disinformation is to cause chaos in society and undermine
   trust in the state, which is directly related to inciting hatred and
   distrust towards state institutions. Disinformation has become a hybrid
   tool as a form of attack on the interests of every democratic state and
   the security of its citizens. Foreign powers often try to spread their
   narratives through their own or friendly media, or fictitiously
   independent activists, while they often communicate differently
   internally within their own state. Based on our findings, coordination
   with three key players is crucial in the fight against disinformation:
   technology companies, civil society and fact-checkers and academic
   institutions. In addition, strategic communication is one of the key
   tools in the fight against disinformation and requires a broad approach.
   Disinformation campaigns are often not limited to spreading fake news,
   but often focus on building a damaging narrative. This implies a close
   relationship between the fight against disinformation and strategic
   communication, public diplomacy and digital communication.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the determinants of semi-democracy as a distinct
   but under-researched outcome among 12 of the 29 European and post-Soviet
   post-communist states. Institutional the-ory's limitations in explaining
   enduring semi-democracy suggest other approaches may offer new insights,
   specifically realist international relations theory, given the
   concentration of unresolved conflicts, asymmetrical trade dependencies
   on regional powers, and revolutionary overthrows of government among the
   12 semi-democracies. The study uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative
   analysis, incorporating both established institutional and novel
   power-relational conditions drawn from realist IR theory, finding that
   10 of the cases fit four explanatory patterns, which suggest that
   institutional conditions do matter for democratization but are
   intertwined with and subordinated to realist conditions.},

Abstract = {Cyberbullying of women and girls is not just a violation of human
   rights, it is a global phenomenon that is destroying the lives of women
   and their families around the world. Using a hermeneutic documentary
   methodology, the objective of the study was to determine the legal
   mechanisms for the use of social networks as a means of combating gender
   violence and thus outline the main problems of their application of the
   law. Everything indicates that social networks, as an effective means of
   forming positive public opinions, can form a positive image of women and
   the appropriate attitude of men towards them, and as well as contribute
   to combating violence on the Internet. The system for combating
   gender-based violence consists of prevention, protection, criminal
   responsibility, and a comprehensive gender policy. It concludes that
   international gender policy standards have been found to be based on a
   model of ``real equality{''}, which is ensured through the achievement
   of equal opportunities, equal access to opportunities and equal
   performance.},

Abstract = {Since its first outbreak in December 2019, the novel coronavirus has
   spread rapidly around the world, affecting all countries and becoming a
   global crisis. As of August 2021, more than 220 million people have been
   infected and more than four million people have lost their lives to
   COVID-19 disease. Many countries around the globe have taken very strict
   and unprecedented measures to limit the further spread of the novel
   coronavirus and reduce the number of hospital cases and deaths. The aim
   of this paper is to analyse and discuss the public health measures in
   selected member states of the European Union related to the spread of
   novel coronavirus and the outcomes of these measures, focusing on public
   confidence in policy-making institutions. We use publicly available data
   on this topic and test the hypothesis that high levels of public trust
   in decision-making institutions are directly correlated with compliance
   with the public health measures and restrictions adopted by these
   institutions to limit the spread and consequences of the novel
   coronavirus.},

Abstract = {In our study on current views on the position of power in politics, we
   were based on a number of modern political theories, where the
   fundamental aspect of modern power and politics is conflict and the aim
   of politics is to gain and retain power. The constitutional position of
   power in these theories is characterized as a ``goal about itself{''}.
   Power is a goal, it is not an instrument of politics. Political
   philosophy from Hobbees to Nozick rejects theories that give politics
   (or political power) higher goals. We analysed new concepts of the
   position of power in political relations (Badiou, Oakeshott, Ranciere,
   Shapiro), leading to a new concept of politico. We have concluded that
   the perception of power is gradually taking shape, which represents a
   categorical turnaround compared to the understanding of modern power and
   politics as conflict. The basis for the new perceptualisation of power
   is the change in its existing constitutional position within political
   relations - as an objective. The new concepts of power and politics
   represents a power that has undergone conversion on the basis of a new
   understanding of political objectivity and does not involve conflict
   between opposites and coercion or violence.},

Abstract = {Using the dialectical and documentary method, the article analyzes the
   state of implementation of the strategic priority of reforming Ukraine's
   judicial system. It demonstrated that, under the current conditions for
   Ukraine, European integration is a key priority of the state's foreign
   policy. Issues hindering the successful implementation of Ukraine's
   strategic course towards European integration were identified, such as:
   Ukraine requires a comprehensive renewal of three bodies: the bar
   association, the law enforcement system, and the courts themselves. The
   conditions for the effective administration of justice have also been
   determined: updating of the High Council of Justice and the High
   Qualification Commission with the participation of international
   experts; creation of a new court to replace the Kiev District Court of
   Appeal, which will consider key decisions of state bodies; ensure the
   fair composition of the Constitutional Court; Building public confidence
   in the judicial and police system. It is concluded that it is important
   in the process of reform of the Superior Council of Justice to find a
   compromise between non-interference in the activities of this body, its
   components, and to guarantee the transparency and effectiveness of its
   decisions.},

   (754,372) from more than 50 Russian news websites for the years

   the West and Ukraine, the key year is 2014 - the year of the beginning
   of the aggression against Ukraine. But at the same time, Russian
   propaganda positions it as a struggle for influence with the West, and
   this perfectly demonstrates the synchronicity of anti-Western and

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {168-176},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the relationship between religiosity and vaccine
   hesitancy by highlighting the role of a specific dimen-sion of
   religiosity that makes some people more prone to explaining health
   conditions as a divine agency-the belief in the immanent presence of the
   divine in everyday life. Accordingly, these people may undervalue the
   role of vaccination as a solution to cope with a pandemic and may be
   more skeptical of vaccines. We suggest a mechanism explaining the
   relationship between religiosity and vaccine hesitancy by focusing on
   the mediating role of beliefs in conspiracy theories, given that belief
   in divine immanence and conspiracy theories share the common trait of
   attributing agency to hidden forces. Beliefs in conspiracy theories, in
   turn, have been shown to be among the strongest predictors of vaccine
   hesitancy. By using a moderated mediation analysis on Italian survey
   data collected during the Covid-19 pandemic, we show that such a
   mechanism helps explain the relationship between believing in divine
   immanence and vaccine hesitancy among people not adhering to
   institutional religiosity. In contrast, this mechanism does not apply
   when the immanent conception of the divine is framed within a system of
   beliefs belonging to institutional religion.},

Abstract = {Immigration policy is often portrayed as a zero-sum trade-off between
   labor and capital or between high- and low-skilled labor. Many have
   attributed the rise of populist politicians and populist movements to
   immigrants and/or immigration policy. While immigration has
   distributional implications, we argue that something is clearly missing
   from the discussion: the fact that migrants are an engine of
   globalization, especially for countries in the Global South. Migration
   and migrant networks serve to expand economic markets, distribute
   information across national borders, and diffuse democratic norms and
   practices throughout the world, increasing trade and investment flows.
   We further argue that many commentators have got the causal relationship
   backward: Instead of immigration reducing support for globalization, we
   argue that trade, financial flows, and offshoring have reduced support
   for immigration among the elite and a vocal plurality of citizens in the
   Global North.},

Abstract = {This paper offers a critical examination of the foundations of Hans
   Kelsen's democratic theory in neo-Kantian epistemology. It argues that,
   while such an epistemological framework provides coherence to his
   intellectual endeavor by reconciling his monistic legal theory with a
   pluralist democratic theory, it weakens the theoretical fertility and
   analytic edge of his political thought. Furthermore, I also claim that
   the Kelsenian epistemological turn, in its understanding of both law and
   politics, remains very much entangled in the dilemmas and modes of
   thought of a philosophical tradition that Kelsen himself believed to
   have entirely surpassed. His nevertheless insightful analysis of modern
   democratic institutions would therefore benefit from being read through
   different philosophical spectacles.},

Abstract = {With the beginning of the protests against the presidential election
   fraud in August 2020, A. Lukashenko and the Belarusian state media
   attempted to create and promote their interpretation of the nature of
   the protests, which took place in many cities and towns across Belarus.
   These protests were the largest, both in terms of sheer size and
   duration, in the history of independent Belarus. Our critical analysis
   of the events and the way they were depicted through media channels
   consists of the following elements: (a) how Belarus' state narrative
   about the protests developed in August-September 2020, (b) the rhetoric
   used by the Belarusian state to describe the protests, (c) the
   protesters, and (d) the use of force against the protesters. Using a
   short contextualisation, the paper aims to bring and highlight parallel
   rhetoric of non-accredited Belarusian media with its representations in
   the Russian and Ukrainian media.},

Abstract = {The article discusses a study conducted in the Chipinge-East District of
   the Manicaland Province in Zimbabwe. The possibilities of establishing
   local peace committees in a Zimbabwean context were analysed. The study
   was as a reaction to the recurring violence affecting Zimbabwean
   communities along the border with Mozambique. In addition, the absence
   of comprehensive violence-reduction measures from the Zimbabwean
   government and communities to address this violence was noted. An action
   research approach was used to conduct the study. The findings of the
   study revealed that the Chipinge-East community had the capacity and
   interest to set up a Local Peace Committee (LPC). The LPC managed to set
   up an early warning system to mitigate the violence which occurs in the
   community. The LPC members also managed to travel to other locations in
   Chipinge District to inform the wider community about the early warning
   system. Despite its notable achievements, the LPC faced obstacles which
   included a lack of financial resources, initial resistance, and
   suspicions from community members and state authorities. Despite the
   challenges, the LPC continues to forge ahead and serves as a model for
   peacebuilding in Zimbabwe.},

Title = {THE RUSSIAN POLITICAL ELITE: CHARACTERISTICS AND DYNAMICS (based on
   research materials dating from 2011 to 2021)},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The article presents the results of a political and psychological
   analysis of the political elite of Russia. The empirical research was
   conducted using the psychobiographical method, content analysis of texts
   and the observation method. In the course of the study, the biographical
   information of about 556 politicians was collected and processed,
   including all deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation,
   heads of regions, ministers of the federal government of the Russian
   Federation. The biographical information formed the basis of the
   status-role analysis of the modern political elite in Russia, and also
   made it possible to analyze the dynamics of its main socio-demographic
   indicators, starting in 2011 (based on previous studies). The 30
   political and psychological profiles of representatives of the elite
   allowed the author to formulate hypotheses about the challenges
   encountered by representatives of the political elite of modern Russia
   in trying to realise their potential. The study found that the trend
   towards rejuvenation is the most visible. However, this only applies to
   those corps that the federal government recruits. The problem of
   developing the personal and professional abilities of representatives of
   the political elite arises from the peculiarities of the current
   situation and from the demand of the population for specific qualities.
   An assessment of the current crisis situation has shown that
   psychological threats are largely rooted in the consciousness and
   behavior of the political elite itself. Accordingly, the
   recommendations, first of all, imply serious work with its
   representatives, especially with the young. They need to be trained to
   develop leadership skills, the formation of reflective thinking, the
   ability to develop long-term strategies.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2022},
Number = {29},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the reception of natural disasters in Baroque
   lyric poetry and aims to show the proximity between prose and verse in
   Southern Italy's literary output. Through the analysis of three poems
   from the second half of the 17th century and their comparison with a
   scientific ``discourse{''} by Tommaso Cornelio-on a solar eclipse in
   1652-, it is possible to reveal not only similarities in the narrative
   structure of these texts, but also the use of the same images and the
   same lexicon. This study, which allows us to delve further into the
   relationship between science and poetry during the 17th century,
   outlines a poetic product that was very widespread in the Spanish
   Viceroyalty of Naples: the poetry of disaster. The demonstration also
   underlines that the poetry of disasters is the fruit of Neapolitan
   scientifical knowledge, as well as the particular product of a territory
   frequently struck by natural disasters.},

Abstract = {Wars do not fall from the sky. They have a pre-history. The
   constellation for a conflict consists of various factors involving
   domestic politics, foreign policy, and international relations. In the
   case of Russia's war on Ukraine, the Putin regime's radicalization into
   autocracy and its dissociation from the West combined with Ukraine's
   simultaneous democratisation and increasingly Western orientation are
   the central factors that explain the conflict's dynamics, made the
   outbreak of war more likely, and influence the dynamics of warfare as

Abstract = {This article aims to present a comprehensive analysis of study-related
   migration of Moldovan ethnics from the Transnistrian region, also known
   as a post-Soviet unrecognized entity. The Transnistrian region is a
   narrow strip of land located between Ukraine and the Republic of
   Moldova, which is affected by massive migration flows. The young people
   of the Transnistrian region are inclined to migrate permanently to
   neighbouring countries and Western EU member states. Nevertheless, the
   phenomenon of migration from the disputed land is an under-researched
   topic. Therefore, this study aims to determine the particularities of
   this phenomenon, the main root causes and the perception of students
   concerning studies abroad, life in a disputed territory, and the impact
   of the unresolved status issue. The research is based on a two-pronged
   approach in order to determine the complexity and the magnitude of
   study-related migration. It presents the results of 20 semi-structured
   interviews conducted with students who graduated from
   Moldovan-administered Latin-script schools and it analyses the data
   provided by Transnistrian and Moldovan institutions. A special attention
   is given to graduates of Romanian language schools because their
   decision to migrate is influenced by a more diverse combination of push
   and pull factors.},

Title = {The War in Ukraine: Implications for the Africa-Europe Peace and
   Security Partnership},
Journal = {STRATEGIC REVIEW FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {93-110},
Abstract = {This paper discusses the war in Ukraine and what the EU's increasing
   preoccupation with it means for the EU-Africa peace and security
   partnership. It does this from the angle of a new EU funding mechanism,
   the European Peace Facility (EPF), which is a (sic)5.6 billion fund that
   came into effect in March 2021 to support conflict management and
   international security during the EU's seven-year budget period (2021 to
   2027). The facility funds a variety of activities globally and-for the
   first time in the EU's history-provides a legal basis for the EU to
   provide not only technical and material support but also lethal weapons
   to partner countries. As of May 2022, the EU has pledged to provide
   (sic)2 billion to support Ukraine's armed forces aside from the
   unprecedented economic sanctions the EU has imposed on Russia.
   The creation of the EPF is inspired by the EU's ambitious Global
   Strategy of 2016 (EEAS 2016) and the preceding policy discourse between
   the EU and its member states on making the EU a ``global player{''} and
   not just a ``global payer{''}. This shift is partly a response to the
   emerging international geopolitical order in which the EU feels the need
   to assert itself and defend its interests globally. This marks a radical
   paradigm shift in EU foreign policy.
   The paper argues that the EU's evolving foreign policy and its
   unforeseen use of EPF funds in Ukraine have at least two implications
   for Africa. First, the use of the EPF in Ukraine raises questions about
   the availability of funds for African peace support operations, which
   the EU has been supporting for some years. It raises also questions
   about the way Europe and Africa will decide about funding African
   security priorities. The EPF allows the transferring of funds and
   equipment to partner countries or regional coalitions directly, without
   the need to go through established regional organisations like the AU.
   Second, the EU's changing security interests and geopolitical ambitions
   as well as Africa's aspirations to find its place in the new global
   order could alter the dynamics of the EU-Africa peace and security
   partnership. While the EU remains an important economic and security
   actor in Africa-at the bilateral and continental levels-the EU-Africa
   partnership struggles to thrive and go beyond money to live up to its
   full potential.
   To meet their own aspirations, the paper argues that the AU and its
   member states will have to work harder to reduce their financial,
   security and economic dependence on non-African states. The AU and its
   member states will also have to avoid getting trapped in geopolitical
   confrontations between ``the east{''} and ``the west{''}. At the same
   time, they need to summon the political leadership the continent needs
   to prevent and manage internal political crises and conflicts on the
   continent while reducing interference from different international
   partners.},

Volume = {13},

Pages = {8-30},
Abstract = {The article proposes a systematic assessment of the right to the
   Internet in the context of modern legal and political challenges. The
   authors substantiate the thesis that the right to the Internet is a
   complex category that cannot be considered solely in terms of providing
   technical capabilities and overcoming the digital divide (inequality)
   between different social groups and states. Much more complex and
   important is the consideration of the right to the Internet in the
   context of the corresponding duty of states not to impede the
   possibility of information exchange via the Internet, as well as in the
   plane of the search for a ``golden mean{''} between the right to the
   Internet and natural human rights. The main purpose of the article was
   to determine the main features of the right to the Internet in the
   context of human and civil rights and freedoms and to analyze the main
   manifestations of digital discrimination as a consequence of the digital
   divide. A detailed methodological basis of the article contributed to
   the achievement of the abovementioned purpose. The research was based on
   a systematic method, which made it possible to consider the right to the
   Internet as a complex and dynamically developing legal and political
   category. The authors used functional and logical (deduction, induction
   and analogy) methods, as well as a number of particular scientific
   methods: historical, sociological and statistical. The approach proposed
   in the article to determine the key parameters of the right to the
   Internet was substantiated mainly on the basis of the application of
   comparative legal, formal legal and axiological methods. The methodology
   of the research made it possible to formulate and substantiate the
   conclusion that the right to the Internet in the face of modern legal
   and political challenges is undergoing a qualitative transformation both
   in the direction of expanding the positive obligations of the state to
   overcome the digital divide, and in the direction of restricting the
   right to freedom of Internet communication under the auspices of
   ensuring the right to privacy and the need to respect the public
   interest. The presence of << double standards >> in determining the
   boundaries of the right to the Internet leads to conflicting legal
   decisions and allows us to predict the aggravation of this contradiction
   in the context of the rapid development of digital platforms and the
   active sanction policy of the collective West.},

Pages = {117-138},
Month = {JAN-APR},
Abstract = {The present essay, analyzing Giorgio Agamben's philosophical
   contribution regarding the pandemic and its legal and political
   consequences, proposes a close comparison between the author of Homo
   sacer and Georges Bataille, presented here as Agamben's (mostly occult)
   master alongside the more overtly stated Walter Benjamin and Martin
   Heidegger. It will be argued that Agamben's reading of the pandemic fits
   into his broader philosophical discourse on power, understood as a trans
   -historical continuum in which power and violence stand in a topological
   inside-out relationship from archaic Roman law to Auschwitz and the
   recent administration of the pandemic emergency. According to Agamben,
   this nexus of power and violence can only be defused through
   introflexion, a denial of activity. Agamben's reflection is thus traced
   back to an aristocratic (and reactionary) challenge to the beautiful
   death that echoes Bataille's joy before death. It is a response that
   takes the form of a paradoxical `affirmative tanatopolitics' and that,
   in its genealogical obsession with the arche, forgets the role of rights
   as instruments for fighting oppression and shaping the violence that
   nonetheless always re-emerges, like a remnant and a discard, and peeps
   out from behind the baroque drape that covers the death facade of
   sovereignty.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that the broader legal and extra-legal environment
   matter to understand the set of beliefs and attitudes which condition
   judicial activity and therefore influence the design of judicial
   appointments. Attitudes to the separation of powers are discussed and
   illustrated by the consideration of, in turn: the history of
   appointments to the higher courts, the recent accompanying changes to
   the role of the Lord Chancellor, the changing perception of the
   judiciary in the media and political circles, the present constitutional
   role played by the Supreme Court and the vulnerability of judges to
   politically motivated attacks. In the UK, the consideration of such
   factors points towards rejection of greater involvement of the Lord
   Chancellor in the UK Supreme Court appointments, at least for now or
   until a sense of basic constitutional propriety prevails among all
   political institutions.},

Abstract = {The explosive growth in connected vehicle infrastructures and
   IoT-enabled traffic systems opens the potential for novel societal
   impacts stemming from cyber-attacks on transportation systems.
   Researchers and threat actors have demonstrated that they can gain
   control of safety-critical vehicle functions, compromise poorly
   authenticated third-party apps, as well as modify supervisory control
   and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. This raises the question of where
   policy makers should invest to reduce the most significant consequences
   of a cyberattack on road infrastructure. In this paper, the authors
   develop a network-based approach in conjunction with historical trip
   information to quantify the network impacts of cyberattacks on road
   networks in Washington DC. They find that a highly targeted attack on
   only 10 SCADA-controlled signaling devices at specific locations
   disrupts a third of the most efficient paths in Washington DC. The
   results open the possibility of layered deterrence strategies that
   minimize the disruptive consequences of cyberattacks, thereby reducing
   benefits to attackers.},

Title = {Mortality in times of COVID. Are democracies better at controlling the
   outbreak?},
Journal = {ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The COVID pandemic hit countries around the globe differently. Besides
   the biological and demographic factors, the social norms and
   institutions frame the impact of the health emergency, by instilling
   values and norms helping people to adapt their behavior. Democracy seems
   to be better prepared for facing the health emergency, because of its
   good health outcomes and the ability to cope with disasters, democratic
   governed societies are vulnerable in the face of COVID because of the
   longer life expectancy of their public which plays against democracy, as
   the empirical evidence shows the disease hit mainly old adults. This
   paper inquires whether democratic societies still have an advantage in
   dealing with the COVID crisis, proving with empirical data that COVID
   mortality is lower in highly advanced democracies.},

Abstract = {The increased commission of sex crimes in Iran highlights the need for
   more efforts to design strategies towards prevention and reduction of
   such crimes. Accordingly, the present research aimed to identify the
   factors affecting the sexual victimization of children and adolescents
   as well as to identify the personality characteristics of sex
   delinquents in the criminal justice system of Iran. The research method
   is mixed design in terms of data nature (qualitative and quantitative)
   and practical in terms of purpose. The qualitative section has reviewed
   the previous literature and the quantitative section has benefited from
   the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). This research has used the
   opinions of 13 experts in the field of crimes against children and
   adolescents, and 43 sex offenders. The research findings led to the
   identification of six factors (social, economic, psychological, legal,
   executive, media) that are effective on the prevention and postvention
   of sexually abused children and adolescents in Iran. The highest rank is
   related to the economic and social factors, and the lowest rank is
   related to the media factors. The results of this study showed that the
   identified parameters are approved by experts and have theoretical
   support that can be effective in reducing sexual delinquency.},

Title = {INTERNET FRAGMENTATION AND THE FORMATION OF DIGITAL BORDERS: AN ANALYSIS
   FROM THE STANDPOINT OF CRITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2022},
Number = {2},
Pages = {8-21},
Abstract = {In recent years, the number of scientific publications devoted to the
   fragmentation of the Internet has been increasing; specialized terms
   such as ``Internet Balkanization{''} and ``Divided Internet{''} have
   appeared to describe the new state of the de-globalized information
   space. As a rule, this process is associated with the emergence of
   digital boundaries on the Internet. At the same time, according to
   statistics, the volume of data crossing the borders of states continues
   to grow. Thus, information globalization at the data level coexists with
   the strengthening of digital boundaries and attempts to strengthen
   digital sovereignty. Critical geography allows us to study digital
   boundaries not only as material objects, but also as social constructs,
   discursive practices that reflect the nature of power relations in the
   international arena and are a source of power for those who create and
   control them. According to critical geography, digital borders, due to
   their social nature, are not impenetrable and the construction of
   digital borders, therefore, does not mean the end of information
   globalization. The article identifies two levels of digital boundaries -
   discursive and ontological. At the discursive level, they reflect the
   securitization of the information sphere and the transformation of the
   balance of power, the formation of multipolarity, and at the ontological
   level, they are designed primarily to protect against threats to
   information security. At the same time, states are interested in the
   benefits that the global connected Internet provides. Its connectivity
   is boosted by businesses, which act as the subject of the formation of
   new global digital spaces, contributing to the globalization of the
   market in order to increase profits.},

Abstract = {This article contends that sexism plays a fundamental role in the
   electoral rise of the far right, both as a predisposition and as a
   changing attitude. Using panel data from Spain, we show that modern
   sexism is indeed among the most important attitudinal predictors of
   voting for the far-right party Vox. The results also show that internal
   individual changes in levels of modern sexism impact far-right voting.
   Backlash attitudinal change, defined as increases in sexism occurring in
   a context of feminist momentum, contributed significantly to the recent
   emergence of the radical right. Our findings indicate that sexism is not
   a crystalized attitude but rather susceptible to showing short-term
   changes with important political consequences. This highlights the
   importance of understudied context-dependent individual dynamics of
   gender backlash in far-right voting.},

Abstract = {The United States, EU members, and Russia share extensive and important
   interests in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) in terms of geo-security,
   energy, and values. The US-EU-Russia trilateral interaction in this
   region features three characteristics: intensifying security competition
   between Washington and Moscow; closer transatlantic coordination against
   Russia; and growing wariness about China's larger economic footprint.
   New changes have taken place in the regional distribution of power amid
   continued China-US competition, increasingly diverging values among the
   United States, Germany, and CEE countries like Poland and Hungary, and
   heightening geopolitical tensions between Washington and Germany on the
   one hand and Russia on the other. China-CEEC (CEE countries) cooperation
   is also coming under mounting geopolitical pressure, owing to
   Washington's containment policy toward China, the EU's weakening control
   over the CEE countries, Russia's shift from a defensive to an offensive
   posture in response to Western sanctions, the new German government's
   values-based diplomacy, and the European Commission's new China policy.
   However, the transatlantic world is not a monolith. The EU's weakening
   control over CEE countries and Washington's deteriorating relations with
   Poland and Hungary are bringing potential opportunities for furthering
   China-CEEC cooperation. The aforementioned factors merit closer
   attention as important variables in CEE countries' China policies.},

Abstract = {This article makes a contribution, based on previously unseen archival
   materials, to debates about the so-called `decline' of black cricket in
   England. It discusses the historical context of the development of black
   cricket in the postwar period and presents a case study of the Haringey
   Cricket College-1984-1997-a black-led project in and around the deprived
   areas of Tottenham, north London, which, during the period of its
   existence, produced more first class cricketers than many of the most
   expensive, elite `cricket schools' in England. In so doing, it achieved
   national and international acclaim. The article goes on to provide
   detailed evidence regarding the closure of the college, arguing that the
   college's demise should not be seen simply as part of a wider process of
   decreasing interest in cricket within England's black communities, but
   involved active decisions by the cricket establishment not to support
   the college. The article raises wider questions about when and how it
   has been possible to be perceived as legitimately black and English in
   cricketing terms, and how cricket's authorities should respond to these
   historical problems.},

   and Constitutional Implications},

Abstract = {The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a possible postponement of the
   2021 South African local government elections is analysed. The question
   was whether a court of law could constitutionally postpone the election
   and if so, would such a postponement constitute a legal amendment of the
   Constitution? In a brief literature review, four themes were identified,
   namely the `unamendability' of a constitution, unconstitutional
   constitutional amendments, the `basic structure' of constitutions'
   doctrine and the `implicit limitations' on amendments doctrine. The
   Electoral Commission of SA appointed the Moseneke inquiry for advice on
   whether the election will be free and fair while subject to the pandemic
   regulations. It recommended an election postponement beyond the
   constitutional time-limits which was tested by the Constitutional Court.
   The Court did not allow for a postponement but insisted on additional
   voter registrations. The conclusions are that the judiciary regarded
   `regular elections' as a more binding constitutional principle than
   `free and fair elections'. Judicial amendments of the Constitution would
   be possible only in exceptional cases, which excluded the pandemic. The
   positive public perceptions about the election are qualified by a lower
   voter turnout, which results in compromising the quality of South
   Africa's democracy, but only temporarily.},

Abstract = {Associative issue ownership (AIO) has proven its value in describing
   issue competition and explaining voting behavior. Yet, it is unclear
   whether and to what extent AIO also differentiates parties and
   influences vote choice in highly fragmented, multiparty systems. In such
   a context, parties must differentiate from many electoral competitors,
   which makes AIO worth pursuing. At the same time, obtaining unequivocal
   ownership may be a very difficult endeavor in the face of so many
   rivals. This paper aims to assess these questions empirically by
   employing the Dutch Parliamentary Election Study 2021 on a system with
   17 elected parties (ENPP = 8). At the aggregate level, we find
   unequivocal issue ownership for 4 of the 14 issues under study. AIO of
   most other issues is contested, either by parties with very similar
   policy positions (within-block competition) or by parties with opposing
   positions (between-block competition). A final set of issues remain
   unclaimed. At the individual level, perceptions of issue ownership
   explain the composition of voters' party consideration sets
   (pre-elections) and their actual vote choice (post-elections). These
   impacts are stronger when voters associate the party with an issue they
   find important. We conclude that AIO perceptions are an important factor
   to consider when studying party dynamics and voting behavior in a
   context of highly fragmented multipartyism.},

Abstract = {As the public, policymakers, and scholars increasingly call for police
   reform, one commonly proposed solution is to increase the number of
   female officers and leaders under the assumption that female police will
   be perceived as more trustworthy, less violent, and more effective at
   addressing gendered crimes. Using a survey experiment, we explore
   whether there is a link between passive representation in police
   leadership and civilians' perceptions of substantive representation by
   the police. We argue that due to feminine stereotypes and role congruity
   theory, female police chiefs should be perceived as more effective at
   addressing gendered crimes, corruption, police brutality, and community
   relations, but be evaluated as less competent on addressing violent
   crimes. We find that female police chiefs are considered to be more
   competent at handling gendered crimes (with little relationship with
   non-gendered crimes), and are viewed as more able to address corruption,
   police brutality, and community relations. Female police chiefs are also
   more likely to receive higher levels of overall support. We emphasize
   that our study points to the importance of passive representation within
   police leadership, but caution that increasing women's representation
   may be a necessary, but not sufficient condition to improve relations
   between the public and the police.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to investigate the important role that
   the topic of time occupies both in terms of the individual ` s
   subjective experience and in its historical dimension, in Pierre
   Bourdieu ` s sociology. The way in which Bourdieu understands the
   relationship between temporary structures and socio-economic
   institutions is essential to understand the way in which, both
   individuals and societies, relate to each other and conceive their own
   future. These approaches constitute an interesting contribution to
   thinking about the temporality forms representative of our time.},

Abstract = {Historical events, however terrible, are not in and of themselves
   traumatic. For a trauma to emerge at the level of a collectivity,
   `social crises must be-come cultural crises' (Alexander et al., 2004, p.
   10). For an historical event to become a cultural trauma, it must be
   socially mediated and represented, a trauma narrative must be
   constructed. Consequently, there is always a gap between the
   traumatogenic event and its representation, this gap creates the space
   for the `trauma process'. Unlike trauma theory, therefore, cultural
   trau-ma places the weight of analysis not on the historical event as
   such but on the narrative struggle that constitutes and sustains that
   event as a cultural trauma. Thus, we have a series of interrelated
   terms: history, trauma, narrative and memory, that pivot around an
   absent presence, a traumatogenic event. It is the nature of that
   traumatogenic event that I explore in this paper. First, I will set out
   my theoretical differences from trauma theory and then attempt to square
   the circle between a non-pathological conception of trauma in cultural
   trauma theory and my own commitment to psychoanalysis. In conclusion I
   will put forward a number of claims that I hope will be consistent with
   cultural trauma theory. That is to say, the traumatogenic event is not
   given but is retrospec-tively constructed and in this sense is
   ahistorical and non-narrative.},

Abstract = {Drawing on a subset of 30 farmworkers from the community-driven Oregon
   COVID-19 Farmworker Study, the paper examines how farmworkers
   interpreted and contested the contradictory label essential worker.
   Using discourse analysis, the article finds institutional recognition
   helped farmworkers assert a historically informed Campesino immigrant
   worker identity as a strategy to challenge their racialization and
   politicization in and out of the workplace. The participatory research
   methods based on trust engendered new perspectives among farmworkers who
   disrupted narratives of essentiality by highlighting contradictions
   between indispensable labeling and disposable treatment on the ground.
   In adjunct, Campesinos galvanized grievances about constraining webs of
   immigration and labor policies that lead to social and economic everyday
   devaluation, exposure, and dehumanization. Farmworkers referenced their
   body and labor contributions working throughout the pandemic to contest
   their wages, treatment, lack of protection in the workplace, and
   illegality. Results suggest the need to invite a historical
   understanding of the marginalization food chain workers experince and
   how is reproduced in today's commodified food systems transnationally.
   This study contributes to growing studies exploring the epistemological
   implication of labeling workers as essential through the perspectives
   and interpretations of farmworkers themselves and ends with practical
   implications.},

Abstract = {When do governments adopt ambitious climate policy? Charting the
   theoretical territory between climate change politics and long-term
   policymaking, this paper highlights the role of electoral competition in
   shaping how politicians respond to the intertemporal tradeoff of one
   important climate change mitigation policy: fossil fuel taxation. The
   more secure the government is in office, the more insulated it is from
   the vagaries of political competition, and the more likely it is to
   impose costs on constituents today to generate a future stable climate.
   By influencing governments' time preferences, competition structures the
   myopia of elected officials. I test the arguments using an original
   dataset of gasoline taxation across high-income democracies between 1988
   and 2013. I find evidence that higher levels of electoral competition
   are associated with lower gasoline tax rates, and that the relationship
   is moderated by the level of costs imposed on voters, but not government
   partisanship. More generally, the analysis highlights when governments
   can increase consumer prices to address long-term challenges.},

Abstract = {This paper harnesses the strengths of the recent affective turn in
   citizenship studies. It makes three contributions to the literature.
   First, against proponents and critics of neoliberalism who neglect the
   reinventions of citizenship under `neoliberalism', it emphasises the
   politics of hope advanced by socially excluded people. Second, while
   sympathetic to the affective turn in citizenship it addresses what it
   believes to be its key limitations: a neglect of the care people expect
   from the state and the feelings of solidarity that remain central to
   citizenship. Third, by reflecting on the experience of neighbourhood in
   Sao Paulo, the paper challenges the overwhelming focus of the affective
   citizenship literature on the Global North by drawing on perspectives
   from a key city in the Global South.},

Abstract = {Community policing, and citizen cooperation with law enforcement more
   broadly, can improve local security outcomes by providing decentralized
   mechanisms for police accountability to local citizens. We hypothesize
   that five factors-alignment of citizen/police interests, relative costs
   of cooperation, costs of crime, prevalence of others' cooperation, and
   perceived police efficacy-comprise a decision framework that guides
   citizens' choices regarding whether to share information with law
   enforcement. We find evidence for this framework using rich survey and
   survey experimental data from a large nation-wide survey of Guatemalans
   and municipal administrative data. Our results indicate that increasing
   police efficacy, witness protection, and neighborhood trust boost the
   odds of cooperation with police by up to 55\%. At a time when
   conversations about the relationship between community and police are
   widespread, this research offers insights into conditions under which
   cooperation between community members and law enforcement is most likely
   to occur.},

Abstract = {Although central bank independence is a core tenet of monetary
   policy-making, it remains politically contested: In many emerging
   markets, populist governments are in frequent public conflict with the
   central bank. At other times, the same governments profess to respect
   the monetary authority's independence. We model this conflict drawing on
   the crisis bargaining literature. Our model predicts that populist
   politicians will often bring a nominally independent central bank to
   heel without having to change its legal status. To provide evidence, we
   build a new data set of public pressure on central banks by classifying
   over 9000 analyst reports using machine learning. We find that populist
   politicians are more likely than non-populists to exert public pressure
   on the central bank, unless checked by financial markets, and also more
   likely to obtain interest rate concessions. Our findings underscore that
   de jure does not equal de facto central bank independence in the face of
   populist pressures.},

Abstract = {Discussing An Outline of a Theory of Civilization by the Japanese
   thinker Fukuzawa Yukichi, this essay shows how theorists of liberal
   nationalism might draw on ``non-Western{''} theoretical resources to
   enrich their normative ideas and better appreciate their own tradition.
   I argue that Fukuzawa's work represents an alternative strand of liberal
   nationalism that complements its mainstream counterpart pioneered by
   David Miller, Yael Tamir, and others. More specifically, I argue that
   Fukuzawa's contributions help us reconsider three central claims made by
   his more mainstream peers: (1) cosmopolitanism poses the most important
   threat to liberal nationalism, (2) the strength of liberal nationalism
   lies in its perceptiveness about ordinary people's sense of national
   belonging, and (3) liberal nationalism emerged in mid-nineteenth-century
   Europe and spread elsewhere in the age of decolonization. In so doing, I
   show how the current ``comparative turn{''} in political theory can
   benefit a specific debate-on liberal nationalism-within the discipline.},

Abstract = {We suggest a new democratic decision-making (or recommendation-making)
   device for divided societies that may be added to the democratic
   toolkit. Imaginative Policy Surveys in divided societies seek to combine
   the advantages of conventional attitude surveys (ability to generalise
   to the wider population) with some of the advantages of deliberative
   mini-publics (citizens learn about policy options and consider the
   perspective of members of the ethno-national out-group). Imaginative
   Policy Surveys consist of a conventional survey design with two added
   features: videos providing information and arguments and an imagined
   policy dialogue with an out-group member. We test the feasibility,
   effect and perceived legitimacy of Imaginative Policy Surveys in the
   deeply divided context of Northern Ireland, drawing on evidence from two
   experiments. We conclude that Imaginative Policy Surveys in divided
   societies are feasible, have a slight positive pro-compromise effect,
   and are perceived to be a legitimate decision-making mechanism to an
   equal extent by rival ethno-national groups.},

Title = {Middle power and power asymmetry: how South Korea's free trade agreement

Abstract = {The political economy literature extensively discusses how great powers
   use asymmetric power relations as a tool in trade negotiations, yet
   discussion regarding how asymmetric power relations can account for the
   variety of power asymmetry dynamics in international relations,
   especially in the cases of middle power countries such as South Korea,
   is scarce. This paper examines how South Korea's free trade agreement
   (FTA) strategies with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
   were enabled under the Moon Jae-in administration's New Southern Policy
   (NSP) by analyzing the sources of South Korea's power asymmetry with
   ASEAN. Understanding power asymmetry as an evolving process, this paper
   takes the constructivist approach to middle power to demonstrate how
   South Korea's development of a middle power identity shaped the
   country's negotiation leverage in trade negotiations. This enabled South
   Korea to secure in-depth FTAs with ASEAN at the bilateral level under
   the NSP, despite ASEAN members' initial reluctance.},

Abstract = {For decades, scholars have argued that low and declining political trust
   affect citizens' support for democratic and undemocratic reform. While
   some theorized that low political trust induces alienation and support
   for non-democratic decision making, others argued that it pushes
   critical citizens to support reforms aimed to reinvigorate democracy.
   Yet, empirical tests of these expectations remained sparse and
   inconclusive. This paper employs panel data from the Netherlands
   (covering 3 waves in 3 years) to test these diverging theories
   simultaneously. We employ the random effects within-between (REWB) model
   to differentiate between the effects of structurally low and declining
   political trust. Our results suggest that low and declining trust both
   diminish support for representative democracy, enhance support for
   direct democratic decision making and do not affect support for
   authoritarianism. These findings cast doubt on the understanding of
   political distrust as a determinant of political alienation. Rather,
   they support theories of critical citizenship and stealth democracy.},

Abstract = {Comparative politics in Croatia has had two phases of development:
   initial development and institutionalization. Since its establishment in
   1962, the Fa-culty of Political Sciences in Zagreb has been the main
   scientific and higher education institution for political science in
   Croatia, and the development and institutionalization of comparative
   politics in Croatian political science were primarily carried out there.
   In the first four decades of the Faculty's existence, there were
   sporadic researches and publications of scientific papers on foreign
   policies, and we consider that period as the phase of the initial
   development of comparative politics. The establishment of the Department
   of Comparative Politics at the Faculty in 2004 marked the beginning of
   the systematic work on further development of comparative politics
   through scientific research and teaching of this subdiscipline in the
   study program of political science. This enabled the
   institutionalization of the subdiscipline, and we analyse it using
   Gabriela Ilonszki's theoretical concept with five institutionalization
   proper-ties: identity, autonomy, reproduction, legitimacy and stability.
   Based on this analysis, we make conclusions about the state of
   comparative politics at the Faculty of Political Science in Zagreb in
   2022, 60 years after the establish-ment of the Faculty and 18 years
   after the establishment of the Department.},

Abstract = {We analyze the determinants of fair Bolsonaro's electoral victory in the
   brazilian presidential election in 2018, through the description of his
   political trajectory and electoral campaign, a theoretical discussion
   and data analysis. A quantitative technique is used for a multivariate
   analysis of data extracted from the 2018 Brazilian Electoral Survey. We
   show that the predilection for authoritarian political regimes, the
   antipetism, the identification with right wing ideology and evangelical
   religious affiliation were characteristics positively associated with
   the vote for Bolsonaro. This research prioritizes the contextual
   approach to the political phenomenon, by conditioning the theoretical
   discussion to the reading of the context, and its data analysis provides
   robust evidence on the factors that explain the transformation of a
   politician formerly recognized as ``low clergy{''} into chief of the
   federal executive branch.},

Title = {`To Make a People Out of a Mere Population': Sovereignty and

Journal = {RUSSIAN POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {555-580},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The paper claims that contemporary Russian cultural policy has been
   determined by political transformations associated with the political
   project to establish sovereignty that has organized Putin's regime since
   2012. The idea behind it is traced to Putin's 2006 intention `to make a
   people out of a mere population'. To understand that inten-tion, and to
   explain the contribution of culture and cultural policy to its
   concretiza-tion, the paper draws on Foucault's account of sovereignty
   and governmentality, and the development of the Gramscian notion of
   hegemony. The paper argues that Putin's regime uses governmentality in
   its hegemonic project to establish sovereignty. To describe that
   project, and the contribution of culture and cultural policy to it, the
   paper presents evidence of the relation between Putin's political
   actions and changes in the structure of Russian state and government,
   Russian culture, and the cultural policy infrastructure. The paper
   begins with a discussion of the draft Concept of cul-ture introduced in
   2018 and concludes with an examination of its fate in order to raise the

Abstract = {The main aim of the paper is to provide a chronological overview of the
   de-velopment and history of the study of journalism at the Faculty of
   Political Science from its foundation in 1970 to the present day. Four
   key periods are identified in the paper, i.e.: 1) the one-year and
   two-year study period; 2) the four-year study period; 3) the period of
   implementation of practical work in journalism studies; 4) the period of
   implementation of the Bologna reform. The paper relies on records,
   published texts and transcripts of conversations with professors of
   political science and journalism who, in various ways, par-ticipated in
   the development of this study at the Faculty of Political Sciences,
   which now spans more than 50 years. The main part of the work is focused
   on recording the facts that were relevant for upgrading the study of
   journalism and what the study is today in the Croatian context. This
   paper confirms that the only constant in the development of the study of
   journalism is the constant re-examination of the conception and reform
   thereof as extensively as possible. Digital technology requires quick
   response, knowledge and skills, but the concern for fair access to the
   journalism profes-sion has remained the same throughout the decades.},

Title = {Ideological Talk, Strategic Vote: German Parties' Positions on the
   Military Intervention in Afghanistan in Parliament},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Existing literature has examined party positions on several military
   interventions across various countries, mostly using manifestos and
   expert surveys as sources of data. This article employs a different
   approach by analysing German parties' positions on one mission only: the
   Afghanistan intervention (2001-2021). We extract positions from
   parliamentary speeches through the automated text scaling method
   Wordfish and compare them with voting data to check public speech
   against behaviour. We find that moderate parties were more in favour of
   the intervention than extreme parties. We also highlight the presence of
   a strong government/opposition conflict. This dynamic was amplified in
   the votes as both government and opposition parties have more incentives
   to act strategically, while surprisingly, we find little evidence of
   differences in positioning across missions. Other than being the first
   comprehensive assessment of parties' positions on the intervention in
   Afghanistan in any country, this article offers a methodological
   contribution to the study of the party politics of peace and security
   operations.},

Abstract = {The relationship between economic inequality and political support is
   not well established in previous empirical studies in part because
   people commonly misperceive the level of economic inequality. Moreover,
   people perceiving high economic inequality may not oppose the incumbent
   government or political regime because they consider the inequality
   fair. To better capture the political outcomes of economic inequality,
   we investigate the effects of perceived distributive unfairness on
   regime support. Using data collected from the fourth wave of Asian
   Barometer Survey (2014-2016), we find that perceived unfairness
   decreases support for the current political regime. We further examine
   three mechanisms through which distributive unfairness dampens regime
   support: changes of political value orientation, redistribution demand,
   and social trust. We find that political value orientation plays a
   greater mediating role than redistribution demand and social trust,
   meaning that distributive unfairness depresses regime support largely
   through its erosive impact on citizens' affective identification with
   authoritarian values that underpin regime support in East Asian
   societies. Moreover, we find that distributive unfairness is more
   detrimental to regime support in autocracies and lower-income groups.
   Our study corroborates the importance of distributive fairness for
   regime legitimacy and highlights the vulnerability of autocracies to
   distributive unfairness.},

Title = {Does gendered representation in national legislatures promote
   substantive representation and human development? Evidence from the
   developing world},

Abstract = {Despite the increase in the share of women in national legislatures in
   the developing world, scholars are still debating if gender-diversified
   legislatures promote women-friendly policies or negate women's
   empowerment attributed to intersectional demands, the absence of a
   critical mass, and continued gendered patriarchy. Previous studies also
   lack generalizability as they are based on single-country studies or
   cross-national research with samples restricted by region or constrained
   to affluent nation-states. To resolve the conundrum pertaining to
   understanding the nature of substantive representation in the
   non-Western world, a panel study of 64 developing countries from
   2005-2019 is employed. The study finds evidence that increased
   legislative representation by women is positively associated with the
   implementation of policies that promote higher levels of gender
   equality, social inclusion, and human development. The results imply
   that women's legislative presence in the global south has significant
   contributions in terms of affecting policy outcomes that improve the
   human condition.},

Abstract = {In this article, I present the potential of using a radical feminist
   approach to empowerment as an analytical framework in federal studies.
   To do so, I develop an analytical framework that is part of the fourth
   wave of gender and federalism studies that focuses on the interactions
   between embedded oppressions and federal arrangements (institutions,
   practices, discourses). I study the empowerment processes of farmers who
   protested against the implementation of new agricultural laws in India
   in late 2020. Through this case, I first illustrate how federalism
   contributes to the fragmentation of marginalized groups, while raising
   the need to build federal arrangements from local realities, ecosystems
   and environments. I then show how a radical feminist conception of
   empowerment can change analytical perspectives in federal studies and
   make visible structures that perpetuate interlocking oppressions within
   a federation.},

Abstract = {We identify in-person early voting and no-excuse mail voting as
   antidotes for the depressing effect inclement weather has on voter
   turnout and the Republican dividend that accompanies rain and snow on
   Election Day. We offer and test an explanation for how voters utilize
   early voting to anticipate and avoid the costs of voting in bad weather.
   Replicating and extending Gomez et al (2007) analysis through the 2016
   election, we confirm the remedial effect in-person early voting and to a
   lesser degree no-excuse mail voting has on turnout and the Republican
   advantage when bad weather coincides with Election Day. Our work makes
   an important contribution to understanding how election laws effect
   voter participation. We discuss how taking seriously treatment effect
   heterogeneity both in theoretical and empirical analyses might
   contribute to our understanding of the effects of election laws on voter
   participation.},

   Latin America},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {80},

Abstract = {In Latin America, corruption often fails to turn voters against
   incumbents at the ballot box. We build on existing studies asking why
   and argue that voters are more likely not to reelect an incumbent with
   poor corruption performance when they have an ideologically viable
   opposition alternative. We test this with AmericasBarometer survey data
   for eighteen Latin American countries from 2008 to 2014. We find that
   respondents who are ideologically close to the incumbent are more likely
   to intend to vote against corruption when they are ideo-logically
   proximate to an opposition alternative. We corroborate these findings
   and demonstrate causality in the relationship with a survey experiment
   in Mexico. We conclude that the existence of an ideologically viable
   alternative increases voters' probability of voting against incumbents
   perceived to be involved in corruption.},

Title = {Designing advisory councils to do what? Analysing the most common

Abstract = {Advisory councils (ACs) are one of the most common participatory
   institutions, aimed to provide authorities with a forum to consult the
   organized groups at a given territorial or sectoral level. Although they
   constitute permanent spaces for civic participation, they remain
   overlooked. This work systematically analyses ACs from a large-N
   perspective that goes beyond the best-cases approach. The article
   initially reflects on the role and expected benefits of ACs, identifying
   three important design choices: organizational structure, objectives,
   and accountability channels. Then, the article maps 2,013 ACs in Spain
   and develops a descriptive analysis relying on an original database
   obtained from the study of official regulations and web pages of 70 ACs.
   Our first goal is to describe ACs. Secondly, a good picture of these
   councils sets the foundation for discussing their performance in terms
   of inclusiveness, impact in policy-making and democratic control.
   Combining different statistical techniques the article shows that: (1)
   ACs present diverse design features; (2) these characteristics enable
   the generation of typologies of ACs; and (3) having the explicit goal of
   influencing public policies positively correlates with being an
   empowered council. These findings connect with the broader debate on
   participatory governance.},

Abstract = {This article supplements the familiar picture of Plato as a critic of
   democracy by reconstructing a Platonic theory of appropriate mass
   participatory politics. Plato's Laws offer a theory of how to evaluate
   collective institutions and group practices; an analysis of the
   conditions for collective action; and principles for the design of
   electoral institutions and other forms of mass participation. The
   central claim is that groups and associations, organized around any
   collective activity whatsoever, must be properly ruled (the necessity of
   rule principle {[}NRP]). The principle is developed and tested through
   the Stranger's analysis and qualified defense of drinking parties, which
   the dialogue connects to democracy. But Plato's democratic turn is
   limited. When the Stranger applies NRP to mass political participation,
   it yields a novel justification of open (nonsecret) voting, centered on
   how such procedures might foster coordination around the judgments of
   leading citizens rather than the judgments of the many.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Prosecutors have immense discretion to determine which offenses to
   charge, which cases to take to trial, and which sentences to recommend.
   Yet, even though many of the prosecutors who exercise this discretion
   over important crimes must face the electorate to keep their jobs, we
   know little about how the use of this discretion affects prosecutors'
   electoral fortunes. Drawing on two experiments embedded in a nationally
   representative survey, we demonstrate that the public is more supportive
   of prosecutors who issue lenient sentences for low-level crimes. The
   results have important implications for criminal justice reform inasmuch
   as they provide a linkage between progressive prosecutorial behavior and
   respondents' vote intentions.},

Abstract = {Our personalities affect how we understand the political world, but
   research to date has focused almost exclusively on democratic contexts.
   How is personality related to political attitudes and behavior in
   authoritarian systems? Three original surveys of Chinese citizens
   (N-study1=2,024, N-study2=3,573, N-study3=1,986) show that discontented
   citizens in contemporary China are more fearful, disagreeable, and
   introverted, lacking close emotional attachments to others. Conversely,
   Chinese Communist Party members show high levels of extraversion and
   other traits associated with personal and professional success. These
   findings suggest a social element to regime support. China's most
   dissatisfied citizens operate at the fringes of society, which may
   contribute to the durability of authoritarian rule in the country.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of macro-economic conditions on
   partisan policymaking through an analysis of novel data on the
   fulfilment of 2412 Italian pledges. Are parties able to produce
   ideologically driven policies even during economic downturns? And how
   does the economic context affect parties' capacity to fulfil their
   pledges? In this paper, I contend that the interaction between
   macroeconomic conditions and the policymaking process is more complex
   than it is usually depicted and cannot be restricted to the constraints,
   financial above all, engendered by a recession period. Results from
   binary logistic regressions indeed suggest that parties do maintain a
   certain room for manoeuvre to influence the governing agenda in times of
   crisis. Even though in some cases pledge fulfilment is severely affected
   by deteriorations of economic conditions, parties are still able to
   carry out a large share of their programmatic priorities. Moreover, the
   economic situation mostly challenges left-leaning governments.},

Abstract = {This study analyses a mechanism to explain how internal mobility in the
   dominant party enhances economic performance. We argue that
   authoritarian leaders incentivize their political agents to advance
   economic development by using age-based promotion and retirement rules.
   We empirically examine our theoretical claim using China's cadre
   rejuvenation policy, which rewards younger leaders with more
   opportunities for career advancement. Drawing on panel data for
   prefectural party secretaries who were in office at some point between
   2000 and 2012, we show that the principle of youthful rejuvenation leads
   the Communist Party of China to grant more promotions to party leaders
   who enter office at a younger age than to their older counterparts.
   Under such an incentive scheme, the regions served by younger entrants
   into the officialdom have better economic performance than those served
   by older entrants, holding ability and other regional characteristics
   constant.},

Abstract = {Voting paradoxes date back to the origin of social choice theory in the
   18th century, when the Chevalier de Borda pointed out that
   plurality-then and now the most common voting rule-may elect a candidate
   who loses pairwise majority comparisons against every other candidate.
   Since then, a large number of similar, seemingly paradoxical, phenomena
   have been observed in the literature. As it turns out, many paradoxes
   only materialize under some rather contrived circumstances and require a
   certain number of voters and candidates. In this paper, we leverage
   computational optimization techniques to identify the minimal numbers of
   voters and candidates that are required for the most common voting
   paradoxes to materialize. The resulting compilation of voting paradoxes
   may serve as a useful reference to social choice theorists as well as an
   argument for the deployment of certain rules when the numbers of voters
   or candidates are severely restricted.},

Abstract = {Dublin Castle stands as a signifier of both conflict and conciliation
   between Ireland and Britain over recent centuries. On 16 January 2022,
   all of Ireland's mainstream political parties gathered there on the
   centenary of the castle's handover by the last lord lieutenant of
   Ireland, Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent, to the provisional government of
   Ireland led by Michael Collins, which took place after the Dail endorsed
   the 1921 Treaty. Jarlath Kearney, Peter Shirlow and Etain Tannam show
   that a century after that treaty and the partition of the island, the
   facts and themes flowing from that period - particularly ongoing
   identity and culture contests over Northern Ireland's constitutional
   status - remain live. It is essential in managing future challenges that
   British-Irish intergovernmental cooperation thrives and that the
   Belfast/ Good Friday Agreement is implemented robustly. This is not
   simply because of Northern Ireland, but because of the host of
   geopolitical and international security challenges ahead.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Explicit racism in political campaigns is on the rise. Some research
   suggests policy threat and government discrimination are correlated with
   increased political participation, while others find evidence of
   alienation and withdrawal. However, little direct causal evidence exists
   on the effects of inflammatory campaign rhetoric on marginalized groups.
   Using a survey experiment of Latinx Americans, we investigate how
   exposure to racist political attacks shapes a targeted group's political
   engagement. We find that randomized exposure to a stylized campaign
   video critical of immigrants or Latinx people increases vote intention
   and enthusiasm, but does not affect other political actions, such as
   donating and protesting. Increased participation effects are
   concentrated among respondents who report strong Latino identity and low
   political interest. These findings highlight the resilience of minority
   communities who respond to political attacks with political
   mobilization, not avoidance. Together, this causal evidence complements
   previous observational work and shows that mobilization can result not
   just from policy threat and state action, but also from campaign
   rhetoric.},

Abstract = {The primary goal of this investigation is to systematically explore the
   relationship among the students' performance, grades, gender, previous
   experience, and impressions while using Diplomacy, a strategy game, as
   an educational tool. The rationale for this research is the existing and
   commonly expressed concern that such games unfairly disadvantage female
   students due to their lesser exposure to similar games. If such teaching
   methods are to be successfully employed, we must ensure that they are
   well suited, appropriate and, most importantly, fair to all our
   students. To explore this issue, the data collected over 6 years through
   a university course on strategic thinking and from anonymous student
   questionnaires were analyzed and tested for statistically significant
   correlations. The results show that, while male students are more
   experienced in playing similar games, had an easier time understanding
   the rules, and showed stronger engagement, this did not translate into
   considerably better performance or grades and even led to higher levels
   of disappointment with their own performance.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {79},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Are right-wing incumbents punished for failures in public security?
   Partisan accountability models predict greater sanctions for politicians
   who fail to deliver on issues they ``own.{''} According to this logic,
   right-wing incumbents should suffer more from crime spikes. Contrary to
   this expectation, we show that right-wing gov-ernments are not always
   punished for sudden increases in crime just before an election. We take
   advantage of rich local crime data in Chile and Mexico to identify
   places that experienced a crime shock, and use a difference
   -in-differences design to illustrate the heterogeneous electoral effects
   of public security failures. We also provide survey evidence from 18
   Latin American countries to improve the external validity of the main
   findings. We hold that right-wing incumbents' greater electoral
   resilience to crime spikes could be explained by voters attributing
   security failures to exogenous factors or by voters still perceiving
   left-wing and centrist challengers as less competent at addressing
   crime.},

Abstract = {Study examines the results of the 2017 elections to the Czech Chamber of
   Deputies based on the administrative districts of municipalities. Beta
   regression and Seemingly Unrelated Regression models identify main
   determinants of voting for anti-system parties and/or voter absenteeism.
   The results show that the greatest electoral dissatisfaction occurs in
   regions dominated by agriculture and mining industries, particularly the
   former Sudetenland. This territory, emptied after the WWII, was often
   inhabited by people who either were looking for an easy way to gain the
   property left by the displaced Germans or were forced to move there by
   the former communist regime.},

Abstract = {The rise of populism presents a challenge to liberal democracy in
   various countries. This article questions how populist attitudes affect
   the democratic preferences of the electorate. Using representative
   survey data fielded from Turkey in 2019, we first tested the effect of
   populist attitudes on illiberal democratic attitudes. The results show
   the negative impact of populism on support for illiberal democratic
   attitudes. Next, we analyzed which dimension of populism correlates with
   illiberal democratic preferences. Our results pointed to the negative
   influence of the Manichean outlook on preferences concerning democracy.
   Contrary to expectations, as anti-elitist and people-centric attitudes
   increase, support for illiberal democracy decreases. Hence, the relative
   emphasis on different dimensions of populism is likely to shape the net
   balance of its influence on democracy. Electoral alliance preferences
   also shape democracy preferences. The ruling People's Alliance voters
   are more supportive of illiberal democracy than the opposition blocs and
   parties.},

Abstract = {Bobbio's democratic vision warrants scrutiny not simply as a theory of
   procedural democracy, but also for its critical study of political
   ideologies (historical and contemporary) and its ambition to reconcile
   some of their driving ideals. This article draws the attention of
   Anglophone scholars to Bobbio's life-long endeavour to merge the
   competing agendas of liberalism and socialism and thus develop a
   democratic theory capable of merging productively the notions of
   equality, liberty, and justice. Rather than a cross-eyed theory of
   democracy, Bobbio's encapsulated a vigorous attempt to alert rival
   partisans of both the limits and the potential of their respective
   projects. He urged socialists to appreciate the importance of liberal
   institutions and procedures vis-a-vis unconditional celebrations of
   direct democracy; at the same time, he warned liberals about the `broken
   promises' of representative democracy and the oligarchic involution of
   parliamentarism. The article pursues three related goals. It situates
   Bobbio's project in its historical context, charting the ways in which
   the political history of 20th-century Italy and Europe forged his
   ``liberalsocialism{''}. It examines its similarities and differences
   with previous attempts to cross-fertilize the liberal and the socialist
   projects across the Atlantic. It explores its constitutive tensions
   through the lenses of one of its most perceptive interpreters in the
   Anglophone world - Perry Anderson. By doing so, the article seeks to
   provide a nuanced study of Bobbio's democratic vision and shed light on
   its persistent relevance for thinking through the challenges of
   representative democracy in our present.},

Abstract = {Political scientists have long accepted the ``party eras{''} delineation
   of American political history. In this, the first party era (1789-1824)
   is characterized as a proto-democratic period lacking the party
   development and mass electoral engagement necessary to produce
   recognizably modern electoral democracy. This study uses newly available
   constituency-level House of Representatives election returns from the
   Middle Atlantic region to challenge this characterization. These data
   permit detailed study of voter turnout, the party vote and evidence of
   partisanship, geographic patterns of party support, and the effect of
   election rules on party ability to elect representatives. Interpreted in
   light of recent historical scholarship and received theories of party
   emergence, the returns show a more developed, party-centric, and
   competitive electoral politics than previously recognized.},

Abstract = {Little is known about which features of Facebook's interface appeal to
   users of far-right extremist groups, how such features may influence a
   user's interpretation of far-right extremist themes and narratives, and
   how this is being experienced across various nations. This paper looks
   at why certain `Reactions' appealed to users in Australian and Canadian
   far-right groups on Facebook, and how these `Reactions' may have
   characterized user decisions during their interaction with far-right
   extremist themes and narratives. A mixed methods approach has been used
   to conduct a cross-national comparative analysis of three years of
   `Reaction' use across 59 Australian and Canadian far-right extremist
   groups on Facebook (2016-2019). The level of user engagement with
   administrator posts was assessed using `Reactions' and identified themes
   and narratives that generated the most user engagement specific to six
   `Reactions' ((SIC) `Love', (SIC)'Haha', (SIC)'Wow', (SIC)'Sad',
   (SIC)'Angry' and (SIC)'Thankful'). This was paired with an in-depth
   qualitative analysis of the themes and narratives that attracted the
   most user engagement specific to two popular `Reactions' used over time
   ((SIC) `Angry' and (SIC)'Love'). Results highlight (SIC)'Angry' and
   (SIC)'Love' as the two most popular `Reactions' assigned to
   in-group-out-group themes and narratives, with ` algorithms having
   propelled their partnership in these groups.},

Abstract = {In recent years, legislators from both parties have drawn attention for
   their public support or opposition to leading figures within their
   party, such as Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi. Yet we know relatively
   little about the extent to which voters care about members' professed
   loyalty to party leaders, especially when compared to competing
   considerations such as members' policy positions. In two national survey
   experiments, we independently manipulate hypothetical Democratic and
   Republican legislators' ideological reputations and levels of support
   for a leading party figure. Through our experiments and a supplemental
   observational analysis, we find that partisans in the electorate do use
   information about support for or opposition to leading party figures as
   a basis for evaluating members of Congress. At the same time, the
   results reaffirm the importance voters attach to policy and ideological
   factors and suggest these considerations are not overwhelmed by partisan
   loyalty considerations.},

Abstract = {Our study investigates political candidates' networks in the multilevel
   political setting of Belgium. Using Twitter data collected during the
   four months preceding the May 2019 regional, federal and European
   elections, we examine the extent to which network homophily - defined as
   the tendency to interact with similar others - occurs among political
   candidates along parliament, language and party lines. Relying on a
   unique dataset of 20 061 retweets between 935 candidates, we find that
   network interactions are most likely to occur among co-partisans and
   candidates speaking the same language. Candidates campaigning for the
   same parliament also tend to retweet among each other, although this
   tendency is not strong. Overall, the findings confirm the strong divide
   of Belgian politics along language lines and Belgium's `partitocracy' in
   which parties are the main actors in the representation and
   policy-making process.},

Abstract = {There are two main categories of counterterrorism policies: proactive
   and defensive measures. Proactive policies directly target terrorists
   and, by weakening their ability, share public good features. Defensive
   measures, on the other hand, seek to protect a potential target.
   Unilateral defensive measures may induce terrorists to replace one
   target with another, possibly a foreign one, as confirmed by the
   succession of terrorist attacks in the European Union over the last 20
   years. We analyse different institutional frameworks to determine the
   best one for interstate cooperation considering the externationalites of
   various counterterrorism measures. This article highlights the combined
   effect of voter propensity towards defensive policies, certain
   intelligence policies and different institutional scenarios on the
   (in)efficient strategic choice of counterterrorism defensive policies in
   democratic countries, where efficiency means maximising the joint
   welfare of countries. We consider four different institutional
   scenarios: decentralisation, intelligence cooperation, unanimous
   political cooperation and full political union. We model these
   situations as a three-stage signalling game and show that, surprisingly,
   intelligence cooperation increases the probability of efficient
   defensive policies more than unanimous political cooperation.},

Abstract = {The United States took an active role in promoting some countries for a
   United Nations Security Council seat as part of its struggle with the
   Soviet Union during the early Cold War. Did these US-backed countries
   act in the interests of their promoter when they voted in the Council?
   Were these efforts of the United States advantageous? By studying the
   voting behavior of the US-backed countries between 1946 and 1965, this
   article answers the question of whether promoting some states to
   international institutions is beneficial for the great powers.},

Title = {Jumping on the Bandwagon: The Role of Voters' Social Class in Poll
   Effects in the Context of the 2021 German Federal Election},

Abstract = {Published findings of opinion polls are an important part of the
   political coverage before elections. Thus, researchers have long
   investigated whether the perceived popularity of political parties can
   lead to even more voters following this majority. However, empirical
   findings on this so-called political bandwagon effect are mixed. In the
   present paper, we integrate theories from political science and social
   psychology to explain these inconsistencies through social class as a
   potential moderating variable. Based on previous findings regarding
   consumer decisions, we hypothesized that bandwagon effects are greater
   among voters with lower social class. To investigate this hypothesis, we
   combined data from the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) Rolling
   Cross-Section 2021, which was collected over the 55 days before the 2021
   German federal election, with the results of published preelection
   polls. Using separate multilevel models for each of the parties, we
   found no evidence for bandwagon effects. Only for the Social Democratic
   Party were poll results related to voting intentions assessed on the
   following day, suggesting that polls might have contributed to the
   party's electoral success. However, there was no evidence for a
   moderation of bandwagon effects by voters' social class. Accordingly, we
   could not resolve the mixed findings in this field of research. Our
   results point to important open questions in research on bandwagon
   effects in multiparty systems as well as on effects of social class in
   Germany.},

Abstract = {Rising costs and challenges of in-person interviewing have prompted
   major surveys to consider moving online and conducting live web-based
   video interviews. In this paper, we evaluate video mode effects using a
   two-wave experimental design in which respondents were randomized to
   either an interviewer-administered video or interviewer-administered
   in-person survey wave after completing a self-administered online survey
   wave. This design permits testing of both within- and between-subject
   differences across survey modes. Our findings suggest that video
   interviewing is more comparable to in-person interviewing than online
   interviewing across multiple measures of satisficing, social
   desirability, and respondent satisfaction.},

Abstract = {In contemporary democracies, the prevalence of corruption is reinforced
   when citizens tolerate corruption. This study analyzes a particular
   tolerance of corruption: the willingness to pay bribes. We argue that
   tolerance of paying bribes is influenced by people's distrust in the
   political system's integrity. Analyzing public opinion surveys conducted
   in Latin America, we provide evidence that corruption victimization,
   perceptions of political corruption, and political disaffection increase
   the odds of expressing tolerance of corruption.},

Abstract = {Survey research has revealed that post-communist citizens are skeptical
   towards democracy. Despite a substantial body of literature that has
   researched the origins and determinants of these attitudes, consensus
   has not yet emerged. A major challenge has been to distinguish between
   individual support for democracy as an ideal political regime and
   satisfaction with the way democracy is practiced in one's country. Using
   structural equation modeling with latent variables, we improve
   measurement validity and account for feedback effects to better
   understand the relationship between these attitudes. Consistent with our
   performance-based theory, we find that positive assessments of political
   performance drive normative support for democracy. The impact of
   satisfaction with democracy on democratic support suggests that we
   should not rush to view post-communist citizens' mindset as anomalous
   and inherently anti-democratic. Rather, post-communist skepticism of
   democracy might be generalized to contexts characterized by flawed
   implementation and unmet expectations of this form of government.},

Abstract = {Researchers of Russian elections have long noticed that in a number of
   ethnic republics, the level of electoral mobilization and voters'
   political conformism is higher than the average in Russia. Which factors
   influence a high level of electoral mobilization? How does it work? The
   article attempts to answer these questions by analyzing qualitative data
   collected through focus groups in five regions: Bashkortostan,
   Tatarstan, Komi, Chuvashia, and Yakutia. The results of the study allow
   us to conclude that a high level of electoral mobilization is the result
   of a combination of three factors, each of which affects different
   categories of voters.l},

Abstract = {This article considers the recent resignation of Metropolitan Police
   Commissioner, Cressida Dick, and places this event within the context of
   ongoing attempts to address institutional racism in the police. The
   article argues that successive police commissioners have publicly
   supported tackling institutional racism while maintaining serious
   reservations about the concept and, in the case of Dick, ultimately
   rejecting it. It goes on to show that Dick's record on tackling
   institutional racism has been partial and contradictory, focussing on
   recruitment of ethnic minorities whilst simultaneously increasing use of
   stop and search tactics. Institutional racism, I argue, is a useful, but
   frequently misunderstood concept. Institutional reform, however, is
   possible if we recognise that everyday individuals actively create and
   maintain institutions, which is to be contrasted with the conventional
   approach to institutional reform where it is the institution that moulds
   or reforms the individual. As such, reforming the police requires
   starting at the bottom as well as the top.},

Abstract = {The revival of ideologically motivated right-wing political agitation
   across the Western world demands that its intellectual sources be
   discovered. Martin Heidegger has occupied a position among anti-liberal,
   anti-modernist, and anti-Western forces across the globe comparable to
   that of Karl Marx on the socialist Left. Yet scholars still lack the
   conceptual terminology for capturing the political import of his work.
   The recent publication of Heidegger's Black Notebooks provides an
   opportunity for rereading his central political works in order to
   recover their meaning for contemporary political movements. Such a
   rereading also illuminates the sources of Heidegger's remarkable and
   misunderstood influence on the political Right. It thus explains a
   matter of urgent and high importance for generalist political
   scientists.},

   environments. Specifically, this article uses the same course I taught
   during fall 2019 and spring 2020, ``Introduction to Political
   Science,{''} at a private university in Lebanon during a massive social
   uprising, an economic crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic to demonstrate
   the use of the ``three-C approach.{''} It also incorporates student
   feedback on modified assessment models and faculty-student interactions
   to highlight the benefits of the ``three-C approach,{''} especially
   during times of crisis.},

Abstract = {Populism has an ambivalent relationship with liberal democracy. Populist
   leaders often claim power for the people and consider themselves true
   democrats, while their detractors accuse them of being demagogues or
   authoritarians. In the academic literature these two ways of
   understanding populism coexist: as a threat to liberal democracy, or as
   an opportunity for political change that contributes to expanding
   democratic spaces. The aim of this article is to analyze how V-Dem's
   main indices of democracy evolved in the Latin American countries that
   have had governments ascribed to the populist left. We seek to assess
   whether populism is a threat, an aid, or simply a theoretical matter
   without major practical implications for democracy.},

Abstract = {Research has shown that constituents do not evaluate legislators more
   favorably for claiming credit for delivering large grants than for
   delivering tiny ones. It remains unclear whether the observed lack of
   sensitivity to the amount of money claimed reflects indifference to
   grant size or a lack of contextual information. Building on Grimmer et
   al.'s Impression of Influence, we perform a survey experiment in which
   we give respondents information about both the absolute and relative
   size of projects. We find that respondents evaluate legislators more
   favorably for claiming credit for relatively large projects. Our results
   suggest that subjects are responsive to the magnitudes in claims of
   legislative accomplishment when provided a benchmark. We also find that
   subjects are more inclined to punish legislators for delivering grants
   of below average size than they are to reward them for delivering grants
   of above average size, and we discuss possible mechanisms that could
   explain this asymmetric effect.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this paper we review the importance of the work of the German
   philosopher Axel Honneth and the Spanish philosopher Antoni Domenech for
   a project of renewal of socialism. We start by asking: what kind of
   freedom does the socialist project require (social freedom and
   fraternity)? In addressing this problematic we assess the institutional
   conditions of access to the market (property, exploitation, and
   use-values), followed by an exploration of the epistemological dimension
   of the market. In the fourth section, we focus on agents and their
   motivations in the sphere of consumption and the labour market. And,
   finally, we examine the problem of the principal/agent relationship
   through the notion of fiduciary relations.},

Abstract = {This essay explores how the critique of national citizenship has evolved
   over the past 25 years. Specifically, I focus on the literature which
   grew out of Yasemin Soysal's seminal work Limits of Citizenship. Soysal
   argued for a post-national model of membership based on observations
   that rights traditionally associated with citizenship were becoming
   increasingly separated from the nation. I explore how, while some have
   taken up the study of post-national citizenship as a cosmopolitan
   research agenda, many others have subjected this idea to sustained
   critique on the basis that the empirical observations on which it rests
   have not materialised. Indeed, the continued hegemony of the national
   citizenship model suggests that this is not soon to change. However, I
   look to the literature on acts of citizenship, itself a major thread of
   research over the past quarter of a century, to argue that there is
   scope to reclaim post-nationalism as a fruitful lens for the study of
   citizenship-as-practice.},

Abstract = {How did Democrats running for federal office win in Georgia in 2020-21,
   but not in North Carolina, a state long regarded as more
   ``flippable{''}? This article uses newly assembled organizational data
   to situate recent Democratic fortunes in the context of two long-running
   statewide campaigns for racial and economic justice-led by North
   Carolina's Reverend William Barber II and Georgia's Stacey Abrams. We
   track shifting political opportunity structures and the organizational
   and strategic evolution of both movements during the 2010s, with a
   special focus on outreach beyond major metropolitan areas. Our findings
   suggest that social justice campaigns aiming to increase government
   responsiveness to poor minority citizens do better if they engage in
   persistent, locally embedded voter outreach along partisan lines rather
   than heavily relying on morally framed, media-friendly protests. This
   research also demonstrates how data on organizational networks can be
   assembled and used to explore historical-institutional hypotheses about
   the development and impact of social movements.},

   different people decide to engage in politics. In the US, political
   attitudes typically vary across salient identity markers such as race,
   gender, and socio-economic class. Drawing on insights from the Black
   Lives Matter movement, this research note advances a theoretical
   framework for understanding justice and political protests through a
   transnational Black feminist lens. Here, I consider political behavior
   through the Black feminist frame of interlocking identities and the
   notion of ``the personal being political.{''} I examine the diverse ways
   in which Black feminism provides novel insights for better understanding
   justice and political behavior in terms of theory, methodology, and

Abstract = {This article analyses the effect of economic assessments on attitudes
   towards the European Union. The literature has mostly studied this
   question with observational data (which does not allow to establish a
   causal link), and has not explored how different countries's experiences
   during economic hardship shape opinions about the European Union. To
   account for this, I run a survey vignette experiment in Germany - a
   creditor countries's during the Great Recession - and Spain - a debtor
   country. I find that having worse perceptions about the impact of the
   crisis erodes attitudes towards the European Union. The mechanism is,
   however, different across countries. In Germany, worse economic
   evaluations reduce the perception that the European Union is a
   beneficial project. Conversely, in Spain, negative assessments about the
   financial crisis are linked to beliefs that democratic representation is
   limited in the European Union. These results are relevant to understand
   the conditions and mechanisms by which attitudes towards the European
   Union are worsened.},

Abstract = {In political scientists' drive to examine causal mechanisms, qualitative
   expert interviews have an important role to play. This is particularly
   true for the analysis of complex decision-making processes, where there
   is a dearth of data, and for linking macro and micro levels of analysis.
   The paper offers suggestions for making the most effective and
   reflective use of qualitative expert interviews. It advocates an
   encompassing, knowledge-based understanding of experts and argues for
   the incorporation of both ``inside{''} and ``outside{''} experts,
   meaning those that make and those that analyze political decisions, into
   an integrated analytical framework. It puts forward concrete advice
   addressing this technique's inherent challenges of selecting experts,
   experts' personal biases, and the systematic capturing of evidence.
   Finally, the article suggests that the combination of expert interviews,
   experimental methods, and online interviewing can meaningfully
   strengthen the evidentiary value of this important data collection
   technique.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates MPs' questions in Denmark. The paper focuses on
   the role of the ``partisan context{''} for their questioning behavior.
   This refers to three aspects. First, the status of the party in terms of
   government versus opposition. Second, it refers to the issues a party
   finds important to focus on, as measured by its party manifesto. Third,
   it refers to the role of individual MPs within the party, most
   importantly the issues to which the MP is connected, measured by their
   committee membership. We investigate the role of the partisan context
   based on a unique database consisting of more than 35,000 questions to
   the minister asked by Danish MPs from 2004 to 2013. The paper highlights
   two findings. First, that the Danish model of minority governments with
   support parties creates a particular structure which shapes the partisan
   context and thus question behavior. Second, the importance of
   specialization within political parties. Being your parties'
   representative in a given committee is thus central to understanding on
   which issues an MP asks questions, but especially if the issue is
   important for your party.},

Abstract = {The P/CVE sector is a growing and increasingly professionalised field in
   many countries affected by ``homegrown{''} extremism. While opinions of
   individuals working and researching in the P/CVE sector have informed
   many studies, little is known about these professionals as people. This
   is problematic, because P/CVE employees are not black boxes; they have
   personal motivations, opinions, and experiences, which potentially
   influence their work and therefore the development and implementation of
   prevention and counter-extremism efforts. The present study offers a
   preliminary glimpse into P/CVE professionals as individuals by reporting
   the analysis of 27 experts interviews with academics and practitioners
   working in P/CVE, who describe their personal motivation for working in
   this particular field. These motivational factors range from childhood
   experiences to personal interest in the topic, anger, the wish for a
   positive personal impact, the desire to use research to improve social
   ills, and personalised responsibility to protect democracy},

Abstract = {How does exposure to conspiracy theories affects voters' political
   attitudes? Using an online experiment among US subjects, we show that
   exposure to conspiracy theories decreases voters' trust in the domestic
   informational environment. Subjects were exposed to conspiracy theories
   that are entirely unrelated to American domestic politics, which further
   underscores such narratives' danger. However, we fail to reject the null
   hypothesis that voters do not weigh unrelated conspiracies in their
   evaluation of politicians' performance and domestic political
   institutions. Overall, our findings illustrate that an informational
   environment permeated by conspiracy theories could impede the
   functioning of democracy by eroding trust in information providers and
   undermining the credibility of political information.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {56},
Number = {3},
Pages = {363-394},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Why does support for mainstream parties decline? A growing literature
   points to economic loss as a source of political resentment. We bring
   this explanation one step further. We posit that the local economy
   qualifies the role of social capital in forging systemic support. When
   the economy thrives, social capital buffers discontent via interpersonal
   interactions. When the economy declines it exacerbates discontent,
   leading to a diffusion of grievances. We test our ``networks of
   grievances{''} hypothesis in two settings. We first test our theory in
   Italy, which offers individual-level information together with
   fine-grained municipality-level social capital data. Second, we test the
   mechanism underlying our theory combining survey and local
   administrative data across 18 European countries. The results suggest
   that ``networks of grievances{''} operate as channels of political
   discussions with peers, converting retrospective evaluations into
   systemic discontent bringing non-mainstream parties into voters' choice
   sets.},

Abstract = {Identity capital entails the use of identity as an asset in achieving a
   set goal. It demonstrates a wider in-group identity spurred by social
   resource mobilization, identity cohesion, and social development. This
   article queries why identity is used as a capital to advance Biafra
   activism in Southeast Nigeria. Identity capital theorizes the adoption
   of Biafra identity as an asset to create in-group identification to
   foster social cohesion for the advancement of Biafra agitation. Using a
   secondary source of data collection and content analysis, this study
   reveals that Biafra identity is used to sustain Biafra activism among
   the Igbo in Nigeria.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on the relationship between Hindu nationalism and
   democracy and how the former emerges from within democracy only to
   subvert it. The essay outlines important conceptual issues in the
   relationship between Hindu nationalism and democracy, discusses the
   relationship between the idea of a `Hindu Rashtra' and `Hindu Rajya',
   and delves into the complex interplay between Hindu nationalism and
   caste. This article ultimately argues that Hindu nationalism's alignment
   with authoritarianism in a political style does not simply corrode
   democracy, but it also undermines all values. The objective of this
   analysis is not to provide a comprehensive explanation of the rise of
   Hindu nationalism, as much as to reflect on the ways in which its
   ideology operates at multiple levels.},

Abstract = {Violent hostility between ordinary partisans is undermining American
   democracy. Social media is blamed for rhetoric threatening violence
   against political opponents and implicated in offline political
   violence. Focusing on Twitter, I propose a method to identify such
   rhetoric and investigate substantive patterns associated with it. Using
   a data set surrounding the 2020 Presidential Election, I demonstrate
   that violent tweets closely track contentious politics offline, peaking
   in the days preceding the Capitol Riot. Women and Republican politicians
   are targeted with such tweets more frequently than men and
   non-Republican politicians. Violent tweets, while rare, spread widely
   through communication networks, reaching those without direct ties to
   violent users on the fringe of the networks. This paper is the first to
   make sense of violent partisan hostility expressed online, contributing
   to the fields of partisanship, contentious politics, and political
   communication.},

Abstract = {Radical right parties and their nativist ideas have gained considerable
   momentum, compelling non-radical parties to ``engage{''} with this
   demand and with the nativist ``Zeitgeist.{''} Yet, aside from general
   trends such as tougher stances on migration, we know little about the
   strategic choices of parties when balancing their commitment to core
   policy goals and the need to be ``timely,{''} that is, to respond
   changing environments. Theoretically, parties may either adapt their
   ideological ``core{''} to signal commitment or merely attribute nativist
   ideas to secondary issue areas to signal general responsiveness. Drawing
   on Austrian, German, and Swiss manifestos for over two decades and
   establishing a novel dictionary to assess parties' use of nativism, we
   find that while previous studies showing right-wing parties to compete
   with RRs using nativism in the same domains are correct, the strategic
   choices around this competition are more complex. How much commitment to
   nativist ideas parties show depends on whether RR parties use the same
   domains to construct their nativist claims. For research on party
   competition, this means that more attention should be paid to how rather
   than if parties ``engage{''} with their rivals.},

Abstract = {This article examines the evolution of long-term trends in the
   prioritization of environmental protection in Britain over a period of
   four decades. It does so by compiling comparable questions tapping into
   the same underlying environmental dimension from a range of sources,
   including historical polling data that has only recently been made
   available to the research community. At the aggregate level,
   prioritization largely tracks changing economic conditions as well as
   key environmental events, with the winter of 2019 showing the highest
   recorded levels. Furthermore, trends in individuals' willingness to
   prioritize the environment may not always go in tandem with trends in
   environmental salience. At the individual level, educational attainment
   is the only consistently significant demographic correlate over time.
   However, there is evidence of increasing politicization of the
   environment, with left-right orientations only becoming an important
   correlate of environmental prioritization in recent years, in line with
   rising divergence on the issue at the elite level.},

Abstract = {An ongoing debate in American politics concerns the extent to which
   subnational politics has become ``nationalized.{''} We advance this
   debate by collecting issue-position data on four distinct policy topics
   from unprecedented national surveys of public officials at both the
   local and state levels. We then combine this survey data with
   precinct-level presidential vote-share data that is tabulated to match
   the boundary of each survey respondent's government jurisdiction. In
   doing so, we demonstrate that national party sorting of subnational
   officials is substantively and statistically significant across a range
   of issues with national salience, that it is consistent across local and
   state levels of government and it cannot be explained by the party
   sorting of constituents. These findings have implications both for the
   scope of nationalization as well as its implications for substantive
   representation.},

Abstract = {As part of the European Semester, the European Commission issues
   country-specific recommendations for all member states. I contribute to
   the literature on this political instrument, by considering the
   determinants of recommendations calling for greater wage moderation and
   enhanced cost competitiveness. For the most part, research on European
   economic governance has either understood the European Commission as a
   politicized and `ideological' institution or as a de-politicized,
   technocratic actor. My analysis shows that the European Commission's
   ideological preferences on labour markets and wage bargaining
   institutions are more convincing predictors than explanations based on
   economic indicators. By testing a series of multilevel models, I find
   that irrespective of developments in competitiveness, countries with
   stronger social actors are more likely to be recipients of
   country-specific recommendations calling for wage restraint.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant disruptions in Canada's
   public school system as provincial and territorial governments have
   enacted sudden and prolonged school closures. We compare the different
   school closure decisions in Alberta and Ontario during spring 2021,
   using official public briefings and publicly available data about rates
   of COVID-19 cases. We ask if provincial policy decisions can be
   explained by different epidemiological contexts and risks. We find that
   key epidemiological indicators such as the rate of cases were not
   directly linked to school closure decisions. This is important for
   policy makers and experts: it problematizes the assumption of a straight
   line between evidence and decisions and has implications for
   transparency and public trust in pandemic policy choices. A systematic
   description of the gap between evidence and policy is an important
   starting point for asking, What does drive decisions to close schools?},

Abstract = {The revelation, via a leaked draft, that the Supreme Court of the United
   States was going to overturn the landmark decision in Roe v. Wade (1973)
   sparked immediate questions about whether a similar retrenchment of
   abortion rights could occur in Canada. Key legal, structural, and
   political cultural factors mitigate the forces of American-style erosion
   of norms on the Supreme Court of Canada and in our broader politics
   surrounding abortion rights. Despite this generally optimistic
   comparative context, complacency about the status of abortion rights in
   Canada would be unwise. This short Currents article canvasses factors
   crucial for not only preserving the policy status quo in criminal law
   (that is, the absence of criminal law abortion regulation in Canada),
   but also for advancing the scope of abortion rights in the positive
   sense, as serious barriers to access persist at the provincial level.},

Abstract = {High levels of self-reported trust in government found in China has
   invited skepticism about the authenticity of survey results. To address
   this question, we examine implicit political trust, an automatic,
   intuitive orientation toward government. Using the Single-Target
   Implicit Association Test, we found that the Chinese public holds an
   implicit trust in government that is unrelated to self-reported,
   explicit trust. Whereas early political socialization processes,
   represented by education and urban residency, increase implicit trust
   they also decrease explicit trust suggesting that agents of
   socialization have differential effects. Furthermore, performance
   evaluations, income, and social desirability affect explicit trust but
   have no effect on implicit trust. Controlling for explicit trust, we
   found that implicit trust matters for understanding various types of
   regime support including system justification, the social credit system,
   and government's ability to handle crises. Our results have important
   implications for understanding regime support in the world's largest
   authoritarian country.},

Abstract = {This essay reflects on Claire Jean Kim's racial triangulation theory in
   light of the 20-year convergence between the US immigration system and
   the carceral state. Drawing on a non-probability sample of 70 in-depth
   interviews with individuals who had direct and vicarious immigrant
   detention experiences, I argue that immigrant detention depends on
   anti-Blackness to manage race-class subjugated groups' demands for
   de-carceration. Interviews expose how Latinx immigrant subgroups and
   other immigrant subgroups are differently subjected to carceral logics
   in ways that compel or suppress their resistance to racial
   triangulation. Finally, by recentering the agency of directly impacted
   individuals, the essay complicates Latinx politics and sheds light on an
   emerging dignity politics in immigrant detention with implications for
   intergroup relations.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93},

Abstract = {This article charts surprising departures in how the two major British
   parties have cultivated and regulated financial services since the
   1990s. During this time, Labour leaderships have consistently sought to
   accommodate the City, while the Conservatives have defied it at
   important junctures. This pattern of behaviour challenges the assumption
   in classical business power theory that Conservatives should be more
   attuned to finance's preferences than Labour. The article attributes
   this to the parties' distinct understandings of the interplay between
   the sector's business power and their own statecraft, which derive from
   substantially varying political links with the City. Labour's repeated
   charm offensives are prompted by a sensitivity to disinvestment and
   perpetually weak political ties. The Conservatives' approach is less
   sensitive to the sector's economic weight and is underwritten by
   enduring political ties. The article examines these differences over
   time and with special reference to two episodes: post-financial crisis
   banking reforms and Brexit.},

Abstract = {In the moderation literature opposition movements are driven to alter
   their political behaviour via either inclusive or exclusive political
   forces. Despite each analytical pathway producing cogent analyses, the
   lack of any consensus complicates our ability to understand the drivers
   of the moderation process holistically. However, this research questions
   the efficacy of any dichotomy. Using the Islamist movement Hamas as its
   case study, I argue that concentrating solely on examining the
   structural causal mechanisms of moderation exhibited by inclusion and
   exclusion does not capture the full ambit of the moderation process. To
   provide a more nuanced account of the causal drivers of moderation, I
   argue for the need to examine a movement's ideological agency within the
   moderation process. By doing so, the article demonstrates that what is
   driving Hamas's moderation post-2004 is not only a combination of
   inclusive and exclusive political forces, but its evolving ideological
   reconceptualisation of resistance. Hamas's dual-status means that its
   resistance legitimacy, gained from confronting Israel's occupation
   militarily, is also used as a political buffer to justify making
   substantive ideological compromises. A key finding of this research is
   that while inclusion allowed Hamas to be more ideologically circumspect,
   exclusion forced Hamas to take more ideological risks.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relationship between descriptive
   representation, patrimonial voting, turnout, and voting patterns in
   small ethnic groups. It argues that the combination between patrimonial
   voting and descriptive representation marginalizes the importance of
   substantive representation, leading to a decline in turnout, but
   simultaneously to cliental loyalty networks among voters that shape
   voting preferences. It utilizes the case of the Druze in Israel and
   analyzes their voting patterns in order to establish the argument that
   the mechanism that leads to party preferences among minority voters,
   namely, clientalistic accountability, is the same mechanism that renders
   descriptive over-representation devoid of substantive impact on state
   policies directed towards the minority. Our aim is to enrich the
   literature on the affinity between minority descriptive representation,
   patrimonial voting, clientalist accountability, and political efficacy.
   We demonstrate that Druze candidates in Zionist parties, especially
   those close to decision-making circles by being part of the governmental
   coalition, establish a broad network of supporters based on family ties,
   personally benefiting voters by integrating them or their relatives into
   high-income jobs, making their cliental preferences rational. This
   creates the gap between mere descriptive representation of minority
   groups and the substantial representation of their communal interests in
   ``patronage democracy.{''}},

Title = {Corporate and business domination of food banks and food diversion

Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},

Abstract = {Critics have identified the corporate and business sector as
   contributing to household food insecurity through its endorsement of low
   wages, anti-union activities and lobbying for retrenchment of the
   Canadian welfare state. It is therefore troubling that this same
   corporate and business sector has come to dominate positions on the
   boards of directors of civil society organizations with missions to
   reduce household food insecurity. Fisher uses the term `Big Hunger' to
   describe how this `hunger-industrial complex' of food banks, food
   diversion schemes and corporations and companies are accruing benefits
   to themselves yet do little to reduce household food insecurity. We
   consider such processes as illustrating two key political economy
   concepts: (1) Marx's concepts of base and superstructure and (2)
   Gramsci's cultural hegemony. We carry out a critical case study of the
   relevance of these concepts to the Canadian household food insecurity
   scene by examining how the corporate and business sector now dominates
   the boards of directors of four major civil society organizations
   concerned with reducing household food insecurity. We find evidence of
   these civil society organizations Corresponding exhibiting agenda
   distortion, reciprocity and loss of integrity, all reflecting their
   becoming part of the superstructure of capitalist society whose ruling
   elites come to dominate the ideas and values of society. Issues of
   wages, unionization and collective agreement bargaining, taxes and
   taxation, income inequality and retrenchment of the welfare state - all
   important contributors to household food insecurity and key concerns of
   the corporate and business community - are for the most part absent from
   these civil society organizations' reports, documents and statements. We
   specify the implications these developments have for addressing
   household food insecurity and the inequitable distribution of other
   social determinants of health.},

Abstract = {The Nigerian state has witnessed an upsurge in violent crime - such as
   kidnapping, looting and cattle rustling - especially in its northwest
   geopolitical zone. Referred to as `armed bandits' in local parlance,
   loosely organised criminal gangs with strong links to Boko Haram and the
   Islamic State West Africa Province have compounded the war on terror in
   the Sahel. In this article, Promise Frank Ejiofor draws on the New
   Mobilities Paradigm to contend that mobility is central to comprehending
   the persistence of armed banditry. By understanding the problem in this
   way, anti-terror legislation could then aim at effectively governing not
   just territorial spaces but also mobilities.},

Abstract = {We develop a theory of policymaking that examines when policy
   sabotage-the deliberate choice by an opposition party to interfere with
   the implementation of a policy-can be an effective electoral strategy,
   even if rational voters can observe that it is happening. In our model,
   a potential saboteur chooses whether to sabotage an incumbent's policy
   by blocking its successful implementation. A voter then decides whether
   to retain the incumbent, who is of unknown ability, or to select a
   challenger. We find that the incentives for sabotage are broadly shaped
   by the underlying popularity of the incumbent-it is most attractive when
   an incumbent is somewhat unpopular. If so, sabotage may decrease the
   probability the incumbent is reelected, even though sabotage is
   observable to the voter. This is because while the saboteur knows that
   sabotage will improve the incumbent's reputation, he fears that absent
   sabotage a policy success will improve that reputation even more.},

Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {224-240},

Abstract = {This article considers how intergovernmental relationships (Igr) between
   the State and the Regions in Italy changed during 2021, the second year
   of the pandemic outbreak. Three events altered significantly the
   previous cooperative arrangements and opened a new phase: the
   vaccination campaign, the new government led by Mario Draghi, and the
   launch of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP). These events
   helped to shift the former cooperative governance (grounded in joint
   decision-making in the development of provisions and policies) towards a
   centralized governance (grounded in the leadership of the Prime Minister
   and an `adhocracy') where the Regions had mostly an implementation
   rather than a more active decision-making role. This change is visible
   through two analytic dimensions: delegation/autonomy and
   cooperation/conflict. Empirical evidence was gathered on both
   dimensions. The article argues that the new centralized governance
   implied no formal change at the institutional level. Political variables
   determined it, analogously with what occurred in 2020 with cooperative
   governance. This means that relations between State and Regions in Italy
   change according to the political climate: they are more prone to
   politicization, than to institutionalization and permanent
   consolidation.},

   extensive prior experience and widespread respect was certainly a
   factor. The global context was also important, with the new Biden
   administration in the US leading a group of countries seeking

Abstract = {This essay takes a stand against the ideological abuse of
   ``democracy{''} enabled by the substitution of the original meaning of
   the word with a far more reductive one. After outlining a brief overview
   of the word's history starting with ancient Greece, then the struggle
   for universal suffrage and the democratic constitutions after WWII,
   sometimes embedded with significant elements of social democracy, it
   examines the attack on democracy from the post-war period to the present
   day, which took place through the practical demolition of universal
   suffrage, various forms of theoretical attack on democracy, the attack
   on state sovereignty through globalization and an increased use of
   ``state of exception{''} after 9/11. The conclusions emphasize the worth
   of democracy as a value, as a dynamic concept that cannot be reduced to
   a specific form of government.},

Abstract = {Decades of research has debated whether women first need to reach a
   ``critical mass{''} in the legislature before they can effectively
   influence legislative outcomes. This study contributes to the debate
   using supervised tree-based machine learning to study the relationship
   between increasing variation in women's legislative representation and
   the allocation of government expenditures in three policy areas:
   education, healthcare, and defense. We find that women's representation
   predicts spending in all three areas. We also find evidence of critical
   mass effects as the relationships between women's representation and
   government spending are nonlinear. However, beyond critical mass, our
   research points to a potential critical mass interval or critical limit
   point in women's representation. We offer guidance on how these results
   can inform future research using standard parametric models.},

Abstract = {Many developing democracies suffer from persistent corruption and
   rule-of-law violations. Growing efforts have focused on establishing
   anticorruption institutions to combat this culture of impunity, but
   success has been modest. We tackle this puzzle by focusing on the
   calculus of the threatened corrupt elites in undermining serious
   anticorruption efforts. We examine electoral manipulation, as credible
   anticorruption reforms may increase pressure on corrupt elites to
   fraudulently maintain power in order to control anticorruption efforts.
   At the same time, anticorruption reforms can deter electoral
   manipulation if they sufficiently raise the costs of lawbreaking.
   Focusing on the representative case of Romania and using a variety of
   data sources, diagnostics and research designs, we show how credible
   anticorruption efforts systematically induce electoral manipulation by
   the backlash coalition of corrupt politicians. However, this
   manipulation is constrained by electoral competition, which may be the
   key to longer-term political consolidation of these ``imperfect{''}
   democracies.},

Title = {Humiliation and International Conflict Preferences},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Volume = {84},
Number = {2},
Pages = {874-888},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Politicians and scholars often link humiliation to decisions to initiate
   and escalate international military conflict, yet the microfoundations
   underlying this link are undertheorized and untested. Can emotions, like
   humiliation, actually affect international bargaining? If so, through
   what mechanisms does humiliation operate? Drawing on studies in
   neuroscience and experimental psychology, this article offers two new
   mechanisms through which humiliation may influence conflict preferences:
   by decreasing sensitivity to the cost of conflict and by increasing the
   salience of potential status loss. This change in preferences shrinks
   the bargaining range, increasing the probability of bargaining
   breakdown. I test this theory using both survey and lab experiments that
   exploit the carryover effects of humiliation on unrelated decisions to
   isolate its effects on conflict preferences. The results provide the
   first experimental evidence able to distinguish support for different
   mechanisms through which humiliation increases conflict preferences.},

Abstract = {Research shows that government-controlled media is an effective tool for
   authoritarian regimes to shape public opinion. Does
   government-controlled media remain effective when it is required to
   support changes in positions that autocrats take on issues? Existing
   theories do not provide a clear answer to this question, but we often
   observe authoritarian governments using government media to frame
   policies in new ways when significant changes in policy positions are
   required. By conducting an experiment that exposes respondents to
   government-controlled media-in the form of TV news segments-on issues
   where the regime substantially changed its policy positions, we find
   that by framing the same issue differently, government-controlled media
   moves respondents to adopt policy positions closer to the ones espoused
   by the regime regardless of individual predisposition. This result holds
   for domestic and foreign policy issues, for direct and composite
   measures of attitudes, and persists up to 48 hours after exposure.},

Abstract = {Holding elected officials accountable for their behavior in office is a
   foundational task facing citizens. Elected officials attempt to
   influence this accountability process by explaining their behavior with
   an eye toward mitigating the blame they might receive for taking
   controversial actions. This article addresses a critical limitation in
   the literature on elite explanation giving and accountability: the
   absence of attention to conflicting information regarding the official's
   behavior. The study shows across three pre-registered survey experiments
   that explanations are ineffective when other speakers offer
   counter-explanations that focus on the official's potential ulterior
   motives. It further demonstrates that this occurs even when the
   counter-explanation comes from a partisan source with low credibility.
   These results imply that elected officials enjoy less leeway for their
   actions than existing work allows, and highlight important tensions
   concerning the relationship between elite behavior and accountability
   processes.},

   Legislators and Effective Public Goods Provision from a Global Sample},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 APR 1},
Abstract = {In the past two decades, women achieved significant gains in national
   legislatures by advocating for improvements in healthcare, welfare
   programs, and the promotion of civil rights. However, extant studies
   also find that women's increased representation in national legislatures
   have led to symbolic tokenism without any substantive gains in terms of
   policy outputs, signifying their continued marginalization. Utilizing a
   global sample, this panel study shows that female representation in
   legislatures are correlated with having better public goods provision in
   the context of tangible public services that are important to women
   constituents (i.e., women's issues). The results are consistent even
   when controlling for other variables that concern women's empowerment in
   society and government, regime type, levels of democracy, economic
   development, and disparate regional effects. Disaggregated results based
   on a developing world sample and states that experienced an
   authoritarian past also show how female representation in national
   legislatures leads to better infrastructure development. The
   implications suggest that women in legislatures improve access to basic
   infrastructure that concomitantly affects the quality of life of
   citizens, reflecting women's substantive representation.},

Abstract = {Research on the political preferences of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB)
   voters shows that they are more progressive than heterosexuals. However,
   few studies consider differences between heterosexual, gay/lesbian, and
   bisexual men and women. Furthermore, little is known about how these
   preferences have changed as society has become more accepting of diverse
   sexualities. We offer an analysis of Canadian LGB voters' political
   preferences a decade and a half after same-sex marriage was legalized.
   Consistent with prior research, we find that gay men, and, to a lesser
   extent, bisexual men, are more left-wing than heterosexual men. A more
   novel finding is that bisexual women are the most left-wing group.
   Lesbian women are only slightly to the left of heterosexual women. While
   left-wing bisexual women are growing in number, the overall gap between
   LGB and heterosexual voters has remained stable across generations,
   because marriage narrows some of the preference gaps.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that the current COVID-19 pandemic reveals and in a
   sense crystallizes a series of long-standing tensions about sovereignty
   that have become increasingly salient in the advanced capitalist
   democracies of the European Union. The spread of the pandemic led first
   to the activation of a conflict between a `sovereigntist reflex'
   privileging the expression of national capacities and national
   self-reliance and a more `perforated' understanding of sovereignty
   stressing the interdependence of peoples and states, both geographically
   and institutionally. As the response to COVID itself became more
   politicized we see the emergence of a second tension, between a
   libertarian `reflex' supporting a residual state protecting liberties
   and facilitating individual choice and a sovereign-statist `instinct',
   calling for an empowered guardian of the public good capable of ensuring
   collective security. A third tension relates to the seemingly growing
   opposition between a conception of sovereignty founded (and contingent)
   upon the will of the people and one in which the sovereign is,
   simultaneously, the discerner, defender and ultimate guarantor of the
   public good. After having mapped out these interwoven tensions and their
   main fault lines in general terms, the paper proceeds comparatively,
   tracking and tracing their (differential and specific) presence in
   governmental responses in two advanced capitalist democracies, France
   and Britain.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates whether the politicization of a new generation
   of trade agreements has led to the transformation of EU trade policy. It
   provides a qualitative study of multilevel contention based on sources
   from civil society and the parliamentary archives in Belgium, Germany,
   and the European Union concerning the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic
   and Trade Agreement (CETA) and three subsequent agreements concluded by
   the EU with Japan, Vietnam, and Singapore. We argue that, far beyond
   mere institutional disputes, the contention surrounding CETA has
   epitomized two conflicting visions of sovereignty: on the one hand, a
   vision where national executives qua states share sovereignty under the
   auspices of the European Commission, and on the other hand, a claim to
   reassert popular sovereignty (and the channelling thereof by
   parliaments) in a multilevel fashion. We demonstrate that the
   strengthening of the latter vision has been limited as the empowerment
   of parliaments was not sustained when civil society's mobilization
   waned. The EU institutions have successfully curtailed the category of
   mixed agreements thus limiting the involvement of national and regional
   parliaments. CETA was a climax in the politicization of trade yet failed
   to bring about a new constitutional settlement that enhances the popular
   component of sovereignty in the EU.},

Abstract = {This study assesses EU states' responses to the pandemic through
   engaging with literatures on surveillance capitalism, authoritarian
   liberalism, and democratic backsliding. It investigates restrictions
   that were carried out in EU states and the means that were used to
   enforce them via surveillance technology. The analysis reveals that
   private technological corporations' resources, data, and applicational
   platforms enabled governmental security and health institutions to
   monitor, trace, and quarantine entire populaces through side stepping
   democratic mechanisms. Concurrent to emergency decrees and mass
   restrictions, governments privileged corporate and industrial interests
   during lockdowns. These outcomes warrant debate and theorization on what
   a post-pandemic liberal democratic social order will look like.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a new theoretical framework to conceptualize
   extreme-right entrepreneurial activities as `toxic' brand networks. It
   applies political marketing and branding, consumer culture, and customer
   engagement research to different extreme-right identity myths and
   narratives that are connected through various commercial goods,
   services, and subcultural products, such as martial arts, music, and
   clothing. The article argues that a comprehensive understanding of the
   threats posed by the modern extreme right is limited by the lack of
   attention on their political marketing and branding strategies. These
   strategies combine fundraising with the spread of extremist ideology to
   facilitate radicalization and recruitment. The conceptual framework
   presented here explores the various elements and reciprocal mechanisms
   within such a brand network. Among these, shared emotional and social
   experiences, as well as ideological authenticity and reciprocity, are
   identified as the most crucial. The article makes specific suggestions
   to use this framework to improve counter-messaging and to design other
   effective countermeasures, such as the targeting of weak links in the
   brand network in order to facilitate brand damage.},

Abstract = {The Conservatives have long been ideologically split on immigration
   between the business right and identity right of the party. Appealing to
   the social right of its voter base, since 2010 immigration policy has
   been doggedly restrictive. Yet, lobbying channelled through bureaucratic
   politics has led to subtle, but important, concessions to appease
   business interests. The Conservative administrations have legitimised
   these concessions by making distinctions between `good' and `bad'
   migrants. In the 2010s, lobbying strategies, while shifting according to
   the political climate, predominantly consisted of insider lobbying. Yet,
   with significant labour market shortages induced by the new immigration
   system and heightened by the pandemic, employers are `going public' with
   their opposition, placing significant pressure on the Conservatives to
   perform a policy reversal. Meanwhile, public opinion on immigration has
   softened and its saliency has dwindled. Politicising immigration may not
   be an electoral winner anymore; business interests may override the
   identity wing of the party.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},
Pages = {145-163},

Abstract = {This paper uses a 22-country cross-national analysis to test whether
   high levels of citizen trust in governmental civil servants prompt high
   levels of confidence in vaccine safety, effectiveness and importance.
   Because vaccine initiatives have long been the responsibility of
   national governments and the civil servants who coordinate their
   development, distribution and implementation, vaccine hesitancy or
   acceptance can be expected not just to reflect citizens' judgements of
   the efficacy of the vaccines themselves, but also of the governments who
   control almost every aspect of the vaccination programs. As existing
   global surveys on vaccine hesitancy do not include measures of attitudes
   toward governmental trust, we merge two pre-COVID-19 international
   datasets - one that measures citizen attitudes toward governmental civil
   servants and the other that measures citizens' views of vaccines - and

Abstract = {In this article, we present a conceptual model for the study of
   intellectual trajectories. The notion of trajectory combines the figure
   of the intellectuals, as actors, and the stages on which they act. With
   the help of this model, we seek particularly to study the figure of the
   global digital public intellectual and the global digital stage on which
   this figure operates. By studying the case of Project Syndicate (the
   most important global platform or stage for the circulation of ideas
   through opinion columns), we show empirically that this stage has
   particularities that make it a circuit for such circulation. The notion
   of circuit seems to us more appropriate than field to describe this type
   of global stage at a transnational scale, still characterized by a lower
   level of institutionalization.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes specifics of instrumental and perceptional
   dimensions of the soft power of Russia. The analysis of these dimensions
   is particularly relevant in terms of studying the likelihood of the fact
   that Russia may continue applying the soft power strategy of long-term
   external influence. The main tools of the instrumental foundation of
   Russia's soft power have been analyzed. Russia's position in the
   rankings of well-known international rating agencies have been compared.
   The comprehensive studies are considered to be promising, combining
   detailed analysis of the soft power tools in the domestic and foreign
   policy strategy of the Russian Federation and the way it is perceived by
   different target audiences. It is concluded that foreign countries and
   societies perception of the soft tools application (mostly perceived as
   propaganda) may affect Russia's low position in international soft power
   and branding rankings.},

Abstract = {Our understanding of modern authoritarianism lacks a satisfying
   explanation for the genuine popularity of autocrats. While most of the
   literature on authoritarianism focuses on coercion, institutional
   manipulation, or clientelism, many contemporary autocrats clearly enjoy
   enthusiastic support even in times of economic stagnation or decline. We
   argue that part of the solution lies in unpacking the role of emotions
   in building support for rulers. Drawing on a unique panel survey
   conducted shortly before and after Russia's annexation of Crimea, we
   discover that the resulting ``rally{''} around the authoritarian flag
   involves much more than simply support for the leader or a simple
   increase in nationalism. Rather, we witness a broad shift in
   respondents' emotional orientation. Driven by the shared experience of
   the Crimean ``moment,{''} this shift improves people's evaluation of
   their social, political, and economic surroundings in the present, the
   future-and even the past. The result is a new explanation of the
   nonmaterial means through which autocrats may succeed in bolstering
   their legitimacy.},

Abstract = {This article examines the constitutional limits and guarantees with the
   use of biometric identification techniques in the light of sanction
   PS/00120/2021 instructed by the AEPD and passed in Spring 2021.
   Biometric data, according to the GDPR, are those personal data obtained
   via a specific technical treatment, relative to the characteristics of a
   physical person, which allow for the confirmation of the unique or
   unambiguous identification of said person, such as biometric facial
   patterns as the case may be. There is much confusion with regard to
   this, and the AEPD itself has acknowledged that there have been a series
   of errors in relation to this technology (fingerprints or facial
   recognition) for the purposes of identification and authentication. For
   this task, the indeterminate legal concept of ``essential public
   interest{''} is analyzed in accordance with jurisprudence, as an
   exception to the general prohibition of the treatment of biometric data
   ex article 9.2.g) GDPR. More specifically, the problem is approached
   from a triple perspective: from the point of view of the subject,
   especially with relation to that responsible for treatment (with special
   mention of the event that this is not a public organization), from a
   formal point of view, the limits relating to legal discretion, and
   finally from a substantive point of view, the material limits pertaining
   to the principle of proportionality and the minimum content of the
   fundamental right to the protection of personal data are studied.},

Abstract = {Scandals can cause serious damage to political parties' brand name and
   reputation, which may taint all members of the party-even those not
   implicated in the scandal. In this article, we therefore explore how
   (uninvolved) politicians are likely to react to the eruption of such
   events. Building on a survey among UK local councilors (N = 2133), we
   first document the prevalence of distinct response strategies (such as
   distancing oneself from the scandal-hit party or redirecting attention
   to similar events in other parties). Then, building on a between-subject
   survey-experimental design, we assess the moderating roles of
   partisanship and scandal type. We show that a scandal in one's own party
   reduces the probability of distancing oneself from the scandal-hit party
   (particularly among men). We also find that scandal type matters:
   pointing out similar scandals in other parties is less likely for sex
   scandals compared to financial scandals (particularly among women).},

Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {58},
Number = {4},
Pages = {745-764},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article investigates the relationship between levels of party
   institutionalization and individual-level partisan mobilization. Levels
   of party institutionalization have been linked to macro-level outcomes
   such as party system stability, but little is known about the
   micro-level underpinnings of such patterns. This article investigates
   one set of mechanisms through which party institutionalization might
   affect electoral outcomes. Specifically, we ask how routinization and
   value infusion - two central dimensions of party institutionalization -
   shape partisans' political mobilization. We investigate these
   relationships by matching data on individual-level behaviour (taken from
   the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) 2014 wave) with data on
   party attributes commonly associated with levels of institutionalization
   (taken from the Democratic Accountability and Linkages Project - DALP).
   We find that while value infusion encourages relatively greater
   participation from non-member supporters, party routinization depresses
   non-member participation but may mobilize otherwise inactive members.
   These findings suggest that to understand the effects of party
   institutionalization on a macro-level phenomenon such as electoral
   volatility, it may be necessary to study how parties institutionalize,
   rather than just asking how much they institutionalize.},

Title = {Weak agency and preferences for participatory democracy: discourses of

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1035-1054},

Abstract = {Recent studies exploring public opinion on participatory democracy show
   that disadvantaged social groups tend to hold favourable views on
   participatory processes. At the same time, research has also found that
   these groups frequently express feelings of weak agency and lack of
   competence to make valuable contributions to political processes. How
   then is support for democratic participation to be understood, if people
   see themselves as unskilled and incapable agents? To address this
   question, a series of focus groups were conducted with young,
   middle-aged, and older Spanish adults in situations of socioeconomic
   disadvantage. Like other studies, the analysis found that the
   participants had positive views of participatory reforms, but this was
   modified by low levels of personal and collective agency (internal and
   external efficacy and horizontal mistrust). While some scholars argue
   that such ambivalence is coherent with populism, the analysis suggests
   that many participants (particularly younger and middle-aged adults) are
   keenly appreciative of the complexity of such proposals and that
   negativity relates to the implementation of participative processes
   without genuine redistribution of knowledge and power, as well as a lack
   of mechanisms to guarantee responsiveness and commitment to bottom-up
   democracy.},

Abstract = {Illegal economies have received substantial attention in conflict
   studies over the past decades. Often, this attention is linked to
   economicist paradigms, rendering invisible the political processes
   linking conflict and illegal economies. By discussing the Colombian
   case, we argue that criminalisation is linked to patterns of capital
   accumulation and State-building. First, it reflects a long-term conflict
   of Proudhonian overtones between small-scale producers and big capital;
   secondly, it reflects a Tillyian process but without a Tillyian effect.
   Thus, the interaction between capital accumulation, political power and
   warfare takes place, without the expected result of a centralised and
   efficient, democratic State.},

Abstract = {Epistemic hubris-the expression of unwarranted factual certitude-is a
   conspicuous yet understudied democratic hazard. Here, in two nationally
   representative studies, we examine its features and analyze its
   variance. We hypothesize, and find, that epistemic hubris is (a)
   prevalent, (b) bipartisan, and (c) associated with both intellectualism
   (an identity marked by ruminative habits and learning for its own sake)
   and anti-intellectualism (negative affect toward intellectuals and the
   intellectual establishment). Moreover, these correlates of epistemic
   hubris are distinctly partisan: intellectuals are disproportionately
   Democratic, whereas anti-intellectuals are disproportionately
   Republican. By implication, we suggest that both the intellectualism of
   Blue America and the anti-intellectualism of Red America contribute to
   the intemperance and intransigence that characterize civil society in
   the United States.},

Abstract = {The greatest threat of democratic breakdown stems from the federal
   structure of the US Constitution and from false claims of election fraud
   with the potential for state- or congressional- level reversals of
   popular vote outcomes. The potential for such a breakdown was revealed
   by the events of January 6, 2021, with tens of millions of voters still
   believing in the big lie and the repetition of that lie by legislators
   and government officials. It is exacerbated by hyperpolarization,
   minoritarian control caused by partisan gerrymandering for state
   legislative districts and in the US House, malapportionment in the US
   Senate, and the highest likelihood of Electoral College reversals of
   popular vote outcomes in more than a century. Democratic breakdown is
   also made more likely by recent legislation that makes it easier for
   legislators in some gerrymandered states to reverse the outcomes of the
   popular vote in their states.},

Abstract = {With dozens of mandates, federal agencies have considerable discretion
   in how they focus their time and resources. In this article, I explain
   how presidents influence agency goals, focusing on how appointee teams
   are essential to prioritizing and resetting agency goals. Using original
   data on federal agency goals from the Obama administration to the Trump
   administration, my analysis of strategic and priority goals across 56
   agencies reveals that agencies in which the president has a higher
   percentage of key appointed positions filled experienced higher levels
   of long-term goal change. This finding highlights the president's
   immediate need to get their appointee teams in place to alter the course
   of agency policymaking for their whole first term.},

Abstract = {The National Science Foundation (NSF) recently replaced its
   long-standing Political Science Program with two new programs: the
   Security and Preparedness Program and the Accountable Institutions and
   Behavior Program. This article evaluates the likely impact of the reform
   by way of original survey data. The NSF Program Change Survey asked past
   recipients of the Political Science Program Standard Grant to evaluate
   their own previously funded proposals according to the new NSF program
   descriptions. Respondents were asked whether they would apply for the
   same research project under the new thematic programs and, if they
   would, whether they believed it would be necessary to change the framing
   or substance of their proposal. Data from the survey suggest that the
   new NSF program themes are likely to discourage some political
   scientists from applying, while encouraging many more applicants to
   shift the framing or substance of their research to accommodate the new
   call for proposals. In particular, the new Security and Preparedness
   Program carries significant consequences for new knowledge production.},

Abstract = {Despite the extensive theoretical connections between defense budget
   growth and inflation, empirical findings based on traditional
   time-domain methods have been inconclusive. This study reexamines the
   issue from a time-frequency perspective. Applying continuous wavelet
   analysis to the U.S. and Britain, it shows empirical evidence in support
   of positive bilateral effects in both cases. In the bivariate context,
   U.S. defense budget growth promoted inflation at 2- to 4-year cycles in
   the 1840s and at 8- to 24-year cycles between 1825 and 1940. Conversely,
   inflation accelerated defense spending growth at 5- to 7-year cycles in
   the 1830s and at 25- to 64-year cycles between 1825 and 1940. Similarly,
   British defense budget growth spurred inflation at 8- to 48-year cycles
   between 1890 and 1940 and at 50- to 65-year cycles between 1790 and
   1860. Inflation fueled the growth of defense spending at 7- to 20-year
   cycles between 1840 and 1870, in the 1940s, and in the 1980s.
   Preliminary results from multivariate analyses are also supportive,
   though there is a need for further research that is contingent on
   advancements in the wavelet method in the direction of simulation-based
   significance tests.},

Abstract = {The burgeoning interest and research in the ideology of the Islamist
   thinker Sayyid Qutb (d. 1966), since the attacks of 11 September, have
   been driven by one of the two goals: to demonstrate the crucial role of
   Qutb's verdict upon all modern societies as ungodly (jahili) in shaping
   the worldview of militant Islamists, or, more specifically, to explore
   the extent of Qutb's influence in shaping the takfiri rhetoric of late
   20th century jihadists. Yet one aspect of Qutb's verdict against modern
   societies that might explain the continuing appeal of his ideology to
   jihadists has received less attention in the literature: how the
   arguments Qutb employs in formulating this condemnation of modern
   societies as ungodly leads to a de-territorialization of jihad that
   explains his refusal to accept the traditional division of the world
   into `land of Islam' and `land of disbelief.' To drive this argument
   home, the article revisits Qutb's theo-political vision of Islam and
   explores his conception of divine sovereignty (hakimiyya) as a
   counter-term to jahiliyya to explicate the implications of that vision
   for his view of jihad. I argue that Qutb's call for the restoration and
   submission to divine authority encompasses both a transnational and a
   national concept of jihad.},

Abstract = {A significant body of literature has addressed the impact of party
   polarization on voting behavior. Yet little is known of the relationship
   between party polarization and belief systems. The present study argues
   that party polarization enhances the ideological consistency of belief
   systems and does so for the citizenry as a whole. We first demonstrate
   that the more party systems are polarized on economic and sociocultural
   issues, the more consistently belief systems are aligned with the
   progressive-conservative continuum. Second, we show that ideological
   consistency is greater in highly polarized party systems, not only among
   the most politically attuned Europeans but also among those with lower
   levels of political sophistication. Results have implications for our
   understanding of citizen competence and responsiveness to elite cues in
   polarized party systems.},

Abstract = {This special issue revisits and reframes the old, but active, debate on
   the relationship betweencriminality and civil war. It argues that the
   terms in which the debate isgenerally posed are still inadequate to
   address the complexities of thisrelationship, showing how
   criminalisation and de-criminalisation are deeply political and hotly
   contested processes. The shifting movements towards the separation or
   convergence-between criminality and politics are part of the processes
   of constitution of both political power and state. Thearticles in the
   issue flesh out the mechanisms and social dynamics throughwhich this
   takes place.},

Abstract = {This essay provides a concise review of the meanings of praxis,
   emphasizing its complex evolution since Aristotle formulated it within a
   triad of concepts. While the transformation of the concept owes
   something to Hegel, Marx's writings in 1844-6 (not fully published until
   the twentieth century) gave praxis a central role in Left philosophy.
   Yet this inheritance is complex and uncertain. Notwithstanding many
   profound elaborations on the philosophy of praxis, the concept remains
   at once fundamental yet vague, ostensibly materialist yet metaphysical,
   and therefore worthy of questioning.},

Abstract = {This work aims to discuss Ethics, Morals and Law with the background of
   public policies. The construction of the argument carried out here, part
   of the ethical theoretical framework defended by the philosopher Adolfo
   Sanchez Vazquez who bases his thought on the bases of the historical
   materialism of men inserted in a certain sociability that respond to the
   demands of that period. It is noted that in this way, morality, law and
   public policies (creation and execution) are also involved in real
   concrete situations. To elucidate our argument, we can revisit history
   by recalling certain issues morally accepted and protected by law that
   are currently unacceptable from a moral and legal point of view, such as
   slavery, the census vote and/or the holocaust. The article seeks to
   discuss the morals and ethics in the administration of public policy,
   above all, in relation to the norms referring to the role of the public
   servant, which after the promulgation of the 1988 Constitution had two
   principles; administrative morality and efficiency added to the existing
   ones. We can conclude that, normally the state rhetoric of the powers
   defends the premise that the proper functioning of public affairs is
   intrinsically related to the cooperation of all parties, being
   operationalized in the admi-nistrative sphere, legally protected and
   morally accepted, however, this erasing formula State of resolutions
   aimed at public problems does not reach the heart of the social problem,
   it does not transform the structure only to produce inequalities.},

Pages = {309+},
Abstract = {The Euromaidan in the winter of 2013/2014 and the annexation of Crimea
   brought to light the fact that among the German public, Ukraine hardly
   existed as a nation and sovereign state with its own history. It was
   also marginal in East European history as a discipline. Institutionally,
   the expansion of historical research on Ukraine has hardly advanced
   since then. But in terms of content, there has been intensive work on
   topics such as memory culture and history policy, Galicia, World War II
   and the German occupation, Jewish history and the Holocaust. Works on
   economic and social history are rare, and classic political history is
   lacking. And this even though Ukraine's archives offer a wealth of
   material to work with. Since the decommunization laws of 2015, the
   archives have been almost fully open to researchers. Putin's war against
   Ukraine could reverse all of this progress. And no one knows whether
   Ukrainian collections will survive the war.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to determine the forms of media
   involvement in justice for crimes against the civilian population. The
   research was conducted using the methods of systems approach,
   descriptive analysis, forecasting, systematic sampling and comparative
   method. The mass media as an institution of civil society have ample
   opportunities for active participation in justice, in particular, in the
   detection and documentation of crimes, social support to victims,
   coordination of efforts of governmental and non-governmental entities.
   The media is an active subject in justice for crimes against the
   civilian population. However, their functions are not of a legal nature;
   they are aimed at establishing the completeness and objectivity of the
   facts. It is concluded that the prospects for the development of media
   activities envisage the model, which focuses on the detection and
   documentation of crimes, in particular through the latest technologies;
   provision of social support and opportunities for victims to express
   their position while facilitating the coordination of efforts between
   governmental and non-governmental entities interested in justice for
   crimes against civilians.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the phenomenon of imperial cities -
   structures, the main function of which is to transmit power impulse from
   the imperial center to its adjacent periphery, linking the heterogeneous
   body of the empire. Such cities are not merely a result of natural
   agglomeration processes, but rather they represent political constructs
   that make it possible to hold the empire together and at the same time
   take into account its heterogeneity. Today, in the vast post-Soviet
   space, the imperial cities of the vanished empire of the USSR (capitals
   of the former Soviet republics, regional, economic and military centers)
   are undergoing a period of transformation, which is often described as
   the absorption of the city by its surrounding periphery. It is difficult
   to identify the main determinants of such transformation and build a
   stable model for predicting further changes, because even today this
   process is far from being complete, which makes it impossible for
   researchers to reveal all groups of factors that could impact the
   development of an imperial city outside the influence of the empire that
   left it.
   To solve this problem, the authors turn to the experience of the
   imperial city, which has already undergone a similar evolution, the so
   called ``Russian Harbin{''}. The article describes the transformations
   of the external appearance of the city, daily household routines, power
   distribution in the urban space, which are considered to be markers of
   change in the meanings of the imperial signals. Along with the trends
   that are common to the imperial cities of the East of Russia ({''}Europe
   for Asia{''}), there are also trends that are specific to Harbin as an
   imperial city outside the empire. The article demonstrates that the
   structure of the imperial city, which was created to transmit power
   impulse, is capable of transmitting the meanings of another empire. The
   authors show that the disappearance of the ``Russian Harbin{''} as a
   historical and cultural phenomenon does not mean the disappearance of
   the imperial city, which comes back to life every time the political
   center begins to produce meanings that need to be relayed to a
   heterogeneous territory.},

Abstract = {This article assesses whether a gender gap in political science,
   identified in the international literature, also is present in the
   context of Italian political science. The literature has mostly centered
   on the comparison of female publication rates in international journals
   with the academic workforce in the United States, but this raises an
   issue of data comparability. As an alternative strategy to avoid
   comparability biases, this study focuses on the analysis of a single
   national case: Italy. The article evaluates to what extent the
   ``glass-ceiling{''} effect persists for political scientists who intend
   to publish their contributions. By analyzing data on articles published
   between 2015 and 2020 by the three major Italian political science
   journals, this contribution shows that (1) the proportion of published
   articles written by female authors is lower than that of male authors;
   (2) the hypothesis that the lower female proportion depends on a lower
   female presence in the field of political science is refuted; (3) there
   is little collaboration between men and women; (4) there is a
   correlation between the presence of female editors in scientific
   journals and the proportion of female-authored articles; and (5) gender
   differences are reflected in women's academic career progression.},

   Relocalizing the migration issue and new mobilizations in rural settings},
Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2022},
Number = {137},
Pages = {183-207},
Abstract = {This article is based on a post-doctoral study of refugee settlement in
   rural areas, in the context of refugee policy reforms particularly
   focused on the spatial redistribution of migratory flows. The study
   consisted of ethnographic research among non-profit organizations and
   less formal groups in and around the town of Orlay that help people
   whose applications for refugee status were refused. Studying the local
   emergence of concern with migration, this article presents the interplay
   of scales that favors the development of new causes and new
   mobilizations in rural areas. It analyzes varied reactions of local
   political powers faced with the arrival of these new figures of poverty,
   making it possible to grasp the crossed logics of politicization and
   depoliticization. The article highlights how support for undocumented
   refugees contributes to the reconfiguration of the field of assistance
   in rural settings. Although housing seems to be a priority, settling
   people weakened by the ordeal of migration and being undocumented is a
   long-term process that re-defines relationships between solidarity
   networks and local political power.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Without any substantial constitutional change, Peru has moved during the
   last five years from a presidential political system, where the
   Executive controlled the political agenda, to one where the Peruvian
   Congress has considerable power. This article claims that the trigger
   for change was the electoral result of 2016, as it drastically shifted
   the balance of power between executive and legislative. This election
   gave a large majority to the opposition in Congress, allowing the
   generalization of extreme institutional weapons such as the presidential
   impeachment and the confidence motion. The corruption scandal known as
   Lava Jato accelerated the process. The proof that this is a new system
   is that these repertoires of interbranch conflict have remained in place
   even if no party has able to hold a majority in Congress during the last
   two electoral cycles.},

Abstract = {The end of the 19th - beginning of the 20th century is a watershed
   moment for Russia. It was the era of ``theomachy{''}, or getting rid of
   the former gods (authorities, restrictions, coercion and control), in
   politics, economy, science and culture. In this sense, the motto ``Down
   with the autocracy!{''} is the political equivalent of the poets' slogan
   ``Throw Pushkin off the ship of Modernity{''}. Poets, like politicians,
   wanted to break out of the past by removing its linchpin - the tsar, the
   old power. Some intended to reestablish it, others - to rethink it
   Politicians sought their ideal in ``geography{''} (the political
   structure of advanced, democratic Europe), poets - in culture. And they
   found it in Peter the Great - the revolutionary on the throne, the
   demiurge of St Petersburg's Russia. That cult, which was seemingly
   organic for that culture, concealed the expectations that can be
   politically deciphered as ``the dictatorship of development{''}. It was
   Peter's model of transformation (radical upheaval, a step from the past
   into the future, with the leader heading the process) that was adopted
   by the Russian culture as a normative. The revolution and the new
   ({''}October{''}) world, with its eulogy of the future, dictatorship,
   and cult of the leader, have become the answer to the questions of the
   beginning of the century and their test.
   The article views revolution precisely as an experience (which, for all
   its intensity and tragic nature, has received insufficient reflection)
   that failed to have any impact on the subsequent political practice. At
   the same time, although the main goal of the study is political in
   nature, the author draws on literary, mostly poetic sources, showing how
   revolutionary practice (not only at the start, but also at the end of
   the century) highlights the extent to which the ``irresponsible
   chatter{''} of poets was truly reflective in political and moral
   respects.},

Abstract = {This article intends to discuss the legal representations about paid
   domestic workers in Labor Law doctrines, with special focus on the form
   of constructions of a discourse that builds inequalities. We opted for
   the documentary research methodology, with attention to legal
   productions about these women. The considerations of this research point
   to the construction of an imagery about the maids of subjects who do not
   deserve the same rights as other workers.},

Abstract = {Post-apartheid South Africa is ravaged by crises of extreme
   unemployment, poverty, and inequality. While the majority who were
   politically excluded by apartheid can now choose their government
   through democratic elections, social and economic justice continues to
   elude them. Neoliberal policies which seek to reduce state expenditure
   on social services and promote state policies that protect the interests
   of big businesses at the expense of working-class and poor communities,
   along with corruption and abuse of power, are the primary causes of
   poverty and unemployment. However, what is missing in the assessments of
   social justice since the pre-1994 democratic era is the recognition that
   social justice organisations have not simply disappeared, but have
   actually remained involved in social justice struggles. Based on
   information from in-depth interviews and internet sources, this article
   records some of the partial victories scored through these struggles,
   albeit in the context of generalised pauperisation of working-class and
   poor communities. These partial victories in the era of defeats show
   that these organisations, although weakened, have not given up the
   struggle for social justice.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to substantiate the concept of national
   worldview, which underlies the effective unity of a person with his
   state. Currently, purposeful actions are being carried out in Ukraine
   directed against the sovereign statehood, threatening the territorial
   integrity of the country, national identity and its infrastructure. The
   revival of the sense of nationhood is considered an important task of
   the youth, as it is the basis of love for the national community of
   which one is a part. The present work is an essay close to political
   philosophy. It is concluded that in conditions of crisis and
   uncertainty, the requirements for the formation of a worldview of sense
   of the country, the development of which is based on the benefit of the
   people of Ukraine as a social democratic state, ready to form a
   responsible society, increase. Definitely, civic worldview is an
   integral part of the holistic idea of educational consolidation of
   society, which includes the breadth of understanding of the country's
   borders, the degree of love for fellow citizens, goodwill and awareness
   of being part of own unique social organism, the Ukrainian nation.},

Abstract = {How do economic opportunities abroad affect citizens' ability to exit an
   authoritarian regime? This article theorizes the conditions under which
   authoritarian leaders will perceive emigration as a threat and use
   imprisonment instead of other types of anti-emigration measures to
   prevent mass emigration. Using data from communist East Germany's secret
   prisoner database that we reassembled based on archival material, the
   authors show that as economic opportunities in West Germany increased,
   the number of East German exit prisoners - political prisoners arrested
   for attempting to cross the border illegally - also rose. The study's
   causal identification strategy exploits occupation-specific differences
   in the changing economic opportunities between East and West Germany.
   Using differential access to West German television, it also sheds light
   on the informational mechanism underlying the main finding;
   cross-national data are leveraged to present evidence of the external
   validity of the estimates. The results highlight how global economic
   disparities affect politics within authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {This article is devoted to the study of procedural and criminological
   aspects of ensuring the safety of participants in criminal proceedings.
   The problems of legal regulation of ensuring the safety of participants
   in these proceedings are also considered. The legal status of the
   subjects of relevant decisions is analyzed and the international and
   Ukrainian experience in regulating these issues is studied. The methods
   of dialectical, formal-logical, historical, structural-functional,
   institutional analysis, content analysis of laws and regulations and the
   method of evaluation of scientific positions were used. Among the
   relevant results of the research, the necessity of implementing security
   measures for participants of criminal proceedings in the Criminal
   Procedure Code of Ukraine in a separate section was demonstrated.
   Similarly, the expediency of creating in Ukraine a specialized
   independent structural unit for the implementation of measures to
   protect persons involved in criminal proceedings is discussed. In the
   main conclusions the need for the introduction in Ukraine of
   corresponding programs for the protection of participants in criminal
   proceedings is argued.},

Abstract = {This article studies the selection of committee chairs as a substantive
   indicator of parliamentary institutionalization. The case selected to
   carry out this analysis is the Mexican Chamber of Deputies during the 21
   years of non-majoritarian congresses (1997-2018). This legislature is
   appropriate for questioning the traditional precepts of informational
   theory given the ban on immediate reelection of its members and the lack
   of seniority norms that reward experienced congressmen with hierarchical
   positions in committees. By analyzing an original database with
   biographic, institutional, partisan, and electoral information of the
   3,841 federal congressmen who held a seat in the assembly between 1997
   and 2018, results of logistic models with conditioned effects suggest
   that both the parliamentary experience and the acquisition of
   specialized policy knowledge in extra-congressional arenas, became
   increasingly relevant as factors for committee chair selection.},

Title = {ON THE DEATH OF MAME MBAYE: RACIALISM AS THE ULTIMATE GOAL IN THE
   ``BATTLE AGAINST IRREGULAR IMMIGRATION{''}},
Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {70-89},
Abstract = {On 15 March 2018, Mame Mbaye, a 35-year-old migrant from Senegal who
   lived in Spain for 11 years, died on a street in the centre of Madrid. A
   police raid on unauthorized street vendors caused panic among
   illegalized migrants, who ran away trying to avoid an arrest that could
   have led to their detention and deportation. Mbaye ran towards his home,
   located a few hundred meters down the road, but he never made it. The
   official version, endorsed by the Spanish court, is that Mbaye suffered
   a fatal cardiac failure. Some eyewitnesses claim the police suffocated
   him to death. The article explores how the pervasive and perverse
   exercise of racism on different levels against illegalized migrants
   results in their social and in some cases literal death. To fully grasp
   the tenacity with which racism and racial cruelty are applied in the
   immigration field, we must recognize that most other arenas that have
   historically served as breeding grounds for advancing racialism in
   western societies have been legally proscribed. In contrast, the
   anti-immigration arena allows for acting practically, discursively and
   politically in racializing and racist manners against some of the most
   vulnerable members in society: so-called `irregular' migrants, `failed'
   asylum seekers and `non-real' refugees. The immigration field thus
   serves as a crucial, and perhaps the last, frontier for advancing
   racialism more holistically in western societies. Animating racialism as
   an operative ideology informs-consciously or not-those who staff the
   state apparatus, and society more broadly, to believe in and act upon
   racialized categories of othered people. In so doing, racialism
   legitimizes the social production and justifies the social death of
   illegalized migrants. The ultimate goal of this vicious dynamic, of
   inhumane treatment and judicial impunity, is to keep operational the
   racist notion that the lives of some people matter less than others.},

Volume = {55},

Abstract = {A fair peer-review process is essential for the integrity of a
   discipline's scholarly standards. However, underrepresentation of
   scholarly groups casts doubt on fairness, which currently is raising
   concerns about a gender bias in the peer-review process of premier
   scholarly journals such as the American Political Science Review (APSR).
   This study examines gender differences in APSR reviewing during the
   period 2007-2020. Our explorative analysis suggests that male reviewers
   privilege male authors and female reviewers privilege female authors,
   whereas manuscripts reviewed by both male and female reviewers indicate
   less gender bias. Using within-manuscript variation to address
   confounding effects, we then show that manuscripts reviewed by both male
   and female reviewers receive a more positive evaluation by female
   reviewers in terms of recommendation and sentiment, but they experience
   a marginally longer duration. Because these effects are not specific for
   type of authorship, we recommend that invitations to review should
   reflect mixed compositions of peers, which also may avoid overburdening
   an underrepresented group with review workload.},

Title = {SPECIALIZED MILITARY JOURNALISM IN THE SYSTEM OF MASS COMMUNICATION
   DURING THE RUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN WAR (2014-2022): COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF
   WORLD AND UKRAINIAN MASS MEDIA},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSFORMATION STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {136-152},
Abstract = {The article gives an analysis of world military publications and
   militarized journalism in comparison with the Ukrainian comparables in
   historical retrospective view and in the context of Russia's full-scale
   invasion of Ukraine, which is still ongoing. Special attention is paid
   to international military-focused media standards and specific military
   (mainly print) mass media: Stars and Stripes, Milli tehlukesizlik ve
   herbi elmler, Narodna Armiia, Narodna Armiia (People's Army), Army
   Inform, Officer of Ukraine, on occasion - The Washington Post, The New
   York Times and others. In the process of research, it was found out that
   military journalism has almost completely transformed into universal
   journalism. And for some reason, specialized printed editions of
   military focus have closed down in recent years. And if in Ukraine it is
   associated with the denationalization of the mass media, then abroad, it
   is most likely connected with the processes of digitalization and the
   separation of journalism from ideologies and state policies. As a
   result, the remaining military mass media are also changing their
   format, approaching global brands such as The Washington Post, The New
   York Times, Le Mond. However, this does not prevent them from putting
   information and analytics about Russia's war against Ukraine in the
   foreground and highlighting key points as reality and the principle of
   objectivity require. And although the Ukrainian mass media in this
   regard are far from ideal, their ideological bias should be attributed
   to the war, an organically inherent ritual model of communication and
   still a close connection with the socialist past. Since military
   journalism is currently working in extreme conditions, it is difficult
   to draw comprehensive conclusions, but it is already clear that
   specialized military media are relevant and promising for scientific
   research.},

Abstract = {Using an empirically based methodology, the scientific approaches to
   define the concepts of ``innovation{''} and ``innovation policy{''} are
   summarized. It is substantiated that the goal of implementing innovative
   entrepreneurship is the transition to an innovative model of
   development, which requires the implementation of the following priority
   tasks: integration of all stages of innovative entrepreneurship in the
   region; formation of competitive regional innovative products;
   increasing the level of quality of institutional infrastructure;
   improvement of information provision of innovative processes;
   stimulation of regional business entities to ensure innovative activity;
   creation of communications in the ``science-production{''} system;
   ensuring quality training of specialists in the field of innovative
   entrepreneurship; development of knowledge-intensive industries;
   effective use of innovative potential and intellectual capital of the
   region. Modeling of the innovative entrepreneurship profile of the
   regions led to the conclusion that the main task, for each of the
   regions, is to develop measures to increase the level of formation of
   its innovative entrepreneurship space, which will have the effect of
   optimizing the economic results of the operation and increase its
   competitiveness in domestic and international markets.},

Abstract = {The paper considers the horror stories spread among the militants of
   illegal armed groups ``L/DPR{''} in the period 2014-2021. Examples from
   personal interviews of militants are given. An algorithm for narratives
   detection and analysis is proposed, and a preliminary classification of
   such stories is proposed: narrative artifacts, trench legends, and
   artificial propaganda narratives. Estimates of the dynamics of the
   spread of such stories is described, and conclusions are drawn on the
   origin and functionality of scary stories: the stories of pro-Russian
   militants are mostly products of a rethinking of Soviet military
   folklore, and their functions are the dissemination of group norms and
   initiation of newcomers. Assumptions on militant identity and on the
   drivers of violent behavior are proposed.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},

Volume = {42},

Pages = {565-590},
Abstract = {Despite the abundant literature on consecutive reelection, few works
   examine how party leaders' preferences over incumbent traits can affect
   the future positions of sitting legislators. This paper examines how
   consecutive reelection and strong par-ty leader control over candidate
   selection combine to promote certain types of po-liticians for
   renominations for reelection, while others are consigned to candidacies
   for lower posts or left out of the selection process. We use Mexico's
   first experience with consecutive reelection since 1932 to better
   understand how incumbents' inte-rests and the demands of party leaders
   shape candidacy outcomes by examining whether the incumbents from the
   2018-2021 term were able to win a renomination bid or were sent to a
   higher or lower post.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the characteristics and changes of Peronist
   identity in the province of Santa Fe between 1983 and 1995. From an
   approach based on a political sociology of identities, it investigates
   the way in which provincial Peronism re-signified elements of its
   tradition and its history, as well as the way in which it defined its
   internal limits from processes of representation carried out by the
   leadership of the different Peronist governors of the period. The
   research is based on the content analysis of the discourse and it
   explores press materials, provincial archives and specialized
   bibliography. As a result, it is observed (against the widespread
   academic common sense around the ideas of ``emptying{''},
   ``disintegration{''} and ``crisis{''} of the historical political
   identities during the eighties and, especially, during the nineties) the
   persistence and, for this reason, the transformation and ductility of
   the Peronist political identity.},

Abstract = {On April 25th, 1974, the Carnation Revolution would take place in the
   streets of Lisbon ending the dictatorship of the Estado Novo . Tired of
   the bloody colonial war and the immobility of the regime, the Armed
   Forces Movement (MFA) would end up planning and executing a coup with
   democratic intentions. During the hours in which the coup took place,
   the civilian population of the Portuguese capital disobeyed the order of
   the insurgent soldiers to stay in their homes and invaded the streets
   declaring their support for the MFA. Both groups joined forces in
   pursuit of a peaceful political transition to democracy through the use
   of civil resistance and a democratic coup. Throughout this article we
   have studied this union of forces, this nonviolent synergy that brought
   down the longestunderstand how both merged in a peaceful way.},

Title = {Governability of Regional Challenges: The Arctic Development Paradox},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {29-40},
Abstract = {The advancement of governance architecture in the Arctic region and
   dealing with the ???Arctic development paradox??? have been among the
   most significant challenges of the circumpolar North for decades. The
   common denominator of both issues is the growing necessity to frame
   solutions that credibly and effectively support the Arctic???s social
   and environmen-tal systems in the face of climate change and
   globalisation. The current status quo seems deficient, which is why
   under-standing the main impediments is subject to public and academic
   discussion. This article contributes to these debates by referring to
   the concept of governability to demonstrate how transregional activities
   advance the development of more coherent governance in the Arctic. The
   article explores approaches applied by transregional organisations and
   cooperation programmes that constitute the governance system in the
   European Arctic. Specifically, it scrutinises governing interac-tions
   developed by the Barents Regional Council and the Northern Periphery and
   Arctic Programme to overcome the normative trap of the Arctic
   development paradox. This research follows a semi-structured,
   exploratory approach, which facilitates identifying key elements of a
   structurally and conceptually led response that resounds in each case.
   Combined with a synoptic literature review, this article answers two
   questions: First, how do the transregional actors approach the Arctic
   development paradox in their cooperation strategies and programmes, and
   to what extent do these approaches differ? Second, what kind of
   recommendations do they provide to overcome the Arctic development
   paradox?},

Abstract = {In 2021, Chile witnessed the continuation of several political and
   social processes inherited from previous years, among them the fight
   against the COVID-19 and the constitution-making procedure. In this
   article, we analyze two key aspects of the Sebastian Pinera's last year
   in office: the intense electoral calendar and the impeachment proceeding
   initiated against him during 2021's second half. On the one hand, the
   results of several different elections confirm the weakening of the
   center-right and its traditional parties, a process that began in the
   2019 ``estallido social{''} (social outburst) and how President
   Sebastian Pinera handled it. On the other hand, we examine in detail the
   impeachment proceedings against the chief executive and leader of the
   center-right coalition, paying close attention to the sponsors'
   potential motivations and its impact on Chile's presidential stability.},

Title = {KANG YOUWEI AND ITALY IN THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY:
   COMPREHENSION OF THE POLITICS OF THE WEST BY THE TRADITIONAL CONFUCIAN
   THINKER},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {186-198},
Abstract = {The article deals with the theoretical treatises written by Kang Youwei
   (1858 - 1927) in exile and devoted to the understanding of Western
   social and political reality from the standpoint of a bearer of
   traditional Chinese culture and Neo-Confucian philosophy. First of all,
   these are ``Travelogue to Italy{''} (Yidali youji, 1904) and ``Impartial
   Words on Republicanism{''} (Gonghe pingyi, 1918). Kang Yuwei's thinking
   is characterized by attention to the Confucian binary opposition si gong
   (private - general), which he transferred to both civilizational
   development and international politics. In other words, the Western path
   of development, which consist national imperialist states based on
   economic, social and foreign policy competition and individualism
   ({''}private{''}), was opposed to the monolithic ancient China, whose
   society and politics are based on the principles of ``community{''} and
   unity. Kang Youwei perceived the political reality of Western countries
   from the standpoint of traditional Chinese historiography, which was
   intended to serve as a base of positive and negative precedents for use
   by the ruler in the name of the common good and the harmonization of
   society. In Kang Youwei's system of historical views, modern Italy and
   Germany were very important for illustrating the principle of
   consolidation of political entities and the merging of small and weak
   states into large empires. Methodologically, this was formalized as the
   assignment of Germany, Italy and China to the same ontological category
   (tong lei).},

Title = {Maritime Strategies in the European Union for the Indo-Pacific - What
   Role for Africa?},
Journal = {STRATEGIC REVIEW FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {46-60},
Abstract = {The European Union and its member states have developed a set of
   strategies for the Indo-Pacific region. Recognising that regions are
   constantly subject to reinterpretation, negotiation, and contestation,
   this paper analyses the EU's framing of the Indo-Pacific as an exercise
   in territorial delineation, justifications for interference, projected
   regional attributes, and relations with actors in the region. Particular
   attention is dedicated to the role attributed to the African countries
   constituting the western shore of the IndoPacific.
   The paper examines the four Indo-Pacific strategies that have emerged
   since the EU 2018 within, namely the strategies launched by France,
   Germany, the Netherlands, and the EU. It highlights and compares the
   differences and similarities between them and argues that although the
   four strategies agree on many priorities, especially commercial
   interests, there are notable differences in terms of projected military
   involvement and the framing of China. Considerable divergences unfold
   with respect to Africa, both regarding its belonging to the Indo-Pacific
   and the role it is expected to play. Only the EU and French documents
   develop a strategic approach towards Africa, notably through regional
   organisations. Yet they concede little agency to the African actors.
   Given the fragmented and unilateral approach of the four strategies, the
   scope for Euro-African collaboration in the Indo-Pacific remains
   uncertain.},

Abstract = {The European integration project, after 70 years of the successful
   implementation, is now facing a significant number of difficulties
   caused by the process of globalization. The list of these difficulties
   includes: (1) the incompleteness of the process of formation of the
   European identity; (2) the deepening contradiction between two
   fundamental legal principles - transnational and national
   constitutionalism; (3) the growing asymmetry between the European
   regions; (4) dramatic disputes over migration issues; (5) the
   ideological confrontation between liberal and illiberal democracies.
   This situation, exacerbated by the challenges of globalization and
   officially defined today as the ``existential crisis{''} of the EU,
   revealed certain significant flaws in the current integration model hung
   between confederalism and federalism. The shortcomings, such as weakened
   democratic legitimacy, ineffective decision-making and the absence of
   clear and stable European leadership, have resulted in the growing
   spread of Euroscepticism and right-wing populism, as well as the erosion
   of Europe's mission in the world.
   The increasingly obvious threat of a loss of political balance in
   Eu-rope makes it important to comprehend the potential directions and
   scope of changes in the EU integration project, to assess the
   hypothetically possible le-gal and institutional forms of the new
   integration model and their political im-plications. The author
   describes the current situation as a Machiavellian mo-ment in Europe:
   under the conditions when the preservation of the status quo only
   reinforces the contradictions within the integration project, the
   European elites are faced with the necessity to make a clear choice
   between a confederal and a federal system in order to find a new
   legitimizing formula for this fading project, and it should be done as
   soon as possible.},

Abstract = {The war in Ukraine poses an exceptionally dangerous risk of major
   escalation by design, accident or miscalculation. However, the causes
   and drivers of the war are far from exceptional, being struggles over
   how to imagine, name, organize, and control space at local, regional
   (subnational), national and international scales. Advocating a geography
   that is ``for peace,{''} this article uses a transscalar conception of
   how conflict and peace are interrelated within states and
   internationally. Analyzing a number of key Russian government speeches
   and legal texts, it identifies major political geographical elements of
   the conflict and, drawing on comparative examples, proposes creative
   ways in which they might be addressed as part of negotiations.},

Abstract = {This article explores the multi-faceted, contextual, and ambivalent
   character of support relations between the LTTE and Tamil civilians. It
   demonstrates how distinct support patterns emerge from particular power
   constellations and manifestations of violence in the localities where
   respondents lived and interacted with the LTTE. The social ties between
   respondents whose political socialization was shaped by the escalation
   of the conflict and who, later, lived in government controlled areas
   were predominately based on a sense of political representation and
   characterized by subtle notions of socio-spatial distance; by contrast,
   for interviewees living in militarily contested zones, fear and coercion
   but also affective connections to LTTE members played a crucial role in
   their interactions with and orientations towards the LTTE. Lastly, in
   LTTE controlled areas, notions of support oscillated between perceptions
   of effective service provision and fear of recruitment.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {80-89},
Abstract = {Asian waters have been particularly affected by a high number of piracy
   incidents during the last three decades. Against the backdrop of
   established international legal frameworks to combat piracy, states have
   created additional regional fora of cooperation. Existing theoretical
   contributions on the regime complex of counter-piracy consider this
   institutional frame-work to be highly fragmented and regard it as an
   impediment to effective cooperation, but empirical evidence is yet
   lacking. To systematically analyze the development of piracy incidents
   in Asia, I draw on incident data from 2001 to 2021. Results show that
   the effect of counter-piracy cooperation is indeed not as negative as
   hypothesized by the regime complex lit-erature. However, a positive
   effect cannot easily be quantified either. Discussing possible
   explanations for this finding, I suggest that instead of unorganized
   fragmentation, counter-piracy governance in Asia may rather be
   characterized by a functional differentiation between regional
   cooperation mechanisms, which can be expected to be more conducive to
   effective cooperation.},

Abstract = {This essay examines the attitude of the president of the Republic,
   Francesco Cossiga, regarding article 11 of the Italian Constitution
   during the Gulf crisis of 1990-1991. Cossiga saw the provisions of
   article 11 as the fundamental legal parameter to evaluate every military
   Italian involvement in the Gulf and he inspired the political and
   military choices of the Andreotti's Government to this parameter. From
   the beginning of the crisis, the Italian Government sent a naval
   military mission to the Gulf to take part in the enforcement of economic
   sanctions against Iraq deliber-ated by the United Nations Security
   Council. Cossiga opposed sending ground-based forces to Saudi Arabia,
   because it was incompatible with article 11; he then suggested the
   dispatch of a unit of Tornado aircrafts with the only purpose of
   supporting the naval contingent. Cossiga also did not consider lawful
   the use of Italian forces to cooperate in the US military operations
   within the framework of the Atlantic Alliance. In the views of Cossiga
   and Andreotti, every economic sanction or military operation had to be
   deliberated and enforced within the UN's legal system, which constituted
   one of the rare exceptions to the repudiation of war prescribed by the
   Constitution.},

Abstract = {In presidential democracies with strong party systems, the congress
   shares legis-lative powers with the executive, and parties strongly
   influence the behavior of legislators. The law-making process should
   reflect that balance of power, as the reactive legislative powers of
   Congress should make committee membership less valuable than in systems
   where the legislature enjoys proactive powers. The strong party system
   and electoral rules should also be reflected in committee assignment
   dynamics. We test 4 hypotheses on the impact of individual
   (distributional and in-formational theories) and party level incentives
   (cartel party and issue ownership theories) on annual committee
   membership in the Chamber of Deputies in Chile (1990-2018). District and
   legislator specific characteristics-like the economic acti-vity in the
   district and the legislator's professional expertise,
   respectively-explain committee membership. In some policy dimensions,
   parties that exercise issue ow-nership also have more presence in the
   respective committees.},

Abstract = {In spite of its immense global impact, Republicans and Democrats
   disagree on how serious a problem the coronavirus pandemic is. One
   likely reason is the political elites to whom partisans listen. As a
   means of shoring up support, President Trump largely downplayed but at
   times hyped the severity of the virus. Do these messages influence the
   perceived seriousness of the virus's death toll, how the president is
   evaluated as well as support for and compliance with social distancing
   guidelines? Results suggest that Republican identifiers had by early
   June crystallized their views on the virus's seriousness, the
   president's performance, and social distancing policies and behaviors.
   Unexpectedly, information critical of President Trump's policy decisions
   produced a backlash causing people to show less concern about the
   virus's death toll and rate the president's performance even more
   highly.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research was to analyze the problems of preservation
   and reproduction of physical and psychological integrity of a person in
   extreme conditions and, at the same time, to identify the patterns of
   formation of a complete personality, since today there is a lot of
   stress, depression and physical fatigue. In extreme situations of
   martial law and instability, we do our best to overcome the problems of
   physical and psychological incongruity and personality crisis. The
   methodology consists in the use of methods such as: analytical, logical,
   historical, comparative, axiological, which contribute to the
   identification of problems addressed. The object of the research means
   or implies a set of humanitarian tasks that correspond to the processes
   of formation of the integrity of the individual. The novelty lies in the
   understanding of objective processes of reproduction of physical and
   psychological integrity of the individual in extreme conditions,
   including wars, crises, uncertainty, instability, informational
   similarity, which are analyzed in terms of interconnection,
   interdependence and development, the overcoming of which contributes to
   the integrity of the individual and social welfare.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The research on electoral accountability after corruption scandals has
   focused on the punishment of the incumbent party. The literature
   consensus is that scandals damage the incumbent party's electoral
   performance, but only mildly. However, the literature has not inquired
   the damage corruption scandals might do to the established parties'
   electoral performance, aside from the incumbent party's. Using
   time-series cross-sectional data from the Mexican states, I suggest that
   corruption scandals, besides possibly harming the incumbent party's
   electoral performance, might damage the established parties' electoral
   performance. Corruption scandals therefore could have an
   anti-establishment effect, not only an anti-incumbent effect.},

Abstract = {This contribution explores how specific methods of artistic production
   are to be employed in a positive agenda aimed at promoting citizens'
   identification with the European Union. The novelty brought by the
   elaborated framework is that it allows to design a strategy through
   which citizens are encouraged to question the naturalised understandings
   of `being European', and to do so outside of their conscious efforts. I
   argue that the resulting process of meaning making, in virtue of not
   being influenced by predetermined idealistic constructions, allows us to
   think about Europe and a European identity without creating - and
   systematically excluding - a ``non-European Other{''}.},

Abstract = {Widespread fear that hosting refugees will mean more terrorism in host
   states is at the heart of the ``refugee crisis.{''} Yet, we lack
   rigorous evidence for such claims. This article theoretically unpacks
   how and under what conditions transnational refugee movements plausibly
   lead to different types of terrorist outcomes. Combining original data
   with a multi-pronged approach involving a treatment-placebo design as
   well as instrumental variable estimation, we provide systematic and
   robust evidence that sheds new light on the security implications of
   transnational forced migration. Our findings challenge the claim that
   hosting refugees heightens the risk of ``importing{''} terrorist attacks
   against nationals of host countries, especially in developed countries.
   However, in these countries, refugees themselves are particularly prone
   to becoming the targets of terrorist attacks by natives, who are driven
   by fear. Dominant policy responses to the refugee crisis that raise
   fears and suspicions are therefore not only unsuitable, but potentially
   counterproductive.},

Abstract = {The filiation of children born abroad through surrogacy has undergone an
   interesting evolution. After the initial refusal of the French and
   Spanish high courts to recognize such filiation, the jurisprudence of
   the European Court of Human Rights related to the right to private and
   family life has led them to reconsider their initial positions. This is
   especially visible in the jurisprudential evolution of the French Court
   of Cassation, which today is more advanced in the matter than that of
   the Strasbourg Court itself. Other European national authorities have
   refused to transcribe the filiation of children of same-sex couples, in
   defense of traditional marriage. And this time it has been the Court of
   Justice of the European Union who, under the protection of the free
   movement of citizens of the Union and their families, has imposed the
   duty for such parentage to be recognized by the Member States. What is
   being imposed in one way or another is the best interest of the minor,
   which obliges national authorities to go so far as to inapply state
   precepts with the force of law.},

   Perceived Dirty Campaigning},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {247-260},
Abstract = {Uncivil campaigning and deceitful campaign techniques are increasingly
   relevant phenomena in politics. However, it remains unclear how they
   share an underlying component and how partisanship can influence their
   associations with democratic outcomes. We introduce the concept of dirty
   campaigning, which is situated at the intersection of research on
   negative campaigning and political scandals. Dirty campaigning involves
   violations of social norms and liberal-democratic values between elite
   political actors in terms of style and practices, such as uncivil
   campaigning and deceitful campaign techniques. In a two-wave panel study
   (N = 634) during the 2021 German federal election campaign, we
   investigate the associations of perceived dirty campaigning by the least
   and most favorite party with distrust in politicians, trust in
   democ-racy, attitudes toward dirty campaigning regulation, as well as
   perceived harmful consequences of dirty campaigning for democracy. We
   find that perceived dirty campaigning by the least favorite party
   increases perceptions of harmful con-sequences of dirty campaigning for
   democracy over time. In contrast, perceived dirty campaigning by the
   most favorite party decreases perceptions of harmful consequences of
   dirty campaigning for democracy as well as attitudes toward dirty
   campaigning regulation over time. Perceptions of harmful consequences of
   dirty campaigning for democracy increase dis-trust in politicians over
   time and vice versa. Our findings suggest that the outcomes of dirty
   campaigning can depend on partisanship and can have important
   implications for the quality of democracy.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes, through image, the different nuances,
   transgressions and projections that establish memory in the spaces,
   uses, objects and daily practices observed in the rural inhabitants of
   Ciudad Bolivar. The image is understood here as a mental and graphic
   instrument that provokes processes of remembering and forgetting, and a
   tool capable of producing a series of cartographies and narratives that
   show the particular forms used by this community to make memory. The way
   in which an image becomes a memory and a narration with the possibility
   of being expressed and shared, makes effective the building of an
   investigative proposal that installs the necessary scenarios and tools
   to reflect on the memory and the way community intervened it. The
   objective of this research is to analyze the images that make up the
   processes of memory and forgetfulness in the inhabitants of the
   Pasquilla village, with the purpose of designing and developing a
   cartography that des- cribes the forms of memory that are manifested
   through the narrative.},

Abstract = {Word embeddings are becoming popular for political science research, yet
   we know little about their properties and performance. To help scholars
   seeking to use these techniques, we explore the effects of key parameter
   choices-including context window length, embedding vector dimensions,
   and pretrained versus locally fit variants on the efficiency and quality
   of inferences possible with these models. Reassuringly we show that
   results are generally robust to such choices for political corpora of
   various sizes and in various languages. Beyond reporting extensive
   technical findings, we provide a novel crowdsourced ``Turing
   test{''}-style method for examining the relative performance of any two
   models that produce substantive, text-based outputs. Our results are
   encouraging: popular, easily available pretrained embeddings perform at
   a level close to-or surpassing-both human coders and more complicated
   locally fit models. For completeness, we provide best practice advice
   for cases where local fitting is required.},

Abstract = {Intensifying US-China rivalry has heightened the risk of accidental
   crises that might spiral out of control. Even as President Biden
   continues much of the Trump administration's confrontational approach to
   China, senior Biden administration officials agree on the strategic
   imperative of improving the risk reduction mechanisms between Beijing
   and Washington. Though the odds of armed conflict arising from
   deliberate provocations may be low, the risks of spinoff crises in
   China's periphery and accidental crises in emerging domains like space
   and cyberspace have grown in recent years. Amid growing geopolitical and
   geoeconomic tensions, better crisis management serves the interests of
   China, the United States, and the world at large. Beijing should
   maintain its effective deterrence by upholding the ``security through
   mutual trust{''} principle and laying out clear red lines. It should
   also resist Washington's efforts to include illegitimate interests and
   conduct risk reduction mechanisms and promote multilateral security
   talks on the codes of conduct in space, cyberspace, and other emerging
   domains.},

Abstract = {The article approaches the genre of communist heroic biography in the
   1930s, particularly in Spain. It starts from the notable weight that the
   << biocratic >> and biographical vector and transnational perspectives
   have acquired in recent years in the international historiography on
   communism. Using a comparative methodology, it analyses a range of
   accounts of the personal that appeared in Spanish in those years, either
   in the form of translations with wide circulation in the international
   communist space or as original texts generated from the national
   singularity. The study highlights several aspects: the empathetic,
   exemplary, didactic and socializing functions of these narratives; the
   coupling between particularities and shared meanings in the communist
   culture; the location of these stories in a << glocal >> -global and
   local- context, typical of anti-fascism; or their involvement in the
   magma of the personality cult, an essential feature of communist
   identity based on the power of charisma and the political-symbolic
   capital generated by the image of an idyllic convergence of individual
   trajectory, collective and party.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to note the unsatisfactory functioning of
   political parties in Spain, their increasingly autocratic and oligarchic
   nature and their lack of compliance with the constitutional mandate
   regarding their due internal democracy. In the context of the
   increasingly frequent primary processes for the election of candidates
   in Spanish political parties, one of the main obstacles faced by those
   within the party who dispute the power of the governing structures of
   political parties is related to the access and management of the
   register of affiliates. Faced with requests from candidates from outside
   the organization to have access to this essential information in order
   to make effective their rights to political participation and internal
   party democracy, party leaders deny access to the census, invoking
   compliance with regulations on personal data protection. In this regard,
   it is analyzed how ordinary courts that have had the opportunity to rule
   on this type of conflict have favored the application of the protection
   of personal data based on an interpretation considered exorbitant which,
   ignoring the context of the problem raised and disregarding an adequate
   analysis in accordance with the principle of proportionality, represents
   a clear undermining of the other fundamental rights at stake and the
   constitutional mandate regarding the internal democracy of the parties.},

Title = {The Challenges of Reconstructing Citizen-Driven EU Contestation in the
   Digital Media Sphere},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {97-107},
Abstract = {This article reflects on the discursive representation, legal, and
   practical challenges of locating, classifying, and publishing citizens'
   views of the EU in digital media discourse. We start with the discursive
   representation challenge of locating and identifying citizens' voices in
   social and news media discourse. The second set of challenges pertains
   to the legal, regula-tory framework guiding research ethics on personal
   data but also cuts across the academic debate on what constitutes
   ``public{''} discourse in the digital public sphere. The third set of
   challenges are practical but of no less consequence. Here we bring in
   the issue of marketisation of the public sphere and of the digital
   commons, and how these processes affect the ethics but also the
   feasibility and reliability of digital public sphere analysis. Thereby
   we illustrate that barriers to content analysis can make data collection
   practically challenging, feeding dilemmas with data reliability and
   research ethics. These methodological and empirical challenges are
   illustrated and unpacked with examples from the Benchmark project, which
   analysed the extent to which citizens drive EU contestation on social
   and digital news media. Our study focuses on UK public discourse on a
   possible European Economic Area solution, and the reactions such
   discourse may have triggered in two EU-associated countries, Norway and
   Switzerland, in the post-Brexit referendum period 2016-2019. We thus
   take a broad European perspective of EU contestation that is not
   strictly confined within the EU public sphere(s). The case study
   illustrates the research process and the emerging empirical challenges
   and concludes with reflections and practical sug-gestions for future
   research projects.},

Title = {CIVIL FREEDOMS OR POLITICAL COMPETITION: WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF
   DEMOCRACY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS?},

Abstract = {Today most researchers agree that democratic regimes are superior in
   producing technological innovations to authoritarian regimes, despite
   the fact that the question of the influence of the type of political
   regime on economic growth and its most important component, such as
   innovative activity, remains debatable. At the same time, there are
   several alternative, although not mutually exclusive, hypotheses about
   what causes this superiority. One hypothesis suggests institutions that
   ensure political competition, and above all, competitive elections, are
   of key importance. According to another hypothesis, the main
   prerequisite for innovative development lies in the provision for rights
   and freedoms of citizens.
   The article attempts to test these hypotheses empirically in order to
   determine which one of them possesses a greater explanatory power. To
   perform this task, the author employed a method of multi-level
   regression, which allows taking into account factors at the level of
   countries, as well as that of individual firms.
   The research conducted by the author shows that the presence of
   competitive elections is not a sufficient condition for innovative
   development. In contrast, the provision of civil freedoms is a
   statistically significant predictor. Thus, the liberal aspect of
   democracy is more important than its electoral as-pect for producing
   technological innovations.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to explore the political organization
   of space - the ways in which space and human interaction in space are
   structured to fulfill political functions - as it relates to the central
   theme or modern geography: the spatial organization of human society.
   This is a subject which, despite its obvious importance, has received
   relatively little direct and systematic attention from geographers or
   other social scientists. The political geography remains firmly locked
   into the ``statist{''} tradition within geography, with its emphasis on
   areal differentiation and description of unique characteristics. This
   study is not aimed at substituting a new orthodoxy for and old one. Nor
   is it meant to encompass the full breadth of interest in political
   geography. Its fundamental objective is to explore a few new paths and
   to suggest a framework of concepts and themes which may possibly link
   political geography more effectively with recent methodological and
   philosophical developments in geography itself and in the other social
   sciences. Perhaps most important, its ultimate goal is to involve the
   reader, to make him aware of the political organization of space, of the
   way himself perceives this organizations, and how it affects his own
   activity and behavior.},

Abstract = {Why do some regional entrepreneurs engage in conflicts with the heads of
   the subnational units of the Russian Federation within a system that
   puts economic elites in a deliberately unequal position in relation to
   the authorities? Based on the analysis of conflicts between governors
   and busi-nessmen in Karelia, the author hypothesizes that contradictions
   around re-distribution, combined with the availability of the
   independent resources e.g., branchy patronal networks, drive such
   confrontation. According to the author's conclusion, the federal center
   also plays a significant role. When de-ciding whether to start
   confrontation with governors, regional actors could count on the support
   from Moscow and resignation of an undesirable regional leader. However,
   due to the peculiarity of the external environment, primari-ly
   institutional and informational, the rationality of such behavior often
   turns out to be low. The opaque informal rules, which electoral
   authoritarianism relies upon, affect the ability of actors to create
   adequate cognitive schemata. The informational environment, in which the
   regional elites operate, sends them unclear and contradictory signals
   about the limits of acceptable actions and their possible consequences.
   In turn, the formal preservation of an insti-tution of elections and
   parties leads to the formation of identities that narrow the set of
   available behavioral strategies. The mechanism of mutual learning does
   not work either: under conditions when the resources available to
   coun-ter-actors cannot be verified, and the rules of the game change
   with a gover-nor's turnover, reliance on the previous experience is
   fraught with strategic miscalculations.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the Constitutional Court's manifestations of
   self-restraint, that is, those areas in which, within the margin granted
   by the Constitution and the law, the Court has shown deference to the
   actions of the judicial bodies, seeking to draw the perimeter that is
   proper to its actions. There are some cases in which, if we speak of
   self-restraint, it would be in an improper sense because deference to
   the ordinary jurisdiction is a normative requirement of the
   Constitutional Court Act (LOTC). In other areas, which we could call
   self-restraint proper, the self-limitation is expressed in constructions
   of the Constitutional Court itself, without prejudice to the fact that
   they are ultimately anchored in the position that the Constitution
   reserves for the Constitutional Court, the ordinary jurisdiction, and
   the Supreme Court.},

Abstract = {During the Covid-19 pandemic, in order to reduce infections and
   consequences, various public policies are implemented, including
   messages to develop desirable prevention behaviors. Behavioral economics
   theory points out the importance of considering people's cognitive
   biases that distance them from rational decisions and have a negative
   impact on the implementation of suitable behaviors. The present research
   work carried out a qualitative content analysis in messages to combat
   the spread of the COVID-19 disease, which the Government of Mexico
   transmitted through the internet. Infographics and official videos were
   analyzed to identify if the contributions of behavioral economics were
   considered. The analysis made it possible to identify the biases that
   were most present and the behavioral tools that sought to mitigate them,
   but still in a limited way. The benefits of considering this theoretical
   approach when designing and evaluating these messages are recognized.},

Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {298-315},
Abstract = {After the October 2021 elections to the Chamber of Deputies in the Czech
   Republic, the most discussed topic has been preferential voting due to
   the surprising results for the coalition of the Czech Pirate Party and
   the Mayors and Independents. This fact led us to pursue a comprehensive
   analysis of preferential voting in the Czech Republic. Taking a broad
   perspective, this study of the Czech Republic explores the mechanisms of
   preferential voting in flexible-party lists. Preferential voting is
   analysed at the party-electorate level. This article proves that a
   flexible-party list system can have significantly different results
   compared to other systems in accordance with the number of votes per
   voter and the threshold for candidates. It also finds evidence that
   sub-party competition is significantly higher for coalitions where the
   degree of preferential voting is higher. The ideological stance of a
   political party does not play a role in the use of preferential votes.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE INVESTIGACIONES POLITICAS Y SOCIOLOGICAS},
Year = {2022},

Number = {1},
Abstract = {William H. McNeill initiated the debate on the rise of the West, which
   engendered a wide range of studies from different disciplines and
   perspectives. Among these approaches are institutional explanations.
   However, these contributions overlook the role of the territorial State.
   For this reason, this paper aims to clarify how this form of State
   influenced the triumph of western civilization. In this regard, this
   article approaches the topic from a geopolitical standpoint. It begins
   with setting out the most prominent theories of the origin of the State
   and continues by discussing the analytical framework. The paper's core
   argument is that the territorial State introduced a critical shift in
   the organization of the space, which entailed the strengthening of its
   internal capabilities to mobilize and extract resources. In this way,
   the territorial State boosted military spending, which led to military
   revolutions. As a result, western powers attained strategic superiority
   over the Chinese and Ottoman empires. These empires were unable to
   gather enough resources to catch up with the European States due to how
   they organized space.},

Abstract = {The progress achieved in women's rights and gender equality has become
   the target of a backlash driven by ``anti-gender{''} activists and
   right-wing populists across EU member states. To a large extent, this
   conflict takes place in the digital and social media spheres,
   illustrating the new mediatized logic of value contestation. Therefore,
   we ask to what extent are the debates about gender equality on Twitter
   similar in three European countries, and how do users engage in these
   debates? We examine these questions by collecting Twitter data around
   the 2021 International Women's Day in Germany, Italy, and Poland. First,
   we show that the debate remains nationally segmented and is
   predominantly supportive of gender equality. While citizens engage with
   the gender equality value online, they do so in a prevailingly
   acclamatory fashion. In contrast, political and societal actors show
   higher levels of engagement with the value and receive more interactions
   on Twitter. Our study highlights the relevance of national contexts to
   the analysis of (transnational) social media debates and the limited
   political engagement of citizens on Twitter across Europe. We also
   critically discuss the strengths and weaknesses of a cross-country
   social media comparison.},

Abstract = {Linguistic pluralism in literature as well as in everyday life is a
   characteristic of Ukraine. This relaxed multilingualism is a legacy of
   the multi-ethnic European empires to which the country belonged
   throughout its history., In Western Europe, however, this was often seen
   as a sign of unfinished nation-building. Only recently has the German
   public discovered the positive potential of Ukraine's linguistic
   diversity. This applies in particular to the field of literature, where
   multilingualism has produced a special richness of forms and timbres.
   However, the war that Russia thrust upon Ukraine in February 2022 also
   threatens to destroy this unique mobility and openness.},

Title = {Political Theory Rediscovers Public Administration},
Journal = {ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {21-42},
Abstract = {Political theory is rediscovering the colossus of public
   administration-the vast public service and regulatory bureaucracies and
   their countless employees and extensions that conduct the daily business
   of government. This review explains how something so visible could ever
   have fallen from view, and surveys four burgeoning areas of research.
   These pertain to the legitimacy of public administration, to the
   articulation of standards of good government distinct from good public
   policy, to the analysis of how the moral agency of bureaucrats is
   implicated and undermined by the everyday operation of bureaucratic
   agencies, and to how we should conceptualize the state when we apprehend
   it through the seemingly banal routines of administration. What emerges
   from this body of work is a picture of the executive bureaucracy as an
   object of normative, critical, and conceptual inquiry on a par with the
   other two branches of government, the legislature and the judiciary.},

Title = {NEW REGIONALISM AND OLD ISSUES IN THE MIDDLE EAST},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2022},
Number = {6},
Pages = {55-66},
Abstract = {The concept of regionalism is based on identity, i.e. the cultural,
   historical, political association of individuals, peoples, states,
   leaders with a certain region. Regionalization is associated with
   institution-building or the conclusion of formal agreements which are
   sometimes substituted or supplemented by informal ties. The article
   analyzes the processes of regionalization in the Middle East.
   Regionalization in the Middle East is affected by contradictory trends.
   The Middle East has always been considered a highly conflict-prone zone,
   little affected by changes in the external environment. The conflicts
   themselves have become the system-forming elements, which in their own
   way tightened this space and ensured the building of coalitions and
   alliances. Modern conflicts, most of which have become rapidly
   internationalizing intra-state confrontations, and the general increase
   in militarization are still eminent characteristics of the Middle East
   subsystem of international relations. At the same time, the trends
   towards the rapprochement of individual opponents and normalization are
   becoming clearer, and their further development could possibly play an
   integration role in the future. The involvement of both states and
   non-state or quasi-state actors in these processes is noteworthy. There
   is a growing independence of the leading regional states as well as an
   activation of small countries driven by their national interests. The
   continued fragmentation of the Middle East cannot be equaled to the
   absence of common features of regional identity and interdependence of
   states. It also does not exclude the attempts of different parties to
   develop group strategies in response to common challenges. The building
   of new logistics and transport routes, the expansion of trade and
   economic relations between individual countries have all contributed to
   the regionalization of the Middle East.},

Abstract = {The direction and extent of corporate governance reforms in any country
   are determined by its ownership and corporate control structure. Three
   forms of markets in corporate control could be distinguished. The first
   is the external market for corporate control, closely associated with
   the dispersed, outsider-dominated ownership systems of the UK and the
   US. The second form is the insider market for the purchase and sale of
   blocks of shares in family-owned firms in Continental Europe and Asia.
   The third form, which is observed in Japan, is the internal markets in
   which managers reorganize their ownership structure. Under this
   framework, this study examines the relationship between corporate
   governance reforms, and ownership and control in twenty-first century
   Japan.},

Abstract = {Because research and communication proficiency is ubiquitous in the
   academic and professional world, teaching students the necessary
   information literacy (IL) and visual literacy (VL) skills has become
   increasingly important. Integrating IL and VL pedagogy into substantive
   coursework can enhance students' comprehension of the material and teach
   them to make a meaningful contribution to public awareness and
   understanding of political science. Yet, faculty often find it
   challenging to include instruction in these skills with necessary
   coverage of substantive course material. This article discusses the use
   of an infographic assignment in an introductory American government
   course as a tool to teach literacy skills and to reinforce substantive

Title = {Emotional Sensibility: Exploring the Methodological and Ethical
   Implications of Research Participants' Emotions},

Abstract = {Although political science increasingly investigates emotions as
   variables, it often ignores emotions' larger significance due to their
   inherence in research with human subjects. Integrating emotions into
   conversations on methods and ethics, I build on the term ``ethnographic
   sensibility{''} to conceptualize an ``emotional sensibility{''} that
   seeks to glean the emotional experiences of people who participate in
   research. Methodologically, emotional sensibility sharpens attention to
   how participants' emotions are data, influence other data, and affect
   future data collection. Ethically, it supplements Institutional Review
   Boards' rationalist emphasis on information and cognitive capacity with
   appreciation for how emotions infuse consent, risk, and benefit. It
   thereby encourages thinking not only about emotional harm but also about
   emotions apart from harm and about emotional harms apart from trauma and
   vulnerability. I operationalize emotional sensibility by tracking four
   dimensions of research that affect participants' emotions: the content
   of research, the context in which research occurs, researchers'
   positionality, and researchers' conduct.},

Title = {Sentience and salience - exploring the party politicization of animal
   welfare in multi-level electoral systems: Analysis of manifesto
   discourse in UK meso elections 1998-2017},

Abstract = {This study explores the party politicization of animal welfare in the
   context of multi-level governance in the UK. It examines over 1300
   pledges in party manifestos for Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish
   elections 1998-2017. It reveals the nature of party competition,
   including increasing salience over electoral cycles. This is
   complemented by examination of the party dynamics in two sub-fields:
   wildlife protection and farm animal welfare. The wider significance of
   this study lies in showing how the move to multi-level electoral
   politics provides new political spaces to advance animal welfare and how
   meso-ballots are increasingly attuned to the symbiosis of humans and
   animals. These factors are driving the territorialization of policy and
   leading to distinctive animal welfare regimes in the different countries
   of the UK. In addition, partisan theory reveals how the electoral
   politics of animal welfare varies between sub-fields and is shaped by
   parties' relationships with different policy communities.},

Abstract = {The rotating EU presidency's relevance for EU politics has decreased
   since the introduction of a permanent council president. However, news
   salience and framing of the own government acting as the EU presidency
   can amplify publicity for EU affairs. We, therefore, evaluate the
   visibility and framing of the EU presidency in 12 Austrian newspapers
   for 2009-2019. We conduct an automated text analysis of 22 presidencies
   over 11 years, testing several hypotheses statistically, and qualify
   results via manually coded frames of the Austrian EU presidency in 2018.
   The results confirm the crucial importance of the domestication of EU
   politics, underscoring the potential of the presidency to serve as a
   window of opportunity for public debate. We discuss our findings with
   reference to the EU's democratic deficit.},

Title = {Revolution and restoration in post-war East Asia: A Gramscian approach
   to the `history problem'},
Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {48},

Pages = {135-156},

Abstract = {While tensions over historical issues between Japan and South Korea have
   long served to impede US strategic goals in East Asia, mainstream
   International Relations theory has largely been unable to explain the
   stubborn persistence of such issues. Instead, I interpret East Asia's
   post-war history through the lens of Gramsci's concept of passive
   revolution, thereby situating the `history problem' in the context of
   the dialectical relations between state (re)formation, geopolitical
   contestation and transnational capital accumulation in the post-war era.
   I argue that US intervention in 1945 was a process in which a set of
   state-society relations was established whereby democratising tendencies
   from below were repressed through the establishment of US-aligned
   capitalist regimes. This implied the partial restoration of certain
   aspects of the pre-1945 regimes in a manner that served to forestall any
   genuine coming to terms with past colonial history. Gramsci's concept of
   passive revolution thus provides a framework for rethinking how
   bilateral relations between countries can be explained with reference to
   the broader dynamics of geopolitical contestation, transnational capital
   accumulation and the dynamics of state-society contestation within
   national social formations. While existing empirical applications of
   passive revolution have typically focused on particular national
   instances of state formation and transformation, I argue that the
   concept can be utilised to analyse the region-wide processes whereby the
   US empire was established in the aftermath of the Second World War, and
   by extension, how supranational processes of passive revolution
   subsequently generated their own tensions and contradictions as
   manifested in contested bilateral relations between states.},

Abstract = {The long duree narrative of the state in independent India is one of
   accumulation of incremental and aggregate power relations arrayed in and
   through political institutions inhabiting a field of power. These
   relationships are protean, exhibiting conflicts and contestations among
   institutions that compete for power within the domain of the state. The
   `ebbs' and `flows' in power are visible in the state-space represented
   by institutional arrangements and the patterns of relationship among
   them. While institutions perform the function of legitimation for the
   state, they also manifest the crisis that besets the state, reflecting
   dissonance between its moral-political goals of bringing about
   socio-economic transformation and its ability to achieve them through
   `state-bureaucratic' practices. The constitutional state in India can be
   seen as the setting where the state-idea as limited by law and as an
   `instrument' for bringing about transformative change was situated.
   Institutional crises during the emergency and the uneven trajectories of
   institutional presence in the ensuing period show the marginalization of
   institutions such as Parliament and the ambivalence of the judiciary in
   articulating the principles underlying the constitutional consensus. A
   dominative presence of the executive corroding deliberative spaces
   making them sites of adversarial combat and the populist appeal of the
   `leader' drawing upon communitarian emotions has paved the way for a
   majoritarian state.},

Abstract = {Stigmatisation has been recognised as a major factor influencing the
   fortunes of populist radical right (PRR) parties. While scholars have
   examined it by taking parties as units of analysis, this study focuses
   on the individual level by asking Which PRR party members are more
   likely to feel stigmatised? After offering a novel theoretical
   explanation for feelings of stigmatisation based on the personal
   networks in which PRR grassroots members are embedded, it then
   investigates stigma using an original membership survey of about 7,000
   members of the Sweden Democrats (SD) and interviews with 30 of them. The
   survey results show that the higher the educational qualification PRR
   grassroots members have achieved, the more likely they will feel
   stigmatised. In addition, those who have never had any relatives and/or
   friends in the SD, and those who are employed in the public sector, are
   more likely to consider membership discrediting. The interview data shed
   light on the survey results, by illustrating how public employees and
   university students find it hard to be open about their membership as
   they are surrounded by people with left-wing views. By contrast, having
   relatives and/or friends who are members of the party reduces the stigma
   of joining PRR parties, becoming active in them, and talking about
   politics in public. Along with countering some of the prevailing wisdom
   about stigmatisation in PRR parties, the findings contribute to our
   understanding of PRR grassroots membership, which has long been an
   overlooked topic in the literature.},

Journal = {STATE POLITICS \& POLICY QUARTERLY},

Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-47},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Why have some states adopted policies expanding ballot access while
   others have restricted access to the ballot? Since the 1990s, some
   states have been adopting policies restricting access to the ballot such
   as requiring identification. At the same time, states have been adopting
   a variety of registration reforms that lower the barriers to
   registration and voting. Using an original, 45-state dataset, we examine
   state innovation within the policy domain of electoral reforms in US
   states. We find reforms have an independent and, sometimes, negative
   effect on the innovation of states in electoral reforms. Next, we use
   dyad analysis to examine the spread of a single policy: automatic voter
   registration. We find that the propensity to innovate both within and
   across a state makes the spread of automatic voter registration more
   likely. Our paper contributes to the broader understanding of why states
   adopt electoral reforms.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the citizenship of both nationals and
   non-nationals. We define citizenship as a contested membership among all
   populations within the territory of a state, encompassing the status,
   rights, and performativity of the people. We look at changes in the
   citizenship of non-nationals, particularly the most vulnerable:
   undocumented migrants. Despite long-standing discrimination against
   undocumented migrants, the COVID-19 pandemic compelled the South Korean
   government to reconsider its policies on their citizenship rights. The
   government provided free tests and treatments, and free vaccinations to
   the undocumented migrants who had long been ignored in South Korea. It
   also suspended immigration crackdowns and deportations. While these
   COVID-19 preventive measures were intended to address community safety,
   they also affected the multifaceted nature of citizenship by making
   everybody within the territory both the subject and object of
   quarantine. Do these measures indicate an expansion of South Korean
   citizenship to include undocumented migrants? We discuss what
   implications the South Korean government's pandemic-response policies
   may have for citizenship. With the increasing elasticity of citizenship
   boundaries in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we claim that
   territorial aspects have been given greater emphasis in the politics of
   South Korean citizenship.},

Abstract = {In democracies, policy ambitions hinge upon governments' ability to
   collect tax revenue from their citizens. Ongoing funding cuts at the
   Internal Revenue Service (IRS) undermine the US government's ability to
   fulfill this function. Yet, despite its central importance, funding for
   IRS enforcement activities has received scant scholarly attention,
   limiting our understanding of the factors that underlie public attitudes
   on this issue. In this article, we report the results of preregistered
   experiments that test whether citizens' attitudes regarding the IRS can
   be shaped by framing efforts. Specifically, we test both
   information-based and value-consistent frames that invoke partisans'
   core ideological concerns. Results show that these frames significantly
   increase public support for the IRS, as well as citizens' willingness to
   learn more and become politically active. Thus, to ensure state
   capacity, information about the consequences of IRS underfunding and
   appeals to partisans' ideological concerns can be implemented to
   increase support for tax collection.},

Abstract = {The study of political careers has focused mainly on highly
   institutionalized systems. This article examines the extent to which the
   findings from this research agenda apply to more fluid settings, looking
   at trajectories to the national cabinet in a regime combining
   presidentialism and federalism: Argentina from 1983 to 2020. We propose
   an operationalization of political career that integrates five
   definitional dimensions, looks at full sequences of single occupational
   positions, and tests six expectations derived from the literature. When
   only political jobs are taken into account, we found that careers show
   significant movement from the subnational level and predominance of
   executive experience. However, when all occupational jobs are
   considered, political positions are pulled into second place behind the
   private sector. Most unexpectedly, in a significant percentage of cases,
   a ministerial position does not appear to be the last step of a
   political career but rather an initial springboard thereof.},

Abstract = {How do European far-right parties reconcile their long-standing
   nationalism with their allegiance to European ``civilization{''}?
   Although they are certainly not contradictory, simultaneously adopting
   national and supranational identities requires considerable discursive
   maneuvering to articulate clearly. In this article, I argue that the
   European Far Right negotiates the boundaries between its national and
   supranational identities through two discursive mechanisms, abstraction
   and embedding, which present civilizationism as nonthreatening to and
   partially constituted by nationalism. Specifically, abstraction links
   European civilization to general features of a shared heritage, whereas
   embedding connects civilization to elements of the nationalist
   repertoire. I demonstrate the Far Right's monopolization of
   civilizational discourse and use of these twin mechanisms through
   quantitative and qualitative analyses of more than 1,000 party
   manifestos and more than 650,000 tweets. These findings contribute to
   the growing scholarly literature that treats civilizations as
   supranational ``imagined communities{''} and has implications for the
   study of nationalism, civilizationism, and the Far Right.},

Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},

Abstract = {During their early political socialization young people start to
   recognize their agency as political actors and to develop their
   political identity. This article presents the findings of a comparative
   study across different types of youth activism in two cities, Athens and
   Cologne, which differ in their youth cultures of participation and the
   opportunities they provide to mobilize. Our data derive from in-depth
   qualitative interviewing, which is considered to be most fruitful for
   the exploration of the reasons behind activists' trajectories. We
   identified three groups of influences: micro-, meso- and macro-level
   influences, with micro-level influences being most visible in the path
   of social movement-related activism, meso-level influences being
   dominant in the path of partisan activism, and macro-level influences
   prevailing in grassroots activism. Finally, the implications of the
   differential impact of the studied socio-spatial contexts are critically
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present and analyze public policy research
   in the context of the development of Croatian political science, while
   also probing the relationship between public policy research within
   political science and its application through other sciences and
   interdisciplinary areas in Croatia. After the introduction, in the first
   part of the paper, the concept of public policy is delineated and the
   development of the theoretical discourse that was formed around public
   policies as a rational system of state intervention in society that
   strives for good governance is presented. In the second part, the
   context -spe-cific development of public policy research within the
   framework of Croatian political science is analyzed and interpreted. In
   the third part, this develop-ment is linked to the examples of policy
   relevant research and teaching in other academic institutional foci and
   discourses that deal with public policies. In the conclusion, the
   current state of public policy research is evaluated and possible future
   directions of research development and academic influence on public
   policy making are outlined within and across the borders of politi-cal
   science. Our thesis - or, more precisely, a value-driven projection - is
   that in front of public policy as a theoretically and methodologically
   constituted subject of research and the political science
   sub-discipline, stronger interdis-ciplinary cooperation outside the
   framework of political science asserts itself as a major practical
   challenge ahead in the joint task of solving relevant public problems in
   the political community.},

Abstract = {As far as we know, in the only writing that Horacio Gonzalez explicitly
   dedicated to the philosophy of Spinoza, he detects in a motif of the
   Theological-Political Treatise, in the biblical reading of Spinoza, an
   ambivalence of great fruitfulness for a thought of the popular, not
   exempt from baroque connotations around mathematics, poetry and madness.
   This is a text included in a collective book that gathers the
   interventions that took place in a meeting organized by Gonzalez himself
   at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires in
   1999. The present paper takes as its object this brief writing, and
   compares it with the question of the baroque in Spinoza, taking
   especially into account the study developed by Marilena Chaui at the
   beginning of The Rib of the Real: Immanence and Freedom in Spinoza.},

Abstract = {Recent protests in Colombia, Ecuador, and Chile, as well as tense
   elections in Peru, Ecuador, and Chile, suggest strong polarization. At
   their heart lies a dispute for the development model. The plurality of
   factions and vindications underscore the plurality of development
   notions, rendering the situation a wicked problem. Grid group cultural
   theory makes sense of such complexity, identifying four irreducible
   cultures and their respective development models-illustrated by
   neoliberalism, the developmental state, multiple alternatives such as
   Sumak Kawsay, and a chimera. To address this problem effectively and
   legitimately, all models must be engaged to produce clumsy solutions.
   Further, each culture has its own pathway to harness this plurality.
   These are messy institutions whose shape, as well as that of clumsy
   development models, will depend on the relative power of each culture
   and the context in which they are located. It could be beneficial to
   incorporate these insights into research on and the practice of
   development governance in the Andean Region.},

Abstract = {Based on a qualitative and quantitative research design, this article
   examines the implementation of a morality policy - the medical cannabis
   policy in Switzerland - to investigate three understudied aspects of
   bureaucratic entrepreneurship. First, moving away from mono-professional
   studies, the focus is on a policy characterized by a dispute between two
   groups of bureaucrats: physicians and jurists. Second, key conditions
   triggering bureaucratic policy entrepreneurship are identified, with a
   focus on mid-level administrative entrepreneurs. Third, vertical
   alliances between bureaucrats and politicians of the executive and
   legislative branches are examined and these processes are reflected in
   the wider perspective of the politics-administration dichotomy. Results
   show that law obsolescence, disputes between groups of bureaucrats and
   the need for political arbitration are favourable conditions for
   bureaucratic policy entrepreneurship. The study also shows that within
   the traditional separation of powers, bureaucratic entrepreneurship
   reinforces the executive power and creates dividing lines within the
   different branches of government.},

Abstract = {Policies are assumed to rarely change after enactment. Punctuated
   equilibrium theory argues this is because law makers shift attention
   away from policies after enactment, letting them run on autopilot. I
   argue that the periods between punctuations deserves study, and that
   what law makers do is design institutions to make policies path
   dependent so they can only change within limited parameters-if at all.
   It may also be that interest groups opposing new policies are still able
   to shape the way they evolve, pushing against intended paths. In this
   article I test the influence of path dependence versus group opposition
   in state charter school policies. I find some evidence of path
   dependence, but I also find that, to some extent, opposing interests can
   still change these laws after enactment. Furthermore, I find these
   policies became increasingly similar over time, partially because of
   path dependence, but also because of the influence of opposing
   interests.},

Abstract = {Recent elections reveal a rise in first-time candidates. Building on
   prior works on nascent political ambition, we examine how ideological
   incongruence with one's party relates to the initial development of
   interest in running for office. We advance the theory that individuals
   will be more motivated to run when they view their party as failing to
   represent their preferred position. Using two nationally representative
   surveys, we find support for this hypothesis, as we show that people are
   more likely to develop political ambition when they perceive themselves
   as ideologically distant from their party. Finally, using a panel study,
   we show that ideological distance predicts running for office for the
   first time. Our findings further highlight how the factors that
   contribute to the initial formation of ambition differ from the
   strategic concerns driving more advanced career decisions and illustrate
   another potential side-effect of ideological disagreement within
   parties.},

Abstract = {Despite broad public support, investment in US infrastructure has not
   kept pace with growth, population shifts, and rising exposure to climate
   change risks. One explanation lies in politicians' electoral incentives:
   because, in the short term, voters see only the costs of investment and
   not its benefits, politicians have incentive to pander and spend less
   than what they or their fully informed constituents would prefer. Local
   newspapers could help reduce this constraint by increasing politicians'
   confidence that voters will receive information that justifies higher
   spending. In a survey experiment, we found that informing US city and
   county elected officials about news coverage of infrastructure failures
   increased support for a costly investment for those in competitive
   electoral settings. When motivated by reelection, politicians need the
   benefits of investment to be visible in order to justify its costs. Our
   results demonstrate the political importance of the nonpolitical news
   covered in local newspapers.},

Abstract = {The Ludwig group is usually described by the media as a group of serial
   killers operating in Italy during the so-called Years of Lead. The
   present article examines the structure and the nature of the group's
   language through a multidimensional approach to rediscuss its current
   classification and description. The source material of the analysis is
   represented by the handwritten leaflets released by the group to claim
   its actions. The collected material, comprised of seven leaflets
   released by the Ludwig group in 1980-1984, has been examined through the
   analysis of language register, syntactic and rhetorical structure,
   adopted lexicon and co-occurrences. According to the analysis of the
   group's language and messages it passed on, this paper suggests that the
   political nature of the Ludwig group receives its inspiration from Nazi
   ideology. The ideology that inspired the group's violent actions must be
   brought back to Nazi Ideology, especially to the ideas of what is
   generally known as Esoteric Nazism.},

Abstract = {The extent to which de/centralization is shaped by regime change in
   federations that have experienced periods of autocratic rule is yet to
   be fully explored. To this end, this article measures static and dynamic
   de/centralization in Pakistan - a federal country under autocratic rule
   for long periods - since the introduction of its first constitution in
   1956. Drawing on an original dataset compiled by the authors, this
   article challenges the narrative that only military regimes have abetted
   centralization. It also identifies the main instruments of
   de/centralization and the primary agents behind change, including the
   military, political parties, and the senior judiciary. The first study
   of its kind on Pakistan, and part of the project Why de/centralization
   in federations?', this article contributes to the literature on
   decentralization in hybrid regimes by mapping the longitudinal evolution
   of Pakistan's federal system.},

Abstract = {Grievance and opportunity theories dominate research on the causes of
   civil war. However, theoretical and empirical problems limit their
   ability to explain variation in conflict onset. We argue that these
   problems partly stem from treating them as largely independent
   explanations. We integrate grievance and opportunity into a unified
   theory and argue that they are complements that jointly predict
   conflict. We apply insights from the interstate war literature to
   develop and test a theory of conflict onset that argues that the
   probability of civil war increases as the disparity between relative
   power and the status quo distribution of benefits increases.},

Abstract = {This contribution focuses on the potential geographical impact of the
   National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) given its constraints,
   objectives and resources. The article analyses the NRRP as a great
   development opportunity, especially for the Mezzogiorno regions. The
   Plan has been presented as another `historic opportunity' to narrow the
   North-South divide; as a symbolic turning point that should trigger a
   virtuous spiral of growth, social cohesion and sustainability. More
   specifically, starting from the multiple current structural crises
   affecting the society and economy of Italy's less developed regions,
   attention is focused on the complex policies involved in the
   implementation of the Plan in order to achieve the expected results in
   these regions and on the central role played by the (financial,
   organizational and political) resources mobilized.},

Abstract = {The political and institutional trajectory of Italy was clearly
   punctuated by the economic upheavals of the pandemic. The articles in
   the special issue aim to assess the character of the institutional
   change prompted by the economic response to the pandemic, and in
   particular by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), in
   different policy areas. Three contributions analyse the reform dynamics
   related to the strategic axis of the Italian NRRP, namely digitalization
   and innovation (Ottone and Barbieri), the ecological transition (Cotta
   and Domorenok), and social inclusion as concerns labour-market policies
   (Tassinari). Two contributions focus on two overarching priorities of
   the NRRP: gender equality (Dona) and development of southern Italy
   (Cerruto, Cersosimo and Raniolo). Finally, one contribution focuses on
   reform of the public administration, which has been identified as a key
   area, affecting horizontally all missions in the NRRP (Di Mascio,
   Natalini and Profeti). Overall, the articles in the special issue
   highlight that the pandemic has been followed by a process of
   institutional change that occurred both incrementally and unevenly,
   often disguising substantial continuity.},

Abstract = {The European Union considers gender equality to be a key issue for
   post-pandemic recovery. The establishment of the Recovery and Resilience
   Facility (RRF) required member states to present their National Recovery
   and Resilience Plans and commit themselves to considering gender
   equality a horizontal objective. As Italy's Recovery and Resilience Plan
   was, in terms of resources, the largest national plan under the RRF, it
   had the potential to be a `turning point' for gender equality in Italy.
   This article offers a preliminary analysis, based on the categories
   elaborated by feminist policy research, aimed at assessing whether the
   National Plan initiated a process of policy and institutional change and
   if so, in what direction. It is argued that under pressure from the
   European vincolo esterno, the scope of gender equality has been narrowed
   and the measures aimed at promoting gender equality have become more
   bureaucratized and aligned with a managerial and technical policy turn,
   thus promoting a shift towards the depoliticization of gender equality.},

Abstract = {Instructors seeking to add active learning elements to their courses
   encounter an ``evaluation challenge{''} when trying to assign grades to
   discussion-based activities that do not produce a final product. By
   creating a way to incorporate evaluation into hard-to-observe
   activities, the protocol presented here can help instructors make active
   learning elements a key part of the evaluation of courses and, by
   providing a simple framework, reduce time spent marking. Drawing on
   debates in the scholarship of teaching and learning focused on reducing
   bias and grading irregularities in peer-evaluation, and building
   directly on Lawrence Li's normalization protocol, this procedure
   combines marks from both self- and peer-evaluations, controlling for
   irregular grading practices and differences in subjective marking
   ``toughness.{''} As the community of the scholarship of teaching and
   learning in politics and international relations continues to grow,
   continued attention on evaluation can help ensure that this important
   element of pedagogical practice can be improved to better fit the
   realities of today's classroom (real or virtual).},

Abstract = {This article employs the methodology of the Why De/Centralization in
   Federations project to assess dynamic de/centralization with a focus on
   state autonomy throughout Brazil's republican life (1889-2020). The
   results reveal diverse patterns for the spheres observed. Institutional
   autonomy had a trajectory closely associated with regime type, unlike
   the two other politico-institutional dimensions. Legislative authority
   over policies and the fiscal dimension experienced an underlying process
   of centralization, punctuated by waves of decentralization. The
   administrative dimension of policy autonomy showed the most stable
   pattern, oscillating around a mean that indicates the dominance of the
   centre. The evidence contradicts the assumption that cycles of
   centralization and decentralization offset each other in Brazil. It
   supports the hypothesis that democratic transitions with increased
   political autonomy of states at the initial stages lead to broader
   decentralization. The data also show that regime change made
   de/centralization moves more frequent, in transitions to or from

Abstract = {What are the policy consequences of constitutional differentiation in
   core state powers? We argue that the most important consequence is not
   necessarily the exclusion of the constitutional outs from the policies
   of the ins, but their reintegration by different means. The outs often
   have strong functional and political incentives to re-join the policies
   they opted out from, and the ins have good reasons to help them back in.
   We develop a theoretical framework that derives the incentives for
   reintegration from the costs of a policy exclusion. We use a novel
   dataset of reintegration opportunities to map trends and patterns of
   reintegration across policy fields and member states. We analyze
   selected cases of reintegration to probe the plausibility of our
   theoretical argument.},

Abstract = {Probability-based web surveys are increasingly challenged by decreasing
   response rates and high costs. A cheap and convenient solution is to use
   `opt-in' online panels, which are based on non-probability samples.
   However, the quality of the data such panels produce is subject to
   debate. To improve our understanding in this regard, especially in the
   Swiss context, we compare conditional distributions of sociodemographic
   variables and voting behaviour of two probability-based web surveys and
   three opt-in panels. Indeed, point estimates in opt-in panels are well
   studied, but bivariate relationships between variables, arguably more
   important for researchers in political science research, have received
   less attention. Our analysis has the advantage of most variables of
   interest being included in the sampling frame and thus the true values
   are known for each conditional distribution. Our results show a lack of
   consistency and reproducibility in the results from opt-in panels, which
   leads us to recommend care when using this type of data.},
