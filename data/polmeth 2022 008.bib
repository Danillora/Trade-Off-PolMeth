Abstract = {Russia's crimes in Ukraine in 2022 continue a long history of imperial
   violence. In Russia, the only visible cultural sign of past crimes
   against the Ukrainian nation lies in the Karelian forest of Sandarmokh.
   There, in 1937, the Soviet secret service shot thousands of people,
   including some 300 Ukrainian writers and artists, together with members
   of the cultural elite of many other peoples. Like no other place,
   Sandarmokh reveals the colonial dimension of the crimes. It is the
   arcanum of an empire, a repository for memory to be destroyed. The man
   who discovered it, Gulag researcher and Karelian section director of the
   human rights organization Memorial, Yurii Dmitriev, was arrested after
   the first attack on Ukraine in 2014 and, on the basis of scurrilous
   charges, sentenced to 15 years in prison.},

Title = {International Statebuilding and the Domestic Politics of State
   Development},
Journal = {ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {261-281},
Abstract = {Managing the threat of violence remains a central concern in
   international security and development. International actors seek to
   terminate civil wars and prevent conflict recurrence by building peace
   and strengthening state institutions. In this article, I review the
   scholarship on international statebuilding, defined broadly as external
   efforts to create, strengthen, reform, and transform the authority
   structures of the state. Much of this literature models international
   state-building as provision, in which external actors provide a solution
   to the enforcement problem that plagues postconflict bargains. However,
   in many cases, the assumptions about domestic politics underpinning the
   provision model do not hold. When the central problem of domestic
   politics concerns bargaining over the distributional consequences of the
   peace rather than the parties' ability to credibly commit to the peace,
   international statebuilding is more fruitfully modeled as imposition, in
   which terms are imposed on recalcitrant domestic actors. The imposition
   model allows the preferences of external actors over the postwar order
   to diverge from the preferences of domestic actors. Divergence arises
   because statebuilding interventions have distributional consequences
   that threaten the interests of domestic elites. To unpack why this is
   the case, I turn to the literature on the domestic politics of
   statebuilding, which shows that governance arrangements that appear to
   outsiders as weak statehood can help manage violence by facilitating the
   distribution of sovereignty rents. Insights from these literatures
   suggest exciting new avenues for future scholarship.},

Abstract = {This research explores European `soft law' and how it is used by
   interest groups. At the European level, soft law has been developing in
   many sectors and is one of the instruments that interest groups can use.
   Our reflection is based on the following question: How does European
   soft law impact on the strategies of interest groups at national level?
   Do they make specific use of it in the conduct of public action, how and
   under what conditions? In the first section, this article reviews the
   evolution of the institutional environment of interest groups and the
   multi-level European context in which they operate. We then address the
   issue of the use of legal instruments, more specifically soft law, by
   interest groups. Finally, we will set out the framework for the
   comparison and our survey protocol.},

Pages = {792-807},
Abstract = {The modern state of legal relations is characterized by the growing
   influence of globalization factors. These lead to global transformations
   of the international legal system, in which the methodology of
   understanding the principles of law is of significant importance. The
   aim of the article was to explore the methodological framework for
   identifying the key approaches to understanding the principles of law in
   modern globalization transformations. The methodological basis consists
   of methods such as: systematic analysis, generalization,
   systematization, graphical analysis and cluster tabulator. The results
   of the studies have established that global transformations have a
   destructive impact on the principles of law. They deepen the processes
   of unclear distinction at the international and national levels. It has
   been found that in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
   approaches to the understanding of the principles of law differ from
   each other. It has been found that Germany and Slovenia set higher
   standards for the application of the principles of law and are more
   globalized than Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia. It has been
   suggested that special measures should be designed in which the
   principles of law act as an instrument of globalization.},

Abstract = {This article presents a model designed to guide Public Service
   Organizations to explore the benefits of innovation, derived from the
   adoption of their own R\&D (Research and Development) activity. The
   model designed considering new thinking about the need to radically
   transform organizations that provide public services, adopting more
   systemic innovation practices and intensifying the use of R\&D to
   address social challenges or missions. The methodology used to outline
   the model was qualitative, guided by the inductive method of analysis.
   In the initial stage of the research, the technical procedure of
   bibliographic research in the two areas of knowledge related to the
   research objective: innovation in the public sector and innovation via
   R\&D. The model is the result of combining knowledge from the literature
   and co-creation between academic researchers and corporate researchers
   in the field of Brazilian Public Security. The model, called
   ``Innovation Model via Own R\&D for Public Service Organizations{''} is
   composed of up to four non-linear steps and aggregating elements. The
   steps are strategy, R\&D, implementation and evaluation. The aggregating
   elements are creation of public value, feedback, continuous learning,
   user environment and Society, represented in the model due to the
   presence of the open innovation},

Abstract = {In two speeches immediately before the armed attack on Ukraine, Putin
   tried to explain his war. His arguments, which drew on history and
   international law, fell short, however. Nonetheless, neither the
   sweeping condemnation found in the UN General Assembly, nor the interim
   injunctions by various courts have been able to put a stop to the
   attack, which is in violation of international law. It is unclear what
   kind of effects this fundamental violation of the rules will have on the

Abstract = {Does anti-Muslim rhetoric by Western politicians breed radical attitudes
   among European Muslims? This article explores this question by
   conducting an experimental study in Bosnia - a European democracy,
   where, unlike the rest of Europe, Muslims are neither immigrants nor
   socio-economically disadvantaged. This helps clearly identify the
   radicalization potential of Western rhetoric alone, absent contextual
   factors such as social inferiority. Experimental evidence with Bosnian
   Muslims from five surveys (with a total of 2,608 participants) suggests
   that rhetorical attacks on Islam by Western politicians do not
   strengthen individuals' Muslim identity, cause higher levels of
   animosity toward the West or lead to condoning the use of violence. The
   study also finds that pro-Muslim rhetoric, while increasing positive
   views of the West, does not affect individuals' strength of Muslim
   identity or their radical sympathies. These results have important
   implications for the sources of radicalization and efforts to curb
   radical tendencies.},

Abstract = {This study is due to the existing contradiction between the current
   socio-economic, institutional, and other transformations that are taking
   place in Ukraine, and on the state of state policy implementation
   mechanisms in the tourism sector. Solving these problematic issues
   requires new approaches to the strategy formation in this area. The
   research is based on conceptual, methodical, project, institutional and
   historical-legal approaches, as well as a set of methods that ensure
   their implementation, in particular: logical generalization, factor
   analysis, synthesis and abstraction. In order to actively involve the
   existing tourism resources in the state and ensure the effective
   functioning of its tourism sector, it is necessary to develop a
   scientifically based system of programmatic and strategic measures based
   on common methodological principles and cover the main directions of
   state policy in the tourism development. In Ukraine, these areas are
   defined in the Tourism and Resorts Development Strategy for the period
   up to 2026. This strategy does not take into account the new intensions
   in ensuring the tourism sector development due to a number of factors,
   actualized recently and related to the emergence and spread of viral and
   other diseases and the like.},

   politics in Iceland by outlining some major characteristics of the
   development of Icelandic society and the political system in the 20th
   and 21st centuries. Gradual changes from a strongly state-centred
   patronage system towards a liberal market system are analysed, as well
   as the Icelandic party system, the traditional four parties that
   dominated politics for decades, increasing fragmentation, left-right
   positions of parties, turnout, recruitment of MPs, electoral volatility,
   the electoral system, the open coalition system, candidate selection,
   membership of parties, party financing and women's representation in
   parliament. The question of whether Icelandic politics have been
   characterised by conflict or consensus, ideology or pragmatism is also
   addressed.},

Abstract = {Poland is historically connected with the Middle Eastern states, and
   based on this fact in its foreign policy, it has regularly declared to
   achieve variable aims in the Middle East. Currently there are two kinds
   of interest which might be considered important in Polish foreign policy
   towards selected states of the Middle East. The first type is related to
   economic sphere when Poland tries to diversify gas and oil supplies,
   exemplified in agreements signed with Qatar. The second type refers to
   political interests, exemplified by the engagement of Poland in mission
   of stabilization in Iraq.
   The aim of this paper is to show the real capabilities of Polish foreign
   policy in the Middle East and identify the key obstacles to reach many
   aims. The author will also try to answer whether Polish foreign policy
   in the Middle East is effective or not and what reasons are behind that.
   The short-term perspective for the foreign policy of Poland towards the
   two Middle Eastern states of Qatar and Iraq will also be outlined.},

Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},

Abstract = {Historically, Guinea-Bissau is a small West African state that depends
   on external aid to secure survival. The political situation in
   Guinea-Bissau has been marked by political and governance instability
   after the country's independence. Thus, this article aims to analyze
   what are the factors that contributed to the emergence of new modern
   political parties in Guinea-Bissau from 1994 to 2019. For this purpose,
   the case study method on the experience of Guinea-Bissau and a
   qualitative analysis were used. Thus, this study concluded that
   Guinea-Bissau needs to make a real reform in the party system to promote
   the emergence and consolidation of organized and strongly
   institutionalized party affiliations, which are financed through a
   transparent mechanism and capable of empowering their leaderships for
   political functions. In addition, it is essential to establish a
   regulatory mechanism enabling party funds to be distributed only to
   parties that achieve a certain percentage of votes, as a way of
   achieving greater political participation of electorates in political
   party decision-making and reducing the very high rate of fragmentation
   in the Guinean party system. This will enable greater competition
   between political parties and guarantee the highest quality of democracy
   in the country.},

Abstract = {Political discourse finds the social networks an ideal medium for
   disseminating its messages, especially Twitter, the most widely used
   social network in politics. Voters are becoming concerned about the
   amount of disinformation and fakes they receive through the networks,
   and are demanding greater transparency in public management. The aim of
   this study is to discover the political treatment of corruption on
   Twitter, identifying the brands of false language of the candidates and
   verifying the opinion of experts on the need to increase public
   transparency. The methodology used is based on quantitative, qualitative
   and discursive content analysis with a comparative approach, focusing on
   the personal accounts of the five candidates for the Spanish General
   Elections in 2019. This is completed with an expert panel of
   professionals and academics from the political communication sector. The
   results point to the use of a fallacious discourse by politicians and
   that, as a result, a policy of absolute transparency is more necessary
   than ever.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {In spite of having a transformative character or even having adopted an
   anti-sexist discourse, social movements constitute spaces for the
   reproduction of sexism and gender violence. The union around a common
   claim and the intensity of the relationships of friendship and trust,
   configure a complex scenario of affinities and interests, that break
   through the dynamics of the group and confer certain particularities to
   the social space (physical and discursive) that they occupy. We
   understand that this is a particularly interesting field of analysis
   since discursively, this type of behavior is rejected and, therefore,
   mechanisms for both prevention and management of violence should be
   activated. This research delves into the responses that these groups of
   political action have developed to the violence against women
   perpetrated among them, through a qualitative perspective that focuses
   on activist communities in the Basque Country. Our objective is to
   contribute to deepening the concrete study of violence against women by
   abounding in its structural nature and breaking with the traditional
   representation that places this violence in some social spaces and not
   in others.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to determine the most effective model of legal
   regulation of the form of declaration of will in legal transactions from
   the survey of the legislation of several countries and their respective
   jurisprudence. The research covered the methods of statistical analysis,
   comparative law, dialectics and legal epistemology, as well as data
   selection and legal modeling. It is shown that the model of legal
   regulation of the form of declaration of will, which is based on the
   principle of free choice of the form of declaration of will, is the most
   effective in terms of these indicators in the case of: (Greece, Poland,
   Czech Republic). At the same time, these States provide for strict
   requirements for challenging legal transactions and provide for the
   prohibition of abuse of rights. It is concluded that it is justified
   that in the majority of states the principle of valid will is applied
   when concluding legal transactions. Moreover, the results of this study
   can be used to develop proposals for the improvement of legislation in
   the field of regulation of the forms of declaration of will in the
   conclusion of legal transactions in their various forms and modalities.},

Abstract = {The year 2021 marked the 25th anniversary of the signing of Guatemala's
   landmark peace accords. Yet celebrations of this historic achievement
   stood in sharp contrast to the year's alarming trends in the
   deterioration of democracy and the rule of law. Reviewing the events of
   2021, this article uncovers two key patterns in Guatemalan politics,
   both evidence of democratic decline: 1) open assaults on judicial
   independence and breaches of the constitutional order, and 2) an
   escalation in the criminalization of government critics, particularly
   those on the frontlines of the anti-corruption struggle. It also takes
   stock of the most pernicious consequences of these patterns, including
   the abysmal Covid-19 response and the new opportunities for corruption
   amid resurgent impunity. Combined, these dynamics have also increased
   tensions within US-Guatemala relations as the Biden White House
   increasingly perceived the Guatemalan government as an unreliable
   partner in tackling the root causes of migration. In sum, 2021 was an
   inflection point in Guatemala's 25-year trajectory of peace-one that has
   steadily sent the country down an authoritarian path like many of its
   neighbors in the Western Hemisphere.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic necessitates taking measures that may be very costly
   from an economic standpoint and likely to make the mass public
   discontent. If an anti-pandemic regimen does not accomplish its goals,
   its costs become even harder to justify. We argue that, under such
   circumstances, cancellation of an anti-pandemic regimen would decrease
   the reliability of health data because rank-in-file policymakers and
   bureaucrats have incentives to present more optimistic statistics to
   signal their competence and politicians would further pressure them to
   report statistics that appear to agree with the cancellation of
   restrictions and give legitimacy to taking the measures. Our empirical
   analyses suggest that closeness to the restrictions' cancellation date
   is associated with lower reliability of COVID-19 daily cumulative cases
   and deaths data. Being robust to several sensitivity and robustness
   checks, this finding is alarming from the perspective of representative
   democracy and for those who have to survive in these turbulent times.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to studying the new radical left parties (NRLP)
   that either emerged or strengthened in Western Europe in the light of
   social protests against neoliberal policies and austerity measures. The
   mid-2010s witnessed the peak of the electoral successes of the NRLP,
   when, after revisiting the mistakes of the past, the radical left
   challenged social democrats, who shifted to the right and thus freed up
   a niche in the political space. De-spite the fact that the mass
   protests, which swept across Europe, created pre-conditions for
   strengthening the NRLP everywhere, not all such parties could claim
   significant electoral achievements. The purpose of the article is to
   iden-tify the reasons why in some Western European countries the radical
   left ma-naged to create effective political organizations, while in
   others they did not. The authors analyze SYRIZA (Greece), Podemos
   (Spain) and France Un-bowed as examples of successful NRLP, which
   achieved the best results in the elections. However, only SYRIZA managed
   to become a senior partner in the government coalition. Podemos had to
   settle for the role of a junior partner, while the achievements of
   France Unbowed were even more modest.
   The conducted research allowed the authors to single out several
   fac-tors that can explain the successful performance of the NLRP in the
   electoral field. According to their conclusion, the existence of a
   pluralist democracy is a necessary condition for the efficiency of the
   NRLP. In addition, the electoral successes of the radical left were
   prepared by a change in the social structure, which provided the NRLP
   with a social base - young educated professionals. However, a country's
   party system, primarily the role and the weight of social democratic
   parties in a country's political life, is a decisive factor that defines
   prospects for the NRLP},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the current legislation on weapons and the opinion
   of scientists on firearms, ammunition, explosives or explosive devices.
   The fundamental importance of firearms in the forensic characterization
   of crimes is emphasized. It is noted that firearms are goods subject to
   a special regime of regulation, which can be carried out only by the Law
   of Ukraine. It is a particular type of weapon intended for attack,
   defense or sound signals, which is set off by the energy of gunpowder
   combustion gas. The authors' definition of firearms is given and the
   characteristic features of ammunition, explosives and explosive devices
   are highlighted. It is concluded that, for the purpose of legislative
   regulation of relations arising during the circulation of civilian
   firearms, as well as similar to weapons and ammunition products, in
   particular, to avoid free interpretation of the assessment of the
   actions of a person involved in crimes with the use of weapons, the
   development of a corresponding law comprehensively regulating this
   criminal methery is needed.},

Abstract = {We revisit the theory that Hollyer, Rosendorff, and Vreeland use in
   their research program on transparency and political stability. We show
   that in a representative citizen setting and in their multi-citizen
   model, more transparency increases the likelihood of revolution if this
   likelihood is sufficiently small, but reduces the likelihood of
   revolution if it is sufficiently large. Rather than coordination
   concerns, the mechanism driving this result reflects the logic of
   ``gambling for resurrection{''}: when you're ahead, don't give
   information, but when you're behind, gamble for resurrection by
   providing more information. Their model suggests that protest risk
   drives transparency, not the converse: regimes facing a low likelihood
   of revolution should reduce transparency, while those facing a high
   likelihood of revolution should raise transparency, generating a
   positive correlation between transparency and instability. Moreover, we
   show that in Hollyer et al.'s core models, a citizen's net payoff from
   revolting does not depend on either the citizen's private economic
   well-being, or the public economic situation: economic interest, either
   self-interest or sociotropic interest, is not itself an incentive to
   protest. Rather, the model is a sunspot game, with economic data playing
   the role of sunspots, which, by assumption, act as focal points for
   coordination.},

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {This study, based on Lederach's conflict transformation (CT) theory,
   analyses the participation of the local church in CT of political crises
   in Zimbabwe at the grassroots level - from 2005 to 2020. It compares the
   CT interventions of one Pentecostal church denomination and of one
   African Independent Church denomination in the Dzivarasekwa suburb of
   Harare. A convergent parallel mixed methods design was used. SPSS
   software was used to analyse quantitative data while the NVivo
   application was used for qualitative data analysis. One key finding is
   that both denominations believe CT entails community engagement. Major
   challenges to local churches' CT participation include financial
   constraints, repressive laws and church executives' fear of
   victimisation. The study concludes that the impact of the local churches
   is low because their interventions are limited to congregation members
   and their immediate neighbours. Another conclusion is that CT is
   politicised in Zimbabwe, which restricts effective church participation.
   The study makes some recommendations to address this most effective in
   achieving peace in the region.},

Abstract = {Most research on diversity within political methodology focuses on
   gender while overlooking racial and ethnic gaps. Our study investigates
   how race/ethnicity and gender relate to political science PhD students'
   methodological self-efficacy, as well as their general academic
   self-efficacy. By analyzing a survey of 300 students from the top 50
   US-based political science PhD programs, we find that race and ethnicity
   correlate with quantitative self-efficacy: students identifying as
   Black/African American and as Middle Eastern/North African express lower
   confidence in their abilities than white students. These gaps persist
   after accounting for heterogeneity among PhD programs, professional and
   socioeconomic status, and preferred methodological approach. However,
   small bivariate gender gaps disappear in multivariate analysis.
   Furthermore, gaps in quantitative self-efficacy may explain
   racial/ethnic disparities in students' broader academic self-efficacy.
   We argue that the documented patterns likely lead to continued
   underrepresentation of marginalized groups in the political methodology
   student body and professoriate.},

Abstract = {This programmatic article's objective is to encourage research to tackle
   more directly change in the how the EU has been governed since the
   mid-1990s. The central hypothesis developed is that the combined effects
   of economic policy orientations adopted after the Maastricht treaty and
   around the first Eastern enlargement, largely destroyed the EU's
   dirigiste political equipment. Ever since, liberals within the EU's
   elites have made the most of the space left open to them, whilst their
   principal adversaries, largely because they have never managed to
   reinvent dirigisme at the EU scale, have consistently participated in EU
   affairs without any ideological compass.},

Title = {Crime Victimization Increases Turnout: Evidence from Individual-Level
   Administrative Panel Data},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {What are the consequences of being the victim of crime for political
   participation? Previous studies report mixed results with respect to
   voter turnout, in contrast to the positive effects found for other
   indicators of political engagement. However, previous turnout studies
   have failed to differentiate between violent and non-violent crime, and
   have relied on cross-sectional survey data that is prone to measurement
   biases and selection effects. This article addresses these shortcomings
   via a panel analysis of official registry data from Denmark recording
   individual-level turnout in two municipal elections (in 2009 and 2013)
   and victimization from violent and non-violent crime. It identifies the
   effect of victimization by comparing changes in turnout between the two
   elections for victims and two different counterfactual groups:
   non-victims in the general population, and individuals who were
   victimized after the 2013 election. The results show that victimization
   from violent crime increases turnout by 2 to 3 percentage points. The
   study further demonstrates a large negative between-individual effect of
   victimization, suggesting that previous studies have been marred by
   severe selection bias.},

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {547-575},
Abstract = {In this paper, I estimate the effects of first rank using a regression
   discontinuity design in the context of three multimember district (MMD)
   elections, in Korea, Spain, and Japan. By analyzing MMD elections, I can
   estimate the effects of first rank separately from those of incumbency
   because there are multiple winners with different ranks. The results
   indicate that there is no first-rank effect on the outcomes of
   subsequent elections in any of the three cases. However, I do find
   evidence that achieving first rank increases candidates' probabilities
   of running for and winning higher office. In addition, I show that the
   first-rank effect on political advancement is likely to be driven by
   political parties, not by voters.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes how the emergence of bulk international
   surveillance impacts the boundary problem in political theory. It first
   describes how the boundary problem was defined and developed as well as
   the solutions proposed in the literature. Then, the paper analyzes
   surveillance as a violation of privacy which has a chilling effect and
   presents the specificities of bulk collection of electronic information.
   The main argument of the article is that the permanent uncertainty that
   bulk international surveillance causes triggers the need for a
   cosmopolitan legal regime to govern it under any of the solutions
   proposed to the boundary problem.},

Abstract = {One of the most ominous forms of violence currently in Mexico is
   disappearance. This work shows the way disappearance is particularly
   executed in a situated context. Initially, the theoretical approach and
   the concept of subjectivity, are explained. Also, a historical overview
   of violence in Mexico is presented in order to analyze disappearance as
   an extreme form of it. Based on this, the situated context and the
   particular way to signify forced disappearance in north Veracruz,
   Mexico, will be described, supported by the data recollected through the
   psychosocial support, consisting of ethnographic work, interviews, and
   emotional containing. Impacts of forced disappearance in this zone of
   Mexico are discussed and analyzed, as well as the importance of families
   with a disappeared person organized in groups in order to resist
   violence.},

Abstract = {Despite the increasingly reported incidence of sexual harassment among
   female elected representatives and staff members around the world, many
   more cases may not surface due to the power asymmetries, partisan logics
   and male organisational culture underpinning parliaments. No workplace
   is immune to sexual harassment, but when such misconducts occur in
   parliaments women's right to fully and equally participate in political
   life is severely infringed. While international organisations have
   issued numerous resolutions calling parliaments to take action, this
   article shows that most legislative chambers in Europe and the Americas
   lag behind the adoption of adequate preventative measures, complaint
   mechanisms and reparation measures.},

Title = {On the Process of Including Shipping in EU Emissions Trading:
   Multi-Level Reinforcement Revisited},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {246-255},
Abstract = {As part of the EU Green Deal initiative in 2019, the EU Commission
   decided to develop a proposal to include emissions from shipping in the
   EU emissions trading system. This occurred only one year after the
   Commission had heralded the emissions reduction agreement negotiated in
   the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as a significant step
   forward-thereby signalling support for the IMO process. We apply a
   multi-level reinforcement perspective to explain this apparent policy
   volte-face, resulting in a Commission proposal in July 2021 which is now
   moving through institutions in the EU. Such a perspective notes the
   ``friendly{''} competition for leadership among central actors at
   various levels in the EU-particularly the Commission, the European
   Parliament, and leading member states. We find, first, that the
   inclusion of shipping is in line with the broadening ambitions of the
   Commission since the start of the emissions trading system. Second,
   until 2019, the Parliament carried the regulatory torch. A turning point
   in the policymaking process was the inclusion of the shipping issue in
   Ursula von der Leyen's programme for getting accepted by the Parliament
   and elected as Commission leader in 2019. From then on, the Commission
   again took the lead. Third, despite the 2018 IMO agreement, progress
   there was deemed slow, which further motivated EU policymakers to act
   unilaterally.},

Journal = {SIYASAL-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCES},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Individuals' self-placement on the left-right scale continues to be a
   staple of voting studies, but the semantic content of this scale is
   rarely explored. This study aims to examine the discrepancy between the
   actual and perceived meanings of the political left-right divide among
   ordinary people, based on original data from a representative sample of
   Turkey. Are economic issues as pertinent to subjectively held left-right
   placements as people think? In order to empirically address this
   question, we develop measures for both parts of the question, i.e. how
   people endorsing certain economic positions place themselves on the
   left-right scale, as well as what left-right placement they attribute to
   a hypothetical person endorsing the same positions. We ask similar
   questions about non-economic issue positions too, all together comparing
   six issues. The results show that while the semantic content of the
   left-right scale in contemporary Turkey is mostly about secularism-a
   non-economic issue-and is popularly understood as such, it is more about
   environmentalism, and less about economic issues, than what people
   think. Endorsement of gender equality and freedom of thought also prove
   to be substantial correlates of a leftward self-placement and they are
   popularly recognized as such.},

Title = {The power of a promise: whom do governments' security justifications
   convince to accept surveillance?},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {To justify surveillance measures and gain them public support,
   governments use the promise of security. It is usually claimed that
   individuals are more willing to have freedom and privacy restricted than
   waiving a promise of increased security. However, empirical evidence to
   support this claim has been scarce-especially from a comparative
   perspective. Focusing on surveillance measures, this paper shows that
   people do indeed express greater acceptance of restrictions when these
   are justified by promises of security, being one of the first to examine
   this across 29 countries on all continents. Based on data from the ISSP,
   it investigates to which degree the effect of a security-based
   justification is moderated on the micro and macro level, with surprising
   results: While the effect does not differ between different levels of
   government support and political orientation, it differs significantly
   depending on how liberal-democratic the country is. The effect of the
   security-justification is very pronounced in liberal democracies, while
   it is even reversed in rather autocratic countries, meaning that
   individuals seem to be rather suspicious towards security justifications
   in non-democratic countries.},

Abstract = {The expert competences of the public bureaucracy are often seen as
   crucial for the quality and legitimacy of public policies. Yet, the role
   of expertise in the state varies greatly across countries. How can we
   explain the position of expert competences in the bureaucracy? The paper
   examines this question through a historical-institutional analysis of
   the Italian ministerial bureaucracy. Extending the `public service
   bargains' framework, it argues that the role of expertise in the state
   is the result of a bargaining process between civil servants and the
   politicians that they serve. The paper shows how the peculiar position
   of expertise in the Italian state - the paucity of technical expertise
   in the permanent administration, the role of ministerial cabinets as
   politicized providers of expertise, and the dominance of legal training
   among civil servants - was the result of a chain of political and
   bureaucratic strategies and responses.},

Abstract = {Can linguistic diversity in the media impede state language proficiency?
   In this paper, we test the extent to which the availability of minority
   languages in the media affects state language proficiency for ethnic
   minorities. We take advantage of an exogeneous development: The rapid
   expansion of Budapest-originating media outside Hungary in the mid-2000s
   transformed the media landscape in neighbouring states. Using an
   original survey data of ethnic Hungarians in minority regions in four
   Central-Eastern European states over two waves, we find (1) the
   availability of minority language media means minorities are consuming
   less media in the state language, which in turn induces low levels of
   state language proficiency - i.e. through an exogeneous exposure
   mechanism; and (2) minorities with weaker state language proficiency
   choose to consume minority language media - i.e. through an endogenous
   selection mechanism. The results suggest a strong relationship between
   the language of media consumption and linguistic proficiency.},

Abstract = {Commencing by noting the international condemnation of the destruction
   of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge by a mining company in Western
   Australia in 2020, this paper examines the extent to which current
   Australian Indigenous cultural heritage legislation reflects
   contemporary international expectations regarding Indigenous peoples'
   right to enjoy cultural heritage. The examination takes place in two
   parts. The first examines the theoretical basis underpinning collective
   rights to cultural heritage in the context of Indigenous peoples' right
   to enjoy it. The second examines national Indigenous cultural heritage
   legislation in Australia and several examples of sub-national
   legislation: the states of Western Australia, Victoria, and the Northern
   Territory. This analysis focuses on those aspects of the legislation
   relevant to land-based Indigenous cultural heritage and project
   approvals. The paper concludes by suggesting that its examination
   reveals an urgent need for thorough reform of Australian Indigenous
   Cultural Heritage legislation to align it with contemporary
   international expectations and the steps currently underway in Australia
   to achieve this goal.},

Abstract = {Shortly after becoming the Philippines' 16th president in mid-2016,
   Rodrigo Roa Duterte had unraveled his predecessor's agenda of standing
   up to China's expansive claims in the South China Sea. He distanced his
   country from its long-time treaty ally and gravitated toward China which
   is resolute in reconfiguring the global commons in the Asia-Pacific
   region. He also set aside the 2016 UNCLOS decision on the South China
   Sea dispute favorable to the Philippines. His appeasement toward China
   contrasted sharply with the late President Benigno Aquino III's
   balancing strategy. President Duterte reoriented Philippine policy
   alarmed both the US and Japan. Consequently, Washington and Tokyo shored
   up their respective security ties with the Philippine military. The
   effort was aimed to prevent the Philippines from being pulled into
   China's orbit. Moreover, the US is the hub while Japan and the
   Philippines are spokes in the San Francisco System of alliances. This
   article concludes that the 1950 San Francisco Peace Conference not only
   established the series of US bilateral alliances in Asia, but also laid
   down the foundation of regional order and security which outlives the
   Cold War, and prevailed way beyond the second decade of the 21st
   century.},

Abstract = {What were the indicators of voter turnout and presidential vote choice
   among Asian Americans in 2020? We argue that 2020 was a unique year in
   which race was salient for Asian Americans due to the rise of anti-Asian
   attitudes attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and the opportunity to
   elect a vice presidential candidate of Asian descent. Because of this,
   racial considerations played a unique role that informed Asian American
   political participation and attitudes in this election. Using data from
   the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey, we identify the
   individual-level factors associated with turnout and presidential vote
   choice among Asian Americans. We find that stronger perceptions of
   racial discrimination were related to a higher likelihood of turnout and
   voting in support of the Democratic Party, especially among Asian
   immigrants relative to the native-born. This study offers new insight
   for when we can expect racial considerations to inform the politics of
   Asian Americans, who are the fastest growing racial group in the United
   States and therefore an increasingly important bloc of the electorate.},

Title = {The strategic determinants of legislative malapportionment in new
   democracies},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {When the number of seats to be elected in the districts of an electoral
   system is not proportional to their pop-ulation, the cost of seats in
   raw votes tends to vary across districts. Malapportionment generates
   partisan bias when some parties do better (worse) in the districts where
   seats are cheaper (costlier) than in other districts. While existing
   research has focused on the exogenous determinants of malapportionment,
   in this article we argue that malapportionment also derives from the
   strategic decisions of ruling elites to maximize their legislative
   representation. The degree of malapportionment in newly democratized
   countries increases when ruling poli-cymakers have reliable ex ante
   information about the geographical distribution of partisan support, and
   the authoritarian incumbent, at the moment of democratic transition, is
   strong. Our arguments are tested with original data from 60 third and
   fourth-wave democracies at national and district levels.},

Abstract = {This research note argues that political theorists of refuge ought to
   consider the experiences of refugees after they have received asylum in
   the Global North. Currently, much of the literature concerning the
   duties of states toward refugees implicitly adopts a blanket approach,
   rather than considering how varied identities may affect the remedies
   available to displaced people. Given the prevalence of racism,
   xenophobia, and homophobia in the Global North, and the growing norm of
   dissident persecution in foreign territory, protection is not guaranteed
   after either territorial or legal admission. This research note
   considers the case of LGBTQ refugees in order to demonstrate the
   analytical potential of more inclusive and diverse normative approaches.
   Taking the origin and extension of harm seriously requires a
   conceptualization of sanctuary after asylum that accurately reflects the
   experiences of the displaced. In doing so, questions arise regarding the
   nature and efficacy of territorial asylum.},

Abstract = {This article outlines the Conservative Party's approach to climate
   change from 2015 to 2022; focusing on its governing policy record and
   the wider political considerations that shaped it. During this time, the
   Conservatives' mixed performance reflected competing political
   incentives for its leaders and internal party division on the issue. A
   detailed exploration of Conservative climate policies allows for two
   broader contributions. European centre-right parties often face common
   strategic challenges, such as competition from the radical right, but
   the UK Conservative Party case study shows that responding to these
   challenges does not necessarily demand the abandonment of climate
   commitments. We also find evidence that in this period climate change
   embodied characteristics of both a positional and a valence issues.},

Abstract = {What positions do ethnic parties adopt on issues related to migration
   and immigration? We argue that, first, the specific characteristics of
   the party system - that is, if there are further ethnic parties that
   compete for votes, in particular among the same ethnic group - matter
   for the policy profile of ethnic parties on immigration policy.
   Secondly, we expect that the ideological position of an ethnic party
   should matter for their immigration policy position: ethnic parties with
   a more right-wing ideological profile should adopt more negative
   positions on immigration, in particular, if they face competition from
   another ethnic party. We use regression analysis and a manually coded
   sample of ethnic parties based on the Comparative Manifesto Project to
   test these assumptions. The empirical analysis provides support for our
   expectations: ethnic parties take more negative immigration positions if
   they compete with other parties among the same group of ethnic voters
   and the more the ethnic parties belong to the right wing of the
   ideological spectrum.},

Abstract = {The scholarly exchange over approaches to measuring public preferences
   in the American states dates back several years. This introduction to
   the debate attempts to provide broad perspective on how scholars have
   conceptualized and measured policy mood among state mass publics in the
   past and the implications of those choices for theoretical and empirical
   questions in state politics. We frame the discussion around two
   questions: (1) what is the concept to be measured? and (2) how does the
   concept fit with the research question? We conclude with some insight on
   the future of the debate and its implications for state politics

Abstract = {Although polarisation risks breaking up the European family, such
   conflicts paired with transnational challenges can also raise awareness
   of the need for more European Union (EU) cohesion. In order to approach
   the hitherto underspecified concept, this article connects the recent
   literature on social cohesion with research on various facets of public
   EU support - integration preferences, identity, voting behaviour, and
   solidarity. Building on survey data from 10 EU countries taken at the
   end of 2020, a latent class analysis identifies two distinct groups of
   preferences for EU cohesion: its friends and its foes. EU cohesion can
   be achieved by highlighting personal advantages of European integration
   and by stressing joint approaches to crises, civic education, and
   democratic processes.},

Abstract = {We examined sensitive questions on political trust and regime support in
   China using indirect methods. We replicated previous list experiment
   results confirming that a majority trusts the central government despite
   overreports. We also conducted novel list experiments on trust in local
   government and support for removal of the presidential term limit and
   found evidence of overreporting for both. The point estimate for local
   government also suggests majority trust, but the central government is
   both more trusted and feared. However, we did not find evidence of
   majority support for removing the term limit at the time of the removal,
   indicating that the public may negatively evaluate government, albeit
   indirectly, in some circumstances. Last, examining self-monitoring, a
   personality trait for examining social desirability, we found that it
   only influenced overreporting trust in the central government. The
   results reveal meaningful variation in political trust and regime
   support in the world's largest authoritarian society.},

   ideology of the American populist right},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {In this article we explore the economic thinking of the American
   populist right and the reservoir of ideological tropes that it draws on.
   We start with Steve Bannon and show how he narrates a binary distinction
   between a healthy, productive capitalism and a perverted, speculative
   capitalism. While speculative capitalism is attributed to globalist
   elites and parasitic minorities in the US, productive capitalism is
   defined as the home-grown American variety that once benefitted workers
   and entrepreneurs alike. In a comparative ideological analysis, we
   document that Bannon's move of `othering' has a long history in writings
   of the extreme right in the US. In the 1920s and 30s, Henry Ford and
   Charles Coughlin grounded their antisemitism in a dichotomy of
   productive and speculative capitalism. Lawrence Dennis developed an
   Americanized version of fascism using a similar distinction. More recent
   thinkers of the American Alt-Right revived the critique of capitalism
   along such lines, as we show with reference to the writings of Samuel
   Francis. This article contributes to the study of populist ideology by
   showing how economic theorizing is grafted upon its core distinction of
   the sane people and corrupt elites.},

Abstract = {This essay suggests that the Renaissance revolution in historical
   thought was encouraged by contemporary debates over the
   Aristotelian-Averroistic doctrine of the eternity of the world. In the
   early Renaissance eternalism came to be understood as a proposition with
   controversial consequences not only for the creation of matter ex nihilo
   but also for the record of historical time. Modern scholarship,
   following Momigliano, believes that understandings of time had little
   effect on the practice of ancient historians. But that was not the view
   of Orosius, the most widely read historian during the Middle Ages, who
   condemned the pagan historians for their eternalism. Nor was it the view
   of the Italian humanists who, after reading the Greek historians,
   abandoned the providentialism of Orosius and other medieval writers and
   revived ancient ways of writing history.},

Abstract = {In this papers we propose to reflect on the work of Horacio Gonzalez
   from the figure of the example. First, we investigate the figure from
   the debates that caused its use in the field of philosophy; then we
   postulate the reasons for the repetition of three examples in Gonzalez's
   work; finally we outline some hypotheses about the legacy of a work of
   thought crucial for our intelectual and political contemporaneity.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how mass issue attitudes are structured and
   constrained across different levels of political sophistication. To do
   so, it replicates the analysis of Lupton et al. (J Politics
   77(2):368-380, 2015) in the European context, relying on the 2014 and
   2019 European Election Studies (EES). First, it tests seven models of
   issue dimensionality on each European country by means of CFA. Then, it
   investigates whether connections among issue dimensions become stronger
   at increasing levels of sophistication. Finally, it checks correlations
   between factors and ideology. Results show that voters' issue
   dimensionality considerably changes between the two EES waves, switching
   from a heterogeneous configuration in 2014 to a predominant GAL/TAN
   model in 2019. Analyses find evidence that sophisticated voters
   constrain their attitudes to one single underlying dimension only in
   some cases. Therefore, the constraining role of sophistication cannot be
   generalized to all European countries. Yet, the link between issue
   dimensions and ideological orientations appears strong across (almost)
   all countries, showing that issue attitudes, especially for highly
   sophisticated voters, are rooted in ideology.},

Abstract = {The sustained growth of tourism activity for more than seven decades and
   its resilience to crisis led to the consolidation of a tourism policy
   arena in which public decision-makers and some interest groups from the
   tourism sector participated on a regular basis. In the context of this
   policy domain, the narrative on tourism and tourism policy also
   responded to a robust rhetoric which, regardless the circumstances, was
   already dealing with negative feedback that pointed out different
   problems related to the sustainability of the model such as overcrowded
   destinations or poor quality of jobs in the tourism sector among others.
   The effects of the health crisis caused by COVID-19 in the tourism
   sector were particularly significant mainly due to mobility
   restrictions. In order to cope with this situation much more active
   positions from both governments and interest groups were required. The
   article examines the impact on the stakeholder map as well as possible
   changes in the strategies adopted by the players involved. The research
   conclusions support the idea that stakeholders continue to perform their
   duties without any significant change, although a more relevant
   contribution is demanded during the difficult moments we are currently
   experiencing. This situation is pushing them to assume more proactive
   and open to dialogue positions.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the endorsement strategies of municipal
   council members in Russia. Since 2O12, the candidates for chief
   executive office are required to collect the signatures at the local
   level. Filtering had been an important political toll before the return
   of direct gubernatorial elections, however, for the latter there are
   specific requirements in terms of territorial quotas and coverage that
   can be used against the independent candidates. We theorize that
   partisanship, gender, and employment sector on individual level and
   political competition, population size, and budget autonomy on the
   municipality level are important in shaping the councilmembers'
   decision. We test this theory against the data on 2O2O Perm krai
   gubernatorial elections and find out that while the general pattern is
   largely in line with our expectations, there are nuances when it comes
   to supporting particular opposition candidates. This study contributes
   to the literature on electoral authoritarianism and subnational
   elections in Russia and to the general scholarship on the means of
   authoritarian control.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on the relevance of popular culture in teaching IR
   and political science. Specifically, we present an active learning
   activity which includes the collective discussion of two comic strips
   -{''}The battle of the packets{''} and ``Sharia Japanese style{''} (Tok
   Tok Anthology, 2018)-. Our first aim was for students to learn about
   North African and specifically about the 2011 antiauthoritarian popular
   protests (or the so-called ``Arab Spring{''}) as well as the main
   factors that caused them. Beyond this acquisition of basic knowledge,
   the designed activity aimed to enable students to ``make sense{''} of
   the fact by using social theory movements' key concepts. Finally, the
   activity was intended to encourage students to reflect on the impact of
   (mainstream and non-mainstream) representations in their learning
   process and to engage them with the region by promoting higher levels of
   empathy with local actors. Preliminary result show that students
   increased their knowledge about the region. While only one student (out
   of 14) was able to establish the causes of the 2011 regional event
   before the activity, almost all of them (13/14) were able to explain the
   factors behind the mobilizations after the activity took place.
   Moreover, many students referred specifically to concepts such us
   ``window of opportunity{''}, ``example{''} or ``cleavages{''} after the
   activity. Finally, during the post-activity class discussions, students
   showed a higher sense of empathy and pointed out how relevant the comic
   was to better understand the actors working within the region.},

Abstract = {This study examines the dynamics of electoral reforms in the constituent
   entities of the Russian Federation and their influence on the
   disproportionality of parliamentary representation since the electoral
   system experienced major changes in 2003. We suggest that some
   characteristics of the electoral system may be highly instrumental in
   ensuring and maintaining United Russia's influence in legislative
   bodies. This makes it possible to classify them as forms of
   institutional manipulation typical of electoral authoritarianism. Based
   on the statistical description and regression analysis, the study
   demonstrates the impact of some elements of electoral reforms on
   disproportionality during the periods at issue. At the same time, we can
   identify the methods of cementing the dominant party's hold on power
   that the authorities find the most effective. In this regard, we make
   the conclusion that certain elements of the electoral system function as
   a balanced mechanism, which is evidenced by how they have been used
   during the different periods. Additionally, the study analyses the
   impact of disproportionality on electoral behavior, with the hypothesis
   about its negative influence on the electoral turnout being supported.
   Yet we regard the lower turnout as a consequence of the voting behavior
   of both the opposition's supporters and loyalists. Finally, the
   electoral reforms in Russia seem to have put limits on
   disproportionality of parliamentary representation due to the issue of
   legitimacy.},

Abstract = {In an increasingly digitized world, vote advice applications (VAAs) seem
   to be effective in providing voters with personalized information about
   their own positions vis-a-vis parties' positions and specific policies.
   Even though electoral research has increasingly paid attention to the
   role VAAs play in voter's opinion formation, very few studies have
   examined VAAs in the context of direct-democratic decisions. This
   article fills this gap by providing new insights into how VAAs affect
   individual decision-making in popular votes theoretically and
   empirically. We use novel data from the referendum campaign on the 2017
   new energy law in Switzerland: a VAA experiment carried out in the
   framework of a three-wave panel survey. In the third wave, which took
   place a week before the referendum, respondents were randomly assigned
   to a treatment group and a control group; only the former was shown the
   VAA and made to use it. The results indicate two main takeaways. First,
   that using a VAA has a tangible effect inasmuch as the share of
   undecided voters is smaller among the treatment than among the control
   group. Second, VAA usage can have both a persuasive effect (i.e., it can
   change vote intentions) and an intensifying effect (i.e., it can
   strengthen voters' preexisting intentions).},

Abstract = {Why do politicians and policymakers not prioritize pro-immigration
   reforms, even when public opinion on the issue is positive? This
   research note examines one previously overlooked explanation related to
   the systematically greater importance of immigration as a political
   issue among those who oppose it relative to those who support it. To
   provide a comprehensive empirical assessment of how personal immigration
   issue importance is related to policy preferences, I use the best
   available cross-national and longitudinal surveys from multiple
   immigrant-receiving contexts. I find that compared to pro-immigration
   voters, anti-immigration voters feel stronger about the issue and are
   more likely to consider it as both personally and nationally important.
   This finding holds across virtually all observed countries, years, and
   alternative survey measures of immigration preferences and their
   importance. Overall, these results suggest that public attitudes toward
   immigration exhibit a substantial issue importance asymmetry that
   systematically advantages anti-immigration causes when the issue is more
   contextually salient.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to normative debates about residential
   segregation and its relationship to inequality. It defends a position
   often disregarded in literature: that there is merit to advancing
   residential integration through some scenarios where advantaged
   individuals move to disadvantaged areas. It develops this case in
   dialogue with three other views. In relation to advocates of addressing
   the inequalities of residential segregation through redistribution, it
   defends integration as a means of tackling social and political factors
   that sustain injustice. It challenges those who defend relocating
   disadvantaged individuals to advantaged areas by highlighting the
   burdens and demand for cultural assimilation this imposes on the
   disadvantaged. It considers the worry that advantaged individuals
   relocating to disadvantaged areas harbours the problematic features of
   gentrification. It responds that these concerns, while important in some
   cases, do not arise in all scenarios of this kind.},

Abstract = {Does military conscription reduce the distance between the ordinary
   citizen and the state? Decades after its abolition, numerous European
   policy makers from across the political spectrum advocate the
   reintroduction of conscription to foster civic virtues, despite a lack
   of empirical evidence in this respect. Leveraging quasi-random variation
   in conscription reforms across 15 European countries, we find that
   cohorts of men drafted just before its abolition display significantly
   and substantially lower institutional trust than cohorts of men who were
   just exempted. At the same time, ending conscription had no effect on
   institutional trust among women from comparable cohorts. Results are
   neither driven by more favorable attitudes toward the government, nor by
   educational choices. Instead, this civil-military gap unfolds through
   the formation of a homogeneous community with uniform values. We argue
   that reintroducing a compulsory military service may not produce the
   effects anticipated by its advocates.},

Abstract = {A large literature contends that conservatives differ from liberals in
   their dispositional sensitivity to threat and needs for social order and
   security. Thus, a puzzle emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic when
   American conservatives, despite their purported threat sensitivity,
   responded to the pandemic in ways that evinced little concern toward the
   risks posed by COVID-19. Threat tolerant liberals present an equally
   interesting case, having fervently masked, isolated, and advocated for
   stringent public health restrictions when facing down COVID-19. Why did
   so many Americans adopt health behaviors and policy preferences at odds
   with their dispositional orientations toward threat and needs for
   security during the COVID-19 pandemic? In this paper, I analyze three
   national surveys to evaluate how psychological dispositions affected
   Americans' responses to COVID-19. I find that authoritarianism, a common
   measure of dispositional threat sensitivity and needs for security,
   conditionally affected Americans' responses to the pandemic. Directly,
   authoritarianism was associated with greater concern over COVID-19 and,
   in turn, increased willingness to engage in protective health behaviors,
   support restrictive public health measures, and support economic
   interventions amidst the pandemic-induced downturn. Indirectly, however,
   authoritarianism promoted identification with and cue-taking from
   right-wing elites who frequently downplayed the severity of COVID-19;
   attention to such rhetoric reduced politically engaged authoritarians'
   concern over COVID-19 and, in turn, their willingness to adopt
   protective health behaviors and support public health restrictions or
   economic interventionism. Attention to political discourse thus appears
   to have countervailed Americans' dispositional orientations toward
   threat and security during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {Soft power is one of the most influential concepts in the discipline of
   international relations, yet it is highly criticized for ambiguity and
   analytical weakness. Thus, through thoughtful literature reviews,
   scholars continue with clarifying and mapping the theory within a
   broader political power research programme. It is in this scholarly
   context that this article offers tools from a bibliometric network
   analysis that could be useful in understanding scholarly approaches to
   soft power. The constructed network of authors with edges representing
   connections set on keywords allows us to demonstrate the place of the
   soft power expert community and the proximity of corresponding research
   interests.},

Abstract = {This article conceptualizes malign soft power, intentionally harming
   through attraction. The analysis differentiates benign from malign soft
   power; explains how flows of information, characterized by their
   content, velocity, and access, serve as attractors by forcefully
   engaging emotions; and presents a taxonomy of modes of malign soft power
   (seduction, amusement, and trickery). To illustrate how malign soft
   power works, the article examines conspiracy theory as a type of
   trickery and presents the exemplars of the `blood libel,' which since
   the 12(th) Century has accused Jews of ritual murder, and Pizzagate,
   which since 2016 has accused prominent Democrats of lurid child abuse.},

Abstract = {The present paper proposes an instrument to measure the risk of
   terrorist conflicts through the concept of affiliation to a terrorist
   organization. The proposed instrument is called the Tool for the
   Assessment of Terrorist Affiliation Degree (TATAD) and measures how
   close the respondents are to a complete affiliation, on a scale of four
   degrees. Based on the Methodology for the Analysis of Computerised
   Textual Data, each degree is characterized by specific interactive
   modalities that differ in the ways they contribute to conflict or to
   community cohesion. Based on the degree of affiliation, it is possible
   to anticipate acts of conflict that are coherent with the modality of
   interaction measured by TATAD. By considering the interactive
   modalities, and not only the contents linked to terrorism, the process
   of affiliation is the same independently of the type of terrorist
   society and its beliefs (ideological, religious, etc.). Therefore, TATAD
   can be used independently of the specific context and motives of
   terrorism. By detecting critical modalities of interaction, TATAD can be
   used to support decision making and plan interventions to promote
   community cohesion in prisons and migration services, and to evaluate
   the efficiency of counter-terrorism strategies, policies and projects
   aimed at promoting social cohesion.},

Abstract = {Drawing on Europeanization and policy change scholarships, and with the
   aim of understanding the extent to which Next Generation EU has become a
   vector of policy change in the country, this article analyses policy
   reforms concerning the ecological transition, which Italy has designed
   within the framework of its National Recovery and Resilience Plan
   (NRRP). More specifically, the study provides a descriptive analysis of
   the two versions of the plan (Conte's proposal and Draghi's final
   version) in order to unveil the nature and direction of policy change
   embedded in particular in its final version, as compared to previous
   Italian ecological policies. The empirical research presented in the
   article shows that the logics of path-dependence and policy layering
   have prevailed in the design of the green pillar of the NRRP, as it
   introduced a limited number of policy reforms; lacked specific
   implementation targets, and was developed in conformity with a highly
   fragmented and top-down style of policy making: one that was typical of
   previous Italian environmental and climate policies.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {The following proposal seeks to explore and reconstruct the initial
   trajectory of one of the main leftist parties that emerged after the
   fall of the last military dictatorship in Argentina: the Movement For
   Socialism (MAS), and in particular the regional Cordoba. As is known,
   since its foundation in September 1982, the MAS achieved a certain
   influence within the labor movement through its union currents and also
   sought to position itself in the renewed election scene. Although
   research on political activism in general and on the left in particular
   for the 1980s has emerged in recent years, the experience of activism in
   provincial regionals continues unexplored, neglected or being read
   through central documentation/official of these organizations,
   replicating this bias due to the almost nonexistence of regional
   archives of the left. Analyzing unpublished documents, flyers and
   internal partisan circulars of the Cordoba region, we will seek to
   reconstruct the first years of MAS activism in Cordoba with the
   intention of contributing to the global knowledge of the
   post-dictatorship or transitional left, emphasizing the views elaborated
   around the social order. the democratic transition and the new militant
   profile that the time suggests building.},

Abstract = {Political liberals have regularly been accused of being antidemocratic.
   The standard version of this objection maintains that in prioritizing
   liberal rights, political liberals leave insufficient room for
   democratic self-legislation. Leading political liberals like Jonathan
   Quong have denied the force of this objection, by arguing that certain
   liberal rights are beyond reasonable dispute and that there is nothing
   objectionably undemocratic about having constitutional guarantees in
   place to protect them. In this article, I argue that the democratic
   problem with Quong's political liberalism is not the emphasis on
   constitutional safeguards for liberal rights. Rather, Quong's theory
   cannot ensure that even a basic desideratum for democratic
   decision-making is met. We are thus faced with the choice of granting
   citizens the right to make democratic decisions and Quong's
   antidemocratic political liberalism.},

Title = {Economic Structural Conditions that Influenced over the Advance and
   Victory of the New Left in Colombia (elections 2018 and 2022)},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In Colombia there have been no electoral processes of transformation of
   the electoral preferences of the voters that imply the passage from one
   ideological cycle to another or from preferences for right-wing parties
   and candidates to left-wing parties and candidates, until the 2006
   elections and clearer until those of 2018, which showed the beginning of
   the breakdown of the preference for right-wing candidates. Therefore,
   Colombia's entry into the Latin American wave of the shift to the left
   has been a lagging phenomenon that has made the country's electoral
   behavior a kind of outlier with respect to the rest of the region. The
   theories on the economic vote frame in this case the selected theories
   of Queirolo (2013(3)) and Levitsky and Roberts (2011(4)) which comprise
   a multi-causal spectrum but specify at least five economic key
   indicators {[}poverty, inequality, unemployment, inflation and economic
   growth of informality] regarding its impact on the turn to the left.
   This article seeks to establish the existence of such an association
   between its increase during the years prior to the arrival of the left
   for the first time in Colombia and in the electoral years and the
   delayed change in electoral preferences by the Colombian electorate.},

Abstract = {If Machiavelli was a committed republican, as the dominant
   interpretations suggest, then why did he heap praise on an oligarchic
   creditor government that ran the city of Genoa in the fifteenth century?
   In the Florentine Histories, Machiavelli offers a curious encomium to a
   remarkable oligarchic institution in Genoa: the Bank of Saint George
   (Casa di San Giorgio). A creditor association and oldest chartered bank
   in the world, San Giorgio owned Genoa's public debt. In return for the
   credit it extended to the commune, the Casa exercised a striking degree
   of fiscal, judicial, political, and even military power. This
   politically unaccountable creditor government with its discretionary
   powers would seem to violate Machiavelli's commitments to
   institutionalized forms of sharing power. This article offers a
   sustained analysis and historical contextualization of Machiavelli's
   remarks about San Giorgio. Drawing on historical research on public debt
   in Renaissance Italy, I put forward a new hypothesis to explain
   Machiavelli's praise for the institution.},

Abstract = {Are there any environmentalists left in the Republican Party? Using
   exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and data from the League of
   Conservation Voters (LCV) for the 115th (2017-2018) and 116th
   (2019-2020) Congresses, the author finds that around 25\% of Republicans
   in the House of Representatives and 40\% of those in the Senate are more
   supportive of environmental legislation than the average Democrat in
   their respective chambers, when separating partisanship from
   environmentalism. However, findings also suggest that environmentalism
   for Republicans tends to focus far more on conserving existing programs
   and resources than it does on advocating for progressive new policies to
   address emerging problems, like climate change, so it manifests
   differently than environmentally focused initiatives that are synonymous
   with the policy doctrine of Democrats.},

Abstract = {This legal comparative article analyzes the regulatory framework of
   lobbying services provided by law firms in the European Union and the
   USA. The comparison of regulation between the jurisdictions focuses on
   three aspects: (1) the definition of lobbying, (2) the legal advice
   exception, and (3) alignment with bar association rules. While the EU
   and the USA are largely aligned on the first two points, the differences
   emerge with respect to the third. The EU regulatory framework ignores
   lawyers' professional obligations, which, together with the bar
   associations' half-hearted embrace of lobbying rules, is found to be the
   main reason why law firms in the EU fly under the regulatory radar. With
   lawyers increasingly becoming involved in the lobbying and advocacy
   market, the EU and its Member States need to bring their rules on par
   with the US regulatory model that acknowledges bar association rules as
   lobbying regulation.},

Abstract = {North Dakota's unique statewide parking-meter ban was instituted by
   initiated measure in 1948. The 2017 legislative session witnessed the
   most credible effort to repeal the ban in decades. The legislative
   debate centered on tradition, the state's long-standing urban-rural
   split, and its lingering populist roots. The authors place this debate
   within a larger rural-consciousness literature and examine how the
   politics of rural resentment contributed to maintaining the
   parking-meter ban, as well as the willingness of state lawmakers to use
   preemption as a tool to constrain the authority of larger cities. The
   authors also examine the complexity surrounding individual place-based
   identities. The extent to which urban residents in a rural state can
   simultaneously identify as ``urban{''} relative to state-based policies
   and politics and ``rural{''} relative to federal-based policies and
   politics merits further consideration.},

Title = {The multidimensional recognition of religion},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 14},
Abstract = {In this article, we present a case for the recognition of multiple
   religions, arguing that states have a non-absolute duty to recognise
   religions which it is likely they should discharge along different
   dimensions and to different degrees. More concretely, we focus on
   several Western European states (or regions thereof), arguing that they
   would be more legitimate if they were to recognise an extensive range of
   faiths and ethno-religious groups. In order to make this argument, we
   deploy a method of iterative contextualism, consisting of two
   interlocking steps which can be thought of as obverse halves of a
   hermeneutic circle. First we identify and describe two cross-contextual
   principles, which we call identification and discretionary recognition.
   Then we suggest how it may be shown that these principles are already
   present to a significant degree in Denmark, Finland and Alsace-Moselle -
   the three contexts with which we are particularly concerned here. This,
   then, is a normatively robust and contextually sensitive argument for
   the multidimensional recognition of religion by a state, and at the same
   time it explains how we apply the method of iterative contextualism.},

Abstract = {The Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
   Organization, dismantling five decades of reproductive choice
   established in Roe v. Wade, will have a chilling, and likely tragic,
   impact on women's capacity to control their own bodies and their
   reproductive destinies. It may also unleash an array of policy attacks
   or private strikes against already vulnerable publics, outside of the
   context of abortion. Alito's majority opinion and Thomas's concurrence
   have placed a target on the backs of vulnerable communities by removing
   the glue that connected a range of protections and then explicitly
   calling for more carnage. Their decisions also reveal a troubling
   disregard for fact, science and reason.},

Abstract = {Instead of focusing on ``why voters appear to tolerate rather than
   punish{''} as most previous literature, this paper advances an
   alternative explanation: it seeks to explain how voters process
   information about corruption. Consistent with research on public opinion
   formation, this paper argues that voters can perceive the same event and
   make different interpretation about its meaning. Based on an original
   survey experiment conducted during the 2018 presidential election in
   Mexico, this study finds that citizens hold partisan attitudes and are
   motivated to protect these partisan predispositions, which make them
   interpret common events in different way. In particular, when this study
   informed voters that an unnamed candidate engaged in corruption,
   respondents unequivocally considered such actions as corrupt. However,
   when the name of their co-partisan candidate was explicitly mentioned as
   engaging in the same activities, voters rejected to qualify them as
   corrupt. Partisans are not ``tolerating{''} or ``condoning{''}
   corruption; partisans tend to choose interpretations that rationalize
   their partisan priors and justify their co-partisans' behavior.},

Abstract = {Journalists have the power to shape the public's perception of new
   premiers. They also share that power with the sources they interview.
   Sourcing is therefore important when making claims about the news
   media's role in reproducing gender biases in representations of
   political leaders. We examine the question of sourcing through an
   analysis of newspaper coverage of 22 newly elected women and men
   subnational government leaders in Australia and Canada to answer the
   following questions. How do news writers rely on sources in evaluations
   of new premiers? To what extent do they employ different patterns of
   sourcing and are these sourcing patterns gendered? We focus on two pairs
   of leadership traits that dominate news coverage of premiers in the
   first week: strength/weakness and competence/incompetence. We find that
   journalists use unattributed assessments rather than sources when
   evaluating premiers' skills and abilities, but when sources are cited,
   these are usually elite men.},

Abstract = {This essay aims to reconstruct the `genetic' phase of Norberto Bobbio's
   research on liberalism, through the theoretical confrontation he
   developed with some reference liberal authors, which we usually call
   `classics'. The paper reconstructs, first of all, the path of Bobbio
   from the years of his liberal formation, which took place in the sign of
   the works of Benedetto Croce, to the first gradual departure from the
   Crocian concept of freedom during the years of the Resistance. After the
   end of the Second World War, also thanks to the encounter with Karl
   Popper's work, Bobbio's arrival to the methodological individualism took
   place as well as the definitive departure from the idealistic and
   Croce's conception of freedom. The systematic criticism Bobbio addressed
   to his idea of liberalism, was developed in the volume Politics and
   culture, a crucial work to understand what the philosophical foundations
   of liberalism are according to Bobbio. The interpretation he gave of
   Benjamin Constant's thought is important for two different reasons:
   firstly, starting from Constant, Bobbio anticipated as early as 1954 the
   famous Isaiah Berlin's distinction between negative and positive
   liberty; secondly, this interpretation is fundamental to highlight the
   particularity and the anomaly of Bobbio's liberalism.},

Abstract = {The incidence of double majorities is rare in the Westminster system.
   Whilst upper house majorities have been the topic of previous studies, I
   examine its effects on committee activity. I consider Australian Senate
   committee activity during the majority of 2005 to 2008, and compare it
   to Western Australian Legislative Council committee activity during the
   first year of its majority in 2021 to identify any trends. I find that
   committee activity decreased and changed during the Senate majority,
   with increased inquiries into bills but with reduced reporting
   timeframes. I then find that the Western Australian experience has not
   followed this trend so far in its first year of an upper house majority.
   These findings are important in establishing trends in committee
   activity for future case studies into upper house majorities.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a study that analyzed from a
   socio-critical perspective the implementation Lean Management the
   Chilean Retail industry. The study was based on a qualitative design of
   an exploratory nature that considered in-depth interviews with key
   informants and workers who belonged from different hierarchical levels.
   The results refers how the cultural and socio-labor matrices of the
   Chilean neoliberal business class, as well as the specific
   characteristics of the Retail production model, influenced the adoption
   and translation process of the modelo in this industry. They also
   highlited the way in which different actors within this scenario
   participated in differentiated and unequal ways in the installation of
   the model. The findings contribute to the understanding some of the
   particularities and asymmetries present in the processes of productive
   restructuring and business modernization that have occurred in Chile and
   Latin America in recent decades},

Journal = {POLITICA \& SOCIETA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {411-428},
Month = {SEP-DEC},
Abstract = {The article focuses on the link between law and duration: to assure the
   endurance of a group is the fundamental job of every legal institution.
   Therefore, law is in charge of remedying conflicts, disputes and
   litigations that could break the unity of the group. The purpose of the
   paper is to demonstrate that this repair-work could be realized in two
   very different ways: on one side, it could be a work to prevent,
   minimize and limit the conflictuality. In this case, the endurance of a
   group is assured through a strong anchor with tradition that refuses
   every social change and forces the group to conform to a unique
   standard. On the other side, law can remedy social rifts through a work
   of continue mediation and negotiation between social actors, which aims
   to compose (and not to end) social divisions. The first kind of legal
   remedy will be analysed through the opinion of the Supreme Court of the
   United States in the case Dobbs v. Jackson; the second type of legal
   remedy will emerge starting from the legal theory of Karl Llewellyn and
   Laura Nader.},

Title = {Gendering Cabinet Reshuffles in France and Spain},
Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 19},
Abstract = {Presidents and prime ministers who form gender-parity cabinets receive
   positive news coverage and public praise. Cabinet reshuffles, with less
   attention, may offer scope to decrease the numbers of female ministers.
   Although research on the gendered impact of reshuffles is sparse, some
   studies suggest that women's presence declines during reshuffles. This
   article explores the gendered dynamics of reshuffles that follow initial
   gender-parity cabinets, asking whether the reshuffle context affects the
   proportions of men and women in reorganized cabinet teams. Employing a
   comparative case study approach, the article analyses initial
   gender-parity cabinets and subsequent reshuffled cabinets in France and
   Spain across three different presidents and prime ministers. We find
   that gender parity functions as a concrete floor, sustained in cabinet
   reshuffles, unaffected by political shocks and party system changes, and
   without consequence for women's appointments to high-prestige
   ministerships.},

Abstract = {The European and African experiences of integration have followed
   different historical trajectories. However, Africa's approach to
   regionalism seems to be dominated by European conceptions in two areas:
   political and institutional. From an institutional perspective, a number
   of European Union and African Union institutions bare certain
   similarities. Do these institutional similarities represent traceable
   evidence of the diffusion of regional integration from the European
   Union to the African Union? This article answers this question using a
   process tracing methodology within a policy transfer and diffusion
   framework. It tests for evidence of diffusion haven occurred through
   conditionalities (incentives) offered from EU support for Africa's
   continental integration as well as for lesson drawing and emulation by
   the AU. It finds no traceable evidence of diffusion from the EU to the
   OAU/AU between 1963 to 2003 and concludes that normative emulation is
   the most probable cause of the institutional similarities between the EU
   and AU.},

Abstract = {This paper examines democracy's impact on the labor share of income: the
   share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) dedicated to wages, salaries, and
   benefits. I hypothesize democratic regimes afford labor the opportunity
   to increase its share of national income. While previous empirical work
   finds cross-sectional evidence for the hypothesis, this paper employs a
   time-series cross-sectional analysis using data for 119 countries
   between 1950 and 2017, indicating the labor share of income is higher in
   democratic countries. The estimates are robust to different
   specifications of the statistical model. This paper also examines a
   potential causal mechanism that links democracy to a higher labor share
   through the supply of labor (the average number of hours worked in the
   economy). The relationship between democracy and the supply of labor
   lends additional evidence to my hypothesis. In a world characterized by
   diverging democracy, the results imply the path countries choose between
   democracy and dictatorship matters.},

Abstract = {On August 2, 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. Over the next three days,
   President George H. W. Bush, his advisors, and world leaders would
   debate and determine the United States' goals and objectives. These
   decisions would compel the country's trajectory for the next several
   months. The process regarding the determination to reverse Iraqi
   aggression, if necessary with force, provides a compelling case study
   regarding the use of historical analogies in presidential decision
   making. Using original archival research, this in-depth history reveals
   that historical analogies played a key role in shaping policy on the eve
   of the Iraq War. This article provides the most complete history of the
   use of analogies in the initial response to the Gulf crisis to date, as
   well as valuable insight into the Gulf War, President H.W. Bush, and the
   process of presidential decision making.},

Abstract = {We explore the relationship between Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) and
   Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) carrier freight rates and global
   geopolitical risk, while also controlling for the macro environment. Our
   results show that a shock in geopolitical risk significantly increases
   the cost of the spot charter rates for both LNG and LPG carriers, with
   the impact reaching around 25\% for the former and 18\% for the latter.
   Our results bear significant implications for both the companies and the
   countries involved in the liquefied gas trade, with its importance
   growing as the use of this energy source is likely to continue
   substituting other fossil fuels in the future.},

Abstract = {An increasing number of states permit dual citizenship, but there are
   public concerns about divided loyalties of dual citizens which might
   lead to intolerance of their political rights. We propose and test
   whether these concerns depend on the emotional versus instrumental
   reasons immigrants express for acquiring their second, host society
   citizenship. Using a survey experiment on a nationally representative
   sample of native-born Dutch, we find that emotional (vs. instrumental)
   reasons for a second citizenship lead to higher perceived host society
   loyalty, which is related to greater political tolerance of dual
   citizens. Instrumental reason for dual citizenship leads to higher
   perceived loyalty to the country of origin; however, this is not related
   to political tolerance of such dual citizens. Implications for theory
   and society are considered.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how class of origin and intergenerational
   social mobility impact left-wing party support among new and old core
   left-wing electorates in the context of post-industrial electoral
   realignment and occupational transformation. We investigate the
   remaining legacy of political socialization in class of origin across
   generations of voters in the UK, Germany and Switzerland. We demonstrate
   that part of the contemporary middle-class left-wing support is a legacy
   of socialization under industrial class-party alignments, as many
   individuals from working-class backgrounds - traditional left-wing
   constituencies - have a different (post-industrial) class location than
   their parents. These enduring effects of production worker roots are
   weaker among younger generations and in more realigned contexts. Our
   findings imply that exclusively considering respondents' destination
   class underestimates the relevance of political socialization in class
   of origin, thereby overestimating electoral realignment. However, these
   past industrial alignments are currently unparalleled, as newer
   left-wing constituencies do not (yet) demonstrate similar legacies.},

Abstract = {Understanding the determinants of support for democracy remains at the
   heart of many puzzles in international and comparative political
   economy. A central but still unresolved topic in this literature is the
   conditions under which such support dissipates. To answer this question,
   this article focuses on distributional politics: since democratic
   leaders possess limited budgets but need to win elections, they often
   skew resources toward one politically influential sector, leading to
   more negative attitudes toward democracy among electorally ignored
   populations. In particular, we argue that governments often face a key
   political trade-off: whether to direct resources to the agricultural
   sector or to encourage urban development. After developing this argument
   in a formal model, we detail historical accounts that substantiate the
   mechanisms identified in the model. Finally, we provide cross-national
   quantitative evidence that discontent with democracy increases among
   geographic populations when governments disproportionately distribute
   resources toward other sectors.},

Abstract = {Fifty years after the publication of Exit, Voice, and Loyalty, Albert
   Hirschman's work is receiving renewed attention in leading journals,
   including efforts to develop formal models and new strands of democratic
   theory that capture his insights. These efforts have led some to
   conclude that power flows exclusively from an ability to exit at low
   cost, and that we can only empower the weaker elements in society by
   giving them more choices-more ability to switch from one public goods
   supplier to another. I examine work by leading proponents of these views
   and argue that their approaches ignore the role that constrained exit
   opportunities play in fomenting collective action and voice, not merely
   to signal dissatisfaction, but to provide information on where leaders
   have gone too far and what needs to be done. We should expect to see
   leaders respond to member dissatisfaction both when members can cheaply
   leave and when they have no way out, with the problematic zone lying in
   between-exactly where ``voucher{''} systems for public goods propose to
   take us.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces the Extraterritorial Rights and Restrictions
   dataset (EVRR), the first global time-series dataset of non-resident
   citizen voting policies and procedures. Although there have been
   previous efforts to document external voting, no existing data source
   simultaneously captures the scale (195 countries), time frame (71
   years), and level of detail concerning extraterritorial voting rights
   and restrictions (over 20 variables). After a brief overview of prior
   datasets, we introduce EVRR coding criteria with a focus on conceptual
   clarity and transparency. Descriptive analysis of the dataset reveals
   both the steady expansion of extraterritorial voting as well as several
   regional and temporal trends of voting rights restrictions. Finally, we
   revisit and extend the work of two groundbreaking cross-national studies
   focused on the causes and effects of external voting rights. Using EVRR
   data we demonstrate that including more fine-grained aspects of
   extraterritorial voting provisions in these analyses improves
   understanding of important political and economic outcomes.},

Abstract = {Ideological discourses of Central Asia have been subject to much
   research. However, the use and the role of ideological discourses in
   framing internationalization of education policy has been largely
   overlooked. While much has been studied on how and why
   internationalization of higher education (HE) became indispensable part
   of tertiary sector, the cases where internationalization of HE is
   confronted by a government ideology agenda has largely remained outside
   of scholarly attention. This pioneering research offers analysis on
   ideology-based resistance to internationalization of education in
   authoritarian regimes. The paper argues that it is the framing of
   internationalization as a threat to national ideologies and a national
   model of education that confronts HE internationalization in some
   authoritarian political orders. The paper uses the case of post-Soviet
   Uzbekistan that promoted national ideologies as the basis of its
   education model. To support its argument, the paper analyses the
   official discourses of former President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan
   (1991-2016) and the statements of government officials on the country's
   national education model. It also analyses the interviews held with
   staff of HE institutions in Tashkent.},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that the public tends to see some groups as
   less deserving of social rights. Our focus in this article is whether
   they are also seen as less entitled to engage in political
   claims-making. Recent theorists of inclusive nationalism argue that
   whether minorities are seen as having the right to codetermine the
   future may depend on whether the majority believes minorities are
   morally committed to the nation. Drawing on a unique survey experiment,
   we test this intuition by analyzing how majority perceptions of a
   minority's commitment to the larger society influence support for
   claims-making by immigrants and national minorities. We show that
   immigrants, French-speaking Quebeckers, and Indigenous peoples are
   judged more harshly about their right to make claims and that this is in
   part explained by the majority's views that these groups are not, in
   fact, committed members of the larger political community.},

Abstract = {How rampant is political discrimination in the United States, and how
   does it compare to other sources of bias in apolitical interactions? We
   employ a conjoint experiment to juxtapose the discriminatory effects of
   salient social categories across a range of contexts. The conjoint
   framework enables identification of social groups' distinct causal
   effects, ceteris paribus, and minimizes `cheap talk,' social
   desirability bias, and spurious conclusions from statistical
   discrimination. We find pronounced discrimination along the lines of
   party and ideology, as well as politicized identities such as religion
   and sexual orientation. We also find desire for homophily along more
   dimensions, as well as specific out-group negativity. We also find
   important differences between Democrats and Republicans, with
   discrimination by partisans often focusing on other groups with
   political relevance of their own. Perhaps most striking, though, is how
   much discrimination emerges along political lines - both partisan and
   ideological. Yet, counter-stereotypic ideological labels can counter,
   and even erase, the discriminatory consequences of party.},

Abstract = {Using survey data collected less than two weeks before the 2020
   presidential election, we investigated why likely Trump voters would
   support Trump resisting the election results if he lost. We first used
   an experiment with randomized hypothetical popular-vote margins to test
   whether support for resistance was contingent on the results of the
   election. We also directly asked respondents who stated that they would
   support resistance to explain their reasoning in an open-ended response.
   In doing so, we gained insight into one of the most turbulent elections
   in American history and examined how support for resistance existed
   before the election due to both misinformation about voter fraud and
   hyperpartisanship that made Trump voters view the electoral process
   itself as illegitimate.},

Abstract = {A substantial literature has been devoted to analyzing how legislators
   delegate regulatory power to a more knowledgeable agency. Yet, much less
   attention has been paid to understand how this delegation process is
   shaped by the environment in which this agency operates, and more
   specifically by the actions of interest groups. We propose a model of
   regulatory capture to assess how the distribution of information across
   interest groups and agencies impacts optimal delegation. Whether an
   interest group and his agency share information or not determines the
   scope for capture and how much discretion should be left to this agency
   in response. Whether asymmetric information reduces or increases
   discretion depends on the biases of the group and the agency vis-a-vis
   Congress. Groups that are more aligned with Congress collect politically
   relevant information, while more extreme groups remain poorly informed.
   The information structure that endogenously emerges increases discretion
   under broad circumstances.},

Abstract = {How do political conditions influence whether public support develops
   for a new policy? Specifically, does the presence of partisan
   polarization and a viable threat to a policy's continuation prevent the
   emergence of such support? We propose a theoretical framework that
   considers how policy feedback may be affected by the presence or absence
   of both policy threat and polarization. We argue that a threat is likely
   to increase policy salience and trigger loss aversion, expanding policy
   feedback even amid strong partisanship. We examine the threat to the
   Affordable Care Act after Republicans won control of Congress and the
   White House and stood poised to act on their long promise to repeal the
   law. Five waves of panel data permit analysis of how individuals'
   responses to the law changed over time, affecting their support for it
   as well as their voting calculations. The results suggest that policy
   threat heightens the effect of policy feedback for some populations
   while depressing it for others, in some cases mitigating partisan
   polarization, and overall boosting program support.},

Abstract = {Does the experiential legacy of participating in autocratic legislatures
   influence how autocratic-era opposition parties and politicians want to
   use legislatures in a subsequent democracy? Do they learn to use
   legislatures to strengthen or undermine democracy? Given the frequency
   of institutionalized autocracies, of opposition party led
   post-transition governments, and importance of legislatures in
   democracies these are important questions. This paper addresses them by
   first drawing on research on authoritarian legacies, and on
   organizational and individual learning to identify three potential
   institutional lessons opposition parties and politicians could learn
   from their autocratic legislative experience about how to use
   legislatures in a subsequent democracy. It then uses data from a survey
   of almost 200 Egyptian politicians conducted during the 2011 elections
   to test which lessons parties and politicians learned by focusing on
   their support for protecting judicial independence from legislative
   interference in the future democratic regime. We find that (i)
   experienced opposition parties learn a democracy-strengthening
   institutional lesson, (ii) experienced opposition politicians learn a
   democracy-weakening institutional lesson, and (iii) membership in an
   experienced opposition party curbed the undemocratic institutional
   preferences of experienced politicians. Thus, authoritarian institutions
   leave diverse legacies among ruling and opposition parties and
   politicians with very different consequences for subsequent democracy.},

Abstract = {An institutionalized party system is often regarded as a precondition
   for a well-functioning democracy. Recent recesses in democracy and, in
   particular, in the liberal dimension of democracy in relatively
   established party systems, however, warrant a fresh look into how party
   system institutionalization shapes liberal democracy. We use a dataset
   that covers 58 European party systems over more than a century to assess
   how party system institutionalization in the governmental arena -
   closure - is related to more robust liberal democracy. Our results show
   that stable coalition combinations are conducive to higher levels of
   liberalism, while infrequent government changes and the exclusion of new
   parties from the governmental arena have a detrimental role.},

Abstract = {In the wake of `end of ideology' predictions of the late twentieth
   century, nationalist ideologies and discourses have proven strikingly
   resilient, as have authoritarian regimes relying on nationalism for
   their legitimacy and power. Meanwhile, so-called liberal political
   philosophers and theorists who claim commitments to rights and justice
   make arguments that invigorate nationalist subjectivities at the expense
   of the rule of law. This essay explains how even those who are critical
   of nationalist, authoritarian regimes nonetheless use a vocabulary that
   reinvigorates Jacques Derrida's `sovereign beast'. Insights from Miguel
   de Cervantes and Franz Kafka are used to amplify Engin Isin's timely if
   not urgent arguments on behalf of theorizing citizenship as enactments
   that are creative, innovative, and autonomous, and not as a status
   derived from membership. Plato's views on justice and the `healthy
   politeia', as well as examples of creativity within existing governments
   are elucidated to further emphasize the benefits of theorizing new
   scripts for citizens over proposing new theories for governments.},

Abstract = {Do exclusionary policies mobilize minority political participation? We
   theorize that the threat of exclusionary policies creates and resurfaces
   grievances that facilitate mobilization. To test our theory, we leverage
   Donald Trump's announcement of a peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian
   conflict, which posed a threat to the citizenship status of Palestinian
   citizens of Israel residing in the Triangle area adjacent to the West
   Bank. First, using more than 170,000 posts from public Facebook groups
   and pages, we show that Trump's announcement was indeed a more salient
   political event for Triangle residents. Then, employing locality-level
   election data as well as records detailing the origin of citizens'
   joining a Jewish-Arab social movement, we use a difference-in-difference
   design to demonstrate that the threat to citizenship imposed by Trump's
   plan increased mobilization in the Triangle area. Our evidence from
   three distinct data sources suggests that threats of exclusion can
   mobilize minority political behavior.},

Abstract = {The resurgence of authoritarianism worldwide has led to renewed interest
   in the Frankfurt School theory of the authoritarian personality. In this
   article, I clarify the role of that idea in a class-theoretical critique
   of fascism by showing how it supplements the Marxist analysis. I first
   outline the Marxist theory of fascism with reference particularly to the
   puzzles of fascist politics and ideology, before arguing that the
   authoritarian personality construct helps solve some of these. Then, I
   clarify the fit between the theory of the authoritarian personality and
   Marxist theory by explicating its origins in the research programme of
   the Frankfurt School. Finally, I propose that the authoritarian
   personality construct explains the nature of the elements in the fascist
   ideological ``medley,{''} with reference to its key characteristics of
   rigid conventionalism, unquestioning obedience and authoritarian
   aggression.},

Abstract = {In this article the system of regional financing in Spain is examined.
   After defining the basic principles of fiscal federalism and its
   relationship with citizens' political preferences, we discuss the
   limitations of the current model and the possible reforms under three
   scenarios of weak, intermediate and strong federalism. The system of
   regional financing in Spain is compared to that of four federal
   countries: Germany, Canada, US and Switzerland. A propositional
   perspective is adopted in order to make some policy recommendations.},

Abstract = {Spain has undergone major political changes in recent years. Among them,
   the appearance of new terms such as ``the national-popular{''},
   introduced in the political national language by Podemos and Mas Pais'
   discourses. This article asks about the content that these political
   forces gave to that concept, of Latin American origin, in a European
   context. It also examines how they used it, in terms of analyzing-in a
   Gramscian perspective-if it was adapted to the historical specificity of
   Spain and its popular sectors. Finally, on the basis of that use, the
   article seeks to specify which meaning can acquire ``the
   national-popular{''}, under a latinoamerican perspective, in the spanish
   context.},

Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ESTUDOS POLITICOS},

Abstract = {The state's duty to protect (Schutzpflicht des Staates) appears as one
   of the greatest consequences of the objective dimension of fundamental
   rights, con-solidated by the German doctrine and jurisprudence after the
   Second World War. Thus, we intend to verify what are its bases and how
   its theoretical conforma-tion has occurred, as well as to analyze two of
   its main developments: the ``prohibition of insufficient protec-tion ``
   (Unterma beta verbot) and the ``prohibition of excess `` (uberma beta
   verbot). For this, the hermeneutical approach is used, based on
   bibliographical and jurisprudential research, from which the theoretical
   demarcation of fundamental categories for the investigation will be
   established, according to the work of scholars who are a reference to
   the theme, such as Christian Cal-liess, Gunter Durig, Claus-Wilhelm
   Canaris, Josef Isensee and Johannes Dietlein. With that, the aim is to
   allow Brazilian legal operators to get closer to the theories
   contributed, so that their criteria can also be more widely applied in
   the implementation and in the control of the state activity in relation
   to fundamental rights.},

   within the Central City was analyzed. The supply of housing increased,
   nevertheless, it was not enough for the population to increase at the
   expected levels in the area, due to the Demographic Transition process,
   which generated fewer people per household, as well as, the combination
   of other factors such as change in the land use, housing deterioration
   and the destruction of homes due to natural phenomena.},

Abstract = {Protected areas play an important role in biodiversity conservation, but
   they also carry local costs in the form of constraints on natural
   resource extraction. We investigate how policy makers make trade-offs
   between national environmental benefits and local economic costs, by
   examining the designation of protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon.
   Using a regression discontinuity design, we find causal evidence that
   the Brazilian government systematically overdesignates protected areas
   in municipalities controlled by opposition mayors relative to
   municipalities controlled by mayors in the president's political
   coalition. In addition, we find evidence that this dynamic is likely
   driven by the economic interests of local elites in safe districts, not
   by those of the municipal electorate. These results show that political
   considerations bias the geographic distribution of protected areas in
   the world's largest rainforest.},

Abstract = {Attention to the American carceral state has focused largely on its
   bookends: policing and sentencing. Between these bookends lies an
   underresearched but far-reaching ``shadow{''} carceral state, a hybrid
   of criminal and commercial systems that often contravenes the principles
   of liberty, due process, and equal protection. Pretrial detention is an
   iconic example. It accounts for the majority of people in local jails on
   a given day. Up to half of detainees will not be convicted, yet
   detention often lasts months and triggers significant losses. Most are
   detained because they are too poor to pay bail, and they are
   disproportionately Black. How does this widespread punitive, arbitrary,
   and unequal experience affect political behavior? Using administrative
   records and as-if random assignment of bail magistrates, we find that
   pretrial incarceration substantially decreases voting among Black
   Americans. These results point to the neglected but important shadow
   carceral state.},

Abstract = {The article applies a Habermasian approach to the reconstructive method
   to the dogmatics of Brazilian Public Finance Law. Such an endeavor is
   lead by a set of theoretical efforts directed to achieving concepts,
   hermeneutical standards and principles that prioritize fundamental
   rights, rather than focus on private wealth protection, as current
   mainstream works do. Hence, public budget and public debt issues
   detaches from the state -of-art approach that understands its object as
   the shrinking of social expenditures with no normative considerations on
   fiscal costs and risks related to the public debt management, which
   should be aimed at accomplishing proper exchange, monetary and credit
   policies. On the contrary, it stresses planning and decision-making
   aspects of a system established to assure the material conditions for
   the implementation of fundamental rights. Tax Law, coherently, is
   depicted as a social relation that promotes fundamental rights not only
   by the means of the resources it extracts, but on its own terms. Thus,
   it is no longer regarded as an irreconcilable conflict between the State
   and its taxpayers.},

Abstract = {A growing number of studies discuss the impact of non-political factors
   on the political success of incumbents. Theoretically, this literature
   addresses core ideas about electoral accountability and voter
   rationality. Scholars have explored factors such as shark attacks,
   weather, natural disasters, and sports results. So far, the evidence has
   been inconclusive and almost exclusively from majoritarian contexts,
   where government accountability is easy for voters to assign. We
   contribute with an analysis of whether nationally important sports
   success, such as Olympic gold medals, affect support for coalition
   governments in a multiparty context. We use monthly polling from Finland
   for a 28-year period from Jan 1994 to Dec 2021, which we combine with
   data on sports success. Our analysis shows that nationally important
   sports success has no impact on government popularity. The finding holds
   while controlling for traditional drivers of government popularity and
   across different operationalizations of government support and sports
   success. With this finding, the study joins several previous analyses,
   which have been supportive of voter rationality.},

Abstract = {The study established the role of electronic evidence in the system of
   administrative procedures in Ukraine and in the member states of the
   CouncilD itrecra o f Europe. Direct observation, comparison and analysis
   of the content of the documents were used. The key results of the study
   were the peculiarities identified from the use of electronic evidence in
   administrative procedures among the 47 member states of the Council of
   Europe; established sources of creation, origin of electronic evidence
   to be used in administrative procedures; the resolute attitude of the
   European Court of Human Rights and the Committee of Ministers of the
   Council of Europe towards electronic evidence in administrative
   proceedings. Unlike paper documents, electronic documents require
   special attention to their review, search and involvement in the case.
   It is concluded that the study of electronic evidence should be
   approached from the point of view of the knowledge and skills of
   specialists, experts and interpreters who have the appropriate license
   and experience. The prospects for further investigations are
   establishing the importance of law enforcement agencies in the field of
   cybersecurity in ensuring the integrity of electronic evidence used in
   administrative proceedings.},

Abstract = {Committee formation in early American legislatures happened when those
   assemblies were inundated with petitions, a relationship unexamined in
   institutional political science. We develop a model where a floor
   creates committees to respond to topic-specific petitions, predicting
   committee creation when petitions (1) are topically specific, (2) are
   spread across constituencies, and (3) have complex subject matter, and
   predicting committee appointments from petition-heavy constituencies.
   Analysis of case studies and with two original data sets-petitions sent
   to the Virginia House of Burgesses from 1766 to 1769, and over 100,000
   petitions sent to Congress and recorded in the House Journal
   (1789-1875)-shows that petitions, their complexity, and their geographic
   dispersion predict committee creation. Our theoretical argument helps
   reinterpret the entropy of political agendas and the origins of standing
   committees in American legislatures.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the study of the peculiarities of the exercise
   of corporate rights under the civil law of Ukraine in order to identify
   their specific characteristics. Through a documentary methodology, close
   to legal hermeneutics, it was concluded that the participant of a legal
   entity (company) may have not only corporate rights but also other
   rights over this legal entity (company). Therefore, it is not enough to
   say that the rights of a person whose participation is defined in the
   authorized capital are corporate. It is important that the content of
   these rights is due to the ownership share (share, number of shares) in
   the authorized capital of the legal person (company). It was also found
   that intangible corporate rights must be distinguished from the personal
   intangible rights of the individual. The concepts of ``non-economic
   rights{''} and ``non-economic personal rights{''} are not identical. In
   relation to a person, intangible rights should be divided into two
   types: non-economic rights that are not closely related to a person
   (e.g., non-economic corporate rights); intangible rights that are
   closely related to a person and are inseparable from a person (personal
   intangible rights).},

Abstract = {Divisive facilities, such as wind turbines, are important for society
   but controversial because they often carry local costs. Elections are
   the most important means for citizens to express their views about
   divisive facilities, but the political science literature on the topic
   has little to say about their electoral effects. To fill the gap, we
   examine wind turbine construction in the United States between 2003 and
   2012. An instrumental variable analysis shows that wind turbine
   construction generated large electoral benefits for (prorenewables)
   Democratic candidates: every megawatt of additional wind power capacity
   over statewide trend increased the Democratic vote share in US House
   elections by 0.03 percentage points. This electoral shift has
   contributed to a pro-environmental shift in congressional roll call
   voting on the environment. While the result is inconsistent with naive
   models of retrospective voting, it accords with positive reinforcement
   theories on how policies endogenously create their political support.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {78},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Receiving a healthy amount of sleep is essential to one's quality of
   life. Both sleep-wake timing preferences (chronotype) and sleep duration
   are implicated in health, academic achievement, and workplace
   performance. This study complements the existing sleep-politics
   literature by examining the associations between sleep duration,
   chronotype, and turnout with a representative cross-national survey
   dataset from nine national contexts. Our analyses demonstrate that
   greater sleep duration is non-linearly related to higher turnout; those
   who sleep too little or too much are less likely to vote. The results
   also show that morning chronotype is associated with higher turnout, but
   controlling for religiosity attenuates this relationship. We argue that
   healthy sleep duration and chronotype lay at the intersection of the
   socioeconomic and psychological resources necessary to participate in
   elections.},

Abstract = {Although vote intention polls are often used in the public debate as
   forecasts of future election outcomes, their predictive value has been
   subjected to scholarly inquiry. This research note contributes to the
   literature by assessing the predictive value of vote intention polls
   simultaneously at the macro-level (polls), meso-level (parties), and
   micro-level (voters). We analyse polls presented by the main polling
   agencies in the Netherlands (covering seven election cycles between 1998
   and 2021), as well as micro-level panel data (covering 27,572
   respondents and 46 polls between 2006 and 2010, and 35,574 respondents
   and 31 polls between 2010 and 2012). We reach three main conclusions.
   First, vote intention polls in the Netherlands generally do not provide
   more information than the previous election outcome, until the last few
   weeks of an election cycle. Second, the predictive accuracy of vote
   intention polls is lower for challenger parties than for non-challenger
   parties, particularly midway through the election cycle. Third, the
   predictive value for individual voters is generally very low, until the
   last few months before the election.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {While electoral reforms clearly affect how seats are (re)distributed
   among parties immediately after their adoption, they do not
   significantly change the (re)distribution of votes among parties. As
   political knowledge is positively related to turnout, we argue that the
   effect of majoritarian electoral reforms on the number of parties is
   contingent upon the turnout in the last election prior to the reform.
   Specifically, the lower the turnout level in the previous election, the
   more effective the majoritarian reform will be. However, the
   psychological effect of proportional reforms relies on the interplay
   between elites and voters and is highly uncertain. The argument is
   tested using aggregated data from 43 major electoral reforms worldwide
   from 1945 to 2020 and individual data from the first election held in
   New Zealand after the 1993 electoral reform.},

Abstract = {Scholars have extensively studied whether campaign attack advertisements
   -messages that attack individual candidates- mobilize or demobilize
   voters with mixed results. We argue that group-oriented partisan affect
   in campaigns -messages about the parties in general- is just as
   important given increasing trends of affective polarization. We use two
   survey experiments, one right before the 2020 presidential election and
   the other before the subsequent Georgia Senate runoff election, to
   examine the effects of partisan rhetoric on several measures of civic
   engagement. In the presidential election, neither positive partisan,
   negative partisan, nor personal apartisan appeals had a statistically
   significant effect on voters' enthusiasm, likelihood to volunteer, or
   likelihood to seek out more information about engaging in the election.
   In the second study, negative partisan appeals led registered voters in
   Georgia to report much higher levels of enthusiasm about their preferred
   candidate, but this result was driven by Republicans only. The findings
   contribute new insights about electoral context and asymmetric affective
   polarization to the literature documenting the mobilizing effects of
   negativity in campaigns.},

Abstract = {This study examines why regime survival rates vary across young
   democracies. The author argues that there is a relationship between the
   type of authoritarian regime and the survival of subsequent democracies.
   Old regime elites inherit valuable resources from former dominant party
   regimes that may increase the likelihood of authoritarian successor
   parties (ASPs) performing well under democracy. This, in turn, for one
   thing, reduces the fragmentation of the new ruling parties, which
   inoculates young democracies against political instability that could
   lead to regime collapse. For another, it can effectively check the
   government's power, thus preventing a new ruling party from crossing the
   line from democracy to authoritarianism. This study considers the
   hypothesis that dominant party regimes have a positive impact on the
   electoral performance of ASPs under democracy, thus contributing to the
   longevity of democracies, and tests that hypothesis by combining
   quantitative and qualitative analysis.},

Abstract = {Although a large scholarship exists on referendums, few have explored
   the impact of turnout levels on policy outcomes. There have only been
   two Swiss studies of turnout bias and referendum results, making the
   current study the first to employ U.S. state-level referendums to test
   the turnout bias hypothesis. Based on 735 cases of morality policy over
   a four-decade period (1980-2020) and a subset of 364 mixed morality
   policies, multivariate analysis found that turnout had no strong or
   positive effect on liberal outcomes. However, competitive elections did
   yield more liberal referendum outcomes, and we revisit the long-standing
   research stream on the impact of competitive elections and welfare
   policies. Since one 2020 study found no support for a partisan turnout
   bias favoring the Democrats, this finding of no turnout bias with
   respect to referendum outcomes adds credibility to their line of
   argument.},

Abstract = {I argue that changes in the numerical identity of groups do not
   necessarily speak in favour of the supersession of some historical
   injustice. I contend that the correlativity between the perpetrator and
   the victim of injustices is not broken when the identity of groups
   changes. I develop this argument by considering indigenous people's
   claims in Argentina for the injustices suffered during the Conquest of
   the Desert. I argue that present claimants do not need to be part of the
   same entity whose members suffered injustices many years ago. For
   identifying the proper recipients of reparation, all that is necessary
   is that the group who suffered the historical injustice under
   consideration has survived into the present. I also support a view upon
   which present living members of a certain group have reasons to redress
   those injustices perpetrated by their predecessors if they are
   relevantly connected with each other. In particular, by relying on the
   notion of collective inheritance, I argue that if present-day members of
   a certain group claim that they are the continuation of the group whose
   past members bequeathed them certain goods, they cannot consistently
   reject such a membership when the very same people legated them certain
   evils.},

Abstract = {Partisanship and polarization lend themselves to the problem of
   demonizing, where citizens construct narratives about ideological
   opponents. These demonizing narratives pose a danger to democratic
   politics, as they can prevent consensus and compromise and possibly even
   invite violence. In thinking about how to combat demonization, I turn to
   Aristotle's virtue ethics and the particular virtues of
   ``friendliness,{''} ``truthfulness,{''} and ``wittiness.{''} These
   ``conversational virtues{''} govern how we ought to interact within
   social contexts. By looking to these conversational virtues, we can
   determine how to leverage ethical principles not traditionally
   associated with political institutions.},

Abstract = {As with public opinion on other policy issues, attitudes toward
   transgender rights are partly driven by ``group-centric{''} reasoning.
   Those with more positive feelings toward transgender people are more
   likely to support policies that protect their rights. But linking group
   affect with policies impacting members of that group requires some
   knowledge and understanding of politics, which not all citizens possess
   to the same extent. In this research note, we demonstrate that political
   awareness moderates the relationship between affect toward transgender
   people and support for their civil rights. ANES data from 2016 and 2020
   show that more politically sophisticated respondents were more likely to
   connect their views of transgender people with policies that protect
   their rights. These results suggest that group-centric thinking is most
   prevalent among the most, not least, politically aware.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {56},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Civil-military relations are characterized by a fundamental dilemma. To
   lower coup risk, leaders frequently empower the military, which
   satisfies the armed forces with the status quo and enables them to fight
   against threats challenging the civilian leadership. Simultaneously, a
   too powerful military itself constitutes a potential threat that is
   capable of overthrowing the government. Our research adds to this debate
   by examining the impact of mechanization, that is, the degree to which
   militaries rely on armored vehicles relative to manpower, on coup risk.
   We discuss several (opposing) mechanisms before developing the
   theoretical expectation that higher levels of mechanization should lower
   the likelihood of a coup due to the increased costs of coup execution.
   Empirical evidence strongly supports this claim and, thus, contributes
   to our understanding of the emergence of coups as an essential breakdown
   of civil-military relations, while adding to the debate surrounding the
   many trade-offs leaders face when coup-proofing their regimes.},

Abstract = {This paper is an exploration of cinematic memory as a resource for
   remembering large-scale Keralan migration to the Gulf since the late
   1960s. The south Indian state of Kerala, which predominantly speaks
   Malayalam, is a major contributor to the migrant labour force in the
   Gulf region for the last five decades. However, until recently, the
   migrant figured in the public discourse of Kerala as an economic agent
   alone. There has been increasing instances of memorialising the Gulf in
   the Malayalam public sphere since the beginning of the 2000s which
   brings to light the subjective aspects of the Gulf migration. However,
   what is lost in these accounts is the simultaneity and interlinked
   nature of the two places. Cinema, on the other hand, offers resources to
   inscribe the mutuality of the two places in the collective memory of
   Kerala. Invoking Pierre Nora's concept of places of memory, the paper
   looks at cinematic renditions of `Dubai' as one such site of memory in
   the present when the image of Dubai and the profile of Keralan migrant
   has undergone a shift. Taking the example of one Malayalam film,
   Pathemari (Salim Ahamed, 2015), and tracing its cinematic genealogy,
   this paper analyses the ways in which `Dubai' is remembered and how this
   remembrance inscribes the Gulf as part of the collective memory of
   Kerala. The paper identifies the persistence of filmed space,
   intertextuality, and the archivality of the star body as the modes in
   which cinematic memory achieves this collective memorialisation. The
   mutuality between Kerala and Dubai, offered by cinematic memory, allows
   it to be an act of affective citizenship on the part of the migrants,
   i.e. embodied and sensorial acts of claiming the universal right to have
   rights.},

Abstract = {Agriculture is one of the most important sectors in Argentina's economy.
   Although most of the time congressional committees play a secondary role
   regarding agricultural policy, they become crucial in certain
   situations. In this article, we analyze the political economy of
   agriculture committee assignments in the Argentine Congress and the
   embeddedness of their members in the agricultural sector from 2001 to
   2019. Conventional wisdom holds that in Argentina a strongly
   presidential country with a congress full of amateur legislators and
   party-oriented career paths-the standing committee's composition
   reflects party leaders' preferences rather than constituencies'
   interests or legislators' backgrounds. Through descriptive analysis and
   a binary logistic regression, we show that many committee members are in
   fact experts in agriculture and are highly embedded in the sector,
   whereas others have no bonds whatsoever. Moreover, constituency
   preferences have some influence on committee appointments. These
   findings contribute to understanding better the legislative organization
   of Congress and the overlap between politics and this fundamental
   economic sector. They further help to expand the theoretical approach
   for studying economic committee composition in Argentina.},

Abstract = {This article juxtaposes the principle of academic freedom with the call
   for an academic boycott of Israel to advance Palestinian human rights.
   It examines the controversy surrounding a conference that took place at
   Stellenbosch University in South Africa in 2018, where an Israeli
   delegation was disinvited from presenting a research symposium following
   calls for an academic boycott. The article is an analysis of the media
   responses of academic leaders, activists, and social commentators in
   Israel and South Africa to the cancellation of the Israeli symposium at
   the conference. The argument advanced is that scholarship is influenced,
   facilitated and restrained by political systems, and that the academy is
   more accurately viewed as a political space where some wield power while
   others do not. The case is made that universities and academic
   conferences function as a consequence of historical and political forces
   and reflect the challenges with which states constantly engage.},

Abstract = {The last decade has seen an expansion of party primaries as a means of
   selecting legislative candidates. Since primaries are rarely subsidized,
   well-resourced candidates have a considerable advantage, which has an
   impact on equality, diversity and representation. This article focuses
   on the well-regulated legislative primaries in Israel, examining the
   gender gap in campaign expenditures, and its implication for the success
   of women candidates. The analysis is based on data regarding 365
   candidates (97 women and 268 men) who competed in seven primary contests
   in three parties between 2008 and 2015. Our findings show that male
   candidates spend on average more than female candidates do. However,
   this difference is pronounced among new candidates only. Moreover, we
   find that men do better than women in terms of electoral success and
   that this electoral advantage is explained by the differences in
   campaign expenses and the share of incumbents between women and men.},

Abstract = {This article develops and tests a new theoretical framework, gendered
   political socialization, which offers important insights into how
   children perceive gender in politics and the consequences of these
   perceptions on sex differences in political interest and ambition. Based
   on data from 1,604 children who live in four different regions across
   the United States, we find that children not only perceive politics to
   be a male-dominated space, but with age, girls increasingly see
   political leadership as a ``man's world.{''} Simultaneously, as children
   grow older, they internalize gendered expectations, which direct their
   interests toward professions that embody the gendered traits that fit
   with their own sex. One result of this mismatch between women and
   politics is that girls express lower levels of interest and ambition in
   politics than do boys.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {68},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {What are the political consequences of rising household debt in the
   context of fiscal austerity? I argue that cuts in welfare benefits
   privatize social obligations as voters address ensuing financial
   shortfalls by borrowing money. Debt re-commodifies individuals and
   shifts their electoral support from incumbents to opposition and
   anti-establishment parties by provoking feelings of political neglect,
   economic vulnerability, and strong emotional responses. I examine this
   argument by leveraging spatial and temporal variation in the rollout of
   Universal Credit (UC), a large-scale welfare reform in the United
   Kingdom. Using fine-grained administrative data on unsecured debt, I
   demonstrate that fiscal austerity generated an increase in indebtedness,
   which lowered support for the incumbent Conservatives and strengthened
   support for Labour and the UK Independence Party (UKIP). I then use
   individual-level survey data to explore the mechanisms that link debt
   and political behavior. The results suggest that rising indebtedness
   increases the political costs of welfare retrenchment and creates new
   political cleavages.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the potential role of the European Court of Human
   Rights in adjudicating cases related to climate change. The Court is
   currently facing its first four climate applications, and addressing
   them is more than a routine process of applying existing case law. These
   cases speak to fundamental questions regarding the Court's engagement
   with systemic problems, politically and technically challenging issues,
   and its own subsidiarity to state decision-making. Looking at recent
   environmental case law, this article identifies and discusses various
   possible futures for the Court's approach to climate cases, including
   from admissibility, substantive, and remedial perspectives. It also
   considers the tendencies and factors influencing the Court's potential
   response to climate claims. This includes its docket crisis, its
   evolution towards a `procedural turn', and its approach to the balancing
   of competing interests and its selection of the appropriate level of
   scrutiny. We conclude that the Court must contribute to the search for a
   modus vivendi that permits competing interests to coexist and ensures a
   liveable future. This is not only a question of ensuring future
   enjoyment of human rights, but also of safeguarding the Court's own
   ability to carry out its role and to thrive into the future.},

Abstract = {How and under what conditions might bureaucrats look to other states?
   Using a novel dataset of state early learning standards, I conduct dyad
   analysis to explain across-state citations in bureaucratic documents.
   Federal government programs can affect which states are looked to for
   ideas by defining which states are successful through competitive grant
   programs. Furthermore, the success of programs within the state affect
   whether bureaucrats look to other states. This article makes two
   important contributions to our understanding of policy. First, it
   explores how bureaucrats can participate in policy knowledge diffusion
   by looking to other states for information. Second, it sheds light on
   how we measure states as laboratories by marshaling an innovative
   dataset of citations within state documents. The article suggests states
   may not be limited to acting as laboratories through electoral
   institutions, but rather, they may also innovate as laboratories of
   bureaucracy.},

Abstract = {Constitutional conventions are popularly expected to attract many
   organized interests seeking to enshrine particularistic benefits into
   law for perpetuity, but there is limited empirical research on interest
   mobilization and lobbying at conventions. I propose that conventions
   attract different types of interests than legislative sessions and that,
   as a result, fears over runaway lobbying at conventions are overblown.
   Conventions and sessions differ in ways that affect interest
   mobilization. As opposed to legislators, convention delegates lack
   electoral incentives and focus on framework-related issues. Unlike
   proposed statutes, proposed constitutions must be approved by voters
   directly. These three differences discourage lobbying by narrow
   interests and encourage lobbying by broad interests. To test my claims,
   I examine archival records to identify the interests and lobbyists that
   were active during eight past conventions in American states. The
   findings contradict popular narratives: conventions attracted higher
   proportions of broad, membership-based interests than legislative
   sessions, and fewer interests overall as well. While convention
   interests employed comparable numbers of lobbyists as did session
   interests, they employed fewer multi-client lobbyists, on average. These
   findings have implications for how future conventions may be structured
   to ensure that constitutions are most representative of broad interests.},

Abstract = {Digital literacy is receiving increased scholarly attention as a
   potential explanatory factor in the spread of misinformation and other
   online pathologies. As a concept, however, it remains surprisingly
   elusive, with little consensus on definitions or measures. We provide a
   digital literacy framework for political scientists and test survey
   items to measure it with an application to online information retrieval
   tasks. There exists substantial variation in levels of digital literacy
   in the population, which we show is correlated with age and could
   confound observed relationships. However, this is obscured by
   researchers' reliance on online convenience samples that select for
   people with computer and internet skills. We discuss the implications of
   these measurement and sample selection considerations for effect
   heterogeneity in studies of online political behavior. We argue that
   there is no universally applicable formula for selecting a given
   non-probability sample or operationalization of the concept of digital
   literacy; instead, we conclude, researchers should make theoretically
   informed arguments about how they select both sample and measure.},

Abstract = {The American reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic is polarized, with
   conservatives often less willing to engage in risk-mitigation strategies
   such as mask-wearing and vaccination. COVID-19 narratives are also
   polarized, as some conservative elites focus on the economy over public
   health. In this registered report, we test whether combining economic
   and public health messages can persuade individuals to increase support
   for COVID-19 risk mitigation. We present preliminary evidence that the
   combination of messages is complementary, rather than competing or
   polarizing. When given a message emphasizing COVID-19's negative health
   and economic effects in a pilot study, conservatives increased their
   support for a broad range of risk-mitigation strategies, while liberals
   maintained high levels of support. A preregistered larger-n follow-up
   study, however, failed to replicate this effect. While complementary
   frames may be a promising way to persuade voters on some issues, they
   may also struggle to overcome high levels of existing polarization.},

Abstract = {This study is motivated by the puzzle of diminishing gains in the
   European Union budget bargaining for governments with a Eurosceptic
   domestic audience, even as Euroscepticism is increasingly represented in
   national legislatures. Engaging literature on fiscal federalism in the
   European Union and the institutionalist politics of its budgetary
   process, we argue that European integration diminishes the ability of
   member states' governments to leverage Euroscepticism to extract
   concessions from the European Union budget. This is because
   Euroscepticism is becoming less exceptional, and greater differentiation
   in integration reduces the will to reward those seen as systematically
   less committed to integration. Running panel-corrected standard errors
   regressions on Operating Budgetary Balances since 1977, we find that in
   intergovernmental bargaining, domestic popular Euroscepticism is an
   advantage, but parliamentary Euroscepticism is not.},

Abstract = {This article describes public records request assignments in courses in
   political science and in Asian American Studies. Beyond commonly known
   activities like voting, volunteering, signing petitions or peacefully
   protesting, students should gain experience in exercising their rights
   to an expansive set of government records that fall within the domain of
   ``the people's business.{''} Few courses include public records requests
   (e.g., implementation of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and state
   sunshine laws) as part of formal coursework assignments at the
   undergraduate level, although responsive records would be useful in, for
   example, course papers and in class oral history projects. For scholars
   of Asian American Studies, the FOIA can be used to uncover invaluable
   data and information that would otherwise be unavailable in traditional
   scholarly publications, textbooks, news articles and online posts. More
   generally, many students report that they are more interested in
   politics, knowledgeable and empowered regarding their political
   efficacy, as well as critical of bias in information flows from pundits
   in the media and from other sources after completing FOIA exercises.},

Abstract = {This essay discusses the emerging literature on APA religiosity and
   politics, with a focus on theologically conservative Christians.(1) APAs
   are both highly religiously diverse, and politically divided between
   those who identify more as conservative Christians and those who do
   less. More-educated, conservative Christian APAs experience
   cross-pressures from more-educated, social progressives (predominantly
   Democrats) and from less-educated, conservative Christians
   (predominantly Republicans). APA involvement in transnational religious
   networks sometimes reinforces, and sometimes bridges, the ``culture
   war{''} cleavages. The essay closes with suggestions on how political
   science professors can teach about, and to, religiously diverse
   Asian-Americans, including potential discussion topics and assignments.},

Abstract = {Based on ethnographic research after the 2005 earthquake in
   Pakistan-controlled Azad Kashmir, this article uses `disaster
   citizenship' as a conceptual lens focusing on how people renegotiated
   their relationships with the state in the context of political
   interventions for reconstruction. The promise of relief encouraged the
   poor to make new claims on the state as disaster victims and needy
   citizens deserving material assistance. Given the social and political
   inequalities and limited democratic rights in post-disaster Azad
   Kashmir, people pursued a politics of citizenship that resisted both
   notions of liberal rights and neoliberal politics of
   self-responsibility, seeking instead rightful material dependence on the
   state. This dependence was ambivalent and precarious as the poor were
   often deprived of the material rights they claimed. Therefore, disaster
   citizenship remained deeply entangled with social dependencies, and
   people had to resort to favors, bribes, and submissive patron-client
   relationships to access state resources and counter their political
   neglect.},

Abstract = {Brexit represents a constantly evolving and complex process. To explore
   it, this paper proposes a new perspective by applying reputation concept
   arguments in order to observe the general evolution of the EU-UK
   relationships investigated it from the cultural policy case and with a
   study of the British Council. It argues that the UK agency responsible
   for educational exchanges and cultural relations with international
   influence can be an example of re engagement. As soon as the referendum
   was announced, the British Council tried to capitalise on Brexit to
   strengthen its bilateral ties with the European cultural and educational
   institutions. The UK and the British Council do not have any motive to
   withdraw from interstitial spaces like European networks for example.
   The British Council thus reengages under a new status of third country
   in some European cultural networks or in some programs like Creative
   Europe or Erasmus+. The analysis of the British Council's reputation and
   soft power provides insights into its capacity to share and implement
   its post-Brexit story about European integration but also the tensions
   engendered by the specificity of the cultural field. Focusing first on
   the British Council's history and its links with the FCO, this article
   examines then the ``audience networks{''} that the British Council has
   developed. Finally, the rupture created by Brexit brings to strengthen
   its cooperation with its European counterparts and to re-enforce the
   post-Brexit EU-UK cultural cooperation.},

Abstract = {The European Union is often seen as a bulwark of progressive values,
   including LGBTI rights. By restricting such rights, politicians thus
   appear to reject the EU's fundamental principles. This paper argues,
   however, that anti-gender politics is often a surprisingly pro-European
   phenomenon. Many of its practitioners rebuff accusations of
   Euroskepticism. For them, rights restrictions are less an attempt to
   reject European integration than to redirect its trajectory. They aim to
   reconnect the EU with Europe's civilizational roots. The paper
   illustrates this argument by analyzing the discourse actors have used to
   justify anti-gender policies in three countries: Hungary, Lithuania, and
   Slovakia.},

Abstract = {Within the small literature on homelessness in political philosophy,
   freedom-based accounts loom large. Such accounts, however, give rise to
   minimalism concerns: concerns that these accounts are too modest in what
   they demand for those who are homeless, particularly when homelessness
   is considered in the context of wealthier countries. In this paper, I
   consider the success of minimalism charges against freedom-based
   accounts of homelessness. I argue that whilst such charges are aptly
   levelled against two major freedom-based accounts, from Jeremy Waldron
   and Christopher Essert, a third account can evade or respond to such
   charges. This is the autonomy-based account of homelessness. Although
   the autonomy-based account has come in for significant recent criticism
   on grounds of minimalism, I argue that properly understood and
   developed, it has the resources to ground a plausible account of
   homelessness.},

Abstract = {This essay aims to offer a clarification of the political significance
   of Raymond Williams's early work, situating it in the context of utopian
   thought. Through a detailed reading of Culture and Society's landmark
   concluding chapter, as well as his breakthrough novel Border Country,
   the essay argues that the core of Williams's early project turns on a
   sustained critique of capitalist-driven forms of abstraction. The
   radical political program Williams weaves out of this critique is to be
   understood, first and foremost, as a utopia of communication and
   community premised on the measuring and overcoming of division.},

   current popularity and its ruling party status and the Kuomintang's

   factor. So are recent laws that handicap the KMT. Thus, it appears the
   KMT will do poorly in the upcoming election in late 2022. However, the
   situation may be different in 2024. The KMT has time to fix its problems
   while other factors suggest certain trends may operate to its advantage.},

Abstract = {The object of this article is to study to what extent the imperfect
   bipartidism which characterized the Spanish parliamentary system since
   the transition to democracy has changed to a new parliamentary scenario
   of fragmentation and polarization. With that aim, parliamentary
   fragmentation and polarization in the Cortes Gener-ales are measured
   applying a number of existing criteria in the literature that have been
   here modified in order to focus on the central role played by
   parliamentary groups in the Spanish Parliamentary System. The conclusion
   is reached that fear of parliamentary polarized fragmentation which
   influenced the drafters of the Constitution of 1978 and the Standing
   Orders of the Parliament passed shortly after, did not really
   materialized until the 11th term of the Cortes Generales, almost forty
   years later than expected.},

Abstract = {Rohingya, an ethnic minority group in the Rakhine state of Myanmar, has
   been levelled as one of the most persecuted ethnic groups in
   contemporary time. For the last five decades, they have been undergoing
   systematic torture ranging from deprivation of citizenship to mass
   killing and forceful eviction from their inhabitants. The army of
   Myanmar spearheads this persecution, which is deemed as genocidal.
   However, the engagement of radical Buddhist groups and support from the
   local Burmese population worsened the situation. Along with army
   intervention and ethnic differences, some economic and geostrategic
   question is highlighted behind this inhuman situation. But Myanmar
   consists of more than 100 ethnic groups, and there are other similar
   areas with similar economic and geostrategic importance. Though there
   are several instances of conflict in some of those areas, they are
   almost unparalleled comparing that of the Rakhine state. Having
   acknowledged the multiple genealogies of this conflict, this paper
   focuses more on the state/nation building process of Myanmar to
   understand the exceptionalism of Rohingya persecution. We want to argue
   that rather than ethnic tension or geostrategic interest, the
   nation/state-building of Myanmar in different phases of its history can
   put more light on the unique suffering of the Rohingya population in
   Myanmar. Analyzing the key historical transition of Myanmar, we attempt
   to trace the gradual exclusivity of the Rohingya people in the evolution
   of State manufactured discourse on the question of nation and their
   deliberate enactment of specific identity while alienating the other.},

Abstract = {How much do electoral institutions matter for the rise of populist
   parties? Evidence on this question is mixed, with some scholars arguing
   that the role of electoral rules is small. We provide new evidence for
   the impact of electoral system change. The UK's adoption of a
   proportional electoral system for European elections in 1999 provides a
   unique opportunity to study the link between electoral rules and the
   ascendancy of right-wing populist parties. Employing both synthetic
   control and difference-in-difference methods, we estimate that the
   electoral reform increased the vote share of right-wing populists by
   about 12 to 13.5 percentage points on average. During a time when
   populism was rising across Europe, the reform abruptly shifted populist
   votes in the UK above the European trend and above more plausible
   comparison cases. Our results also imply that caution is needed when
   empirical results based on partial reforms are extrapolated to electoral
   system change.},

Abstract = {Do politicians represent the policy preferences of men and women equally
   post-war? Gender inclusiveness has particularly high stakes in this
   context: research shows that it can help sustain peace. We use a series
   of survey experiments with politicians (N = 1389) and voters (N = 3049)
   to study gender bias in policy representation in a post-conflict
   setting: Bosnia. We find a significant pro-male bias in the policy
   responsiveness of local politicians (both men and women) to their
   constituency preferences. We do not find evidence that this is because
   men are more active and vocal about expressing their policy preferences.
   Instead, this bias is present in the post-war society more generally:
   politicians' attitudes reflect the pro-male bias among voters, both men
   and women. These results have important implications for the study of
   gender and post-conflict politics.},

Abstract = {How does trade openness affect individuals' social policy preferences in
   emerging markets? Drawing upon the theories of economic openness, risk,
   and social policy preference, we examine how trade openness and job
   sectors jointly shape preferences on social protection in China, the
   largest emerging market. Using the World Value Survey (WVS) Wave VI and
   archival macroeconomic indicators in 2012, we find that trade openness
   is associated with higher demands for government responsibility in
   social protection. We also find, compared with public-sector employees,
   private-sector employees exhibit lower levels of support to the role of
   government in social protection. The public-private divide in policy
   preferences, nevertheless, diminishes in regions with high levels of
   trade openness. This research provides new evidence to the risk-model of
   social policy preferences in the Chinese context. It also highlights the
   importance of considering the significant differences between public and
   private-sector employees in their social policy preferences.},

Journal = {CITIZENSHIP STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {245-261},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Although most Western militaries include women, the military remains a
   hyper-masculine organization where women's service is threatened and
   unstable. Since the military is a citizenship-conferring institution, we
   ask, what civic subjectivity do women soldiers develop considering their
   enduring experience of inequality? Based on 141 retrospective accounts
   by Israeli women soldiers, we argue that women's civic subjectivity is
   based on a sense of gratitude for the opportunity to participate in a
   central state institution. As a moral sentiment, gratitude ties women to
   the nation in bonds of commitment and belonging, but at the same time
   ensures their acceptance of and compliance with the gendered military
   hierarchy. Women's `civic subjectivity of gratitude' is a byproduct and
   expression of structural gendered inequality and at the same time
   reproduces it. Nonetheless, cracks begin to appear in the women's sense
   of gratitude when they encounter gendered devaluation, sexual
   harassment, or military acts of arbitrary violence. In these cases, the
   women become more critical, and gradually develop what we term
   `suspicious civic subjectivity', which can sometimes serve as a source
   and catalyzer for developing and promoting gender equity policies.},

Abstract = {Regional international organizations (IOs) are considered to be among
   the most efficient platforms in promoting an environmental agenda at
   global, regional, and national levels. Yet, the dialogue between studies
   of global environmental politics and comparative regionalism is quite
   recent. The emergence of non-democratic regional organizations (NDROs)
   is among the most recent discoveries in comparative regionalism and
   their implications for environmental politics are to be considered. How
   do NDROs matter in promoting an environmental agenda? How do IOs advance
   the environmental agenda across the post-Communist region? This Special
   Issue aspires us to answer these questions through establishing a deeper
   dialogue between studies of environmental regionalism and authoritarian
   regionalism. This introduction lays out the theoretical ground for the
   collection of articles in this Special Issue. It proposes a definition
   and typology of environmental regionalism (ER) that distinguishes
   between democratic and autocratic ER. It then analyzes the contributions
   to the Special Issue within this new theoretical framework.},

Abstract = {Developers have a longstanding history of exercising disproportionate
   influence over federal, state, and local policy decisions, often at the
   expense of communities of color and lower-income neighborhoods. Recent
   research suggests, however, that homeowners and the interest groups that
   represent them may have gained the upper hand politically, making it
   harder to build housing-especially in high-demand cities. This article
   explores how the link between developers and perceived profit-seeking
   may limit the construction of new housing and the formation of effective
   housing reform coalitions. It concludes by evaluating why measuring
   developer power-and disproving negative views of developers-is
   methodologically quite challenging.},

Title = {Political socialization, political gender gaps and the intergenerational
   transmission of left-right ideology},

Abstract = {While left and right are the main terms to distinguish political views
   in Western Europe, the family socialization of citizens has mainly been
   studied in terms of partisan preferences rather than identification with
   these ideological blocks. Therefore, this study investigates the
   intergenerational transmission of left-right ideological positions in
   two European multiparty systems. To investigate expectations regarding
   gendered patterns in political socialization, ideological transmission
   between mothers, fathers, daughters and sons are analyzed, making use of
   German and Swiss household data. The results underline the relevance of
   the family in the transmission of political ideology in multiparty
   systems, showing high contemporary parent-child concordance in
   ideological positioning in line with classic work in political
   socialization. Moreover, the study demonstrates how the
   gender-generation gap in political ideology is consequential for this
   process. Young women consistently place themselves on the left of men
   across all combinations of parental ideology, which indicates that the
   gender-generation gap trumps other gendered patterns in
   intergenerational transmission. Consequently, daughters are less likely
   than sons to take over their parents' rightist positions, while
   parent-son transmission is equally large on the left and the right. This
   also means that left-leaning parents have a general advantage over
   right-leaning parents in having their ideological identification
   reproduced by their daughters. The study highlights the importance of
   differentiating between the transmission of left- and right-wing
   ideology in political socialization processes. Moreover, it demonstrates
   that the distinction by offspring gender is imperative when studying the
   intergenerational transmission of traits that display gender differences
   within and between parental and offspring generations. The findings
   point at the active role of especially female offspring in the political
   socialization process, as they seem to be more strongly impacted by
   influences outside the family that sustain generational processes of
   further gender realignment.},

Abstract = {Based on data on 67,000 articles published in 100 high-impact journals
   in the twenty years between 2000 and 2019, I analyse the scientific
   contribution of European political science scholarly communities in the
   global context. The scholars contributing to the global scientific
   production are largely concentrated in a few countries, with the US and
   UK alone accounting for more than half of the articles published in
   high-impact journals. However, the tendency is towards increasing
   diversity in the geographic basis of the international scientific
   production; and European countries are central to this change.
   Contributing to international collaborative publications has been a key
   engine of the increased scientific production of scholars based in
   Europe. This was a generalised global tendency, and a spectacular one
   for certain national scholarly communities. The network analysis of
   international collaborations points to the consolidation of three
   clusters within a growing and increasingly dense network. The US,
   followed by the UK, are central to a global cluster of collaborations.
   European countries are primarily clustered in two groups: a larger and
   growing cluster; and a smaller but even more integrated, highly
   productive and connected cluster of scholars based in seven northern
   European countries. All bibliometric indicators consistently point to a
   generalised growth in the output and internationalisation of the
   scientific contribution provided by the European political science
   community.},

Abstract = {While many scholars and analysts have observed a decline in civility in
   recent years, there have been few examinations of how political,
   economic, and institutional structures may partially explain inter-state
   differences in these trends. We suggest three potential explanations:
   (1) institutional structures, such as legislative professionalism and
   gubernatorial power, have created different contexts in which
   legislators build and maintain inter-personal relationships; (2)
   partisan competition has led to less bipartisan cooperation and
   contributed to strained relationships between members of different
   parties; and, (3) economic inequity and change has contributed to
   economic anxiety among citizens, contributing to conflict in legislative
   bodies as elected officials attempt to navigate emerging policy
   challenges. To test these explanations, we develop an innovative measure
   of civility using a national survey of lobbyists and a partial
   Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP) design. Findings
   suggest that there is some validity to all three explanations, and
   signifying that civility is at least partially a result of structural
   issues.},

Abstract = {We seek to answer a deceptively simple question: why do private citizens
   in liberal democracies offer hospitality to undocumented migrants?
   Through qualitative interviews with French citizens, we propose three
   reasons. The first is widely recognized in the scholarly literature:
   hospitality is offered out of a care and concern for vulnerable and
   precarious migrants. However, we uncover two additional reasons that are
   not acknowledged in studies on hospitality. One is the desire by
   citizens to uphold the basic principles and ideals of their own society
   (what we call ``care for the world{''}). Another is the desire on the
   part of citizens themselves to become a different and better kind of
   person by practicing hospitality (what we call ``care of the self{''}).
   We provide a multifaceted account of what motivates citizens to offer
   hospitality even in situations where it is outlawed by their own
   governments.},

Abstract = {As most crimes are never reported, official police data underestimates
   the true extent of crimes. Decisions to report also varies between
   groups resulting in a systematic bias in data used to form police
   changes in the criminal justice system. The current research focuses on
   the impact that crime types, victims SES, and trust towards the police
   has on decisions to report. The study uses a combined dataset of
   victimization surveys conducted annually from 2014 to 2021 (n = 19,440).
   Results show that fewer victims of gender-based violence report than
   victims of other types of crimes. Victims' perception of the seriousness
   of the violence has the strongest impact on decision to report. Young
   people and people in rural areas are less likely to report than other
   groups. The article reviews the complex relationship between trust
   towards the police and decisions to report violence. The findings
   indicate that a recent experience of violent victimization reduces trust
   towards the police. Reporting gender-based violence has a tendency to
   reduce trust towards the police but reporting other types of physical
   violence is associated with increased trust. The results also show that
   victims of serious intimate partner violence have become more likely to
   report to the police in recent years than before 2018.},

Abstract = {Has social reproduction through families preserved unequal political
   participation amongst the working class in post-industrial society? This
   article builds on both political and sociological traditions to consider
   the family as a tenacious social structure that reproduces political
   participation from one generation to the next. In order to answer this
   empirically, the study uses a longitudinal panel data of political
   behaviour across three biological generations in the United States
   (1965-1997). The findings show that respondents who grew up in
   working-class families are less likely to vote as adults regardless of
   whether they have working-class occupations or not. The transmission of
   un-equal participation is partially mediated by the voting behaviour of
   the parent who models this behaviour to their children. The study also
   shows that the second generation of respondents transmits low political
   participation to their offspring in the third generation. This study
   implies that occupational structures of a past industrial society are
   still politically relevant and that inequalities in political
   participation remain a legacy amongst the biological descendants of
   working-class families from the 1960s.},

Abstract = {Exploring if/how lobbying patterns differ by political regime, this
   paper uses data from the World Bank's Enterprise Surveys with about
   29,000 firms across 83 country/years to test the hypothesis that this
   political activity should be greater in democracies. Considering a
   variety of democracy indicators and different lobbying measures, it
   finds strong support for this expected positive relationship. It then
   employs these data to consider the trade and currency policy preferences
   of firms within the special interest channel, comparing democracies with
   non-democracies. These results show a greater percentage of exporting
   firms, a lesser percentage of import-competing firms, and a greater
   percentage of non-tradable firms within the democratic special interest
   channel, helping to build a lobbying-based explanation for why
   democracies tend to have more open trade policies and more flexible
   exchange rate regimes.},

Abstract = {Political participation has increasingly taken unconventional forms in
   advanced democracies. At the same time, the traditional party systems of
   Europe have been upended by the recent emergence of successful niche
   parties. While some studies have examined partisanship and protest in
   tandem, the literature lacks a theoretical framework that ties niche
   voters to political protest. This article argues that niche voters are
   more likely to protest than mainstream voters, especially when the
   politics of governing coalitions results in niche parties being unable
   to represent their voters. Specifically, niche voters are more likely to
   protest when their party joins a coalition with a PM who is
   ideologically distant from the niche party's position. Using all nine
   waves of the European Social Survey in Western Europe, the findings
   broadly support this argument. These findings have important
   implications for understanding conditions under which people engage in
   political protest, especially voters of niche parties. Supplemental data

Abstract = {Populist leaders mobilize supporters to accomplish the political
   transformations they seek to achieve. However, once they are in office,
   populist leaders also encounter mobilizations against them because of
   their exclusionary rhetoric as well as their attack on existing
   democratic norms. These populists' practices represent an erosion of (or
   threat to) political rights and move oppositional groups into struggle.
   Therefore, an increase in mobilizations under a populist leader can be
   seen as resistance to populism. Based on panel data analysis across 18
   Latin American countries between 1990-2018, we find that populist
   rhetoric triggers a higher level of pro-democratic protests when it is
   combined with a populist leader's rejection of democratic norms. The
   findings are discussed in line with the political consequences of
   populism in contemporary Latin America.},

Abstract = {This article responds to the recent special issue of Scottish Affairs on
   `Gaidhealtachd Futures' and in particular the article by lain MacKinnon
   proposing that ancestry, ethnicity and indigeneity should become the
   principal elements in contemporary Gaelic identity. The editors of the
   special issue do not give an analytically meaningful presentation of the
   term Gaidhealtachd and MacKinnon fails to give a complete or balanced
   account of previous research on the question of Gaelic identity. There
   is considerable uncertainty about how the term Gael is understood today;
   many Gaelic speakers are reluctant to accept this label for themselves.
   MacKinnon's arguments concerning the role of ancestry in defining Gaelic
   identity are highly problematic in both analytical and political terms.
   His proposals concerning ethnicity and indigeneity are unsustainable,
   particularly in light of relevant legal standards, and amount to a
   strategic, ethical and legal dead end for the Gaelic revitalisation
   movement.},

Abstract = {Although democratic governance imposes temporal constraints, the timing
   of government policy making activities such as bill initiation is still
   poorly understood. This holds especially under coalition governments, in
   which government bills need to find approval by a partner party in
   parliament. We propose a dynamic temporal perspective in which ministers
   do not know whether they face a cooperative or competitive partner at
   the beginning of a term, but they learn this over time and use their
   agenda control to time further bill initiation in response. A circular
   regression analysis using data on more than 25,000 government bills from
   11 parliamentary democracies over 30 years supports this temporal
   perspective, showing that ministers initiate bills later in the term
   when their previous bills have experienced greater scrutiny. Ministers
   further delay bill initiation when coalition parties' incentives to
   deviate from compromise increase and when they have less power to
   constrain their bills' scrutiny.},

Abstract = {This article reconstructs the coming about of the 750 billion EU Covid
   Recovery Fund. We provide an embedded process-tracing analysis of the
   dynamics from mid-March 2020, when the idea of `Corona-bonds' was
   parachuted onto the Heads' Agenda, up until the `historic' deal on the
   Multiannual Financial Framework and Recovery Fund of 21 July. Where most
   media accounts and scholarly assessments focus on the high-level deal
   making between political leaders, we trace the proceedings inside the
   EU's institutional machinery, which produced the solutions and laid out
   the groundwork for a deal. The reconstruction assesses the role and
   influence of the EU institutions - the European Commission in particular
   - in producing this major step. We show that the process was
   characterized by a handicapped European Council, which hampered the
   ability of member states to oversee and control developments. The
   conclusions discuss the implications of our findings for our
   understanding of (institutional) leadership and policy making during
   crisis.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain changes in the patterns of political
   participation in Thailand between 2002 and 2014. Relying on four waves
   of survey data taken from the Asian Barometer (2002, 2006, 2010, and
   2014), it proposes an analytical framework composed of several factors
   that include not only socioeconomic status (SES) but also various
   psychological, attitudinal, and mobilization factors to test and seek
   for factors that affect a likelihood of being a passive or active
   political participant. This article shows that apart from some SES,
   there are various factors, such as political interest and self-efficacy,
   party attachment, and group membership that affected the participatory
   actions of Thai citizens during this period. Moreover, because group
   membership is only one factor having a significant impact on political
   participation for all the four waves of survey data, this article found
   that political participation of Thai citizens is largely a result of
   their learning and experiences obtained from the interaction within
   their respective groups.},

Abstract = {Using the formation of a lesbian and gay electoral constituency as a
   case, this article demonstrates how activists and party elites contest
   and construct collective identities and groups. Activist-party
   interactions produce identity-building feedback that recognizes some
   groups and identities and rejects others, creating conditions for people
   to see themselves as partisans. I call this process ``constitutive group
   mobilization.{''} I find that, when party actors affirmed civil rights
   and libertarian constructions of lesbian and gay people and politics,
   mobilization was relatively bipartisan. Republicans' emerging alliance
   with the Christian Right, however, brought activists to form the
   National Association of Lesbian and Gay Democratic Clubs, crystallizing
   civil rights as the dominant linkage to partisanship. These developments
   reveal how groups and identities form endogenously to parties rather
   than entering the party system as preformed entities with fixed
   interests and partisanship. Thus, the lesbian and gay case provides
   insights about group and identity formation previously overlooked in
   party and LGBT politics scholarship.},

Abstract = {Drawing on an original data set of over 4000 teacher-union endorsements
   in local school board elections, I make three contributions to the
   literature on union power in education politics. First, despite some
   recent evidence that union strength has narrowed at the federal and
   state levels, I show that teachers' unions remain an influential player
   in local school politics today. Second, I provide evidence that
   teachers' unions are active and influential in elections that occur
   outside of traditionally strong union states and prolabor school
   districts. Finally, I show that union-endorsed candidates do not win
   simply because they are stronger candidates ex ante, but in part,
   because union support makes them more formidable candidates on Election
   Day. I conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of these
   findings and suggest some avenues for future research on interest groups
   in local school politics.},

Abstract = {How do individual-level political attitudes influence affective
   polarization on a global scale? This article contributes to the debate
   on the social distance of party affect by testing a set of hypotheses in
   165 elections across the world. With a sample of over 170,000 voters,
   the results of multilevel mixed-effects regressions demonstrate that
   ideological radicalism, political knowledge, and external efficacy
   substantively affect how voters see the main political parties in
   electoral disputes taking place in 52 countries from 1996 to 2019.
   Satisfaction with democracy, however, is context-dependent; it
   positively influences affective polarization only when generalized
   democratic satisfaction is low. Furthermore, I show that these
   correlations remain stable regardless of the operationalization of
   affective polarization-that is, based on two dominant parties and
   weighted for multiparty competition. These findings provide robust
   inputs to the study of party preferences and social distance in a
   cross-national longitudinal perspective.},

Abstract = {To what extent did the democratic environment in Myanmar allow ethnic
   minority groups to promote their language and culture? After the opening
   of the political regime in 2011, Myanmar's ethnic minority groups placed
   high hopes in securing new rights and powers to manage their own states
   and preserve their culture. While the state implemented new
   opportunities for education of ethnic languages and culture, I argue
   that these small improvements are dwarfed by the continued Burmanization
   of ethnic minorities, and the strength of the Bamar-dominated state.
   Despite the reform of the educational curriculum, the gains made are
   relatively modest. More effective decentralization and inclusion of
   these issues when discussing more genuine federalism would help to
   improve ethnic groups' ability to maintain their language and culture.
   This article draws on data from a survey conducted in 2019, as well as
   interviews in Chin, Kachin, and Karen states between 2015 and 2019.},

Abstract = {The basis of a methodology determines whether a research method can fit
   the core characteristics of a particular academic tradition, and thus,
   it is crucial to explore this foundation. Keeping in mind the
   controversy and progress of the philosophy of social sciences, this
   paper aims to elaborate on four aspects including the cognitive model,
   the view of causality, research methods, and analysis techniques, and to
   establish a more solid methodological basis for historical political
   science. With respect to the ``upstream knowledge{''} of methodology,
   both positivism and critical realism underestimate the tremendous
   difference between the natural world and the social world. This leads to
   inherent flaws in controlled comparison and causal mechanism analysis.
   Given the constructiveness of social categories and the complexity of
   historical circumstances, the cognitive model of constructivism makes it
   more suitable for researchers to engage in macro-political and social
   analysis. From the perspective of constructivism, the causality in
   ``storytelling,{''} i.e., the traditional narrative analysis, is placed
   as the basis of the regularity theory of causality in this paper, thus
   forming the historical-causal narrative. The historical-causal narrative
   focuses on how a research object is shaped and self-shaped in the
   ontological historical process, and thus ideally suits the disciplinary
   characteristics of historical political science. Researchers can
   complete theoretical dialogues, test hypotheses, and further explore the
   law of causality in logic and evidence, thereby achieving the purpose of
   ``learning from history{''} in historical political science.},

Abstract = {This article explores whether the current populist zeitgeist has changed
   the social representation of the political labels `left' and `right' in
   terms of their relevance, understanding and meaning. We merged two
   post-electoral quota samples of the Italian adult population. The first
   (N = 1,377) was collected in 2006 by the ITANES research group, the
   second in 2019 (N = 1,504) for this study. We analysed the relevance of
   left and right in politics as the frequency with which participants
   placed themselves on the left-right axis; its understanding as the
   frequency with which participants answered at least one of two
   open-ended questions about the meaning of such categories, and the
   meaning participants gave to left and right in politics through content
   analysis of their responses to the open-ended questions above. From 2006
   to 2019, the relevance and understanding of left and right declined. In
   terms of meanings, references to the traditional elements of left and
   right became less common, while references to specific leaders, and the
   notion of `left' and `right' in politics no longer making sense, became
   more widespread; moreover, none of the other populist categories
   significantly changed their frequency. This study expands the scope of
   the previous research on this topic also by identifying the critical
   role that political interest plays in the changes on which we have
   focused. Strengths, limitations and implications of the study are
   discussed.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},

Pages = {37-46},
Abstract = {The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has emerged as an
   exogenous shock to global food supply chains, which foreshadows worrying
   impacts on Africa's food security and nutrition, and threaten to derail
   national and global efforts to end hunger and poverty and to achieve
   sustainable development goals on the continent. This article provides an
   early assessment of the implications of the invasion for Africa's food
   supply chains and food security. Two particularly aggravating factors,
   which explain the current and likely future impact of the invasion on
   Africa's food security are discussed: the timing of the invasion and the
   two parties involved in the conflict. The article underlines four major
   channels by which the invasion disrupts African food supply chains:
   energy markets and shipping routes, availability and prices of
   agricultural production inputs, domestic food price inflation, and trade
   sanctions and other financial measures. In addition, the article
   considers the risk of social and political unrest that disruption to
   food supply chains and spikes in domestic food prices may inflame.
   Finally, the paper briefly discusses options for short- and long-term
   responses by African governments and their development partners to
   mitigate the repercussions of the conflict on food supply chains, boost
   food and nutrition security, and build resilience of Africa's food
   systems.},

Title = {SUSTAINABLE-RESPONSIBLE TOURISM VALUES AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT: ISSUES AND
   CRITICAL REFLECTION},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSFORMATION STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {97-111},
Abstract = {In recent years, the world has undergone major changes in terms of
   economic, technologic, and touristic development. With the constant
   emergence of crisis situations, it is evident now more than ever that
   these changes need to be addressed and tackled with in a way that would
   ensure long-term stability and prosperity. As a result, the concept of
   sustainable-responsible tourism has emerged, which, among other things,
   addresses many important and complex issues, such as mass tourism,
   natural and social heritage preservation, environmental change, global
   warming, pollution, etc. SRT values also refer to a responsible and
   sustainable approach to crisis management, which is the topic of this
   paper. In order to keep up with the constant changes and establish a
   healthy tourism development that would be in line with ethical and
   responsible behaviour, an experienced and qualified destination
   management is of great importance. Sustainable-responsible tourism
   should therefore not only be considered a new trend in the tourism
   industry, but also a new norm.
   The methodology used in this paper consists of an analysis of secondary
   data sources such as academic articles, documents, and reports relevant
   to the topic of the paper, all written in the period between 2004 and
   2021. The purpose of using this methodology is not only to highlight the
   transfer and dissemination of knowledge about tourism with the goal of
   adding to the already existing knowledge. By focusing on both academic
   articles and practical reports of work experiences, as well as official
   documents, this paper also aims to promote critical thinking about the
   already existing knowledge. The ultimate goal of the paper is to promote
   the creation of knowledge in designing sustainable tourism development
   strategies, agendas, and monitoring the implementation process of
   sustainable development in tourism.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Silicon Valley has become one of the world's leading

   rare. Based on in-depth interviews, observations and data analysis, this
   article sheds light on this paradox and report three main findings.
   First, ``techies{''} express an egalitarian ethos within a universe of
   wealth. Second, Tech companies and investment firms value and promote
   certain category of professionals. Finally, social gaps and unformal
   hierarchies described by the respondents put into perspective social
   boundaries within a society whose members represent themselves as part

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {In this article we will theoretically address the relationship between
   power and violence against women from a gender and Foucaultian
   perspective. Starting from the feminist conceptualization of structural
   inequality, we delve into the intersubjective dimension of gender
   asymmetry. The social devaluation of femininity and women is expressed
   in the pragmatic register of interaction as a tendency to
   non-reciprocity in recognition. Specifically, we will read this
   recognition deficit as a status inequality sustained in complex and
   variable objectification processes. In this way, violence is and derives
   from this reproduction or reinforcement of asymmetry.
   Furthermore, considering the constitutive sociality of the subjects, we
   will think about the effect of interactions, regulated by gender norms
   and by inequality of status, in the sedimentation of dispositions to
   action, emotions and in the psychic tension between self-affirmation and
   recognition. The conjunction of these factors in male and female
   subjectivation provides explanatory elements of violence. Finally, we
   reflect on love as a specific register of action, a register that the
   status system can naturalize and that is affected by the experience of
   gender, given the symbolic centrality of love in the construction of
   femininity. A register that can move towards that of violence when
   inequality is questioned and equivalence is demanded.},

Abstract = {The literature on institutional sustainability has largely focused on
   global-based analysis, and it has generally ignored to examine
   local-based analyses. The main purpose of this study was to measure the
   institutional sustainability of local governments. In this research, the
   intention was to develop an institutional sustainability index based on
   the district municipalities in the province of Istanbul, which is one of
   the most significant metropolises in the world. A total of 48 variables
   were used in the calculation of the General Institutional Sustainability
   Index (social dimension with 26 variables, economic dimension with 15
   variables, and environmental dimension with 7 variables). The index
   consists of 3 sub-indexes comprising the general institutional
   sustainability index. The social dimension was examined in 6
   sub-dimensions, the economic dimension in 5 sub-dimensions, and the
   environmental dimension in 4 sub-dimensions. The results indicate that
   Istanbul municipalities achieved low economic and environmental
   sustainability index scores. Decision-makers will be able to assess the
   general institutional sustainability index results for their own
   municipalities and to observe strong and weak aspects with the
   sub-indexes. In the process of developing the index, missing value
   analysis, cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and the
   composite index calculation methods were applied to data from 39
   district municipalities in the province of Istanbul.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2022},
Number = {29},
Abstract = {The first half of the fifteenth century saw the emergence of a new
   historiography in Italy: written in a Latin language revived through the
   study of classical authors, it is described as ``humanist{''}. The
   article considers two major figures of this historiographical revival,
   Leonardo Bruni and Biondo Flavio, and focuses on the way in which the
   former's Historiarum populi Florentini libri and the latter's
   Historiarum ab inclinatione Romani imperii decades interweave ancient
   history and contemporary history. In both texts, the catastrophic
   collapse of the Roman Empire appears as a fundamental and indispensable
   component of the historical narrative. By examining the narrative and
   ideological aspects of this theme, the article conducts a comparative
   analysis of the two works and highlights the primarily moral function of
   the disaster, reflective of the continuing prophetic vocation of
   history.},

Abstract = {Vladimir Putin is a model representative of the Chekist world view. This
   view is characterised by friend-foe thinking, paranoia, and xenophobia,
   as well as a fixation on the authoritarian power-state as a prerequisite
   for Russia's status as an imperial great power. By this logic, the
   employment of ``active measures{''} and the use of violence, including
   murder, to assert one's own interests are legitimate. Analysis of early
   sources shows that there never was a ``liberal Putin{''}.},

Abstract = {The rise of non-Western powers has led to competing claims about how
   these states act among each other and how they behave vis-a-vis
   established powers. Existing accounts argue that the rising powers are a
   heterogenous group of competing states and that they are socialized into
   the existing Western-centered order. This article challenges these
   claims, arguing that the rising powers are dissatisfied with the
   international status quo and that they have begun to form a bloc against
   the established powers. The authors contend that this dissatisfaction
   arises from their lack of influence on the international stage, their
   status in the international hierarchy and the norms that sustain the
   current international order. They maintain that the formation of a
   rising powers bloc is driven by the countries' economic growth and
   international dynamics, fostering their institutionalization as IBSA
   (India, Brazil, South Africa) and BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China,
   South Africa). To support this argument, the study combines spatial
   modeling techniques to analyze rising power voting behavior in the UN
   General Assembly over the period 1992-2011.},

Abstract = {International security cooperation is regarded as one of the key and
   successful mechanisms to fight terrorism and other cross-border criminal
   activities worldwide. This paper focuses on the benefits and challenges
   of the US and African countries' defence cooperation, using Ghana as a
   case study. This study used 21 people as participants. The subjects were
   selected based on their unique knowledge and expertise in the phenomenon
   under study. The researchers used interviews to solicit the views of the
   participants on the Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) between Ghana
   and the US focusing on the benefits and challenges. In conclusion, the
   study disclosed that no country has a monopoly on what it takes to fight
   terrorism and other transnational organised crime alone. The major
   challenges identified include the breach of domestic law, limited mutual
   trust, and discriminately ethnic and misguided religious practices. The
   challenges were stated as indispensable for the sustainability of the
   DCA and the successful mitigation of terrorism and transnational
   organised crime in West Africa.},

Abstract = {This article is devoted to religion as one component of state identity;
   where the latter is here defined as a form of identity shaped by ruling
   elites, i.a. on the basis of national identity, with a view to the
   interests and conduct of the state being legitimised - both domestically
   and in foreign policy. In our case study relating to Poland, we have
   assumed that religion and the values founded upon it are key variables,
   and among the most important components to present-day state identity.
   At the same time, we note that this specific identity for Poland also
   materialises in axiologically-based conflict, given that a foundation
   upon the factor of religion represents one of the most deeply-rooted
   levels of self-determination - in the CEECs in particular. In this part
   of the world, religion has always played an exceptional role in building
   state identities, not least given the fundamental impact on any
   understanding of what freedom denotes. In the pursuit of such ideas, the
   authors have organised the present article into: (1) a theoretical part
   that introduces the relevant theory (stressing i.a. religion's role as a
   tool accounting for political and international reality; (2) research on
   religion's role in shaping domestic policy and state identity; and (3)
   an attempt to answer questions as to how a religion-based state identity
   is made tangible in foreign policy (in line with an assumption that the
   latter is in essence an extension of internal policy, whereby state
   identity influences the conduct of the state externally); and in that
   way also in international relations.},

Abstract = {This article describes the phenomenon of editorial kitsch trends around
   the Holocaust literature and its impact on the Holocaust memory.
   ``Holo-polo{''} is a way of dealing with the ``discomfort{''} of the
   horrors of war and violence, by creating a more comfortable version of
   it. The article problematizes the ways of representation of a frequently
   debated and controversial issue, the Holocaust. By analyzing individual
   publications, the article addresses the issues of memory, forgetting,
   objectivity and truth of historical representation, and, inevitably, the
   ethical issue of historical fiction. The article argues that
   embellishing the history of the Holocaust is not only inappropriate, but
   also indecent. Instead of describing the horrors of the Holocaust,
   Holo-polo trivializes and misrepresents its significance, depicting
   melancholy, sentiment, and nostalgia in the light of a pop-cultural
   emotional trap. Or maybe is it just being moved by our own emotions.
   Kitschy cliches are misused and certainly do not serve memory,
   literature, or respect for Holocaust victims and survivors.},

Title = {Slovenia as a Stress Test of the EU's External Dimension of Energy
   Policy Case Studies of Russian and American Influence},
Journal = {POLITOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The article focuses on Slovenia's unique historical and geopolitical
   position, which makes the country a highly unusual EU (Central East
   European - CEE) member state and determines its stance on the EU's
   energy policy with respect to the USA and Russia. It pursues the
   research question: how does Slovenia balance between the EU energy
   policy framework and its particular national energy interests related to
   Russia and the USA? Conceptually, the article builds on the
   Europeanization of foreign policy applying the downloading path to
   Slovenian external energy policy via three indicators: the increasing
   salience of the European political agenda, adherence to common (EU)
   objectives, and internalization of EU membership and its integration
   process. It employs a method of statistical data and content analysis of
   documents and secondary sources within two case studies of energy
   projects, namely the South Stream involving Russia, and long-term use of
   nuclear energy for electricity production involving the USA. The results
   substantiate that Slovenia has managed to balance between its
   energy-related national interests and the EU energy framework by
   formulating and legitimizing the former within the EU policy framework.
   However, the second case reveals that the open EU legal framework on the
   member states' choice of nuclear energy cooperatives is a notable
   limitation to Europeanization due to the tendency for interests in
   national foreign policy and domestic politics - both performed by the
   government - to drift away from general EU values. In the conclusion,
   the article identifies two important implications arising from the case
   of Slovenia as a stress test of the EU's external dimension of energy
   policy.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to understand how the ditches dug by the
   Chilean governments, on the international border between Colchane
   (Chile) and Pisiga Bolivar (Bolivia), from September 2017 to July 2022,
   were articulated to the discourse on migrations. and they transformed
   the landscape, control modes and crossing strategies in the region. For
   this, we apply a qualitative methodology of documentary and newspaper
   review in both countries, as well as field work (field notes,
   observation, testimonies and photographs). Our text concludes that the
   trenches analyzed can be interpreted as inverted walls, of low cost and
   great plasticity, which make up a mobile border landscape and constitute
   defensive and protection devices against non-state transnational agents,
   understood as threats. Likewise, its paradoxical condition is
   highlighted: while the ditches are projected with the purpose of
   reaffirming power and expressing state control over a territory, they
   highlight its weakness given its mere existence and operational
   inefficiency.},

Abstract = {The abundance of information has brought new challenges to our global
   digital societies, in such a way that it has become mandatory to speak
   of a ``post-truth world{''} when we analyse the effects of technology
   and social media on our daily lives. The indelible mark of this issue
   has been cemented more and more noticeably in our public space: in 2016
   the word of the year was post-truth (Hendricks and Vestergaard, 2019),
   and, in 2017, it was fake news (Dalkir and Katz, 2020). In this article,
   we attempt to systematize the main lines of reflection on the issue of
   disinformation and clarify the concepts associated with it, thus trying
   to highlight the different axes that constitute the complexity of the
   phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Between 1985 and 2001, the Argentine defense policy built an agreement
   that was sustained over time, under governments of different party and
   ideological signs. During this legislative phase, Law No. 23,554 on
   National Defense (1988), Law No. 24,059 on Homeland Security (1992) and
   Law No. 25,520 on National Intelligence (2001 and amended in 2014) were
   approved. These norms constituted the so-called ``Basic Consensus{''},
   which established an organic and functional separation between internal
   security and national defense. This article analyzes how the debate has
   evolved and the measures adopted by the Argentine government regarding
   the separation between defense and internal security, specifically with
   regard to the involvement of the Armed Forces of Argentina in the fight
   against air traffic of drugs between 2011 and 2019. To do this, the
   securitiza-tion process around the issue is analyzed during the years
   2011 to 2019 and how this was translat-ed at the operational strategic
   level. It is concluded that that it was here that the differences
   between the governments of Cristina Fernandez de Kirch-ner and Mauricio
   Macri arose.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, a serious number of studies have been dedicated to
   defining and conceptualizing populism in order to enable proper and
   comparative analyses of the phenomenon. They usually studied populism by
   reducing it to an ideology, discourse, or strategy and provided
   analytical approaches accordingly although some other approaches (style
   of communication, political project, etc.) are possible to come across
   in the relevant literature. Critically engaging with the most
   influential ones, this article ascertains two principal deficiencies in
   these bodies of work. Firstly, the minimal and generic definitions
   presented in these studies empty the concept to a broad extent.
   Secondly, most scholars assume the concentrated dimension of populism as
   the whole of the phenomenon and undertake its conceptualization with
   this assumption to a large extent. As a result of a comprehensive
   discussion on these main and also some secondary deficiencies, this
   article offers two ways to treat them. Scholars who examine populism and
   make comparisons between different cases can either carry out their
   analyses by taking the multi-layered nature of the phenomenon into
   account or by clearly stating the dimension of populism which they study
   and, in this way, limit their work to this dimension without further
   claims. In addition to all these, showing the inadequacy of the
   Sartorian approaches that dominate the literature, the article discusses
   that Wittgensteinian approaches can provide appropriate alternative
   frameworks for the conceptualization of populism.},

Abstract = {In spite of recent advances in the literature, there are still fewer
   empirical works, embracing different regions of the world, that analyze
   the impact of populist governments on the quality of governance. This
   paper, which covers 33 countries from five world regions from 1996 until
   2019, intends to fill this gap. By using different statistical methods,
   our data show that periods under populist governments in power had a
   significantly negative effect on governance quality measured by the WGI
   data set. For each of the six dimensions of governance, however, (voice
   and accountability, political stability and the absence of violence,
   government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control
   of corruption) we detect exceptions. In addition, exploring the data by
   geographical region and types of populism (exclusive, neoliberal and
   inclusive), crucially refines our findings, showing a great deal of
   differences and revealing that similar types of populism operate in
   different ways in separate geographical contexts. These variations are
   explained both by the difficulty of defining slippery concepts, and
   applying them consistently to historical cases, and by particular traits
   and historical occurrences that significantly affect the relationship we
   analyze. Through different fixed regression models, finally, we control
   for a series of potentially confounding factors and find that our have
   been confirmed.},

Abstract = {In opinion polls, a large majority of people in Russia have expressed
   approval of the war that their country has been waging against Ukraine
   since February 2022. This reflects a totalitarian consensus that has
   been produced by propaganda over more than two decades. The total
   control of information as well as massively intensified repression lead
   people to adopt the ideological formulas and phrases that state
   television feed them. Those who have access to other sources of
   information, especially younger people in big cities, are much better
   able to form their own opinion and to recognize the suffering that
   Russia's leadership and the army it commands are inflicting on their
   neighbour without cause.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research was to reveal the process of becoming a
   person in the information society. The problem of personal formation in
   the modern conditions of growth of the role of information communication
   technologies becomes topical problems in the field of social studies.
   The volume of information, information resources and corresponding
   technologies significantly influence different sides of social life and
   processes of humans. The following methods were used in the study:
   analysis, synthesis, modeling, mathematical statistics and others. The
   tasks of the study included analyzing the approaches, ideas about the
   features of personality formation in the information society. It has
   been shown that the solution of this problem is associated with the
   formation of human information culture. The paper presents the process
   of perception of the essence of this category, as well as describes a
   number of concepts, the essence of which allows to specify the content
   of the concept of << information culture >>. These are the following
   categories: information, culture, information needs. Special attention
   was paid to the development of information needs in educational

Title = {China's Carbon Market: Potential for Success?},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {265-274},
Abstract = {What lessons emerged during the development of China's national
   emissions trading scheme (ETS)? It was launched in late 2017 and started
   operation in July 2021, beginning with online trading of emissions
   permits. The preceding decade was used for preparing and testing,
   including seven pilot markets. It was decided to start with the power
   sector, the largest-emitting sector, and initially cover coal-and
   gas-fired power plants. This article offers theory-oriented and
   empirical contributions to domestic-level learning, and asks what
   happens after a policy has ``landed.{''} We employ an analytical concept
   originating from diffusion theory-learning-and view internal learning as
   a key mechanism. We argue that having a slow and well-prepared start
   contributes to the potential success of the ETS; further, that the
   lengthy preparatory period enabled China to address various obstacles,
   providing a strong basis for success, singly and as part of the national
   mitigation policy complex. Internal learning has proven crucial to the
   development of the ETS in China, with the learning process continuing as
   the national ETS becomes operative. We also discuss the possibilities
   for linking China's carbon market with other markets, which should heed
   China's ETS experience and emphasize learning.},

Pages = {1-30},
Abstract = {We present a theory of war onset and war duration in which power is
   multidimensional and can evolve through conflict. The resources players
   can secure without fighting are determined by their political power,
   while the ability of appropriating resources with violence is due to
   their military power. When deciding whether to wage a war, players
   evaluate the consequences on the current allocation of resources as well
   as on the future distribution of military and political powers. We
   deliver three main results: a key driver of war is the mismatch between
   military and political power; dynamic incentives may amplify static
   incentives, leading forward-looking players to be more belligerent; and
   a war is more likely to last for longer if political power is initially
   more unbalanced than military power and the politically
   under-represented player is militarily advantaged. Our results are
   robust to allowing the peaceful allocation of resources to be a function
   of both political and military powers. Finally, we provide empirical
   correlations on interstate wars that are consistent with the theory.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {62-86},
Abstract = {Leading security experts warn the Western community about the correct
   understanding of Russia's vision of future conflicts. Based on the study
   of the available literature, we analyzed individual approaches and
   pointed out the importance of understanding Russia's individual steps to
   fulfill their interests. The aim of the research was to compare the
   approach of the Western Community and Russia to new ways of conducting
   future conflicts with an emphasis on the hybrid way of conducting war.
   In our research, we primarily focused on the Western vision of hybrid
   warfare and the Russian vision of the future war, which is diametrically
   different. The basic findings are that Russia is shaping military and
   non-military instruments of state power to combat hybrid threats. The
   Russian military defines ``hybrid warfare{''} as an effort at the
   strategic level to shape, manage and geostrategically orient a target
   state, in which all means adopted, including the use of conventional
   military forces in regional conflicts, are the subject of an information
   campaign. Russia considers the Venezuelan presidential crisis, the
   Libyan conflict, the Syrian civil war, and the crisis in Belarus and
   Ukraine as examples of hybrid war. In conclusion, we assess that the
   Russian army is actively focusing on preparing for future conflicts and
   increasing the capabilities it considers necessary for victory in the
   hybrid war. In addition, we have compiled a list of measures to reassess
   the strategy and approach of the Western Community and Slovakia to
   Russia},

Abstract = {The under-representation of women in American politics can likely be
   explained, at least in part, by women's comparatively lower levels of
   political ambition. We analyze a co-ed, religious program for high
   school students in which participants lobby their Members of Congress
   and receive political skills training. By leveraging longitudinal survey
   data about the participants and a difference-in-differences design, we
   find that the program successfully increased the political ambition of
   its female participants. To the best of our knowledge, we offer the
   first quasi-experimental evidence demonstrating a possible means of
   increasing the political ambition of high school-aged American women.
   Our results demonstrate that female political ambition can be increased
   without relying on programs that explicitly focus on gender and
   ambition.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research is information terrorism as a threat to the
   global security system of the 21st century. The problem of combating
   information terrorism requires the analysis of the structure of
   terrorism itself as a phenomenon that has come a long way of evolution
   from lone suicide bombers, to huge terrorist organizations that commit
   destructive acts and cause the death of a large number of people, also
   using the dissemination of information to intimidate a significant
   number of people. The methodological basis of the research is presented
   as comparative-legal and systematic analysis, formal-legal method,
   method of interpretation, hermeneutic method, as well as methods of
   analysis and synthesis. It is concluded that, one of the main threats to
   information security is presented by computer terrorism as a form of
   destructive influence aimed at manipulating or intimidating the
   population or causing harm to the society, the state or individuals with
   the use of information technologies and with the purpose of forcing the
   authorities, an international organization, a natural or legal person
   (group of persons) to commit a certain action (or refrain from
   committing it).},

Pages = {27-43},
Abstract = {The three decades after the fall of communism in 1989 proved to be a
   good time for Poland's national security. A sovereign Poland effectively
   reconstructed its foreign and security policy from the ground up,
   following 40 years of Soviet domination. She reorganized her
   treaty-based relations with neighboring states, consolidated its own
   borders and rejected old military and economic alliances. The Polish
   political transformation, although costly in social terms, has made it a
   democratic and economically successful state, anchored in NATO and the
   EU, regionally cooperative and selectively engaged in the global agenda
   -occasionally ``punching above its weight{''}. This article deals with
   the key aspects of Poland's post-1989 security policy. It begins with an
   analysis of the key historical factors contributing to continuity and
   change in this policy, stemming from national responses to the changing
   external environment and evolving state sovereignty. A detailed analysis
   of Poland's security policy after 1989, covers the following issues:
   Poland's path to NATO and subsequent national priorities as a member of
   the Alliance, the role of the USA in Polish security policy, the
   approach to collective security, and last but not least, the role of
   European Union. It ends with a reflection on the contemporary challenges
   confronting the national security policy.},

Abstract = {Civic education has become one of the most pressing political and social
   concerns of our time. A myriad of debates have emerged concerning
   whether and how citizenship can be educated, but also about the elements
   that should constitute the foundations of civic education in educational
   systems. These positions and controversies, however, are not novel
   overall; in fact, a clear continuity can be traced throughout the
   western tradition of political and educational thought. This paper aims
   to show the genealogy of the main debates on civic education providing
   the context required to improve the coherence of current and future
   analyses in the area.},

   offers an analysis of the current trajectory of the centre left, by
   detailing a systematic mapping of policy change across the family of
   social democratic political parties. Many of the parties, especially in
   the 1990s, took a `third way' turn, or a shift to what has been called
   the `new social democracy'. Yet, the `third way' label is a poor
   descriptor to capture the changing policy profile and dynamics of the
   family of mainstream centre-left political parties. In Adam Przeworski's
   view, there have been four main waves of social democracy. We employ the
   `wave' frame to examine if there is an emergent, fifth, breaking wave of
   social democracy. Overall, we find that social democratic parties have
   moved beyond the `third way'; they are shifting leftwards, but they are
   a new kind of `left' from that of previous decades.},

Abstract = {The paper analyses transformations in higher education, and specifically
   in Italian universities, during and after the Covid-19 crisis. The main
   focus is on visual and digital media and on their role in reshaping the
   relationship between teachers and students: on the one hand, teachers
   have to act as technological performers, following a method in which
   teaching becomes a show and an event; on the other, students watch on
   the other side of the screen in a voyeuristic, consumerist way. As a
   result, education as a lived experience gives way to a mechanical
   transfer of standardised content, designed as products and commodities
   in a video platform market.},

Title = {The eternal cold of Tarquinia Molza. Nature and history of catastrophes
   in the works by Francesco Patrizi of Cherso},
Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2022},
Number = {29},
Abstract = {The process that leads to the degeneration of a body, a political system
   or any other form of cultural organisation may seem inevitable. Yet,
   according to Francesco Patrizi da Cherso (1529-1597), there are ways to
   minimise its consequences. In this contribution, starting with the
   strange case of the eternal cold of Tarquinia Molza, we will trace the
   history of the concept of catastrophe in Patrizi's philosophy, focusing
   in particular on the different forms of ``corruption{''} that punctuate
   the life of a single body as much as that of the entire universe. Based
   on the reading of three texts composed over a period of more than forty
   years -the Citta felice (1553), the Dialoghi della historia (1560) and
   the Paralleli militari (1594-1595)- we will discover how the conceptual
   dimension of catastrophe, from Patrizi's point of view, oscillates
   between nature, history and myth, and how, in a complicated interweaving
   of medicine, history and philosophy, Patrizi seeks the conditions for
   mankind to foresee (and thus, to some extent, control) the unalterable
   course of nature and adapt to it.},

Journal = {REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE PENSAMIENTO POLITICO},
Year = {2022},
Number = {17},
Pages = {589-606},
Abstract = {The clarification of regional competences is a legal operation that
   clearly exceeds the listing of principles or norms which dictate their
   repartition. It is of great importance to optimize their exercise since
   that decentralized management is consistently contingent upon a legal
   system that promotes the emergence of the local decision. The terms and
   means involved in this decision-making divulge the extent of freedom
   that the local authorities possess. If we consider that the regional
   preeminence established in the Moroccan constitution represents a form
   of clarification with regard to the scale of competences conferred to
   the region, the legal framework that accounts for the constitutional
   provisions must cede control to the local collectivity over its own
   affairs. This priority is only valuable if the theory governing the
   exercise of competences assigned to the local authority is in conformity
   with the rule of law.},

   Until February 2022, the UOC had always maintained its autonomous status

   intra-Ukrainian church dispute with the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. But
   the bombs of Russia's army and the imperial stance of the Moscow
   patriarch, who supports this war of aggression, have led to a tectonic
   shift. The fate of the common church is sealed. What remains open is how
   relations develop between the Ukraine's Orthodox churches.},

Title = {CUBA AND THE NEW ``PINK TIDE{''}},
Journal = {REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE PENSAMIENTO POLITICO},
Year = {2022},
Number = {17},
Pages = {607-624},
Abstract = {In the last five years Latin America has shown a gradual shift to the
   left, which has led some analysts such as Jorge Castaneda (2021) and
   Andres Oppenheimer (2022) to talk about a new ``pink tide{''} in the
   region. The government of Miguel Diaz-Canel expects that the new
   regional political context will allow them to retrieve the same levels
   of autonomy that Cuba enjoyed during the so-called ``post-liberal
   regionalism{''} (2003-2015). In this sense, this article aims to: 1)
   identify the new opportunities for international insertion that are
   opening up for Cuba in this new phase and 2) analyze to what extent the
   new ``pink tide{''} can contribute to Cuba regaining the levels of
   autonomy it enjoyed during ``post-liberal regionalism{''} and thus
   strengthen its battered national viability.},

   Content analysis has applied to the scanned literature. It is clarified
   from the literature that different anti-social factors exist in

   anti-social factors that influence tourist decision making (TDM)
   negatively. Generally, way old terrorism incidents of Kashmir are
   exaggerated by many media houses, and fake news is designed for viewers,
   mainly for their TRP and other interests. According to results,
   antisocial factors such as terrorism and biased media have changed the
   tourists' decision making and their perception drastically regarding the

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which
   professional ethics, which is a criterion of professionalism, is
   realized for public sector lawyers and corporate lawyers (including
   lawyers working in law offices) and for self-employed lawyers, and to
   compare and evaluate the findings. This study examined how the problem
   of professional ethics in the practice of law is handled according to
   the professional status of lawyers (self-employed, public and
   corporate), and it aims to contribute to the literature by focusing on
   both the perceptions and expectations of the two groups regarding
   professional ethics. The findings obtained from the research were
   evaluated by considering the Attorneys' Act, the Code of Professional
   Conduct, and professional practices. It was observed that there is a
   significant difference between perceptions and expectations of all
   lawyers participating in the research, without a distinction between
   public sector and corporate or self-employed, regarding compliance with
   professional ethics. When the professional ethics perceptions of
   self-employed lawyers and of public sector and corporate lawyers are
   compared, no significant difference is found. However, in terms of
   professional ethical expectations, it is observed that there are
   significant differences between the two groups regarding some ethical
   dimensions.},

   discussing both the massive size of the economic collapse and the

   collapse and the political protests that followed, which were
   unprecedented in the history of modern democracy in Iceland, as well as
   the resignation of the government, with an early election six months
   after the collapse. The left-wing government that took over had to steer
   the country through recovery, and the consequences of the financial
   collapse left a mark on the government's term in office. The post-crisis
   period has been marked by huge electoral volatility, the rise of new
   challenger parties and three early elections. Thus, even if the economy
   settled down, politics did not.},

Abstract = {Satisfaction with how democracy works and political trust has generally
   been quite high in Iceland and on par with the other Nordic countries.
   Immediately after the economic collapse in 2008, those changed
   dramatically but seem to have recovered to a pre-crisis level. In this
   chapter, we first review what the literature says about what maintains
   high levels of trust and satisfaction with how democracy works and
   whether those relate to political support and legitimacy, and second,
   what factors contribute to sharp changes. Our findings indicate the
   sharp decrease in political trust and satisfaction with democracy did
   not have a lasting impact. Satisfaction, trust for politicians and for
   parliament have largely recovered to a pre-crisis level. We found some
   difference among subgroups, for example, the crisis might have increased
   tensions between voters of government and opposition parties concerning
   satisfaction with democracy and distrust for politicians, which is more
   likely to have had a lasting impact on the dissatisfaction with
   democracy among older people and those with lower household income.},

Title = {Illiberal and Populist Political Narratives on Gender and Underreporting
   of Sexual Violence: A Case Study of Hungary},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {26-37},
Abstract = {Sexual violence is underreported all over the world. In this article, I
   argue that democratic backsliding undermines the reporting of sexual
   violence even further. The author's team conducted in-depth interviews
   (n = 15) with representatives of civil society organizations, victims'
   services, clinical practitioners, and child and family welfare in
   Hungary in 2017 and 2018, in search of organizational and structural
   causes to why sexual violence remains vastly underreported in the
   country with the least reported case numbers in Europe. The small but
   diverse sample helped identify associations between the reporting of
   sexual violence and repressive, gender-related political decisions such
   as threatening the existence of civil organizations undertaking victim
   support roles and providing victim services, a family-centered political
   narrative, and confining women's roles solely for reproductive purposes.
   It is not possible to maintain causation since there are other factors
   interfering the association. Thus, instead of discussing it as a single
   cause of underreporting sexual violence, I present the Hungarian case to
   illustrate the consequences of illiberal politics on reporting.
   Furthermore, utilizing Slovic's risk-benefit model, I argue that recent
   products of illiberal politics such as politicizing ``gender{''}
   undermine trust, a precondition of asking for help and providing support
   for victims of sexual violence.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {177-191},
Abstract = {Since late 2020, protests against government measures to contain the
   Covid-19 pandemic have swept across Germany. At the forefront of these
   protests was the Querdenker Movement, a heterogeneous alliance of
   ordinary citizens, hippies, esotericists, opponents of conventional
   medicine, Christian fundamentalists, and right-wing extremists bonded by
   their shared belief in conspiracy myths. This contribution draws upon
   the theoretical framework of the studies on the author-itarian
   personality to dissect the nature of this heterogeneous alliance and the
   democracy-endangering potential of con-spiracy myths. We present three
   key insights based on an analysis of representative public opinion
   surveys conducted by the Leipzig Authoritarianism Study. First, we
   demonstrate that susceptibility to conspiracy myths in the public mood
   occurs in waves that coincide with times of crisis. In this regard, the
   Covid-19 pandemic is a catalyst of conspiracy myths as it has induced
   existential and epistemic insecurities amongst many citizens. Second, it
   is shown that there is an elec-tive affinity between superstition,
   esotericism, and a conspiracy mentality, which can be cited as one
   explanation for the heterogeneous alliance during the protests. On the
   other hand, the nexus between religion and the conspiracy mentality
   depends on an individual's interpretation of religion. It is literalist
   fundamentalism that fosters susceptibility to conspiracy myths. Third,
   we highlight the democracy-endangering consequences of a conspiracy
   mentality. Its manifestations include resentment and hostility toward
   minorities, an alienation from democracy, an increased likelihood of
   voting for right-wing authoritarian parties, and an affinity for
   violence.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Building on the literature on formal and informal institutions, this
   paper offers a typology of the role informal institutions play in the
   efficacy or inefficacy of formal institutions. Particularly, whether and
   why de jure and de facto independence converge or diverge. We
   distinguish four roles that informal institutions can play: competing,
   reinforcing, overlapping, and redundant. To illustrate our typology, we
   include examples of each role from Latin American countries. In Brazil
   we show that a norm of professionalism reinforces internal judicial
   independence, whereas in Mexico a norm of patronage competes with it. In
   Uruguay we show that a norm of legislative cooperation is redundant with
   a high level of de jure external judicial independence, whereas in
   Paraguay a norm of militant subordination overlaps with a low level of
   it.},

   The Killings of Former Guerrilla Combatants and Social Leaders in

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to analyse the phenomenon of the killings of
   former FARC-EP guerrilla fighters and social leaders committed in
   Colombia between November 2016, when the Peace Agreement was signed, and
   June 2021. It argues for the need to focus the analysis on nine
   departments, which account for most of this type of violent homicide.
   This violence is closely linked to armed groups, both in the form of
   FARC-EP guerrillas and dissidents, as well as post-paramilitary and
   other criminal groups that fuel the armed conflict. This forms part of
   the continuation of the geography of violence that existed before the
   Peace Agreement, albeit with new armed actors following the
   demobilisation of the guerrillas. One factor explaining the violence is
   the drug trafficking industry, which attracts armed groups that compete
   for the control of resources and find in former FARC-EP combatants and
   social leaders people opposed to their illicit interests. Using
   different correlational exercises, we also note the need for future
   research to shed light on a phenomenon that has so far been little
   studied, and which highlights the limited capacity for transforming the
   violence that, for the time being, accompanies the Peace Agreement
   signed in 2016.},

Abstract = {Elites are vital actors in understanding state strengths and weaknesses
   during critical times. To what extent do Central American elites
   constrain tax policies implemented during COVID-19? Using novel data
   sets of cabinet trajectories and tax policies imple-mented in Central
   America, this article offers an in-depth empirical comparative analysis
   of the elites' trajectories and resources, state capacities, and policy
   implementation. Our findings show first, that when state capacities are
   weak, and elites' capacities for influence are strong, the policy
   response is regressive. Second, when there are weak state capacities and
   inter-elite conflicts, the policy responses are used as a control
   mechanism. And third, where state capacities are strong, but elites are
   cohesive, policy responses tend to favor the fiscal status quo. This
   article contributes to increasing our understanding of the rela-tionship
   between elite power and public policies by making an empirical and
   conceptual contribution to studying elites.},

Abstract = {This article is based on an investigation that aimed to investigate and
   explore the experience of living in a public geriatric residence managed
   by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires. If generally these
   institutions were studied as areas of solitude and passivity in which
   elderly people who can no longer fend for themselves and are in their
   last stage of life are confined, this work poses the challenge of
   approaching them as a world of life. The research approach was carried
   out from an ethnographic methodology. From a field work carried out
   between 2016 and 2018, it was possible to explore the ways in which
   residents experience old age and inhabiting the institution. The
   ethnographic work led me to develop a perspective that I called
   ``gerontology of experience{''}, from which I have sought to learn and
   reflect on old age beyond age, to consider it as a specific and situated
   experience.},

Title = {Climate Policy Ambition: Exploring A Policy Density Perspective},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {226-238},
Abstract = {National policy ambition plays a central role in climate change
   governance under the Paris Agreement and is now a focus of rapidly
   emerging literature. In this contribution, we argue that policy ambition
   can be captured by the level of national policy activity, which in
   accordance with the existing literature should be referred to as
   ``policy density.{''} In this study, we measure climate policy density
   by drawing on three publicly available databases. All three measurements
   show an upward trend in the adoption of climate policy. However, our
   empirical comparison also reveals differences between the measure-ments
   with regard to the degree of policy expansion and sectoral coverage,
   which are due to differences in the type of policies in the databases.
   For the first time, we compare the patterns of policy density within
   each database (2000-2019) and reveal that while they are different, they
   are nonetheless potentially complementary. Since the choice of the
   database and the resulting measurement of policy density ultimately
   depend on the questions posed by researchers, we conclude by discussing
   whether some questions are better answered by some measurements than
   others.},

   Interpretations of the Anti-Peronist `Progressivism' on the Kirchner

Abstract = {The present work tries to trace an interpretive look on the conformation
   and updating of the anti-Peronist / Kirchnerist discourse in the
   intellectuals identified in progressivism during the Cristina Fernandez
   governments. It is interesting to approach these texts, which belong to
   recognized intellectual references, to capture the nodal points of a
   discourse that disputes hegemony in the conformation of a story about
   our history and our future. The hypothesis that we maintain is that in
   these materials there is a reflected thought that transcends media
   immediacy and it is therefore essential to deepen this line. In turn,
   these texts are the starting point for numerous interpretations that
   will cross different media, that is, they are constituted as a social
   interpretation powerhouse. Thinking progressivism as a broad space in
   dispute composed of figures that come from different backgrounds is
   important to understand the antiPeronist update in an anti-Kirchnerist
   key. For this work we will take La audacia y el calculo, by Beatriz
   Sarlo (2011); El simulacro, by Alejandro Katz (2013); Las huellas del
   rencor, by Santiago Kovadloff (2015); and Argentinismos, by Martin
   Caparros (2011). In methodological terms, the work is based on a

Abstract = {The purpose of the article was to identify problem areas to ensure an
   independent court in administrative proceedings in the context of the
   implementation of the human right to a fair trial. The research was
   conducted using general scientific (induction, analysis, synthesis) and
   special legal (formal-logical, dogmatic, comparative-legal) methods. The
   authors have determined relevant areas of court staffing, such as:
   providing judicial power; providing administrative positions for the
   court and judicial staffing. It is stated that the improvement of
   legislation in the judicial sphere must be carried out from the
   inadmissibility of its exclusively positivist interpretation. It is
   concluded that, in order to guarantee the immunity of a judge in a broad
   context, it is important to prevent cases of unjustified disciplinary
   proceedings against judges. An important guarantee of the legality of
   the disciplinary liability of a judge is the observance by the subject
   of disciplinary liability of the due process established by law. It is
   emphasized that this is an assessment by the administrative court of the
   circumstances on which the plaintiff bases his claims in cases of appeal
   against these acts of the High Council of Justice.},

Pages = {60-82},
Abstract = {This article re-examines the history of local governance reform in New
   Brunswick through an application of Mahoney and Thelen's theory of
   gradual institutional change. Though the changes in New Brunswick's
   local governance system since 1967 have often been dismissed as
   inconsequential, it is more appropriate to understand the history of
   local governance reform as a pattern of layering. Using Mahoney and
   Thelen's modes of change and associated change agents, this article
   attempts to both explain why change has appeared limited up to this
   point and why the present Higgs-Allain reforms may finally result in a
   cumulative impact that disrupts the status quo.},

Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},
Number = {74},
Pages = {953-974},
Abstract = {The figure of culpable recidivism typified in Article 57 of the
   Ecuadorian Organic Integral Penal Code is analyzed with respect to the
   existence of possible violations to basic principles of law, such as
   proportionality and culpability, in addition to its application as an
   aggravating factor in cases of dangerousness of the offender and
   potential to commit infractions again, highlighting the non-compliance
   with the purposes of criminal law. The possible divergence between
   Ecuadorian legislation, international treaties and jurisprudential
   positions are issues to be highlighted in the work. This is a
   qualitative and documentary type of research, focused on building a
   correct differentiation between generic and specific recidivism, to
   avoid future transgressions to the rights of those convicted for guilty
   recidivism. It is concluded that the application of Article 57 of the
   COIP punishes the conduct of the person, which violates the inherent
   rights of Ecuadorians and foreigners residing in the country, because it
   takes into account the dangerousness of the individual as an identifier
   of the recidivist, this results in a previous tendency to the judge at
   the time of sentencing, failing to comply with the purpose of
   maintaining a legal order that avoids putting the recidivist in a
   vulnerable situation.},

Abstract = {The biography of a brilliant university professor, such as Professor
   Lucas Verdu, is extremely complex, although the author knew him well.
   This biographical sketch summarises the personal traits of ``Mr.
   Pablo{''} and his scientific views, how he was always treated and is
   still remembered, especially by his disciples, who all agree in
   remembering his affable manner and his wisdom. Professor Verdu lived
   between two generations of scholars of Political Law and, unlike most of
   them, he never adopted complacent positions with the Franco regime. On
   the contrary, he distanced himself from the regime and in all his
   academic undertakings he focused on subjects not related to the ideology
   of Franco's regime, which he never supported. In doing so, he paved the
   way for the advent of democracy, which he so desired. Professor Verdu
   adopted a broad conception of Political Law, but without mixing
   scientific methods and introducing those of the Italian doctrine of
   Constitutional Law, whose assumptions he agreed with. Early on, he
   opposed legal positivism, which he regarded as undermining democracy
   against its enemies, and he opted for a substantialism that would
   provide the constitutional state with an evaluative character. His
   legacy will not be taken away by a single word of the legislator and
   will continue to inspire us.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {72},
Number = {12},
Pages = {69+},
Abstract = {Western countries want to reduce Russia's revenues from oil exports. To
   this end, the EU and G7 states in early December 2022 decided on a price
   cap for crude oil that Russia brings to the world market by ship.
   Shipowners, technical service providers, financial service providers,
   and insurers from these countries are only allowed to participate in oil
   exports from Russia if the price achieved is no more than \$60 dollars
   per barrel. Official figures give the impression that the mechanism is
   working. Russia was said to be selling crude oil at an average of \$47 a
   barrel as of January 2023. In fact, however, it can be assumed that the
   Russian companies are achieving prices between \$70 and \$75 per barrel
   in the important market of India. The market for shipping services is so
   opaque that regulations can be circumvented and revenues directed to
   shadow accounts.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {JAN-DEC},
Abstract = {Colombia has a long history of violence, but it also shows a renewed
   capacity to resist it. Proposals from women, men, and youth that address
   the way they were affected by the conflict have survived and emerged, as
   well as various peacebuilding strategies that arose in the midst of
   warfare. Likewise, associative strategies have been strengthened, as in
   the case of the inhabitants of Chaparral, Ataco, Rioblanco and Herrera
   (South of Tolima), who have developed organizations of coffee producers,
   organizations related to the care of the environment, women's networks,
   young peace builders, among others. Communities that, like many others
   in different parts of the world, have transformed their situations by
   exercising a transformative power in their environments. The research
   work carried out with co-researchers of social organizations of the
   project ``School, Territory and Post-conflict{''} has revealed the
   presence of different strategies that transform power and from where
   peace in the territories is acquiring different nuances, until giving
   shape to ``Pluriverses of peaces{''} in the South of Tolima. Based on an
   undisciplined and participatory methodology, the research has shown how
   transformative power operates as a vision of future and is embodied in
   transformative strategies that impact territories.},

Abstract = {The aim was to analyze the problems of global development of the modern
   world, including controversial global processes and to investigate the
   theoretical and practical aspects of modern politics in the conditions
   of challenges and reformatting of today's world. The novelty of the
   research lies in the understanding of objective processes of
   intensification of global political relations in extreme conditions,
   including war, crisis, uncertainty and instability. The methodology
   employed consisted of the use of tools such as political modeling and
   forecasting, which help to look behind the scenes of the global world as
   a new integral entity in a new way. The conclusion of the study is that
   the analysis of the new problems of reformatting the modern world in the
   context of globalization has been carried out and the ways of solving
   these problems have been shown. Theoretical and practical approaches to
   finding ways to increase the effectiveness of global management and
   activities of international organizations were considered. A new model
   of modern politics is analyzed, within which the basic problems of
   globalization are outlined and a solution to the negative political
   consequences of the existing world order is proposed.},

Title = {Europe against the people: does eurosceptic news exposure relate to
   populist attitudes? Evidence from a linkage study across nine
   European countries},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The media's attention to populism is oftentimes associated with its
   electoral success. In this paper, we propose that the relationship
   between media coverage and populist beliefs among citizens can be
   understood as an over-time cultivation of support for populist ideology
   due to the media's attention to populist ideas and policies. The media
   may devote attention to ideas high on the populist agenda, such as
   Euroscepticism, which may prime populist worldviews among individuals.
   To test this expectation, we first use a comparative study in nine EU
   countries for which we link content analytic data on negativity toward
   the EU in the media to panel survey data measuring populist attitudes.
   Overall, we find that exposure to negative news on the EU does not
   trigger populist attitudes. In a more detailed case study in the
   Netherlands across multiple panel waves, we do find that social media
   exposure is more likely to be associated with populist attitudes than
   traditional news exposure. Together, our study offers limited support
   for the notion that attention to Euroscepticism in established media can
   fuel populist attitudes among voters.},

Title = {Succession effects in presidential elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {What is the impact of ex-presidents on the electoral performance of
   their party's successor candidates for the office and how long after a
   president has left office are successor effects electorally significant?
   Mattei and Weisberg (1994) argue that successor effects are large
   primarily when the vice president runs for office immediately at the end
   of the term of the president under whom they served. Timeliness and the
   association between presidents and their vice presidents account for
   succession effects. This paper challenges the Mattei-Weisberg successor
   effects perspective, arguing that significant successor effects can be
   possible for non-vice presidential candidates and long after a president
   has left office. Using American National Election Study data, I add
   numerous successions to those Mattei and Weisberg investigated. Analysis
   finds that succession effects apply to non-vice presidential candidates.
   Further, some ex-presidents may influence voting decisions long after
   they left office. There is also a hint in these data that succession
   effects have climbed over time, because as polarization has increased,
   the linkage between presidents and their parties has tightened.},

Abstract = {Partisan preferences usually stand out as the major driving force behind
   voters' expectations about election outcomes. Apart from partisan
   preferences, however, purely individual-level factors appear to be only
   weakly associated with forecasting ability. Some studies argue that we
   need to move from the strictly personal sphere to the interpersonal one
   to better understand the underpinnings of individuals' forecasting
   ability. This paper leverages data from 77 elections at the district,
   municipal, regional, and/or national levels in 10 different countries to
   assess the impact of social networks and social interactions on the
   accuracy of citizens' electoral expectations. The results cast doubt on
   the capacity of social interactions to influence citizens' forecasting
   skills.},

Abstract = {Where autocratization through classical coups belongs to the twentieth
   century, democracies are today primarily demolished through ``autocratic
   legalism{''}, a governing technique destroying democracies deliberately
   and incrementally within the law itself. As a result, it often goes
   unnoticed by hiding in judicial robes. This makes it harder to
   categorize regimes and necessitates a greater analytical sensitivity of
   the indices that many decision-makers - like in our case the European
   Union - have come to rely on when monitoring and attempting to protect
   democracy. By exemplifying the workings of autocratic legalism in
   Hungary and Poland, we firstly discuss what is needed to measure this
   new type of autocratization and how some of the leading indices fall
   short in this regard. We secondly discuss how relying on less adequate
   indices like Polity5 and Freedom House makes it more challenging for
   authorities like the EU to monitor, criticize, and sanction violations
   of democratic principles. In arguing that an index like V-Dem would
   offer a better foundation for tackling the Union's rule of law
   conundrum, we stress that the EU's problems are only in part due to the
   use of mediocre indices but also linked to increased politicization of
   democratic backsliding in the EU.},

Abstract = {The report discusses the main features of Romania's county councils, the
   context and results of their election in 2020, and addresses some
   theoretical questions raised earlier in the annual reviews of regional
   elections. It confirms the argument that Romania's subnational elections
   have a significant forecasting (barometer) potential: in 2020 their
   results correctly indicated that no facile right-wing victory was to be
   expected at the parliamentary elections. The nationalization of the main
   parties and of the party system is also assessed. Analyzing electoral
   results in a longer time perspective reveals that most (though not all)
   counties are strongholds of one of the main political camps, which
   brings Romania close to an aggregated (as opposed to a replicated) party
   system at the national level. While this sets limits to party system
   nationalization, of the other sources formerly contributing to the
   regionalization of the vote only the Hungarian ethnic parties maintained
   their relevance in 2020.},

Abstract = {The article explores the shifts in Sino-Iraqi relations since the 1950s.
   The article's question is: Is China and Iraq's relationship witnessing a
   turning point characterised by more dependency and engagement? The
   article explores Sino-Iraqi interdependence throughout the last six
   decades through primary and secondary resources, including official
   documents, data on trade and Chinese and Iraqi outlets. It employs Nye
   and Keohane's complex interdependence to evaluate Sino-Iraqi dependency.
   The article finds that Sino-Iraqi interdependence was non-existent
   between the 1950s and 1975. At the end of the 1970s, some initial
   elements partially emerged but did not fully materialise; these faded in
   the 1990s, and since 2003 complex interdependence has gradually emerged.
   The bilateral relationships pre-2003 made provision for the development
   of the ties. This has not been without challenges, particularly from
   Iraq. The study shows the role of the oil sector in Sino-Iraqi
   interdependence, the uncertainty and extent of China's Belt and Road
   Initiative in Iraq and the conflicting official and public debates
   around it.},

Abstract = {As the episodes of forced evictions in the environs of Jerusalem gain
   momentum even amidst a global pandemic at the dawn of the third decade
   of the twenty-first century, this paper studies the individual narrative
   of an anglicized Arab woman, Ghada Karmi, who was forced to leave the
   place of her birth and childhood more than eighty-three years ago.
   Engaging Althusser's theory of ideology and interpellation, this paper
   examines this recurring pattern of brutal practice as an environmental
   ethical concern. By stating the postcolonial environmental ethic of her
   homeland through her latest memoir, Karmi questions unexamined idees
   recues,(1) preexisting units of information, that impede the process of
   any solution for the Palestinian predicament. Understanding the need for
   social justice and decolonization, as manifested in Karmi memoir, this
   conceptual paper investigates how she presents her right to return to
   the land of her birth, how she problematizes the ongoing
   marginalization, erasure, and Nakba of her land, both by external as
   well as internal factors, and how she states the environmental ethic of
   her place.},

Abstract = {The current Ukrainian-Russian war has far greater-reaching effects than
   what is typically reported in much of the international news media. The
   war has significantly impacted African development, which was already
   harmed during the global Covid-19 pandemic. With the pandemic seemingly
   over, African nations such as Rwanda hoped for increased economic
   development. However, the current war in Ukraine sparked increased fuel
   and food prices throughout the continent, which has impacted expected
   growth rates. This article reviews the war's impact on the central
   African nation of Rwanda. It illustrates Rwandan anger about the
   economic implications of the war and the frustration from the nation's
   inability to stop its effects.},

Abstract = {Does a universal basic income (UBI) affect voter turnout? This article
   argues that the introduction of an unconditional cash payment-where
   citizens receive money independent of employment status, age, or
   indigence-can have a turnout-enhancing effect. I evaluate the argument
   using the introduction of the Permanent Fund Dividend in Alaska.
   Differences-in-differences estimates covering November general elections
   from 1978 to 2000 provide compelling evidence that the Alaskan UBI has a
   significant positive effect on turnout. The results further suggest that
   the turnout increase was not a one-off effect but persists over a period
   of almost 20 years. Thus, a UBI has the potential to positively affect
   turnout among an entire electorate, adding to the discussion around
   potential welfare reforms in western democracies.},

Title = {United in diversity: understanding what unites and what divides the
   Yellow Vests},
Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3-4, SI},
Pages = {444-478},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper stems from the first sampled and representative survey
   carried out on the Yellow Vests movement in the French region of
   Occitania. While scientific literature mainly explores the drivers of
   internal-social and ideological-cohesion in social movements, our study
   sheds light on the internal diversity of the Yellow Vests' mobilisation.
   Our findings reveal the unprecedented scale of the movement in relation
   to the French population. They confirm and document its social and
   political heterogeneity. We confirm that the working and lower middle
   classes are over-represented in the movement. But our study also
   highlights the diversity of the coalition formed by the Yellow Vests who
   are, in fact, fairly representative of the French working and middle
   classes in all their diversity, including the upper-middle class. Only
   the upper classes are not part of the movement. In part two, we explore
   the cleavages that unite the Yellow Vests as well as those that divide
   them. While they are cohesive on economic issues and their strong
   rejection of political elites, the Yellow Vests are highly divided on
   identity and cultural issues. The results allow us to shed light on the
   forms and dynamics of the movement. Indeed, the variety of ideological
   and social profiles, as well as grievances, is reflected in the
   partially differentiated spatial distribution of the participants across
   the various protest sites. Our analysis also offers keys to
   understanding the process by which demands were generated and framed,
   the reasons for the mistrust shown towards would-be spokespeople and the
   difficulty in translating the movement into the political and electoral
   arena. Our study underlines the processual nature of any social movement
   and prompts us not to overestimate the unity, uniformity, and similarity
   of its participants, since many Yellow Vests probably rallied not so
   much together as alongside each other.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {80},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The second decade of the twenty-first century witnessed a significant
   `rightward drift' as populists in the West scored striking electoral
   gains. We argue that this reflects a shift in the power of electoral
   cleavages that is asymmetric in nature. Specifically, voters for whom
   immigration is salient are more likely to switch to conservative and
   national populist parties than to liberal or left-wing parties. We
   leverage data from three prominent cases, the United States, Britain and
   Germany, to demonstrate that immigration-specific asymmetric realignment
   occurred in the three countries. These findings have implications for
   our understanding of electoral politics, populism and the emerging
   `culture divide' in party systems.},

Abstract = {The literature on the `everyday' or `foundational' economy poses
   fundamental challenges to orthodox economic thinking. First, it implies
   a different way of thinking about economic success, based on good lives
   for all rather than growth for growth's sake. Second, it emphasises how
   dominant financialised business models undermine good outcomes for both
   workers and consumers. But, since the `everyday economy' as a political
   frame does not make these issues explicit, it leaves room for them to be
   elided as part of Labour's post-Corbyn rebranding. When Starmer's Labour
   has squarely confronted issues of power and ownership in the `everyday
   economy'-for example, with its proposed windfall tax on oil and gas
   firms or plans for publicly-owned energy generation-it has reaped
   political dividends. However, it remains to be seen whether the party
   has the appetite to build on these interventions and set out a broader
   agenda for structural reform.},

Title = {Bureaucrats as policy makers: Minority accommodation and exclusion in
   ethnic nation-states},
Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {50},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1141-1157},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Why do some ethnic nation-states employ simultaneously inconsistent
   policies toward ethnic minorities, accommodating them in one sphere but
   excluding them from another? This article argues that this incoherent
   treatment of minorities results from the delegation of authority to
   bureaucrats. Building on the principal-agent approach and nationalism
   scholarship, this work develops a causal mechanism explaining the
   conditions under which bureaucrats can shift state policies toward
   ethnic minorities and the types of policy preferences they seek to
   materialize. Defining policy problems, strategically framing optimal
   solutions, and building support for policy initiatives are the
   mechanisms through which nonelected officials challenge the existing
   status quo and seek to shift state policies toward ethnic minorities.
   This theoretical framework is applied to education and land policies in
   Israel vis-a-vis the Palestinian Arab citizens to illustrate how
   entrepreneurial bureaucrats can bring about diverse policy outcomes
   toward the same minority.},

Abstract = {Undergraduate students are often assumed to be consumers of the material
   instructors bring to their attention. Rarely are they seen as producers
   of original research, other than in elite honors programmes or opt-in
   research opportunities such as university-based undergraduate research
   journals. Yet students new to a subject often have highly original
   responses to what they encounter. Though they may not yet be fully
   attuned to the contours of the scholarship, they are not limited by
   preexisting notions of what the defining questions of the field might
   be, nor are they as committed to the disciplinary boundaries that
   sometimes-intentionally or not-obscure or prevent promising lines of
   inquiry. We argue that recognizing students as emerging scholars capable
   of original, high quality work, and offering a structured assessment in
   the form of a peer reviewed class journal has the potential to transform
   how students they see themselves in relation to the discipline, supports
   the development of advanced research and writing skills, and encourages
   them to understand academic work as a collective rather than individual
   endeavor. This assessment also allows a wider range of students to
   access the benefits of participating in a comprehensive research
   activity that simulates the academic research process, rather than
   reserving such opportunities for those participating in elite programmes
   or opt-in research activities.},

Abstract = {This article theorizes the politics of responsibility-activist struggles
   over who will be held accountable for structural injustices like the
   ``catastrophic{''} changes underway in our climate. To do so, it
   develops a politicized conception of responsibility, one that treats
   responsibility as a social construct and a terrain of contestation.
   Building on the work of feminist philosophers of responsibility and on
   the praxis of ``kayaktivism,{''} this politicized account treats
   responsibility as a social practice of interrogating and contesting
   shared ethico-political judgments. On this understanding, taking
   responsibility or stepping up is a way of making
   responsibility-literally of (re)constructing those social practices and
   judgments through conscious efforts to persuade others, challenge
   prevailing norms and interpretations, change people's beliefs about how
   the world works, revise popular expectations of social actors and
   institutions, and disrupt business as usual. The article highlights the
   centrality of norms and power to social practices of responsibility and
   suggests alternative perspectives on familiar philosophical worries
   about blame, complexity and agency, and justification.},

Abstract = {The food delivery app business has grown in recent years, with an
   increasing number of customers and workers on these platforms. Food
   delivery apps are also an iconic example of the increasing precarity of
   working conditions. Delivery app workers have mobilised to demand
   greater stability and regulation, with one of their main demands being
   to switch from their current status as self-employed workers to being
   employees of these companies. However, in Spain, those who want to
   remain self-employed have also mobilised, demanding better wages and
   improved conditions from the platforms. In this article, we focus on the
   mobilisation of delivery workers in Spain, exploring the characteristics
   of the main actors involved and the evolution and current situation of
   the conflict.},

   interested, first of all, in advancing some indications about what

   (former) members of the military, White supremacist organisations, and
   regular citizens has a rich genealogy. We trace this genealogy to the
   events of 11 September 2001 and the homeland security state built in
   their wake, even as its reach extends further into U.S. history.
   Post-9/11 discourse became a mechanism for seeking and interpreting
   perceived threats to the United States and its citizens. Through it,
   immigration, disease, and White supremacy became intertwined.
   Perceptions of infectious and biological threats became racialised. With
   the emergence of the novel coronavirus, President Trump enacted travel
   bans and routinely referred to the virus as the ``Wuhan virus{''} or
   ``Chinese virus.{''} Hate crimes against Asians and Asian Americans
   followed, as this language reinvigorated Orientalist histories. We
   examine rhetoric about disease over the past twenty years, particularly
   as it has reinforced militarism and White supremacy, all against the
   backdrop of 9/11. State constructions of 9/11 and 9/11 memory inform and
   explain our recent and contemporary terrain.},

Abstract = {Personal relations and networks have long been argued to dominate
   African politics. Since personal power is difficult to measure, much of
   the literature has remained either anecdotal or has used ethnicity to
   approximate power distributions. This article is proposing a social
   network approach to the analysis of personal power in legislatures and
   cabinets in three cases: Ghana, Togo and Gabon. We combine survey data
   on parliamentary discussion networks with a new data set on cabinet
   appointments. We find that power accumulation in one institution
   correlates with power accumulation in the other in all three countries,
   irrespective of the level of democracy: individuals build up a unique
   power base to advance their careers. We also find differences between
   the modes of power accumulation and elite integration across our cases.
   Our findings could stimulate new debates on personal power, regime
   survival and elite reproduction across different regimes.},

Abstract = {There is significant disagreement on the moderating role of institutions
   on policy responsive- ness, yet overwhelmingly research in state
   politics has focused on single institutions. This project leverages a
   new aggregate scale of state institutions to evaluate if the collective
   insti- tutional context moderates the influence of public opinion on
   policy. I use a recently released latent scale of institutional context
   and find that high levels of accountability pressure strongly strengthen
   public opinion's influence on policy for both economic and social
   policy, while the strength of a state's checks and balance system is
   largely unrelated to policy responsiveness. These results demonstrate
   the importance of incorporating aggregate institutional design into our
   understanding of the role of institutions in state politics, and that
   collectively institutions play a large role in determining how public
   opinion is translated into policy.},

Abstract = {Since the 2016 election of President Donald Trump, conspiracy theories
   have become more salient among Americans. Using the deep state
   conspiracy theory QAnon as a case study, we argue three types of
   conspiracy theory adherents exist due to cognitive dissonance
   experienced in the face of key theory milestone failures: Hardliners,
   who do not face cognitive dissonance in response to failed conspiracy
   theory predictions; Moderates, committed members who experience
   cognitive dissonance and must adapt in order to maintain belief in the
   conspiracy theory, and Bandwagoners, casual members with shallow beliefs
   who experience cognitive dissonance and abandon the conspiracy theory.
   From these types, we put forth the bandwagoner acceleration hypothesis:
   by emphasizing the disconnect between complex deep state conspiracy
   theory beliefs and reality that demonstrates the falsehoods perpetrated
   by the movement, relevant stakeholders exogenous to the conspiracy
   theory can activate Bandwagoners to stimulate conspiratorial belief
   abandonment. This is important as Bandwagoners represent the peril of
   latent power which can be coopted and used to threaten democratic
   legitimacy.},

Abstract = {The scholarship supports the effectiveness of high-impact practices
   (HIPs) to advance undergraduates' political knowledge and engagement. A
   line of inquiry asks which type of HIPs is the most effective,
   especially for core (required) courses with students from a variety of
   degree programs. In 2022, many students are from Generation Z, born
   between 1995 and 2000. Surveys of this generation find distinct learning
   preferences and a lack of political efficacy (or a limited sense of
   government responsiveness). Core government courses provide a means to
   address learning preferences with HIPs, as well as increase political
   knowledge and a sense of efficacy. Initially, a quasi-research project
   interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, this exploratory study compares
   two HIPs-embedded service learning and Town Hall Meeting model-and
   political efficacy measures of students across time and type of class. A
   significant body of work is devoted to service learning but scholarly
   investigations of the Town Hall Model are more limited. Comparing two
   HIPs and applying a political efficacy measure offers a guide for future
   research and contributes to scholarly conversations regarding the most
   effective teaching strategies for undergraduate students taking core
   government courses.},

Title = {Entitled and self-conscious? The ego-centric underpinnings of electoral
   preferences during the 2020 US election},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {We investigate whether entitlement (feeling more deserving than others)
   and several dimensions of self-conscious affect (broadly reflecting
   responses to shame and guilt) are associated with voting intentions
   during the 2020 Presidential election in the USA. We utilized a sample
   of 443 adults recruited through Prolific. The sample was demographically
   representative with respect to age, gender, and race. Participants were
   recruited from 12 October 2020 to 15 October 2020, approximately 3 weeks
   before the national election held on 3 November 2020. Results reveal
   that higher entitlement beliefs are associated with support for
   Republicans, and so are shame proneness vis-a-vis behavioral avoidance
   (desire to hide) and blame externalization. Inversely, guilt proneness
   and shame proneness vis-a-vis negative self-evaluation is associated
   with support for Democrats. Results also suggest that shame proneness
   and blame externalization most closely correspond with voting
   preference; specifically, negative self-evaluation drives support for
   Democrats, whereas blame externalization and behavioral avoidance drives
   support for Republicans. While these effects are often only in the
   small-to-medium range in terms of magnitude, their implications for a
   more nuanced understanding of electoral politics-and its pitfalls-are
   noteworthy.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the organisation of two Australian far-right
   political parties: Fraser Anning's Conservative National Party (FACNP)
   and Pauline Hanson's One Nation (PHON). Based on semi-structured
   interviews with election candidates and office bearers and an analysis
   of official party documents, I examine how these parties manage their
   internal organisation and cope with problems of collective choice. I
   argue that their organisational practices are characterised by
   disorganisation. Namely, a lack of meaningful organisational structures
   and procedures, a core of socialised activists, andcoherent
   decision-making processes. By focusing on campaign mobilisation at the
   expense of party building, I argue that their disorganisation is
   inseparable from their muted electoral performance at the 2019
   Australian federal election.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the effect of a voter mobilization campaign to
   increase electoral turnout at the population level. The government sent
   a text message with an encouragement to vote to all 200,000 voters in
   Bergen, Norway. The timing and the order of the text message was
   randomized, and I am able to measure the immediate treatment effect by
   exploiting a unique data set containing the exact timing of each
   Norwegian vote. I estimate that the text message increases electoral
   turnout by between 1 and 2.2 percentage points.},

Abstract = {The September 2020 Abraham Accords between Israel and the United Arab
   Emirates, and Bahrain was the culmination of a multi-year process. Later
   two other Arab monarchies, Morocco, and Jordan jointed them in improving
   their relations with the Jewish State while the remaining Gulf
   Cooperation Council members opted not to join the Accords. This article
   focuses on Gulf Kingdoms and argues that the improvement in Israeli-Arab
   relations is explained by a growing realization that in Iran, both sides
   have a common enemy; the failings of America's Middle East policy; the
   anticipated economic and security benefits to be gained from improved
   relations; and the diminished importance of the Palestinian issue for
   Arab societies and governments.},

Abstract = {While the Central Asian states try to balance their foreign policy
   options and to develop `multi-vector' strategies, the region is tilting
   eastwards, especially towards China. What does this imply for two other
   external powers in the region: Russia and the European Union? This
   article reflects on the future prospects for the EU to play a role of
   significance in Central Asia and for Russia to manage its position as
   the region's former overlord. The uninterrupted continuity of
   authoritarianism in Central Asia suggests that the EU has exerted only a
   very limited influence in the region, while the interests of Russia and
   the local regimes seem to run in parallel. Yet we see both external
   powers adapting their strategies in part to the changed (geo)political
   situation in the region. In this article we interpret these changes and
   draw tentative conclusions about what they may mean for the future of
   the Central Asian countries, especially where the perceived
   contradiction between security and human rights is concerned.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the increase in forcibly displaced people seeking
   refuge and protection, along with restrictions installed at many borders
   to prevent their entry, has meant that millions of human beings face a
   humanitarian crisis. The multiple realities that refugees live, in
   addition to stressing the conceptualizations and regulations about
   asylum and refuge, force its permanent revision. The objective of this
   article is to examine the theoretical and historical considerations of
   asylum and refuge, which show the edges and scope of the discussion on

Abstract = {Citizens in authoritarian regimes understand the concept of democracy
   under the influence of the state's manipulation and individual agency.
   This study examines Chinese citizens' perception of three types of
   government - people relationships - government (1) of the people; (2) by
   the people; and (3) for the people - without directly using the term
   `democracy'. Citizens' perceptions of these three principles of
   democracy can predict the level of their support for democracy,
   identifying variations among Chinese `democrats'. The principle of
   government by the people is most popular among the Chinese public.
   Citizens who understand democracy based on government of the people are
   dissatisfied with the country's level of democracy and criticize
   authoritarian politics. Public understanding of democracy based on
   government for the people has an anti-democratic orientation, and is
   compatible with support for authoritarian rule. This study unveils
   variations in the Chinese public's understanding of democracy and its
   impact on politics.},

Abstract = {Social media is frequently an arena of intense competition among major
   political actors across the world. We argue that a fruitful way of
   understanding this competition is as coalitions among key actors and
   their networks of followers. These coalitions can both advance a shared
   political message and target mutual rivals. Importantly, coalitions can
   be tacit or explicit, and they do not necessarily depend on direct state
   manipulation or repression, although they often do. This makes a
   coalitional framework particularly valuable for studying complex
   political environments in which online actors blend cooperation and
   competition. Empirically, we show the value of this approach with novel
   data collection and analysis of Twitter and Facebook content from
   2018-19 in Pakistan, with a focus on the dynamics leading up to and
   following the controversial 2018 general election. We map out networks
   of narrative alignment and conflict on Pakistani social media, providing
   important insights into the relationships among the major political
   parties, military, media, and dissidents. Future research can fruitfully
   explore the causes and effects of powerful social media coalitions.},

Abstract = {The overrepresentation of advanced age among elites is a rising concern
   in democracies such as the United States. In 2016, American voters
   elected Donald Trump-at the time the oldest president to enter
   office-and in 2020 Joe Biden beat that record. Theories of descriptive
   representation suggest that voters should be less likely to support
   older candidates when age becomes a salient campaign issue. Indeed, age
   raises questions about a candidate's physical and mental health, and
   thus their fitness to serve in office. The present study reports on a
   survey experiment conducted during the 2020 Democratic Presidential
   primaries, which featured several candidates in their seventies, all
   running to replace an incumbent president of the same age group. Priming
   age did not affect voters' assessments of any particular candidate's
   ability to win the general election. These results are inconsistent with
   existing studies of age effects using hypothetical candidates. Possible
   causes of this discrepancy are addressed in the discussion.},

Title = {Wealth creation without domination. The fiduciary duties of corporations},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},

Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {317-338},

Abstract = {Corporations wield power in today's economies, and political theories of
   the corporation argue about the legitimacy conditions of corporate
   power. This paper argues in favour of a double-fiduciary theory for
   corporations. Based on a concession theory of markets, it sees all
   markets as authorized by states (in the name of society), for the
   purpose of creating economic value, or wealth. Hence corporations, as
   much as non-incorporated firms, have a fiduciary duty to the
   state/society to create wealth, in the competitive structure of the
   market. However, their pursuit of wealth often creates unbalanced
   relations of power between corporations and their stakeholders, which
   can at some point be classified as instances of domination. Therefore,
   corporations need to be subjected to a second fiduciary duty, i.e. not
   to dominate others in the economy. This duty is also, in the final
   instance, owed to the state/society. In an era when everyone can
   incorporate their business, states/societies can be interpreted as
   having, through corporate law, mandated shareholders as `proximate
   beneficiaries', to incentivize corporations to create wealth. Now
   states/societies need to think about how to prevent corporations from
   dominating others. New mechanisms of accountability towards stakeholders
   and/or citizens as proximate beneficiaries are needed. Only in this way
   can corporations be effectively held to account for both of the
   fiduciary duties which characterize their normative status.},

Abstract = {Researchers often seek to identify the effects of a treatment on a
   sequence of behaviors, such as whether citizens register to vote and
   whether they then cast ballots. I show that average treatment effects
   (ATEs) are only identified until the first behavior (registering to
   vote) that affects the set of possible subsequent actions (voting). When
   one action changes the set of possible subsequent actions, it creates
   `phantom counterfactuals,' or undefined potential outcomes, which render
   ATEs unidentified. I show that applied theory allows researchers to
   diagnose phantom counterfactuals, which helps to recognize unidentified
   ATEs and focus instead on other estimands that are identified. I
   illustrate this approach using a stylized model of crime reporting,
   showing how different theories generate different sets of identified
   estimands while holding constant an experimental design. I thereby
   establish the necessity of applied theory for causal identification in
   empirical research with sequential behavioral outcomes.},

Abstract = {This article explores how giving systematic attention to emotions could
   enhance grounded normative theory accounts. Grounded normative theory,
   and related approaches featuring an `ethnographic sensibility', involve
   the conduct of original empirical research and/or analysis in the
   development of normative arguments. Each has been increasingly visible
   in normative political theory, focusing on moral claims in contexts such
   as migration, democratic practice, and grassroots struggles. Yet, while
   such approaches have sought to sensitively present experiences of
   injustice and exclusion within such contexts, they have given relatively
   little attention to the emotional or `affective' turn in normative
   theory and social science disciplines, where emotions are studied as
   integral to political/moral claims and the motivation of action. We
   highlight how a similar emphasis on emotions as integral to political
   and moral claims could enrich grounded normative theory, in part through
   presenting an illustrative analysis of emotional expressions by
   immigration detainees in the UK. We show how such analysis can expand
   normative inputs, and clarify or reveal normative issues arising in a
   given empirical context. We also highlight how grounded normative work
   could enrich normative treatments of political emotions.},

Title = {The Appointment of Women to Authoritarian Cabinets in Africa},
Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 18},
Abstract = {What explains variation in the inclusion of women in authoritarian
   cabinets? We theorize that leaders of electoral autocracies are affected
   by changing international norms of democracy and women's rights to
   appoint women ministers. We propose two hypotheses. First, increasing
   dependence on aid from democratic donors encourages leaders of electoral
   autocracies to appoint more women ministers. Second, electoral autocrats
   uprooting democratic traits appoint more women ministers to minimize the
   reputational costs of their autocratization. Using data from
   authoritarian regimes in 38 African countries between 1973 and 2013, we
   find that increases in aid from democracies are associated with modest
   increases in women's share of cabinet seats. As our theory suggests,
   this relationship holds only in electoral autocracies in more recent
   years when norms of gender equality have been strongest. Conversely, we
   find no evidence that autocratization periods are associated with
   increases in women's cabinet share. Additionally, we show that
   supply-side factors and the politics of multi-ethnic coalition building
   appear to explain differences in women's cabinet seat share in
   autocracies.},

Abstract = {Most trade agreements are ratified with overwhelming support by
   legislators throughout the world. This lack of opposition is surprising
   given the strong distributional consequences of trade and the
   expectation of conventional political economy theory that parliamentary
   votes on trade policy should be closely contested between winners and
   losers of globalization. To analyze the driving forces behind
   legislators' voting behavior while avoiding the obscuring effect of
   party discipline, I analyze under which circumstances legislators decide
   to rebel against their party's position when voting on the ratification
   of trade agreements. I put forward two hypotheses: First, rebellions are
   more likely when the trade agreement is with a larger trading partner
   and when the liberalization through the agreement is more comprehensive.
   Second, legislators will rebel when their party's position does not
   align with their constituency's economic interests. These hypotheses are
   supported by a series of multinomial regression analyses based on an
   original dataset comprising votes of several thousand legislators from
   multiple countries on the ratification of trade agreements.},

Abstract = {A prominent and publicly influential literature challenges the quality
   of democratic decision making, drawing on political science findings
   with specific claims about the ubiquity of cognitive bias to lament
   citizens' incompetence. A competing literature in democratic theory
   defends the wisdom of crowds, drawing on a cluster of models in support
   of the capacity of ordinary citizens to produce correct outcomes. In
   this Letter, we draw on recent findings in psychology to demonstrate
   that the former literature is based on outdated and erroneous claims and
   that the latter is overly sanguine about the circumstances that yield
   reliable collective decision making. By contrast, ``interactionist{''}
   scholarship shows how individual-level biases are not devastating for
   group problem solving, given appropriate conditions. This provides
   possible microfoundations for a broader research agenda similar to that
   implemented by Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues on common-good
   provision, investigating how different group structures are associated
   with both success and failure in democratic decision making. This agenda
   would have implications for both democratic theory and democratic
   practice.},

Abstract = {An influential body of scholarship argues that authoritarian regimes
   design ``hard{''} propaganda that is intentionally heavy-handed in order
   to signal regime power. In this study, by contrast, we link the power of
   propaganda to the emotional power of ``soft{''} propaganda such as
   television dramas and viral social media content. We conduct a series of
   experiments in which we expose over 6800 respondents in China to real
   propaganda videos drawn from television dramas, state-backed social
   media accounts, and state-run newscasts, each containing nationalist
   messages favored by the Chinese Communist Party. In contrast to theories
   that propaganda is unpersuasive, we show that propaganda effectively
   manipulates anger as well as anti-foreign sentiment and behavior, with
   heightened anti-foreign attitudes persisting up to a week. However, we
   also find that nationalist propaganda has no effect on perceptions of
   Chinese government performance or on self-reported willingness to
   protest against the state.},

Title = {Social Inequalities in Argentina and Chile: A Comparative Analysis of
   Welfare Models, Labour Policies, and Occupational Trajectories from a
   Biographical Perspective},

Abstract = {The article analyses the configurations of social inequality in
   Argentina and Chile between 2000 and 2019 through a comparative
   biographical approach that combines three dimensions: macro-social
   (welfare models), meso-social (labour policies), and micro-social
   (occupational trajectories). In Argentina, welfare schemes oscillated
   between moderate protectionism and a liberal approach; in Chile, a
   movement was observed between revised neoliberalism and a protectionist
   liberal welfare approach. Regarding labour policies, a transition from
   employment regulation to self-management was observed in the Argentine
   job market; in Chile, a meritocratic discourse remains that advocates
   for worker self-management, regardless of changes in welfare schemes.
   These differences have no appreciable impact on the configuration of
   class trajectories, which are similar in both countries. While the
   service classes generally construct advantageous trajectories, the
   intermediate classes are ambivalently affected by crises and
   insufficient protection and the working classes accumulate disadvantages
   since they are conditioned by welfare schemes and social-labour
   policies.},

Abstract = {Considerable research finds that male political scientists publish more
   research on average than do female political scientists. Yet the reasons
   for this difference are not entirely clear. Those findings may also
   overestimate the relative productivity of men because they do not
   account for the longer time that more men have been in the profession
   and thus have been publishing longer than women. For a prominent survey
   dataset of political scientists, we demonstrate notable cohort
   differences in the research productivity of both men and women across
   time. Our results also indicate that the overall greater productivity of
   men results in part from senior women scholars not generally enjoying
   the same benefits of long tenure on their research output as men do.},

Abstract = {Regional units have emerged as actors seeking to shape international
   trade policy. Focusing on federal systems in North America and Europe,
   this special issue explores the patterns, causes and implication of
   constituent units' participation in trade policy. This introductory
   article situates the case studies assembled in the special issue and
   outlines how they contribute to a nascent research agenda that brings
   together scholarship rooted in comparative federalism, regionalism and
   international political economy. The article distinguishes two basic
   patterns of involvement and discusses the relative weight of explanatory
   factors identified in the literature to explain how and with what
   consequences constituent units engage in the trade policy domain. The
   article concludes with a summary of key insights from the case studies
   and outlines their contribution for future research.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the potential of elections to change our emotions
   and modify the relevance that voters assign to self-interest and
   group-identity issues. We examine this question by analyzing the
   1998-2016 period of the Catalan and Basque regional elections. The
   analysis exploits that Basques pushed to leave Spain in the early 2000s,
   and Catalans pursued independence about fifteen years later. When the
   separatist goal emerges, two issues gain relevance. First, there is a
   significant rise of identity politics, associated with the territory's
   culture and language, to the detriment of other issues that
   traditionally explain vote choice, such as the left-right ideology, the
   degree of regional autonomy, or the economic discontent. Second, the
   territory becomes more divisive, big cities align against dominant
   separatist parties, and rural areas align with independentists. We
   conclude that material self-interests dilute and group-identity factors
   emerge to determine vote decisions in times of national dissolution.},

Abstract = {This study brings a fresh perspective to elite polarization by examining
   how policymakers and party leaders interpret and respond to it.
   Polarization is examined through the language and lived experience of
   those most familiar with it-policymakers themselves. Face-to-face
   interviews posed qualitative and quantitative questions to 212
   legislators and 13 key informants from two states that varied in
   polarization. Most legislators describe polarization in negative terms.
   Consistent with ``Community Dissonance Theory,{''} analyses reveal
   differences in a legislature's institutional culture with policymakers
   in the more polarized state reporting more fraying of the social fabric
   and fracturing of decision-making processes. Specifically, legislators
   report more limited opportunities to build relationships with colleagues
   across party lines and for the minority party to make meaningful
   contributions. Corroborating the ``Theory of Pernicious
   Polarization,{''} polarization appears to function as a
   relationship-based process that leaders can use for instrumental
   political ends. Polarization depends on whether party leaders react to
   rifts in tribal, non-compromising ways and how the minority responds.
   Consistent with ``Conditional Party Governance{''} theory, party leaders
   can contribute to dysfunctional polarization by encouraging homogeneity
   in their own party and polarity from the opposing party. Drawing on
   policymakers' own words, states vary in whether elite polarization is
   dysfunctional.},

Abstract = {Does co-partisanship with mayors influence citizen trust in local
   governance institutions in new democracies? I answer this question
   through conducting a case study in Tunisia. I evaluate Arab Barometer
   (2018) survey data on trust in local governance institutions, and
   interview data with mayors, council members and civil society
   organizations (CSOs). The results indicate that Tunisians who support
   the same political party as their mayors tend to develop greater levels
   of trust in local governance institutions. Both quantitative evidence
   through a mediation model and qualitative evidence link a substantive
   portion of this relationship to the perceptions of institutional
   performance, such as their degrees of corruption, clientelism,
   inclusivity and efficiency. The findings identify the role and mechanism
   of co-partisanship in shaping trust in local governance institutions
   among the emerging democracies. This contributes to understanding the
   influence of parties in new democracies despite their weaknesses.},

Abstract = {In January 2019, the House of Representatives voted 418-12 to respond to
   widespread bipartisan criticism of the inner workings of the legislative
   branch by creating a Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress.
   This article examines the leadership, participation, and salience of the
   Select Committee by key reform stakeholders, including individual
   members, party factions, leaders, interest groups, and the national
   media that cover Congress. I identify bifurcated participation patterns
   that overrepresent the interests of junior members, party leaders, and
   Democratic Party factions. I also find limited salience of Select
   Committee activities among key stakeholders. The findings raise
   normative and theoretical questions about procedural reform and reveal a
   significant challenge to coalition-building efforts in future sessions
   of Congress.},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {When and how does state interaction in cyber-space result in norm
   development? In this article, we contend that governments take on roles
   vis-a-vis both domestic and foreign audiences, often resulting in
   conflicts between crosscutting internal and external role expectations.
   To alleviate these role conflicts, governments use various secret
   instruments of statecraft that, in turn, shape international norm
   development. We theorize the nexus between domestic and foreign role
   play and secrecy, thereby extending the understanding of role taking in
   international relations to the cyber-space. We argue that whereas the
   role conceptions of autocratic powers China and Russia have been geared
   toward cyber-sovereignty of the regime vis-a-vis internal and external
   others, the United States, as a democratic power, has sought
   cyber-security for both state and non-state actors in the international
   realm. Trying to hide some of their cyber-operations, the interaction
   between China, Russia and the US has resulted in a distinct pattern of
   cyber-proxy use and state-based surveillance interaction that has
   facilitated the stabilization of illiberal cyber-espionage norms and the
   spread of diverging notions of information sovereignty.},

Abstract = {The Hungarian minority is an important element of Slovakia's political
   landscape. For a decade, it was represented in the parliament by
   Most-Hid, an integrationist civic party that mobilized its electorate
   across ethnic boundaries and held a special niche in Slovakia's
   politics. Based on Most-Hid's 2020 campaign messages, this article
   identifies drivers of the integrationist party's electoral failure
   stemming from its having to address the needs of its composite
   interethnic electorate equally and its oversize leadership factor. It
   provides evidence of the increased vulnerability of integrationist
   political groups, addressing deficits in Most-Hid's social embeddedness
   that led to the party's collapse.},

Abstract = {The news media acts as a ``watchdog{''} over political institutions by
   holding them accountable for their actions through critical commentary.
   Being that the Supreme Court rarely interacts directly with the public,
   the news media is the primary mechanism through which individuals become
   aware of the Supreme Court's actions and decisions. Thus, for the
   Supreme Court, the news media's role as a ``watchdog{''} takes greater
   meaning than it does for institutions that often speak directly to the
   public. Considering this, along with the Supreme Court's use of
   strategic presentation, we argue that news media attention to particular
   cases will influence the extent to which the Supreme Court deliberates
   on argued cases. We find support for our hypothesis in four contexts.
   First, cases with more news media attention take longer to produce a
   published opinion. Second, cases with greater media attention are more
   likely to be reargued. Third, cases with more news media attention
   produce a higher number of draft opinions before being published.
   Fourth, cases with more news media attention produce opinions with a
   greater share of cognitive mechanisms included in them. Our results have
   implications for the Justice's use of strategic behavior and the
   potential constraints faced by the Court in its decision-making.},

Abstract = {A solicited response for a forum on Matthew Flisfeder's Algorithmic
   Desire: Toward a New Structuralist Theory of Social Media, organized by
   Yahya Madra, this brief essay considers the book's thesis that social
   media functions as a new symbolic order for digital society, one that
   both ideologically interpellates individuals and provides a metaphor for
   social totality that might galvanize social transformation. The essay
   concludes that this thesis significantly contributes to media studies
   but neglects the psychoanalytic account of digital infrastructures as a
   waning of the symbolic and an elevating of the imaginary. It therefore
   underestimates some political complexities of digital culture.},

Abstract = {From the early 2010s the East Central European countries have developed
   the ``third-generation autocracies{''}. They have introduced these
   autocracies through the ``democracy capture{''} with a large deviation
   from the EU mainstream. Compared to the previous traditional types of
   autocracies the third-generation autocracy has produced radical
   innovations with the parallel developments of the formally democratic
   and informally autocratic forms in the institution-building. They have
   created a democratic facade of the formal-constitutional institutions
   and have also made big efforts for the drastic control of the informal
   institutions, in the media, culture and communication. This paper deals
   with the three stages of autocratization in the last thirty years in
   ECE, and it focuses on the recent stage from the early 2010s in its
   three shorter periods.},

Abstract = {For some years now, it takes hold, both in the academic and political
   realm, the idea-force of strengthening local supply systems as a
   proposal aimed at the transformation of the hegemonic agri-food system.
   This idea recognizes several conceptual and empirical backgrounds, not
   only at the international level but also in Argentina, gaining momentum
   by the end of 2019 within the framework of the programs framed in the
   Plan Argentina against Hunger and other governmental actions. The
   purpose of this article is to trace a conceptual itinerary of the topic,
   as well as to consider some of the instruments implemented during the
   biennium 2020-2021, identifying the potentialities and debates they
   raise.},

Abstract = {The QAnon conspiracy theory has garnered increasing attention as more
   than 80 pro-QAnon congressional candidates vied for nominations in 2020
   primary races. The QAnon movement is widely characterized as ``far
   right{''} and ``growing,{''} but such claims rest on flimsy evidence.
   Using six public opinion polls from 2018 to 2020, we find that support
   for QAnon is both meager and stable across time. QAnon also appears to
   find support among both the political right and left; rather than
   partisan valence, it is the extremity of political orientations that
   relates to QAnon support. Finally, we demonstrate that while QAnon
   supporters are ``extreme,{''} they are not so in the ideological sense.
   Rather, QAnon support is best explained by conspiratorial worldviews,
   dark triad personality traits, and a predisposition toward other
   nonnormative behavior. These findings have implications for the study of
   conspiracy theories and the spread of misinformation and suggest new
   directions for research on political extremism.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the investigation is to improve criminal legislation in
   accordance with international standards in the context of the prevention
   of crimes against humanity in Ukraine. The issue of combating crimes
   against humanity in the twenty-first century was addressed. The
   commission of such crimes violates a number of international conventions
   and treaties, including the Rome Statute of the International Criminal
   Court of 17 July 1998, the Charter of the United Nations of 26 June
   1945, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 10 December 1948, the
   Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
   of 4 November 1950, etc. The methodological basis of the research
   consists of general and special scientific methods of scientific
   knowledge. The conclusions have established that the invasion of the
   territory of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, the use of weapons of
   mass destruction, missiles and machine guns against the civilian
   population is a usurpation not only of the territorial integrity of
   Ukraine, but also of the European values that have been built over
   centuries in response to the experience of war.},

Abstract = {The implications of the persistent gender gap in political knowledge are
   a puzzle that the literature is still disentangling; and research has
   evidenced important differences in the way women and men respond to
   survey questions. We argue in this article that political knowledge
   survey items not only inform about differences in cognition but also
   about other latent traits related to gender stereotyping. Gender
   stereotypes around political knowledge push men to be knowledgeable but
   not so much women, which we expect to affect men and women's survey
   responses differently. To test this expectation, we explore response
   times of do not know answers to political knowledge items. Our results
   show that men, particularly those who declare being interested in
   politics, take longer than women to admit that they do not know the
   answer to political knowledge items.},

Abstract = {The article examines how different appointment mechanisms, namely,
   office selling, impacted the performance of government officials in
   colonial Peru. Results show that entry by sales into the audiencia-a
   high-level institution with provincial oversight duties-worsened local
   governance in at least two ways: first, it led to a surge in the value
   of provincial positions, which capture the (illicit) returns from
   office. Second, it increased the likelihood of spontaneous rebellions
   against colonial authorities. These outcomes are likely driven by the
   type of official entering the audiencia-one less likely to rein in
   provincial officials due to the nature of their social and economic
   connections. The findings imply that the potential for profitable
   complementarities across layers of government can help us understand why
   and when office selling may lead to inefficient outcomes.},

Abstract = {Colombian society has been involved in violent conflicts for more than
   two centuries, a historical continuity of war. This situation
   compromises several social spheres in Colombia included the academy
   because public universities were a violent environment. That is why,
   this article seeks to determine if these violence continue in university
   campuses, taking the Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose Caldas as a
   case study, through an exercise in social cartography and maps. This
   exercise demonstrates different violent behaviors in each campus of the
   University, finding that some of them converge. This exercise is part of
   a research carried out in collaboration with two students of the
   Universidad Distrital developing their degree project in 2020.},

Title = {Why Allow Local Elections? Mobilization, Manipulation, and the Abolition

Abstract = {Local executives in electoral authoritarian regimes can perform
   important regime -sustaining functions, including by delivering votes to
   the ruling party at election-time. Furthermore, when local executives
   are themselves elected, regimes can benefit from improved legitimacy and
   efficiency in local government. Yet elected local executives can create
   principal-agent problems and increase the risk that opposition groups
   gain office. How do authoritarian governments manage this tension? Prior
   research on Russia shows that elections are used to co-opt strong local
   mayors, while weak mayors are replaced with appointed managers. This
   paper argues that strong mayors are more likely to see elections
   canceled if their local machine is not delivering manufactured electoral
   support to the national party, while weak mayors are unlikely to be
   targeted. This hypothesis is supported using data from 207 Russian
   cities, including election -forensic estimates of election manipulation.
   The findings improve our understanding of cooptation of local leaders in
   electoral authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {The National Development Plan (NDP) 2014-2018 ``All for a new
   country{''} had among its objectives to lay the foundations for peace
   building and promote economic development through reforms that would
   generate an increase in the country's income. These reforms, in
   parallel, sought to ensure Colombia's entry into the OECD, known as the
   ``Club of rich coun-tries{''}. Within this framework, peace and
   development became central aspects of the NDP. This article analyzes the
   representations and relationships that were established between these
   concepts, in light of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and how their
   interaction can explain some of the tensions that emerged in the land
   restitution processes in Colombia. In particu-lar, this article analyzes
   the tensions that arise when the right to restitution conflicts with
   policies or actors that were understood as fundamental for the economic
   development of the country in the National Development Plan 2014-2018.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic brought to light the phenomenon of simultaneous
   and widespread activation of different `faces' of citizenship.
   Citizenship as restriction played a major part in enacting
   government-imposed restrictions to mobility and public interactions; and
   citizenship as social protection was essential criteria for the
   allocation of social benefits. At the same time, citizenship also
   inspired radical opposition to governments' impositions and experts'
   opinion; and, citizenship as care reflected the enactment of collective
   identity, forged on principles of reciprocity and mutual aid. This
   article contends the concurrent activation of disparate `faces' of
   citizenship during the pandemic provides an opportunity to consider both
   the distinctive character of each `face' as well as the points of
   dynamic overlap and co-constitution amongst them. Building on studies of
   complex systems, the article argues that how we see citizenship
   influences the types of questions and analysis we set to explore. Using
   the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the article lays out an initial
   approach to seeing citizenship from the vantage point of complex
   integrative thinking. Upholding both the singularity and multiplicity of
   the different `faces', the article engages in preliminary examination of
   both their distinctiveness as well as points of overlap,
   co-constitution, and synergy.},

Abstract = {In Latin America, the Inter-American Development Bank (BID) estimates
   that a third of the worker who were in a company at a given time are not
   in tha same job a year later. High job turnover rates make workers go
   throuh unemployment from one momento to another, which implies loss of
   income and well-being. In this sense, organizations must keep in mind
   strategies to make it posible to generate employment opportunities and
   perspectives for all. In the present investigation, a logistic model is
   carried out to find the factors that determine the intention of labor
   rotation in Mexico. The findings found show that working in an informal
   job and being female increases the probability of labor turnover. On the
   other hand, older age decreases the probability of labor turnover. That
   said, it is necessary to desing a public policy tha allows the female
   gender to have job certainty and decent jobs.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the proposed research is to form conceptual state policy
   foundations of regulating public-private partnerships development of
   countries with economies in transition. The need for substantiation of
   the regulating state policy of public-private partnership development in
   the transition economy and transformation processes has determined the
   topic relevance. The development of theoretical foundations for the
   state policy is based on systemic and institutional methodological
   approaches. There were used the method of comparative analysis,
   statistical analysis, structuring, method of abstraction and
   formalization. It has been determined that insufficient activity of
   countries with economies in transition in the public-private partnership
   projects implementation is due to imperfect legal framework, lack of
   clarity in the distribution of risks between agreement participants,
   political crisis and instability, lack of a unified state policy to
   develop partnerships. The principles of promoting the public-private
   partnership relations in countries with economies in transition have
   been identified, which include the formation of advanced legal
   mechanisms and systems of regulatory bodies, that monitor the
   public-private partnership implementation; stakeholder support by taking
   into account private interests, public authorities and end users;
   careful business partners selection. Basic determinants and a set of
   conceptual requirements for policy formation have been formed.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes some rationalities that come into play in the work
   of scientists to problematize the elements that move their practices in
   the production of knowledge in their own institutions. The article
   starts from analyzing the structures of modernity that impact the work
   of knowledge production, which give an instrumental role to science
   within an economic rationality that prevails over other rationalities.
   Starting from a methodology based on an exercise of problematization and
   from a theoretical-analytical perspective reveals the tensions that
   intellectuals face in two ways: the first is due to the need to be able
   to count on economic and employment stability that leads them to be part
   of a higher education institution or a research center, turning research
   work into a paid activity, which subjects them to a logic of
   economic-bureaucratic rationality. The second one, in turn, derives from
   social demands related to the need to solve problems and provide a
   critical look at social and political issues. This demands an
   ethical-political rationality in scientific work. Among the conclusions,
   one can highlight the need to promote (from within a system that
   operates under an economic-bureaucratic rationality) a new
   ethical-political rationality that may offer scientists the possibility
   of strengthening their social commitment and autonomy.},

Abstract = {As concerns about the spread of political misinformation have mounted,
   scholars have found that fact-checks can reduce the extent to which
   people believe misinformation. Whether this finding extends to social
   media is unclear. Social media is a high-choice environment in which the
   cognitive effort required to separate truth from fiction, individuals'
   penchant for select exposure, and motivated reasoning all may render
   fact-checks ineffective. Furthermore, large social media companies have
   largely refrained from permitting external researchers to administer
   experiments on their platforms. To investigate whether fact-checking can
   rebut misinformation on social media, we administer two experiments on
   large, nationally representative samples using a novel platform designed
   to mimic Facebook's news feed. We observe corrections having large
   effects on factual beliefs (.62 on a five-point scale, p <.001). While
   misinformation degrades accuracy, our results offer strong evidence that
   fact-checks increase accuracy, even when tested on realistic simulations
   of social media platforms.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article was to identify the current status and problems
   of Ukraine's regional associations, and discuss them in the context of
   supranational challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic. Observation, the
   comparative method and the neo- institutional approach were the main
   methodological tools involved. The investigation found that Ukraine
   intends to establish various coalitions, blocs and alliances to develop
   the foreign policy vector. Countries that thrive to be regional actors,
   as well as NATO and EU Member States, engage in this type of
   cooperation. A gradual intensification of the growth of the country's
   regional leadership was revealed through a comparative study of
   Ukraine's cooperation with different countries and their partnerships.
   The authors of the research supported the point of view of adherents to
   the concept that Ukraine is interested in the political discourse of
   regional leadership. It is concluded that expanding the country's
   political and economic opportunities is an appropriate context for
   reforming the Western vectors of Ukraine's foreign policy. It
   demonstrated the great potential of regional partnerships, of which
   Ukraine is a member, to improve democracy.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article was to identify the characteristics of the
   development of Ukraine's social policy in the context of integration
   into EU standards. The historical method was used to perform analysis of
   documentary sources in the temporal context and to investigate the
   genesis of the introduction of social policy and trends towards its
   further development with Europe. The legal method was also used to
   investigate Ukrainian and EU legislation and its application in the
   social field, in order to investigate its gaps, as well as its influence
   on integration processes. By way of conclusion, it was determined that
   the processes of European integration and, more precisely, the
   adaptation of Ukrainian legislation to EU standards in the social field
   played an important role in the development of the country's social
   policy. At the same time, there were differences in terminological
   approaches to key categories of the legislative systems of Ukraine and
   the EU, as well as in separate areas of social policy.},

Abstract = {This article offers a novel account of a key concept in Hannah Arendt's
   political thought: amor mundi. In political theory's ethical turn,
   theorists have increasingly turned to amor mundi as a source of ethical
   guidance and inspiration for politics. However, in doing so, they have
   elided Arendt's distinct understanding of care. This article recovers
   Arendt's understanding of amor mundi as care for the world by
   reconstructing the central concerns of her dissertation, Der
   Liebesbegriff bei Augustin, and tracing them to the ``Crisis{''} essays
   of Between Past and Future. It shows that amor mundi emerges in the
   dissertation as part of a question: if love is our fundamental
   orientation toward the world, how can we love the world without
   instrumentalizing it? The two ``Crisis{''} essays provide the following
   answer: if love is to avoid-and perhaps militate against-the
   instrumentalization of the world, it must take the form of care.
   Following this analysis, this article contends that the contribution of
   amor mundi to the ethical turn is best understood, not as the ethos
   needed to guide action in the political realm, but as a key pre- or
   nonpolitical ethos needed to conserve the world where politics takes
   place-and thus the very possibility of politics.},

Abstract = {The study investigates how Pakistani media discourses represented the
   populist political rhetoric of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) between
   2016 and 2018. Applying the theoretical lens of corpus-based critical
   discourse analysis to a specially constructed corpus, the study examines
   how PTI's populist political rhetoric was co-opted by the media to
   garner public support for it prior to the 2018 elections and then to
   criticize its performance following electoral victory. The selected
   corpus comprised news, articles, and headlines published in English
   newspapers between 2016 and 2018. Based on the analysis, the study
   identifies linguistic devices and strategies in the media discourses
   covering PTI's run-up to the elections and ascent to power. It also
   sheds light on the types of populism exercised by the media in depicting
   political messages to move from promotion of PTI's vision and rhetoric
   to critique of its perceived post-election failure to fulfil its
   promises. Concordance lines and collocation analysis furnish evidence of
   a shift in the media discourses from pre-election optimism and
   ideological valorization of the PTI agenda to failure and loss of hope
   in the PTI government following its assumption of leadership.},

Abstract = {Transformando Mi Futuro (Transforming my Future) is a poverty reduction
   program implemented by the Colombian government as part of the strategy
   to support and repair the victims of the armed conflict. The program is
   based on the graduation approach that implies a comprehensive
   intervention in which the household receives consumption support,
   financial education, asset transfer, technical training, and instruction
   in life skills. However, unlike other graduation programs, this one
   targeted the urban population and did not offer direct transfers. Its
   primary purpose was to build capacities among those households who
   reported wanting to invest their legal monetary compensation as victims
   in productive projects. A before-after approach was employed to evaluate
   this program. The main results highlight positive changes in well-being
   and a reduction in the gap between the current perception of well-being,
   expectations for two and five years in the future, and positive changes
   in labor income and informal savings. These results suggest that the
   program contributed to improve the living conditions of participating
   households. However, a heterogeneity analysis shows that changes are
   differentiated according to participants' initial labor status.},

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUN 13},
Abstract = {For the first year of the Korean War, American troops led the effort to
   halt communist aggression. As the fighting continued, though, the
   members of the South Korean Army assumed control of the majority of the
   sectors on the defensive line by the thirty-eighth parallel. During a
   review of strategic studies publications, it becomes clear that most
   scholars believe only three factors enabled this security transfer to
   succeed. Through a more rigorous analysis of the case, this article will
   demonstrate that other determinants actually played a role in the
   auspicious outcome. If all of the contributing factors are identified,
   current and future policymakers will have an opportunity to see what
   conditions tend to produce useful transfers in conventional conflicts.},

Abstract = {Hosting guest speakers is a common practice among instructors because it
   can yield new insights for students. However, the experience is often
   disappointing. This article refers to guest experts to signal a break
   from the conventional approach, in which guest speakers deliver
   information primarily in a one-directional manner without any engagement
   outside the classroom. Three methods are presented as examples of how
   guest experts can be used differently. First, experts are invited to
   question-and-answer sessions without a lecture component, and students
   are assigned discussant roles. Second, students conduct interviews with
   experts and then use the information that they gather in a debate
   assignment. Third, online breakout rooms are organized so that
   practitioners can work through a key issue directly with students. The
   article draws on conceptual writing on active learning, multiple
   learning genres, reflective learning, and scaffolding to argue that the
   use of guest experts can be redesigned for better impact. By
   encountering experts in different formats, students improve their
   research and communication skills and gain confidence and motivation for
   further study and civic engagement. The advantage of these three
   teaching practices is that they can be selectively added to classrooms
   that bridge in-person and online learning.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the June 2013 protests in Brazil from the
   perspective an analysis of the pattern of capitalist accumulation and
   the reaction of state apparatuses. The premise is that these protests
   are derived from a social malaise in neoliberalism, produced over
   decades of implementation of commodification and financialization
   programs. This malaise was expressed through fragmented claims. When,
   however, the dynamics of protests are observed in the light of the
   actions of the ideological and repressive state apparatuses, a
   polarization is observed between participating actors and movements
   regarding the subject of whether or not to criticize neoliberalism.
   Finally, it is argued that these apparatuses have fixed divergences to
   promote conservative demonstrators and to shield the pattern of
   neoliberal accumulation against dissention. This shielding was
   stabilized by a selective policy of criminalizing the protest's sectors.
   The article's arguments are based on the renewal of Louis Althusser's
   state theory.},

Abstract = {The centuries-old financial structure and the modern financial system
   are built on physical currencies. After the global financial crisis of
   2008-2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, along with the introduction
   of all-new cryptocurrencies and stable coins, even many central banks
   have voiced an interest in the introduction of digital currencies.
   Hence, the pros and cons of the new central bank digital currencies
   (CBDC) are the newest widely discussed topic. This paper focuses on the
   ways a new instrument, central bank digital currency (CBDC),is expected
   to improve the modern payment systems, increase the efficacy of monetary
   policy and ensure financial stability in the new era. The study
   concludes that although CBDCs might boost monetary policy effectiveness
   and financial stability, it is vital to reevaluate and thoroughly
   analyse the geopolitical, geoeconomic, and geostrategic implications and
   effects of having a CBDC.},

Abstract = {This article studies how different systems of policy advice are suited
   to provide relevant knowledge in times of acute crisis. The notion of
   evidence-based policymaking (EBP) originated in the successful 1997 New
   Labour program in the United Kingdom to formulate policy based not on
   ideology but on sound empirical evidence. We provide a brief overview of
   the history of the concept and the current debates around it. We then
   outline the main characteristics of the policy advisory systems in
   Germany, Switzerland, and Italy through which scientific knowledge-in
   the form of either person-bound expertise or evidence generated through
   standard scientific processes-was fed into policy formulation processes
   before the COVID-19 crisis. Whereas EBP takes place in the form of
   institutionalized advisory bodies and draws on expertise rather than on
   evidence in Germany, the system in Switzerland focuses more on the use
   of evidence provided through external mandates. Italy has a hybrid
   politicized expert system. The article then analyzes how this different
   prioritization of expertise vs. evidence in the three countries affects
   policymakers' capacity to include scientific knowledge in policy
   decisions in times of acute crisis. The comparison of the three
   countries implies that countries with policy advisory systems designed
   to use expertise are better placed to incorporate scientific knowledge
   into their decisions in times of acute crisis than are countries with
   policy advisory systems that relied primarily on evidence before the
   COVID-19 crisis.},

Abstract = {This letter studies the impact of past violence and repression on
   current territorial preferences in a contemporary democracy. Does a
   violent past lay the grounds for pro-secessionist preferences, or does
   it lead individuals to cling on to the territorial status quo? We study
   whether exposure to the events of the Spanish Civil War and its
   immediate aftermath made people more or less likely to support Catalan
   secession from Spain. Our analysis employs a dataset that combines a
   large N of individual-level survey data with historical data about
   repression and violence in each Catalan municipality. Findings indicate
   that current preferences for secession tend to diminish among the oldest
   Catalan generation that was exposed to higher levels of violence in
   their municipality. Most crucially, we show that exposure to violence
   created a sense of apathy towards politics among the oldest cohort,
   which eventually leads to a lower predisposition to support secession, a
   feeling that was not transmitted to subsequent generations. Our findings
   qualify some of the existing knowledge on the effects of past political
   violence on present political attitudes.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between exposure to immigration in
   one's region or locality and sense of socio-territorial belonging,
   understood as a ``we-feeling{''} toward other inhabitants of the
   territory. Based on the Russian case, it addresses the question whether
   higher intensity of in-migration is related to weaker sense of belonging
   and how this relationship depends on immigrant origin. Using survey data
   combined with official statistical data, I found a negative relation
   when immigration from non-CIS states is considered, but not in case of
   in-migration from CIS states. I interpret these findings in terms of
   symbolic boundaries and the Soviet legacy.},

Abstract = {While various types of lobbying regulation continue to be devised in
   different political systems in the world, some questions remain relevant
   from both a scientific and practical point of view. How can we define a
   lobbying regulation? What are the principles and the practices that
   should be pursued by a policy of lobbying regulation? And what is the
   lobbyists' stance on this matter? We propose a wider definition of
   lobbying regulation, aiming to overcome the traditional exclusive
   attention to formal pieces of legislation dedicated to lobbyists and
   lobbying activities. We refer to the philosophies of open government and
   deliberative democracy to expand the view on the principles of lobbying
   regulations, pointing out the macro-dimensions that can be encompassed
   for a more fine-grained understanding of lobbying regulations,
   considering not only transparency (as commonly done by most analyses
   thus far), but also the (fair) equality of access of stakeholders to
   policymaking and the public accountability of policymakers. On the
   empirical plan, we test our conceptual framework through an analysis of
   the perspective of the professional lobbying consultancies enrolled in
   the lobbying register of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, using in-depth
   semi-structured video interviews to investigate how such specifically
   relevant players assess lobbying regulation, and what principles and
   rules/institutional practices are most significant in their view,
   finding strong support for measures that aim to pursue the other two
   principles pointed out beyond transparency.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the Erdogan government's policy response to the
   coronavirus pandemic. Despite the abundant use of moral antagonisms in
   his discourse, Erdogan did not attempt to politicize the pandemic,
   instead framing it as a global health crisis and presenting the
   government's public health policies as expert-driven and competent.
   However, this expert-driven approach was largely a performance. Without
   a system of democratic oversight or a free media to scrutinize
   government policies, the Erdogan government could systematically
   undercount COVID-19 cases and disregard its own public health
   restrictions, all the while spreading its narrative of competence and
   success. Competitive policymaking by opposition-controlled
   municipalities and criticism from a strong doctors' association had
   relatively limited ability to discredit the government. The public
   opinion data we present reveal broad-based support for the government's
   COVID policies. Our article highlights how authoritarian institutions
   allow governments to sustain a gap between performance and actuality,
   granting their leaders greater possibilities to claim policy success.},

Abstract = {Rising unemployment, poverty, and xenophobic discourse in politics and
   the media led the Buenos Aires City Government to distance itself from
   Argentine migration policies that have historically favored Europeans.
   This article discusses how the Buenos Aires City Government has
   recreated intercultural policies and cultural tourism entrepreneurism
   that recognizes and emphasizes cultural diversity and pluralism under
   the framework of human rights. It shows how since 2009, the city
   government under former President Mauricio Macri has applied the
   rhetoric of ``pluralism{''} to establish the business of colectividad
   with the year-long festival, Buenos Aires Celebra. This intercultural
   branding program pays tribute to more than 50 colectividades in
   Argentina, increasing the visibility of non-European communities.
   Various stakeholders take part in the Buenos Aires Celebra series, which
   projects an image of inclusivity and diversity. Meanwhile, at a state
   level, the city government with its minimal financial input benefits
   economically and politically.},

Abstract = {American policymakers have been wary of the International Criminal Court
   (ICC) since its founding. United States' opposition is largely due to
   the fear that the ICC might initiate biased investigations that target
   members of the American military scattered across the globe. The recent
   ICC investigation into war crimes committed on Afghanistan's territory
   during the American occupation has produced a new surge of interest in
   this topic. But do ICC investigations, in fact, target America's
   military? Using a global sample of cases the ICC could plausibly
   investigate and data on the locations of all US foreign military
   installations, I examine how the presence of American troops in a
   country affects the likelihood of an ICC investigation. Contrary to the
   common narrative of anti-American bias, the estimated effects of US
   military presence are statistically indistinguishable from zero and
   substantively negligible. These results highlight the need to rethink
   America's combative approach to the ICC.},

Abstract = {The article deals with Russia's strategic approach to the frozen
   conflict in Donbas and the two de facto states it generated, which
   differs from Russia's previous practices. It argues that the ``Trojan
   Horse strategy{''} was tailored explicitly to Donbas due to the
   second-generation nature of the conflict which was driven by Moscow's
   interests in the confrontation with the West. However, when the strategy
   failed and created a stalemate, Russia had to adjust it. This resulted
   in Moscow's recognition of the two people's republics in the Donbas as
   independent, followed by an outright invasion of the rest of Ukraine.},

Abstract = {I kept a detailed diary throughout the Falklands campaign. When I read
   my Falklands diary 40 years on, I do not know the author. That person
   was driven, single-minded and obsessed with winning at all costs, well
   aware of the global and national implications of both success and
   failure. I also carried an 8-mm camera and filmed when I could. In 2015,
   I published this footage with the title, `Commando Engineers in the
   Falklands War: Version II', unedited, except for format and subtitles,
   on YouTube. It was well received. On the voyage home from the conflict,
   on SS Canberra, I instructed my officers and soldiers to write down
   their experiences, which were circulated as an after-action report
   within the Royal Engineers. There was little debriefing on return. The
   implications of what we had learned were daunting and too expensive to
   face. We were very tired. We moved on. The focus remained on the British
   Army of the Rhine. I left the Army in 1993 and moved to the US, where I
   reside today with my family. We are all US citizens. Since retiring in
   2014 after 20 years in business I revisited the Falklands Campaign as a
   lecturer for the US Marine Corps. Like most veterans, my memories and
   views have changed over time, as has my knowledge, not least from
   talking to Argentine veterans and learning from the US Marine Corps.
   This article reflects my views today on my very real experiences 40
   years ago.},

Abstract = {This article addresses second-wave feminist interventions in Canadian
   foreign policy debate with reference to two analytic streams: (1)
   political science and international relations (IR) perspectives since
   the late 1990s that stress the formal decisional aims of advocacy and
   the role of transnational networks in pressuring reluctant governments
   and (2) sociological approaches that underline movements' cultural as
   well as statist dimensions and the significance of their domestic
   political strategies. Examining engagement by the Voice of Women (VOW)
   in nuclear weapons debates and National Action Committee on the Status
   of Women (NAC) in free trade controversies confirms sociological
   expectations of campaigners' varied claims and contributions and the
   importance of their political rootedness in Canada. Consistent with
   political science and IR arguments, the study finds NAC paid growing
   attention to international political opportunities in 1990 and
   following. The conclusion considers implications of the analysis and
   directions for future research.},

Abstract = {This article is based on my experience of commanding the Commando
   Logistic Regiment Royal Marines during the Falklands War. It discusses
   the huge logistic challenge of supporting a divisional-size force over
   8,000 miles from home without air resupply and without air superiority
   over the battlespace. This could not have been achieved without the
   unique organisation and teamwork of the Commando Logistic Regiment Royal
   Marines. It was the key component to provide the Land Force Commander
   with the logistical hub of the operation known as the Beach Support
   Area. I conclude with some lessons from the war, which I believe remain
   relevant today.},

Abstract = {It is one of my regrets that I never kept a diary of events during
   Operation Corporate, not just because it would now be a useful record
   for my family, who, after all, probably suffered more than I did during
   that three-month period, but because it has become increasingly apparent
   that there are many different perspectives on the same event, even when
   they come from those who were there. What follows is, however, based on
   my contemporaneous post-operation report as the Officer Commanding of
   No. 3 Medical Troop of the Medical Squadron, some documentary records -
   which in themselves often conflict - and my first-hand experiences.
   Operation Corporate, like every exercise or operation the military is
   engaged in, is subsequently micro-analysed: what happened; what went
   well or wrong; and what should be learned. Implementing some lessons is
   straightforward, but for others it is not so.},

Abstract = {In yardstick competition, the availability of information pertaining to
   neighbouring jurisdictions is crucial for enabling voters to increase
   political accountability. Using a three-jurisdiction yardstick
   competition model and three measures of incumbent performance, the
   present study shows that politicians in isolated jurisdictions (i.e.
   ones that do not experience media spillover) are more likely to capture
   private rents. In contrast, in a jurisdiction connected to two
   neighbouring jurisdictions (i.e., ones with media spillovers),
   politicians are less likely to engage in rent extraction. An interesting
   finding is that the number of links (media spillovers) has a direct
   influence on status quo bias, namely that the more the voter is exposed
   to yardstick competition, the less status quo bias she exhibits.},

Abstract = {The question of whether campaign contributions buy roll-call votes is
   both important and contentious. Although researchers often find positive
   correlations between the two, it is difficult to conclude that these
   correlations are causal because interest groups may be simply giving to
   their supporters rather than attempting to change members' voting
   behavior. In this paper we use a pair of votes on antisugar subsidy
   amendments to investigate the causal effects of contributions on voting.
   With multiple votes we can control for the supportiveness of the
   district or member by using fixed effects. We find strong evidence that
   changing contribution patterns caused significant changes in the
   probability that a district or member would vote to support the sugar
   industry (i.e., against the amendments). Our results hold in both
   district and incumbent fixed effects models and also when we redefine
   the time window for measuring relevant contributions.},

Title = {Response Decoupling and Partisans' Evaluations of Politicians'
   Transgressions},

Abstract = {There is growing interest in the study of expressive responding in
   public opinion surveys, with scholars seeking to determine whether
   partisan differences in response to survey items attest to genuine
   differences in perceptions or to insincere responses meant to signal
   in-party approval or out-party disapproval. This study focuses on
   partisan gaps in evaluations of the inappropriateness of politicians'
   transgressions and tests the effectiveness of a technique designed to
   reduce expressive responding. This ``response decoupling{''} technique
   gives respondents the opportunity to separate their evaluations of a
   politician's performance from their evaluations of a transgression
   committed by the politician, thereby allowing partisans to both
   disapprove of the transgression and signal support for the politician.
   The technique was experimentally tested in a study in Israel (N = 906)
   and in two pre-registered studies in the US (total N = 3,172), as these
   studies presented respondents with a real-life transgression of an
   actual politician. Overall, the technique had a weak effect, as only in
   the Israeli study was the effect statistically significant. On the
   whole, these results suggest that while partisan gaps in evaluations of
   politicians' transgressions may reflect genuine perceptual differences,
   it may also be the case that allowing respondents to decouple their
   responses is not a sufficiently powerful method to reduce expressive
   responding. The paper concludes by discussing the implications and
   limitations of these findings.},

Abstract = {The scientific and philosophical revolution of the 16th and 17th
   centuries was described by Alexandre Koyre as the passage \&
   DLANGBRAC;from the closed world to the infinite universe \& drangbrac;,
   which meant the unification of the celestial and the terrestrial under
   the same physical-mathematical laws, the conversion of the Earth into a
   planet like any other and the ontological division between the physical
   order and the human order. However, in the 20th century, the human race
   acquired for the first time in its history the power to destroy itself,
   either through nuclear weapons or through a global ecological crisis. At
   the same time, there has been a paradigm shift in the scientific and
   philosophical conception of nature and, in particular, of the Earth as
   the original dwelling place of human beings and other living beings. In
   this article, all these transformations are analyzed through the ideas
   of five very different authors: Husserl, Arendt, Lovelock, Margulis and
   Latour.},

Abstract = {Reinhold Niebuhr was a crucial figure in the cultural and political life
   of the United States. The author, through the discussion of two recent
   books of Giovanni Dessi (Intelligenza e potere, 2021) and Luisa Borghesi
   (Il senso della storia, 2021), reflects on the protestant theologian's
   influence in the American public debate during the twentieth century.
   Niebuhr was a proponent of a wide range of debates on political,
   religious, ethical, and cultural issues with other seminal thinkers
   (American or refugee), including John Dewey, Paul Tillich, Karl Lowith,
   George F. Kennan, Hans J. Morgenthau, and Martin Luther King Jr. By
   discussing the theses of Dessi and Borghesi, the author points out
   Niebuhr's innate ability to be a bridge between the American and
   European traditions.},

Abstract = {This essay reflects on the de-naming of the David Hume Tower at
   Edinburgh University in September 2020. It critically examines and
   contextualises the racist footnote written by Hume, that was the focus
   of calls to remove his name from the building. It argues that an
   opportunity was lost to ask deeper questions about the contribution of
   David Hume to current thought, and why we may want to commemorate
   historical figures, despite their flaws. In short, a `teachable moment'
   was squandered in this event. I conclude by suggesting that such
   symbolic gestures as the de-naming of the David Hume Tower are not
   effective ways to oppose racism.},

Abstract = {Former socialist states made great progress in the institutional set up
   and development of civil societies after the fall of their
   non-democratic regimes. However, the gap in levels of political
   participation between former socialist states and old democracies
   remains. Using two-wave panel data, this study explores how four
   different types of participation are related to each other and whether a
   sense of internal political efficacy is a prerequisite or a product of
   these types of participation. The results imply that facilitation of a
   sense of internal political efficacy is the key for enhancing the level

Abstract = {When analyzing data, researchers are often less interested in the
   parameters of statistical models than in functions of these parameters
   such as predicted values. Here we show that Bayesian simulation with
   Markov-Chain Monte Carlo tools makes it easy to compute these quantities
   of interest with their uncertainty. We illustrate how to produce
   customary and relatively new quantities of interest such as variable
   importance ranking, posterior predictive data, difficult marginal
   effects, and model comparison statistics to allow researchers to report
   more informative results.},

Abstract = {Conversations around criminal legal reform often center around
   prosecutorial discretion. Yet, we know little about how the demographic
   characteristics of prosecutors influence case outcomes and race- and
   sex-based carceral disparities. I investigate this question using an
   original dataset of all county prosecutors in the US in 2001 and 2007
   and find some differences between non-white and female prosecutors and
   white and male prosecutors. Black prosecutors are associated with fewer
   felony closures and convictions, Latinx prosecutors are associated with
   lower Latinx jail populations, and female prosecutors are associated
   with lower female and Black jail populations, lower Black prison
   admissions, and lower jail admissions rates. These findings suggest
   prosecutorial discretion is an important plank of criminal legal reform,
   and increasing the diversity of those offices may act as an important
   and initial step to limit the negative effects of the carceral state on
   particular communities.},

Abstract = {When individuals evaluate policies, they consider both the policy's
   content and its endorsers. In this study, we investigate the conditions
   under which these sometimes competing factors guide preferences. In an
   effort to combat the spread of COVID-19, American President Trump and
   Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau bilaterally agreed to close their shared
   border to refugee claimants and asylum seekers. These ideologically
   opposed leaders endorsing a common policy allows us to test the
   influence of a well-known foreign neighbor on domestic policy
   evaluations. With a large cross-national survey experiment, we first
   find that Canadians and Americans follow ideological positions in
   evaluating the policy, with right-leaning respondents offering the most
   support. With an experiment, we reveal how both populations shift their
   views when told about their neighboring leader's endorsement. Our
   findings highlight ideologically motivated reasoning across an
   international border, with broad implications for understanding how
   individuals weigh a policy's content against its political cues.},

Volume = {93},

Abstract = {Recent welfare reforms in the United Kingdom have redrawn the parameters
   of active labour market policy in a way that brings the employers' role
   to the fore. Universal Credit-the new benefit for working age social
   security recipients-is both an in- and out-of-work benefit.
   Significantly, and without international precedent, this brings workers
   on a low income within the scope of the Department for Work and
   Pensions' conditionality regime (in-work financial support was formerly
   provided through tax credits, without behavioural conditions). While
   conditions are applied to claimants, employer responses to this new
   policy terrain will be central to their outcomes as a new tripartite
   relationship between claimant, employer and the state emerges. However,
   employers and their views on these new expectations have been notably
   absent from both research and policy debates. This article reflects on
   why this is the case and why this is a problem for the development of
   effective in-work support.},

Title = {China's pursuit of international status through negotiated deference: an

Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Italy's controversial decision to sign a Memorandum of Understanding for
   collaboration on the Belt and Road Initiative with China in 2019 has
   been widely debated. This article seeks to break new ground by offering
   a theory-informed contribution investigating the rationale behind
   Beijing's own commitment in the negotiations leading to the signing of
   the BRI MoU. It argues that the Chinese government accepted the risks
   involved in the process for the sake of promoting an accelerated
   advancement in China's positioning in the international status hierarchy
   through negotiation of deference against agency with Italy. The article
   empirically probes the extent to which such a strategy of status
   enhancement on China's part is sustainable over time. Based on a content
   analysis of all China-related political stances expressed in ordinary
   non-legislative policy-setting acts tabled in both Houses of the 18th
   Italian Parliament, from March 2018 through to August 2021, the article
   suggests that China's strategy is hardly sustainable. In fact, the
   steady deterioration of China-related sentiment among Italian Members of
   Parliament as a consequence of Beijing's policies towards Hong Kong, the
   coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak, and Xinjiang matches the
   expectations of previous scholarship on international status as it
   confirms that social closure mechanisms discussed in the literature
   prevail over foreign policy consistency when the status-seeking actor is
   perceived as crossing critical normative thresholds.},

Abstract = {This manuscript analyses the parliamentary scrutiny of the presidential
   appointments to the direction of independent Brazilian Regulatory
   Agencies from an in-depth case study of the heads of the Brazilian
   Health Regulatory Agency-ANVISA, between 1999 and 2021. In Brazil, the
   Senate has the final decision on these appointments, exercising a dual
   function: parliamentary control over presidential patronage and
   selecting future heads of agencies. The objective of this article was to
   explain how the parliament exercises these functions and interferes in
   the appointment process. The results indicate that, although the formal
   process of parliamentary scrutiny seems like a game of marked cards,
   where it is already known in advance that the result will be approval,
   the Parliament plays an anticipatory role of presidential decisions,
   interfering in the timing of appointments and the possibility of
   influence over the choice of nominees.},

Abstract = {Why do modern states regulate and provide mass education? This article
   proposes a theory of education as a state-building tool that is deployed
   when mass violence threatens the state's viability. Experiencing mass
   violence can heighten national elites' anxiety about the masses' moral
   character and raise concerns about the efficacy of repression or
   concessions alone to maintain social order. In this context, a mass
   education system designed to teach obedience can become an attractive
   policy tool to prevent future rebellion and promote long-term order.
   Consistent with the theory, I detect a cross-national pattern of primary
   education expansion following civil wars in Europe and Latin America. In
   a complementary study of the 1859 Chilean civil war, I show that the
   central government responded by expanding primary schooling in rebel
   provinces not as a concession but to teach obedience and respect for
   authority. The theory helps explain why nondemocracies often expanded
   mass education.},

Abstract = {The so-called practice turn in International Relations (IR) has
   established a new paradigm that puts practitioners' quotidian doings
   front and centre of IR theorizing. It is proving to be an influential
   development also for area studies (AS) that share much of IR's
   scholarship and objects of study. This is certainly the case for
   European studies (ES) where the works of International Practice Theory
   (IPT) scholars has greatly contributed to raise attention to situated,
   mundane, and everyday practices of EU institutions. This article reviews
   the contribution of IPT scholars to ES to assess the added value of this
   research agenda and its potential to become a `trading zone' where IR
   and ES/AS scholars can advance understanding of how the local and the
   global connect. It also identifies two challenges that have not been
   adequately addressed in the extant literature: (I) finding ways to
   theorize and empirically observe the transition from the level of
   situated practices to EU-wide doings (generalization challenge); and (2)
   assessing the exact role of interaction in structuring and transforming
   both the global and the local (challenge of relationism). The article
   ends by calling for a global practice theory as a way to tackle these
   two challenges.},

Abstract = {This rejoinder focuses on two issues discussed in Samuel Mercer's review
   of Ana C. Dinerstein and Frederick Harry Pitts's book A World beyond
   Work? Labour, Money and the Capitalist State between Crisis and Utopia.
   The first concerns the authors' alleged defense of concrete labor
   against abstract labor; the second concerns the accusation of humanism.
   First, the rejoinder clarifies the authors' understanding of concrete
   and abstract labor as dialectically intertwined, and also the
   implications of this for class struggle in and against the ``play of
   mediation{''} between the two. Second, the rejoinder pleads guilty to
   the charge of humanism in how the authors approach work and alienation.
   The authors argue that the related criticism is based in the idea of an
   ``epistemological break{''} in Marx's work, but they situate their work
   in a countervailing reading of Marx that sees a humanist core and
   continuity characterizing both Marx's ``early{''} conceptualization of
   alienation and estrangement and his later conceptualization of real
   abstraction in the critique of political economy.},

Abstract = {This article engages with Meg Russell and Ruxandra Serban's (2021)
   argument that the Westminster model is `a concept stretched beyond
   repair' that deserves `to be retired'. We examine the logic, theory and
   methods that led to such a powerful, potent and provocative argument. We
   suggest their approach may have inadvertently `muddied' an already
   muddled concept. We assess the implications of `muddying' for their
   conclusion that the Westminster model is, in essence, a dead concept in
   need of a decent funeral. We suggest the concept is `stretched but not
   snapped' by developing a simple four-perspective broadening of the
   analytical lens. This approach aids understanding about what the concept
   covers, how it is operationalized and why it remains useful in
   comparative research.},

Abstract = {Recent discussions of accountability in contexts of expert knowledge
   raise questions about the limits of transparency. Against this
   background, we discuss the nexus between expert knowledge and meaningful
   accountability - that is, context-sensitive accountability based on a
   genuine understanding of a situation. We argue that the concentration of
   expertise in certain institutions makes it difficult to hold those
   institutions accountable. In particular, three components challenge
   meaningful accountability: specialization, inaccessibility and potential
   biases or conflict of interest. We emphasize the role of `epistemic
   communities' and their impact on the tension between expert knowledge
   and independence. Drawing on the deliberative systems literature, we
   discuss how expert knowledge might be communicated to outsiders to
   enable meaningful accountability. To illustrate our argument, we draw on
   the European Central Bank, a case study in which states have chosen a
   delegation design characterized by a high degree of independence and
   trust in expert knowledge, to the detriment of accountability. We sketch
   possible avenues for creating the conditions for meaningful
   accountability even in the case of institutions with highly concentrated
   expertise.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this research note we document changes to the rate of comments,
   shares, and reactions on local Republican Facebook pages. Near the end
   of 2018, local Republican parties started to see a much higher degree of
   interactions on their posts compared to local Democratic parties. We
   show how this increase in engagement was unique to Facebook and happened
   across a range of over a thousand local parties. In addition, we use a
   changepoint model to identify when the change happened and find it lines
   up with reported information about the change in Facebook's algorithm in
   2018. We conclude that it seems possible that changes in how Facebook
   rated content led to a doubling of the total shares of local Republican
   party posts compared to local Democratic party posts in the first half
   of 2019 even though Democratic parties posted more often during this
   period. Regardless of Facebook's motivations, their decision to change
   the algorithm might have given local Republican parties greater reach to
   connect with citizens and shape political realities for Americans. The
   fact that private companies can so easily control the political
   information flow for millions of Americans raises clear questions for
   the state of democracy.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Volume = {84},
Number = {2},
Pages = {714-724},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Compulsory voting involves a legal obligation to vote (or attend the
   polls), but we might instead require those who do not to pay a charge,
   without any legal obligation for them to do so. This nonpunitive price
   creates an incentive for all citizens to participate and prevents free
   riding, but permits nonvoting and avoids condemning nonvoters. Thus,
   this proposal delivers what at least some advocates and opponents of
   compulsory voting want. Moreover, considering this possibility helps to
   clarify the disagreement over compulsory voting. Those who wish to
   reject this proposal need further arguments for their respective
   positions.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to approach the principle of interterritorial
   solidarity by means of a comparative study of its legal, doctrinal and
   case law configuration. In doing so, the objective is to highlight the
   importance of articulating the principle in an effective way in
   supranational integrations. To this end, it analyses how the principle
   has been shaped in the main integrations of the five continents. It also
   argues for the need to articulate it in its economic manifestation in
   order to cope with the onslaught of globalization. Finally, it
   elucidates why solidarity mechanisms have only been successfully
   implemented in the European Union.},

Title = {Counterimagination and the Plurality of Radical Politics},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 APR 1},
Abstract = {This paper considers the role imagination plays in radical politics,
   resistance, and political expression. Contemporary political theory
   shows that political imagination is an important resource for dominated
   groups because it holds possibilities for radical transformation. This
   paper goes beyond the existing literature's focus on public, visible,
   and emancipatory instantiations of political imagination. It shows that
   political imagination has forms that are nonpublic and quotidian and
   that these must be attended to alongside public instantiations of
   imagination. Political imagination often moves iteratively between
   categories of public, private, intersubjective, and personal, and it is
   frequently invited by shared objects. My account of political
   imagination also attends equally to the ways that political imagination
   can foster relations of domination and to how it can be mobilized by
   marginalized groups for radically transformative purposes. I offer a
   concept of ``counterimagination{''} to illuminate the multiplicity of
   ways that imagination can be transformative for political life.
   Counterimagination is a nonpublic form of political imagination levied
   by marginalized groups that holds possibilities for transformation both
   for the subject and for the wider political order.},

   Intergenerational Burden},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected global social and economic
   activities. While German economic output has declined dramatically, the
   German federal government's reactions to the direct and indirect effects
   of the pandemic have resulted in an unprecedented public deficit.
   Leading politicians urge repaying the debts induced by the pandemic, as
   this rather myopic fiscal policy raises questions regarding fiscal
   sustainability. This study analyses policymakers who are designing
   amortisation solutions; employing the method of generational accounting
   provides fundamental insights into the effects of diverse amortisation
   scenarios on intergenerational burden sharing. The results demonstrate
   that current and future generations are unequally burdened depending on
   the period, instrument and amortisation target. These findings indicate
   that a long-term amortisation process initiated promptly after the
   COVID-19 crisis is crucial for intergenerational equity.},

Number = {1},

Abstract = {Despite the integral role of the judiciary to democracy, and the
   importance of judicial trust for judicial system performance, we know
   relatively little about the bases of public trust in this institution.
   How does institutional quality affect judicial trust? We explore this
   question in the context of Latin America, using a multilevel data set
   comprising survey data spanning 2001 to 2016 and country-level
   institutional and economic factors. We find that the effects of
   institutional quality on judicial trust are highly circumscribed.
   Factors like rule of law and corruption impact the judicial trust of
   only the best-educated survey respondents. Among the broader public,
   however, judicial trust is shaped more strongly by individuals'
   subjective economic and regime evaluations, as well as one's personal
   experiences with the judiciary.},

Abstract = {A standard assumption in realistic threat theories is that the presence
   of ethnic minorities is associated with a rise of anti-immigrant
   sentiments. However, we do not know whether this presence has a specific
   local effect, or whether one can detect a more general nationwide
   perception of threat. Using data from a recent Belgian population
   survey, we assess the association between ethnic diversity within the
   local community and anti-immigrant sentiments. Results suggest a strong
   negative association between the level of ethnic diversity and
   anti-immigrant sentiments. Furthermore, while we do not find evidence
   for an association between ethnic diversity and radical right voting on
   the individual level, there is a strong negative correlation on the
   aggregate level. We conclude with some speculation about how
   anti-immigrant sentiments are created in areas with a very low levels of
   ethnic diversity, and what this implies for the electoral potential of
   radical-right parties.},

Abstract = {Resume En reponse a l'invasion de l'Ukraine par Poutine, l'Occident a
   riposte par un ensemble de sanctions sans precedent par leur ampleur.
   Pourtant, dans les semaines qui ont suivi, il y a eu peu d'indices d'une
   reaction interieure contre la guerre de Poutine. En m'appuyant sur les
   recherches existantes sur la survie des regimes autoritaires en cas de
   sanctions economiques, je montre qu'en depit de leur cout economique
   devastateur, les sanctions n'ont guere contribue a destabiliser le
   regime de Poutine ou a le pousser a retirer ses troupes d'Ukraine. La
   cle de la comprehension reside dans la prise en compte de la structure
   des incitations des groupes d'individus qui composent le cercle
   restreint de Poutine.
   In response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the West imposed a package
   of unprecedented sanctions that has failed to generate meaningful
   domestic backlash against Putin's war. Leveraging extant research on the
   survival of authoritarian regimes under economic sanctions, I show that
   their devastating economic costs notwithstanding, sanctions are unlikely
   to destabilize Putin's regime or pressure him to withdraw his troops
   from Ukraine. The key to explaining this outcome is to zero in on the
   incentive structure of the groups of individuals that make up Putin's
   inner circle.},

Abstract = {Driven by financialization and rising demand for credit, household
   sector debt in OECD countries has risen sharply. We argue that this rise
   in private debt has become a significant driver of inequality because
   access to, and the terms of, credit vary by the risk of default, which
   is closely tied to income. The effect is magnified by a trove of new
   data that allow lenders to more accurately assess individual risks,
   thereby linking interest rates more closely to the underlying risk
   distribution. This inequalizing logic is conditioned by social transfers
   and by government regulation of financial markets. We test our model
   with data on mortgage interest rates and access to credit, using the
   government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (FM/FM) in the United
   States (resulting in regulatory change) and the Hartz-IV reform in
   Germany (resulting in changes to social transfers) as exogenous changes
   in important parameters of our model.},

Abstract = {This article conducts a case study of the Alternative for Germany (AfD)
   to explore the link between ideology and climate change scepticism.
   Employing qualitative data analysis on a sample of texts from the
   party's membership magazine, this article studies the AfD's climate
   change communications. The goal is twofold: (1) to explore which frames
   are used by the most visible sceptic voice in Germany; (2) to
   investigate how sceptic frames reflect the AfD's populist radical right
   ideology. Overall, the findings reveal that the AfD frequently connects
   its climate change scepticism to its host ideologies, especially radical
   right-wing and free-market ideology. Accordingly, climate change
   mitigation policies are often attacked because they are claimed to harm
   Germany's national interest or economy. In contrast, populism does not
   play a prominent role. That is the case despite the AfD frequently
   talking of people-centrism, and the `core people' appear to be at the
   heart of its framing strategy.},

Abstract = {This research note investigates how mainstream party strategies affect
   the success of radical right parties (RRPs). It is a widespread view
   that mainstream party accommodation of radical right core issue
   positions would reduce the radical right's success. Empirical evidence
   for this claim, however, remains inconclusive. Using party level data as
   well as micro-level voter transitions between mainstream and RRPs, we
   re-evaluate the effectiveness of accommodative strategies and also test
   whether they work contingent on specific conditions, e.g., the newness
   of radical right challengers or the existence of a cordon sanitaire. We
   do not find any evidence that accommodative strategies reduce radical
   right support. If anything, our results suggest that they lead to more
   voters defecting to the radical right. Our findings have important
   implications for the study of multi-party competition as they challenge
   what has become a core assumption of this literature: that accommodative
   strategies reduce niche party success.},

Abstract = {Territorial conflicts are a significant feature of politics in Spain.
   The two most recent such processes are the cessation of violence by the
   terrorist group ETA and the pro-independence process in Catalonia. Both
   processes are likely to have affected the perception of intergroup
   threats, thus influencing the dynamics of intergroup conflict. This
   article embeds intergroup phenomena in a real context and applies theory
   to factual conflicts. Using data from two countrywide surveys run in
   1994 and 2019, and by means of multivariate regression models, we
   analyze the role of socio-demographic, political, and cultural factors
   in the change of intergroup attitudes in Spain. Furthermore, we isolate
   non-political changes in society by matching between the populations of
   both surveys. We find that attitudes between the Basque national
   minority and the rest of Spain improved after the end of terrorism.
   Attitudes towards Catalonia do not show an association with the surge of
   the pro-independence movement, but attitudes from Catalans towards the
   rest of Spain worsened.},

Abstract = {People presumably strive to maximize their own benefit whenever
   possible, so it is puzzling when they vote for leaders who may not have
   their best interest at heart. We tested whether support for a political
   leader is diminished when supporters learn they are financially
   disadvantaged by the leader's policies. In a two-stage experiment (Time
   1 n = 601, Time 2 n = 343) with pre-registered hypotheses, Trump voters
   predicted their expected tax refund (or payment), and then reported
   their tax outcome immediately after the filing deadline. Afterwards, we
   confronted half of the participants with the discrepancy between their
   actual and predicted tax outcome. Having lower-than-expected tax
   outcomes was not associated with reduced support for Trump either on its
   own, or in combination with being reminded of this outcome. However, it
   led participants who were dissatisfied with their tax outcome to
   downgrade the importance of lowering taxes, possibly in an effort to
   reduce dissonance and justify continued support for Trump. Subjective
   tax outcome satisfaction did predict Trump support, but was dwarfed in
   magnitude by other variables such as system justification and political
   orientation. Thus, people may find ways to rationalize information that
   goes against their self-interest into their partisan world-view.},

Abstract = {There is emerging understanding in the literature that voters who have a
   migration background across Western countries tend to vote for left
   leaning parties. Yet little is known about whether this implies
   different drivers of vote choice for citizens with migration background
   in comparison to natives. This article intends to respond to this
   question by studying the impact of specific policy issue considerations
   on the vote of citizens with both migration and non-migration
   background. To do so, we focus on the 2015 and 2019 Swiss National
   elections, relying on data from the SELECTS post-electoral studies. Our
   analyses show that, while Swiss natives' voting choices are consistently
   affected by key political issues (i.e., foreigners' job market
   integration and the environment respectively), non-native voters are
   generally less driven by the main topics discussed at each election,
   although relevant differences emerge across different migrant
   backgrounds.},

   tendencies one observed during the 1990s and early 2000s, as well as
   reflecting the position of the academic community at the time (e.g.
   {[}Bale, T. (2003). Cinderella and Her ugly sisters: The mainstream and
   extreme right in Europe's bipolarising party systems. West European
   Politics, 26(3), 67-90; Muller, W., \& Fallend, F. (2004). Changing
   patterns of party competition in Austria: From multipolar to bipolar
   system. West European Politics, 27(5), 801-835]), Peter Mair had a clear
   prediction: the future of party politics would be bipolar. Using the Who
   Governs Europe dataset {[}Casal Bertoa, F., \& Enyedi, Z. (2021a). Party
   system closure: Party alliances, government alternatives, and democracy
   in Europe. Oxford: Oxford University Press], the article examines the
   validity of Mair's predictions. Notwithstanding certain exceptions (e.g.
   Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Serbia), the article demonstrates that the
   tendency towards increasingly bipolarised party politics has failed to
   materialise. Next to the description of empirical patterns the article
   provides suggestions on how to improve our conceptual apparatus of party
   system analysis.},

Abstract = {This article examines selected system-level variables. Its premise is
   that a better understanding of how and why scholars may, or may not,
   choose an international orientation in their career requires taking into
   account factors beyond personal preferences or constraints. We suggest
   that characteristics of national systems shape prospects and strategies
   of internationalisation and look at two broadly defined variables:
   resource availability and career incentives. With respect to the first,
   we study the absolute level of national resources and their relative
   importance vies-a-vis those provided by the EU. With respect to the
   second, we consider the rules and norms governing the progress of
   academic careers, especially the extent to which international
   collaboration is significant and necessary for initially attaining a
   stable academic position and career advancement. We explore these
   questions through targeted comparison of four national cases, selected
   to ensure crosscutting variation across the selected variables. A
   comparison of two relatively low-resource cases (Bulgaria and the Czech
   Republic) with two relatively high-resource ones (France and Finland) is
   followed by a comparison with respect to career incentives. This allows
   to conclude that both factors should be considered as necessary
   conditions for internationalisation, and to suggest how this hypothesis
   might be further tested in subsequent research.},

Title = {Beyond lobbying: the political determinants of adopting corporate social

Abstract = {This paper explores the role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as
   an element in a corporation's political action repertoire. Previous
   research has studied lobbying and CSR as a distinct means by which
   corporations seek to manage their non-market environment. Analyzing CSR
   as a political activity, we argue that corporations engage in CSR for
   the same reasons that prompt them to engage in lobbying. More
   specifically, we expect corporations to adopt CSR frameworks that are
   suitable to enhance their reputation in a given political arena. To
   evaluate this argument, we analyze the lobbying and CSR behavior in the
   EU and USA of over 2000 corporations from around the world. Our results
   show that lobbying and adopting CSR frameworks can be predicted by
   similar empirical models. Moreover, controlling for common predictors
   and endogeneity, lobbying in the EU is associated with an increased
   likelihood of a corporation adopting an appropriate CSR framework.
   However, corporations that lobby in Washington DC become less likely to
   engage in CSR the more they spend on lobbying. These findings shed new
   light on the relationship between lobbying and CSR while highlighting
   important differences in corporate non-market behavior across political
   arenas.},

Abstract = {The common-market project, that after World War II aimed to prevent
   future wars among European Nations, evolved through crises into a
   complicated and unstable set of European Union policies and
   institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine reinforced
   coordination and added common debt issuance to the supranational policy
   toolkit. But the NextGenEU program relies heavily on government
   subsidies rather than on market incentives, and Russia's invasion of
   Ukraine shows that economic integration can at most move the boundaries
   of war to those of the integrated economic area, rather than of Nations.
   These developments weaken the crucial role of integrated markets as the
   principal instrument for growth, cohesion, stability, and peace in
   Europe.},

Abstract = {Media, and in recent years social media, are a space for political
   confrontation that generate a framework for the interpretation of
   democracy and affections. Their consumption directly affects citizens
   attitudes, reinforcing previous beliefs and building both a cognitive
   and emotional framing. From this viewpoint, emotions are constructed and
   circulate socially within the framework of political communication. The
   objective of this article is to investigate the extent to which and the
   conditions under which media and social media determine citizens'
   emotions towards the different political actors in Spain. To this aim, a
   analysis has been carried out using the Post-Election Survey for the
   November 2019 General Elections. As main results, it is shown that
   citizens who consume political information in Spain through any type of
   media present a more active emotional profile, with a greater presence
   of negative emotions than positive ones and, with a greater intensity of
   aversion on the internet. Moreover, the different supports have their
   own characteristics, highlighting the activation of enthusiasm towards
   left-wing parties on television and a generalization of negative
   emotions towards all formations and candidates on social media,
   especially on Twitter.},

Abstract = {The work presents contributions of Jose Carlos Mariategui to the
   decolonization of Marxism. It explains its tense character between the
   effort of heroic creation of an Indo-American Socialism and dominant
   tendencies in Marxism. His Philosophy of the Revolution and the central
   referentiality in popular praxis stand out, fundamentally in the
   indigenous one. It presents a series of themes in which this
   ``germinal{''} Mariateguian contribution is evidenced, which questions
   and proposes in the face of Eurocentric tendencies of Marxism.},

Abstract = {This paper estimates the differential between wages in the private and
   the public sectors using the difference-in-differences method. The
   method relies on estimating the wage changes of those that move from one
   sector to the other, that is, from the public sector to the private
   sector or from the private sector to the public sector. We find that the
   wages fall by 6-12\% between years for those that move from the private
   sector to the public sector in either 2015 or 2016, while wages increase
   by 7-10\% between years when moving from the public sector to the
   private sector in either 2015 or 2016.},

   An analysis of their role after Bouteflika's resignation in Algeria},

Abstract = {President Bouteflika's resignation in April 2019, in response to large
   public demonstrations, opened a democratic window of opportunity for
   regime change in Algeria. Nevertheless, despite widespread disaffection
   with the regime, opposition parties have been incapable of triggering a
   democratic transition in Algeria. The military took control of the
   situation and imposed its own roadmap to put an end to the political
   crisis, pushing for presidential elections in December 2019. The elected
   president, Tebboune, a former prime minister under Bouteflika's
   presidency, introduced a constitutional amendment in 2020 and called for
   parliamentary elections to be held on June 12th, 2021. This article
   analyzes the political stances and actions by the Algerian political
   parties regarding these political processes that were intended to be the
   foundations of the new republic. The case study of the Algerian crisis
   contributes to the theories on democratization and authoritarian
   resilience. It does so by showing that, even under favourable conditions
   of intense social pressure for democratic change and widespread
   disaffection with the authoritarian regime, political parties cannot be
   a democratizing agent if: (1) the opposition remains divided; (2) the
   parties do not build broad opposition alliances, not only between
   parties but also with civil society; and (3) the political regime
   retains the support of a number of loyal political parties.},

Abstract = {Although there is much literature on populism and its causes, Michael
   Sandel's particular contribution to this field of study has received
   little attention so far. The purpose of this essay is to explain what
   Sandel adds to the status questionis on the causes of populism, and to
   evaluate the remedy that follows from his analysis. We argue that
   Sandel's earlier works incorporate aspects of the Durkheimian mass
   society thesis, as they emphasize how the public discontent with liberal
   individualism stimulates populist sentiments. Sandel's later works,
   however, are more similar to the Downsian economic thesis, as he therein
   focusses on the role of markets, meritocracy and globalization
   processes. We end by analysing Sandel's republican approach as an
   alternative solution to the rise of populism.},

Abstract = {Recent work on American presidential elections suggests that voters
   engage in anticipatory balancing, which occurs when voters split their
   ticket in order to moderate collective policy outcomes by forcing
   agreement among institutions controlled by opposing parties. We use the
   2021 Georgia U.S. Senate runoffs, which determined whether Democrats
   would have unified control of the federal government given preceding
   November victories by President-elect Biden and House Democrats, to
   evaluate support for anticipatory balancing. Leveraging an original
   survey of Georgia voters, we find no evidence of balancing within the
   general electorate and among partisans across differing model
   specifications. We use qualitative content analysis of voter electoral
   runoff intentions to support our findings and contextualize the lack of
   evidence for balancing withan original analysis showing the
   unprecedented partisan nature of contemporary Senate elections since
   direct-election began in 1914.},

Abstract = {This article utilizes role theory to examine UK MPs' conceptions of the
   roles of the UK and the EU. Employing the House of Commons debates on
   the notification of withdrawal from the EU in early 2017, or the Brexit
   bill, this study outlines the multiple roles each actor possesses
   according to British parliamentarians. Organized according to the
   positions of whether the politicians supported leave and remain, rather
   than on how they voted, the findings are organized into role
   contestations based on three faultlines. The first is a clash between
   global and regional UK roles revealing identity-based discord over the
   post-Brexit vision of its international relations. The second is popular
   versus parliamentary invocations of national sovereignty which echo the
   struggle between pluralist and elite configurations of sovereignty and
   democracy. The last is whether the EU functions as a materialist
   realist-bound power or an ideational norm-creating power.},

Abstract = {Leadership ranking exercises, which have a storied history in the United
   States, have recently gained a foothold in Westminster democracies. In
   2020, the author conducted a major survey of Australian political
   scientists and historians to gauge their opinion of the leadership
   performance of the nation's past prime ministers. Read in tandem with
   the results of earlier surveys, particularly that conducted out of
   Monash University in 2010, the 2020 rankings indicate that expert
   opinion about who have been Australia's most successful prime ministers
   is largely settled. The 2020 results also suggest that the experts
   believe that the policy legacy of a leader is a more important indicator
   of prime-ministerial success than is the longevity of office.},

Abstract = {Pro-Palestine activism in the Arab world has historically been one of
   the few tolerated avenues for political expression. Such activism is not
   an innocuous display of humanitarian concern for the plight of
   Palestinians, but rather a major driver of opposition to
   authoritarianism - particularly in highly repressive environments. In
   this article, I argue that pro-Palestine activism in the region has
   three impacts: 1) introducing activists in their formative years to the
   idea of political agency, 2) providing a space to engage in
   citizenship-building practices, and 3) generating spillover effects in
   the personal development of activists as well as in civil society more
   broadly. Using the case of Qatar and relying on 2 years of ethnographic
   fieldwork and interviews, I show how pro-Palestine activism consistently
   generated discussions and demands not only on the issue of Palestine,
   but on the idea of representative foreign policy, democratic
   decision-making, and the future of authoritarianism in Qatar, as well as
   in neighbouring Arab states. This sort of activism often goes
   unrecognized in the literature as a major driver of opposition, but is a
   crucial factor in our understanding of when and why dissent emerges in
   the region, even in environments when traditional civil society is
   nonexistent.},

Abstract = {Though the US presidency literature widely examines how Congress limits
   executive power, recent discourse argues the public is the more
   effective restraint. This paper develops a theory explaining when
   inter-institutional relations and public constraints influence the
   alteration of unilateral directives. Both are important for curbing
   substantial policy changes that likely provoke congressional and public
   response. Using data on when executive orders are amended and revoked
   between 1955 and 2013 to measure policy shifts, I find orders are less
   likely to be altered under presidents facing oppositional or cohesive
   congresses and high public disapproval. Both types of constraints are
   strongest for large policy changes, that is, revocations or targeting
   ideologically distant orders. This study advances the unilateralism
   literature by examining interactions between multiple constraints and
   degrees of policy change, while also contributing to studies of policy
   duration.},

Abstract = {The Irish party system has been exceptional both for the weakness of its
   left-right conflict and for its long-run stability. How then can party
   competition on policy, and particularly competition between the main
   parties, be characterised? This study examines the Irish party system
   from an issue competition perspective, examining the party system agenda
   and asking whether Irish party competition is marked by differences in
   issue focus. New data from Irish party manifestos (1981-2020) coded
   within the framework of the Comparative Agendas Project show that rather
   than competing by focusing on different issues, Fianna Fail and Fine
   Gael's issue focus is very similar and has moved in parallel over time.
   Nor is a distinct focus on new issues evident in Sinn Fein's offering as
   they have emerged as a major party. Moreover, it finds that `new
   politics' issues have remained marginal and it examines how this has
   occurred using the `crucial case' of environmental policy. While
   differences in issue focus do not help us to distinguish the main
   parties, the politics of competence continues to have an important role
   and positional politics may be coming to the fore.},

Abstract = {Turning to Valerie Solanas, the second wave writer famous for shooting
   Andy Warhol, this paper reconstructs a forgotten argument for the
   feminist use of violence. In the SCUM Manifesto, Solanas calls for women
   to commit gendercide against men to build a feminist utopia. Solanas
   rejects separatism because it cedes the world to men, instead arguing
   that women must use violence to reclaim and change the world. Solanas
   thus sees violence as a world-making project. During the second wave,
   Solanas' shooting of Warhol fractured feminism into liberal and radical
   camps: liberals rejected Solanas, and radicals embraced her. Both sides
   of the feminist divide, however, turned away from violence as a
   political tactic. Even sympathetic radicals adopted separatist agendas
   that sanctioned violence only for the purpose of self-defense. I argue
   that the reaction to Solanas by her contemporaries, and the erasure of
   her from history, is symptomatic of a feminist allergy to violence.
   Returning to Solanas' work and life raises once again the question that
   remains suppressed in feminist thought: is violence a justifiable means
   to achieve feminist ends?},

Abstract = {This study attempts to compare previous maritime issues between China
   and neighboring countries, including the ongoing cooperation between
   Beijing and ASEAN countries in Southeast Asia. This paper suggests that
   the promotion of the Maritime Silk Road Initiative (MSRI) can mitigate
   relevant maritime militarized interstate disputes in the region.
   Creating coordinated foreign policy and sharing information could help
   prevent conflict, as scholarly research has demonstrated. The empirical
   findings of this study also help identify the crucial elements that
   determine how China can improve its maritime policies under the MSRI,
   with a special focus on the case of the Philippines, which has
   experienced the most continuous friction over maritime boundaries with
   China.},

Abstract = {For years, the Colombian state maintained its position about how the
   guerrillas' involvement with drug trafficking has made them lose their
   political and/or ideological nature. Political and military sectors
   supported this approach and used the term narco-guerrilla or
   narco-terrorists. The peace process initiated in 2012 during the Santos
   administration seemed to alter this narrative. This article analyzes how
   Colombia's peace process had a contradictory effect on the
   `narco-terrorist' characterization of the FARC-EP: it opened windows of
   opportunity both for more peace-prone discourses and for an even more
   virulent version of the criminalization of the guerrillas.},

Abstract = {A narrow information diet may be partly to blame for the growing
   political divides in the United States, suggesting exposure to
   dissimilar views as a remedy. These efforts, however, could be
   counterproductive, exacerbating attitude and affective polarization. Yet
   findings on whether such boomerang effect exists are mixed and the
   consequences of dissimilar exposure on other important outcomes remain
   unexplored. To contribute to this debate, we rely on a preregistered
   longitudinal experimental design combining participants' survey
   self-reports and their behavioral browsing data, in which one should
   observe boomerang effects. We incentivized liberals to read political
   articles on extreme conservative outlets (Breitbart, The American
   Spectator, and The Blaze) and conservatives to read extreme left-leaning
   sites (Mother Jones, Democracy Now, and The Nation). We maximize
   ecological validity by embedding the treatment in a larger project that
   tracks over time changes in online exposure and attitudes. We explored
   the effects on attitude and affective polarization, as well as on
   perceptions of the political system, support for democratic principles,
   and personal well-being. Overall we find little evidence of boomerang
   effects.},

Abstract = {The notion of the criminalization of the state is paradoxical. On the
   one hand, the idea that `absolute power corrupts absolutely' might shed
   light on the potentially criminal behaviour of state-officials. On the
   other, the assumption that legal rules are general and anonymous, that
   they apply identically to everybody (and that allows defining these
   elites as criminals), is in its contemporary form linked to the
   bureaucratic rule of the state itself. In this commentary on the
   contributions to this special issue, I address this and other paradoxes
   of the state with regard to the relation between politics and
   criminality.},

Abstract = {This report analyses the subnational elections in Uruguay in 2020. The
   main findings show an important consolidation of the right-wing parties,
   particularly the Partido Nacional, both at the second and third level of
   government (departments and municipalities respectively). This electoral
   power is reflected in three events. Firstly, the victory claimed by such
   party in 15 out of the country's 19 departmental governments, with cases
   in which electoral competition tends to be very low. A decreased
   electoral volatility between national and departmental elections is also
   associated with such power. Finally, there is the clear victory of the
   Partido Nacional at the municipal level, where it has managed to be
   elected in 90 out of the 125 local governments. In a country with one of
   the most consolidated democracies in the region, this paper raises the
   issue about the lack of competitiveness at the subnational level in
   several territories of the country.},

Abstract = {Scholars have argued that racial policy beliefs contributed to a decline
   in public trust among white-Americans, but this effect waned over time
   as racial policies left the agenda. We theorize that beliefs about
   racial policies may have been integrated into whites' racial attitudes,
   resulting in a durable association between racial prejudice and public
   trust. Our analysis of eight ANES surveys (1992-2020) shows that racial
   prejudice, measured in terms of anti-Black stereotypes, informs white
   Americans' beliefs about the trustworthiness of the federal government.
   LDV models strengthen our contention by showing that the relationship
   persists after an LDV is included and it is not reciprocal.},

Abstract = {How do minor states protect themselves against coercion from their major
   power allies? Asymmetric security cooperation is often reduced to
   tradeoffs between security and autonomy, but coercion is another factor
   that minor states fear while cooperating. Coercing partner states can
   take the form of major powers threatening or undertaking regime change,
   and minor states must weigh the benefits of cooperation against this
   risk. To this end, I suggest that minor states with anti-major power
   political oppositions cooperate more extensively with their major power
   partners than minor states with pro-major power oppositions. A pro-major
   power opposition provides opportunities for major powers to threaten or
   replace the incumbent regime; therefore, such minor states limit their
   cooperation out of fear of coercion. I employ original data on
   opposition characteristics to present evidence from security relations
   between the United States and 65 minor states during 1950-1991 to
   support the hypothesis.},

   cross-cut the formal-informal distinction. Analyzing survey data from
   four Latin American capital cities, we find, not surprisingly, that both
   work-based atomization and insecurity depress demand making in the work
   arena. But these traits of work also affect demand making on the state,
   albeit in somewhat different ways. Insecurity is associated with a shift
   from productionist to consumptionist and political demands, while
   atomization is associated with a more generalized demobilization across
   issues. These findings have implications for the representation of
   worker interests in light of current labor market restructuring and
   raise the question if labor can reclaim an important voice in that
   restructuring process.},

Abstract = {Environmental and climate policy has become an important issue in party
   competition in Germany in recent years, and it is easy to observe the
   significant role that specific issues and problems play in the
   competition for votes within this policy area. In this article, we
   demonstrate for the first time how the method of discourse network
   analysis can be used to analyse such issue competitions. Discourse
   network analysis combines qualitative content analysis of media reports
   with methods of social network analysis and thus allows to follow and
   compare the dynamics of an issue competition and the interaction of
   parties in detail over exact time windows. We demonstrate this potential
   using the example of issue competition in Bavarian environmental
   politics in 2018 and 2019. We place a particular focus on the mainstream
   party CSU, which in the 2018 state election campaign was still trying to
   lure away voters from the AfD with pronounced migration policy demands.
   A year later, on the contrary, Prime Minister and party leader Markus
   Soder, ignited a whole ``firework{''} of environmental and climate
   policy proposals. How did this reorientation of the discourse come
   about? Using newspaper articles from the Suddeutsche Zeitung and
   comparing three discourse periods, we show how the salience of
   environmental policy changed over the course of the discourse. The
   extremely successful petition for a referendum ``Save the Bees{''}
   played a decisive role in this process, as a result of which the
   environmental policy discourse intensified and diversified
   significantly. Our analysis shows that because of this dynamic, and the
   threat posed by the electoral successes of the Greens, the CSU felt
   compelled to enter into a competition with the Greens for the issue
   ownership of green issues.},

Abstract = {Building on the proposal for a `culturally sensitive' framework of
   resilience, this article explores the construction of resilience at an
   individual and community level. Through the lens of sport, we explore
   the relational nature of resilience and its relationship to ideas of
   morality and community well-being. Using interviews and focus groups
   conducted across northern Uganda 2018-2020, we engage youth perspectives
   on resilience or restoration (roco). We emphasise the gendered
   dimensions that shape different stakeholder's understandings of the
   concept and that, in this context, the pursuit of a community-affirmed
   vision of resilience or good surroundings (piny maber) reinforces
   pre-existing inequalities.},

Abstract = {This article will explore the origins and afterlife of the Explorers'
   Memorial in Fremantle, Western Australia. Raised to commemorate the
   ``murder{''} of white pioneers in the 1860s, the monument issued an
   explicit denial of Indigenous sovereignty and exonerated white violence
   on the frontier. In an instance of dialogical memorialization, an
   additional plaque was placed on the monument. It outlines the history of
   provocation that led to the explorers' deaths, acknowledges the right of
   Aboriginal people to defend their lands and commemorates those who died
   during the invasion of their country. The article will draw on community
   memory as well as white archival accounts. It will reveal the spaces
   counter-memorialization might offer for alternative readings of the past
   and explore the monument's transition from a symbol of racism and
   division to a platform for what is generally known in Australia as
   truth-telling and reconciliation.},

Abstract = {Focussing on a number of events during the month of March 2021, this
   article illustrates the enduring presence of misogynistic attitudes
   across criminal justice institutions, which leads to discriminatory
   practice and unjust outcomes for women. In particular, it focusses on
   the events following the high-profile disappearance and murder of Sarah
   Everard, the growing awareness of police perpetrated abuse, the collapse
   in rape prosecutions and the unwillingness of the courts to hold the
   Crown Prosecution Service accountable. The article references the
   Domestic Abuse Bill in the final stages of its parliamentary journey and
   what was missing from it. Concluding with a detailed exploration of how
   the small number of women who kill their violent partners are frequently
   convicted of murder, illustrated by a detailed case study of Emma-Jayne
   Magson. How women who kill are treated in the criminal justice system is
   a microcosmic illustration of misogyny in the criminal justice system.},

Title = {Entrenching Privilege: A Critical Discourse Analysis of Afriforum Jeug
   During the \#Mustfall Protests at the University of Pretoria: A Case
   Study},
Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The \#FMF protests at the University of Pretoria (UP) and universities
   across South Africa reflected a confrontation with power and an
   exhibition of distrust in democratic institutions. \#Fallists
   consciously chose to challenge pre-determined notions of `the right to
   education' and the pervasiveness of gatekeeping and access. These were
   questions intricately linked with their past. On all campuses, including
   UP, the \#Fallists encountered many challenges. At UP, students who had
   affiliated themselves with the AfriForum Jeug student society contested
   very specifically the `rights' that the \#Fallists were demanding. This
   paper involves a modest attempt at formulating the possibilities that
   have been opened up by considering the \#MustFall events in light of the
   responses by white Afrikaans speaking students. In this case study, one
   of the challenges faced by the \#Fallists at UP was the opposition they
   encountered from AfriForum Jeug. How was this tug-o-war to be read and
   understood? The AfriForum case study is particularly relevant since it
   has been significantly argued that a dominant motivation and rationale
   for participation in the \#MustFall protests included a pushback against
   persistent inequality and racism.},

Abstract = {Militant democracy calls for pre-emptive measures against political
   actors who use democratic institutions to undermine or outright abolish
   a democratic political system. Born in the context of interwar fascism,
   militant democracy has recently been revived by political and legal
   theorists concerned about the rise of authoritarian right-wing
   populists. A long-standing charge against militant democracy-also
   articulated with renewed force in our era-is that, as a top-down way to
   deal with the intolerant, militant democracy is inherently elitist and
   bears uncomfortable similarities with technocracy (also understood as an
   intolerant form of governance). But while it is true that militant
   democracy relies on state institutions to preserve democracy, it by no
   means excludes citizen engagement: ``courts or the people{''} is a false
   choice. On the other hand, citizens engaged in militant democracy must
   take on the difficult task of distinguishing very clearly between
   democratic essentials under threat and political questions about which
   citizens might reasonably disagree. While citizen assemblies are not the
   answer to all of contemporary democracies' travails, they might be very
   helpful in clarifying such distinctions for wide audiences.},

Abstract = {This paper explains the configuration of the political scenario in
   Ecuador after the 2021 general elections. The pandemic left a
   challenging economic and social after-math that created policy
   challenges for the new government. Guillermo Lasso won the elections
   securing support from the anticorre??smo front. However, this electoral
   coalition did not translate into the legislative arena. Lasso addressed
   policy chal-lenges using political strategies widely used in Ecuador by
   minority governments during the nineties. We focus on Lasso???s attempts
   to push economic reforms to show how his legislative strategy adapted to
   the prevailing political conditions, namely: 1) aimed for less ambitious
   policy goals; 2) used his institutional prerog-atives to shape the
   legislative agenda; and, 3) crafted short-lived and informal agreements
   in exchange for (political) pork. Complex executive-legislative
   rela-tions can limit the government???s ability to address economic and
   social problems in the future, which could lead to political and
   economic instability, as in the past. De facto coalitions are necessary
   for Lasso yet come at a cost for a government quickly losing support. We
   also provide an overview of other social problems and policy responses
   relevant throughout this year.},

Abstract = {Nigeria has continued to experience the menace of Boko Haram insurgency
   over the years. While some progress has been made over the years in
   curbing the activities of the insurgency in some quarters, the unabated
   violence against women and its implication on women and girls remain
   unresolved. As a pointer to the need for a deliberate and focused
   attention on violence against women and girls due to Boko Haram
   insurgency in Nigeria, this paper, through the review of relevant
   literature, explores the activities of the insurgency and violence
   against women. This paper further investigates the implication of
   violence against women and the social structure as whole. The paper
   concludes by making recommendation on how the menace of Boko Haram
   insurgency can be addressed in order to address gender violence against
   women and crime against womanhood.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Emmanuel Macron's electoral victory and the rise of his political
   subject La Republique en Marche, led to significant changes at the level
   of French party politics in recent decades. This new political entity
   has taken the dominant position of the presidential majority, implying
   the disintegration of the bipolar ``cartel{''} of the Socialist Party
   and the Republicans in the National Assembly. In addition to the
   fundamental recalculation of power relations through the election
   outcomes, it has resulted in a major reversal at the level of the
   classical party forces - left and right block, so that the structure
   criteria of the former party system were significantly violated. In this
   paper, we provide a more analytical view of which poles formed the party
   system of the 5th French Republic. We argue that the typical bipolar
   configuration in the form of the dominant left and right polarity has
   not existed from the first moment. We carry out a reconstruction of the
   main poles of the French party system through seat distribution by the
   individual political groups in the legislature. The key argument of our
   article is that the structural impact of the Macronist party's electoral
   success has led to one of the most significant transformations of the
   party system's polarity: the return of the political centre as the
   dominant pole and the shift from bipolarity to tripolarity. Regarding
   the sustainability of the new party reconfiguration, we conclude with
   several scenarios of further development.},

Abstract = {Through the analysis of collected information during the field work,
   this article studies the processes that have affected two subregions of
   southern Tolima in central Colombia. The cases of Planadas and the
   Tolima Triangle are studied as scenarios of the violence of the armed
   conflict since the mid-20th century, involving guerrillas, the state and
   paramilitaries. Its inhabitants are peasants and indigenous people hit
   by poverty and marginality. From a perspective on disputed
   territorialities, several processes are analyzed. First, the
   territorialities of the armed actors and the processes related to the
   armed conflict are studied, in territories under the control of the FARC
   guerrillas and some where the paramilitary challenge has arisen. Second,
   the territorialities of the regional and local authorities are studied,
   including the point of view of the department's elites, who have sought
   political control of the region seen as potential to promote
   ``development{''} projects. Third, the territorialities of local
   communities are analyzed, which in Planadas includes the creation of
   coffee associations, and in the Tolima Triangle they involve
   agroecological projects from mainly indigenous communities, which resist
   the expansion of the rice agribusiness. In the region there are
   interactions between marginality, violence, logics of development, in
   the midst of differentiated levels of peace building.},

Abstract = {The rise of new players - neoconservatives - to the leading positions in
   the Republican Party and American politics on the whole during the years
   of Ronald Reagan's presidency spurred a reaction from far-right
   in-tellectuals, who united in a movement called ``paleoconservatism{''}.
   Although this movement was not able to secure any important victories in
   the political field, its representatives made a significant contribution
   to the revival of the republican ideological tradition, having produced
   a rich intellectual legacy, which still remains relatively understudied.
   The article attempts to partially fill this gap by reconstructing the
   paleoconservative identity on the basis of the methodology of social
   constructivism. Searching for an answer to the ques-tion of who
   paleoconservatives are, the authors analyze the ideals and guide-lines
   put forward by paleoconservatives as well as the set of principles they
   oppose.
   The conducted research shows that the identity of paleoconservatives
   includes two components. Its ``positive{''} component is based on the
   partial identification with the agenda that the American right defended
   in the 1930s-1950s, and its ``negative{''} component is based on
   opposing themselves to neo-conservatives and right-wing mainstream.
   According to the authors' conclu-sion, paleoconservatism, being aimed at
   undermining the tacit consensus that developed in the United States
   between the center-right and center-left elites, de facto represents a
   struggle to define the essence of the American conservatism. Positioning
   true conservatism as anti-liberal, anti-(social)-democratic,
   anti-egalitarian, and anti-statist, paleoconservatives reject more
   moderate right-wing movements as blurring the boundaries of the
   conservative identity.},

Title = {The autonomy of urban commons' reproduction in relation to the local

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {In the post-Marxist debate, commons have emerged as a means to develop
   an autonomous path of emancipation from capitalism. However, the extent
   to which commons can construct this emancipation autonomously from the
   state is unclear. By focusing its analysis on the city-wide scale, this
   article examines the extent to which urban commons are materially
   supported by the local state, the criteria used by the local state in
   offering its support, and how urban commons perceive it and its claims.
   The research study is set in Barcelona and presents the results of 101
   responses to a survey carried out with 429 urban commons. It shows that
   many urban commons are able to reproduce thanks to the economic and
   property support of the local state, that the local state often
   allocates resources by exercising its discretionary power, and that many
   urban commons tend not to recognise this support. It concludes by
   putting forward two main arguments: i) a distinction should be made
   between material and decision-making autonomy; ii) although urban
   commons should pursue their material and decision-making autonomy from
   the state, the material support they receive from the local state can
   become a temporary survival strategy for them.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2022},
Number = {6},
Pages = {67-80},
Abstract = {The active development of military artificial intelligence technologies
   brings the moment of the mass deployment of lethal autonomous weapons
   systems (LAWS) closer. There is no internationally recognized definition
   of LAWS, and this has led to terminological disputes behind which are
   hidden both military-technical and ethical-philosophical problems. The
   task of keeping control over autonomous weapon systems is complex, and
   must be addressed in interdisciplinary ways, simultaneously in several
   dimensions, considering operational issues, moral and ethical dilemmas,
   and legal collisions. All three types of considerations focus on the
   problems of meaningful human control and the attribution of
   responsibility for the application of LAWS. The problem of
   fictitiousness of nominal human control over complex technical systems
   using opaque functioning algorithms is analysed. Developers of the new
   weapons are resisting the creation of adapted regulations, claiming that
   existing international humanitarian law is enough to regulate the new
   field, making it difficult to impose additional restrictions on LAWS.
   Existing agreements to control the proliferation of technology are in
   fact only partially capable of serving as a tool for controlling LAWS.
   It was noted that in the case of LAWS, a powerful impetus is possible
   for the development of a special direction in arms control related to
   the legal aspects of attribution of responsibility for the misuse of
   weapons systems, which was not previously observed in the corpus of the
   international legal framework for arms control. In the context of the
   collapse of the post-Cold War arms control system, only certain concrete
   measures related to commitments to prevent the most destabilizing
   manifestations of LAWS (for example, equipping them with nuclear
   weapons) can be proposed in the short- and medium-term.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Why do states intervene in elections abroad? This article argues that
   outsiders intervene when the main domestic contenders for office adopt
   policy positions that differ from the point of view of the outside
   power. It refers to the split between the government's and opposition's
   positions as policy polarization. Polarization between domestic
   political forces, rather than the degree of unfriendliness of the
   government in office, attracts two types of interventions: process (for
   or against democracy) and candidate (for or against the government)
   interventions. The study uses a novel, original data set to track local
   contenders' policy positions. It shows that the new policy polarization
   measurement outperforms a number of available alternatives when it comes
   to explaining process and candidate interventions. The authors use this
   measurement to explain the behavior of the United States as an
   intervener in elections from 1945 to 2012. The United States is more
   likely to support the opposition, and the democratic process abroad, if
   a pro-US opposition is facing an anti-US government. It is more likely
   to support the government, and undermine the democratic process abroad,
   if a pro-US government is facing an anti-US opposition. The article also
   presents the results for all interveners, confirming the results from
   the US case.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the role of community bonds in the long-term
   transmission of political values. At the end of World War II, Poland's
   borders shifted westward, and the population from the historical region
   of Galicia (now partly in Ukraine) was displaced to the territory that
   Poland acquired from Germany. In a quasi-random process, some migrants
   settled in their new villages as a majority group, preserving communal
   ties, while others ended up in the minority. The study leverages this
   natural experiment of history by surveying the descendants of these
   Galician migrants. The research design provides an important empirical
   test of the theorized effect of communities on long-term value
   transmission, which separates the influence of family and community as
   two competing and complementary mechanisms. The study finds that
   respondents in Galicia-majority settlements are now more likely to
   embrace values associated with Austrian imperial rule and are more
   similar to respondents whose families avoided displacement.},

Abstract = {Discussions regarding the conduct of scientific inquiry have existed
   throughout history. Questions of how to uncover the truth and achieve
   reliable and valid scientific conclusions, all under the umbrella of
   objectivity, have led the sciences to evolve in a systematic manner.
   Hitherto, the general leniency within this conversation has been
   directed at the hard sciences; however, the Social Sciences have also
   recently been on the receiving end of paradigmatic shifts in
   methodologies. Since the behavioral revolution, the conduct of many
   disciplines under the Social Sciences has slowly moved towards a more
   quantitative outlook on the path of uncovering social phenomena. Such an
   alteration in methodology has its benefits as well as certain handicaps
   when dealing with abstract social concepts and notions which are
   difficult to quantify. This is especially the case for the discipline of
   International Relations (IR), where data are of both a qualitative and
   quantitative nature. Thus, the aims of this study are threefold: first,
   the study will present a brief summary of the historical and scientific
   evolution of methods in the discipline of IR; secondly, it will describe
   the current situation in which scientific inquiry is conducted, focusing
   on mixed method approaches; and third, it will deal with the different
   methodological approaches of MM designs established above by
   highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, particularly in the
   discipline of IR. Hence, this study aims to contribute both to the
   literatures of the disciplines of IR and of methodology in Social
   Sciences.},

Title = {GLOBAL CLIMATE CRISIS AND NEOLIBERAL CAPITALISM: PHILOSOPHICAL
   PERSPECTIVE},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {8-48},
Abstract = {Anthropocene, as scholars generally label the current era of human
   civilization, represents an environment in which the society, globally
   operating within the framework of neoliberal capitalism, is confronted
   with the global climate crisis. Consequently, the fundamental
   existential assumptions of the current economic-political system and
   global civilization are at stake. The paper aims to outline the
   philosophical background, threats and challenges of political philosophy
   in the anthropocene era; a philosophy, which is nevertheless able to
   reflect the relationship between global capitalism and the global
   environmental crisis in the 21st century. The study is constructed from
   post-Marxist, neo-Gramscian and neo-Malthusian political-philosophical
   positions and, in general, from the perspective of environmental
   alarmism, which is critical to established social, economic and
   political systems in terms of their long-term sustainability. We use the
   analytical method, and critical and normative-ontological approach in
   the study. We defend the hypothesis that the global environmental crisis
   and the probable global climate collapse cannot be sustainably solved
   within the logic of the established global economic system and its
   structural conditions. Therefore, global capitalism is unsustainable in
   the long run in all three of its components: environmental, social, and
   economic.},

Title = {An Ontology Towards Predicting Terrorism Events},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CYBER WARFARE AND TERRORISM},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Although there is an increasing amount of information for
   counter-terrorism operations freely available online, it is a complex
   process to extract relevant information and to detect useful patterns in
   the data in order for intelligence functionaries to identify threats and
   to predict possible terror attacks. Automation is required for
   intelligent decision-making. To assist with this, in this paper, the
   researchers propose an ontology-based data access system for
   counter-terrorism. The system will enable intelligence analysts to
   perform specialised semantic searches about terrorist events or groups
   for analysis using an ontology. In this paper, the researchers present
   the ontology that was created by following an existing methodology for
   ontology development, and an ontology-based data access system together
   with all the components used in development (i.e., databases,
   web-scraper tools, ontology-based data access software, and data
   sources). Lastly, the ontology is demonstrated by means of use cases
   with example queries for generating actionable intelligence for
   operations.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Pages = {84-94},
Abstract = {While interest in illiberalism has increased in recent years, the study
   of the connections between anti-gender discourse and transnational
   dissemination is a more recent scholarly endeavour. Emerging feminist
   scholarship has helped to move beyond national cases of illiberalism to
   understand how the gendered nature of illiberalism is revealed through
   its ability to cross borders and, in recent years, to become a movement
   with a transnational character. This article examines the evolution of
   the political discourse on gender in Romania and proposes a three-stage
   framework leading from gender traditionalism to a more pronounced
   illiberal discourse. The article examines whether the recent rise of the
   political party Alliance for the Union of Romanians (Alianta pentru
   Unirea Romaniei, AUR) represents a new step towards an established
   political illiberal discourse in Romania. The official public addresses
   of AUR are analysed to show how the terminology and themes identified as
   cornerstones of illiberalism (e.g., anti-gender, traditional family,
   opposition to reproductive rights, education, and anti-LGBTQ) are
   incorporated into its rhetoric.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study was to substantiate strategic directions to
   overcome the asymmetry of regional development. The methodological basis
   involved a systemic approach that allowed, in turn, a holistic approach
   to clarify the linkages and patterns of regional development asymmetry
   and justify strategic measures to overcome it. In the results, it was
   found that the region's development strategy is a set of interrelated
   measures aimed at ensuring the principles of sustainable development,
   improving the quality of life, creating conditions for economic growth,
   ensuring the efficient use of resources, improving regional
   self-sufficiency, economic security and competitiveness of the region.
   It is argued that the region's development strategies should be based
   on: a) associative approach to the formation of goals and tools to
   achieve them; b) efficiency in the use of resources; c) participation of
   a wide range of stakeholders in the substantiation of strategic
   development directions; d) overall coordination of planning and control
   processes for the achievement of the set objectives. It is concluded
   that it is proven that the strategic directions of overcoming the
   asymmetry of regional development must be led by strategic thinking.},

Journal = {ICELANDIC REVIEW OF POLITICS \& ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Pages = {165-188},
Abstract = {In this paper, we analyse whether mock elections in Iceland are
   fulfilling their intended purpose of increasing young voters'
   participation in politics and other types of political engagement. Mock
   elections have been carried out in Icelan-dic upper secondary schools
   prior to parliamentary elections since 2016 (and prior to the municipal
   elections in 2018), but there is no peer-reviewed research about whether
   these elections are followed by an increase in political participa-tion
   and engagement amongst young people. Socialisation is a key factor in
   encouraging political participation amongst young voters as the
   formative years between childhood and adulthood are a key period in
   forming behaviour and political attitudes. In this paper, we argue that
   mock elections have a socialisa-tion impact in terms of increasing young
   people's political awareness and en-gagement, including electoral
   participation. Based on the results from a survey sent to four upper
   secondary schools in Iceland, two where mock elections were held and two
   where they were not held, we found that mock elections have a negligible
   link to participation in real elections, whether voting made a
   difference or whether it was considered a civic duty to vote. Other main
   results are that in schools with mock elections, students were more
   politically engaged in terms of how interested they were in politics and
   the frequency which they discussed politics, both of which have been
   shown to increase the probability of voter turnout.},

Abstract = {The article identifies theoretical and applied problems of the use of
   criminal analysis in the investigation of criminal offenses. The main
   characteristics, components and types of criminal analysis are
   highlighted. The positive experience of the American model of criminal
   analysis is studied. The peculiarities of the use of criminal analysis
   in the territory of Ukraine are clarified, the prospects of legalization
   of its results are determined, as well as active implementation at the
   national level to enhance the fight against organized criminal activity.
   With the help of general philosophical and special scientific methods,
   the prospects of analytical support of criminal proceedings during
   pre-trial investigation are examined, proposals are made on active
   implementation and effective use of methods and results of criminal
   analysis in criminal procedural evidence. It is concluded that an
   effective way to analytically obtain information about the suspect's
   contacts, his probable connections and other entities having an interest
   of operational and investigative units of Ukrainian law enforcement
   agencies is to use the method of telephone connections analysis during
   pre-trial investigation of criminal offences.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {308-322},
Abstract = {In recent years. autistic-coded characters have become a common staple
   in sitcoms. This paper will examine depictions of autistic-coded
   characters in two such sitcoms: CBS's The Big Bang Theory (Big Bang).
   and NBC's Community. Sheldon on Big Bang is stereotyped and mistreated
   by his friends, while Abed on Community challenges stereotypes and is
   beloved The different treatment of autistic characters stems from the
   responses of the shows' writers to the fear of accidentally
   misrepresenting autism, with the crew of Big Bang choosing to avoid the
   label of autism, while Community embraced it and did research to better
   represent autistic people. This difference has a huge impact on
   audiences watching the shows. Seeing Sheldon's friends belittling him
   because of his autistic-coded traits triggers shame in autistic viewers,
   while also validating ableist thought patterns in neurotypical viewers.
   In Community, however. seeing Abed's confidence in his autistic
   embodiment serves to boost the confidence of autistic viewers, while his
   friends' and classmates' love and support of him serves as a model for
   neurotypical viewers of how to best interact with autistic people in the
   real world The case of these two shows illustrates two important facts
   about autistic representation in media: failing to diagnose a character
   does not exempt a writer from ableist representations. and to avoid this
   ableism it is important to listen to audience feedback and do research
   to properly understand the characters from the perspective of the
   communities they stand for.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain the evolution of forms of political
   regulation for the allocation of resources and representation of
   interests in Southern Italy, at length qualified as clientelistic. It
   will show how managerial principles can be taken up in a context with a
   historical resistance to bureaucratic change as well as a political
   orientation which contests neoliberal beliefs. To this end, it analyses
   a sequence of political change in the Apulia region, while focusing on
   the political strategies and discourses concerning local development
   tools for entrepreneurs. It shows how the objective to increase the
   regional council's institutional capacity to deliver public policies
   turned into a managerial drift. It is argued that the critique of
   clientelism, considered the main factor hindering the development of the
   South, led to the prioritisation of efficiency over representation of
   collective interests. The critique of clientelism corresponds to the
   mechanism through which managerialism has spread in a context of
   economic crisis.},

Abstract = {In mid-March 2022, the International Court of Justice ruled that Russia
   must end its attack on Ukraine. The court followed arguments presented
   by Ukraine, which stated that Russia's allegations of genocide in the
   Donbas were unfounded and, accordingly, the military operation based on
   those allegations was contrary to international law. This decision is
   binding under international law. However, only the United Nations
   Security Council, where Russia has a veto, can decide on coercive
   measures to enforce the ruling.},

Abstract = {Given the lack of express constitutional regulation on the regime of

   makes the Statutes of Autonomy to carry out the delimitation of the

   Statutes is not enough so that, through their reform, the creation of a
   new Autonomous Community is carried out from the integration of other
   pre-existing ones.},

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This investigation stems from the need to better comprehend the
   digitalisation of the Iberian parties and, especially, to understand the
   lack of scientific knowledge surrounding the digitalisation of political
   actors in Portugal. The principal objective of this investigation is the
   betterment of knowledge of the factors that intervene in the
   digitalisation of political parties. Taking various theoretical premises
   into account, we will analyse the relation between the age of the
   parties, the ideology and the stability of the party system, and the
   adoption of digital instruments for the purposes of contact,
   participation, deliberation, and mobilisation of financial resources
   between political parties with parliamentary representation in Portugal
   and Spain. To answer these questions the investigation used a data
   matrix taken from six qualitative variables applied to each of the
   analysed political parties. The results show a tendency towards a
   greater level of digitalisation in political parties located on the left
   of the ideological spectrum that were founded after the year 2008.
   Furthermore, the stability of the party system and a lower competitive
   capacity could partially explain the lower level of digitalisation in
   political parties in Portugal.},

Pages = {197-217},
Abstract = {This article provides an overview of the emerging field of American
   political economy (APE). Methodologically eclectic, this field seeks to
   understand the interaction of markets and government in America's
   unequal and polarized polity. Though situated within American politics
   research, APE draws from comparative political economy to develop a
   broad approach that departs from the American politics mainstream in two
   main ways. First, APE focuses on the interaction of markets and
   governance, a peripheral concern in much American politics research.
   Second, it invokes a theoretical orientation attentive to what we call
   meta politics-the processes of institution shaping, agenda setting, and
   venue shopping that unfold before and alongside the more visible
   processes of mass politics that figure so centrally in American politics
   research. These substantive and theoretical differences expand the study
   of American politics into neglected yet vital domains, generating fresh
   insights into the United States' distinctive mix of capitalism and
   democracy.},

Abstract = {We combine deed-level data on homeownership with administrative data on
   voter turnout in local and national elections for more than 18 million
   individuals in Ohio and North Carolina. Using a
   difference-in-differences design, we find that buying a home leads
   individuals to participate substantially more in local elections, on
   average. We also collect data on local ballot initiatives, and we find
   that the homeowner turnout boost is almost twice as large in times and
   places where zoning issues are on the ballot. In addition, the effect of
   homeownership increases with the price of the home purchase, suggesting
   that asset investment may be an important mechanism for the

   economic circumstances importantly influence political beliefs and
   behavior and suggest that homeowners have special influence in American
   politics in part because their ownership motivates them to pay attention

Abstract = {Do the class backgrounds of legislators shape their views and actions
   relating to inequality and economic policy? Building on findings about
   `white-collar government' in the US, this article examines the
   relationship between legislators' class and their attitudes and
   self-reported behaviour in advanced democracies, drawing on survey data
   from 15 countries including 73 national and subnational parliaments in
   Europe and Israel. I find that legislators from business backgrounds are
   more likely to support income inequality and small government, as well
   as less likely to consult with labour groups, than those from
   working-class and other backgrounds. These results are buttressed by
   analysis of an additional cross-national survey of European legislative
   candidates' attitudes, which replicates key findings. Given the skewed
   class makeup of legislatures in advanced democracies, these findings may
   be relevant to our understanding of widespread economic and political
   inequalities that are increasingly salient in many countries.},

Abstract = {The current Russian-Ukrainian war is more than just a border problem or
   contest over territory, although both aspects are essential to it. The
   conflict has roots in ideology and psychology as well as in history,
   including the experience of the population of the Soviet Union during
   the Great Patriotic War and also the break-up of the USSR at the end of
   the Cold War. The traumatic effects of those earlier events are being
   compounded by the physical and psychological damage caused by the
   Russian invasion of Ukraine. The continuing violence there requires of
   the international community careful management. Two kinds of responses
   are in order: geopolitical strategy, in the form of ``containment{''}
   (including self-containment by Ukraine), and diplomatic therapy,
   expressed in empathetic contact at the leadership level and in
   compassionate services provided to the people caught up in the conflict
   (including the refugees driven from it). The potential spread of the
   fighting in ``East Europe,{''} as Halford Mackinder advised in 1919,
   could affect the equilibrium of the ``World-Island,{''} and ultimately
   the ``World.{''} Writing in 2014 at the time of the Crimean crisis,
   Henry Kissinger, with a focus on what the eventual outcome of the
   Russia-Ukraine conflict might be, could imagine the result being, in
   political and territorial terms, the ``balanced dissatisfaction{''} of
   both parties. That is an ``end{''} a retrenched Russia and a resilient
   Ukraine, with international managerial help, might be able to achieve.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {31-61},
Abstract = {The polarisation in the Swiss party system increased in the last three
   decades. Party competition led individual parties to find instruments to
   strengthen party unity at the national level. Because of the unification
   at the national level it is important to study election party
   programmes. The main goal of the article was to investigate in what
   respect have these changes affected party election programmes. We
   compared contemporary programmatic positions of relevant political
   parties in the Swiss lower house which succeeded with more than 4 \% of
   votes in the 2015 parliamentary elections. The findings of our detailed
   content analysis of the party programmes in predetermined categories
   (A-E) pointed to a growing level of polarisation on the right-left axis.
   We argued that the election programmes reflect the level of
   polarisation. We succeeded to set the parties on the right-left axis.
   There is no party we located in the exact centre of the spectrum
   according to their programme. The left part of the scale is more
   polarised than the right, the Green party (GPS) is located on the very
   end of the left part of the right-left axis, the Social democratic party
   (SP) and the Green liberals (GLP) are on the moderate left. FDP, BDP and
   CVP are according our study located on the right part of the spectrum.
   SVP was located almost on the very end of the right part of the
   spectrum. Our research concludes that the level of polarisation of
   current Swiss party system is high.},

Abstract = {Where do armed conflicts occur? In applied studies, we may take ad hoc
   approaches to answer this question. In some regression studies, for
   instance, a single conflict event can cause an entire province to be
   classified as a conflict zone. In this paper, I fill this void of
   knowledge by developing a machine learning method that is less dependent
   on the areal-unit assumptions and can flexibly estimate conflict zones.
   I apply the method to a conflict event dataset and create a new dataset
   of conflict zones. A replication of Daskin and Pringle (2018, Nature
   553, 328-332) with the new dataset indicates that the effect of civil
   war on mammal populations is much smaller than the original estimate.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research is devoted to studying the legal nature of
   legal relations in the process of implementing state tax policy. The
   main content. Considered is the normative framework which forms the
   basis for regulation of tax policy. Noted is close connection of this
   branch with all spheres of legal reality of the society. Analyzed are
   the concepts of ``legal relations{''} and ``legal regulation{''}. The
   content of legal regulation of the tax sector is characterized through
   the study of public service, law enforcement and jurisdictional
   activities of the state in the tax sphere. Methodology. Review of
   materials and methods is performed on the basis of analyzing documentary
   materials on regulation of the state tax policy. Conclusions. It is
   determined that legal regulation in the sphere of tax policy includes
   public service, law enforcement and jurisdictional activity of the
   state, which is aimed at satisfaction of human rights and legitimate
   interests. Such activity is aimed at ensuring a high quality of life for
   people throughout the territory of Ukraine, and also at achieving an
   optimal balance between filling the budget and maintaining conditions
   for economic growth and improving social welfare. The sphere of taxes
   affects provision of national interests.},

Abstract = {Hans Kelsen and his work are sometimes associated with a sort of

   address his democratic theory - as it was developed between the 1920s
   and 1950s - by identifying the realistic elements of his reflection and
   thus showing how such elements are functional to developing a procedural
   view of democracy with a real value content.},

Title = {Digitalization as an opportunity for the development of citizenship in
   childhood and adolescence},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {In the context of the absence of a formal citizenship status for
   children and adolescents, the development of digital citizenship could
   be an opportunity to promote their participation and protagonism, by
   providing them with new spaces and means to express and share their
   opinions, going beyond the referential frameworks of the family and
   school environment. The aim of this article is to analyze the limits
   established for the achievement of active digital citizenship in
   childhood and adolescence in the school environment. To this end, the
   normative framework was analysed and 59 testimonies, from children and
   adolescents, parents, experts, and teachers, were collected. The
   ethnographic content analysis reveals that access to digital media is
   limited by the guardianship and asymmetry of power with adults, in
   addition to the lack of recognition of political and civil rights in
   children and adolescents. This would be hindering progress in the
   development of digital citizenship in children and adolescents within
   the framework of the information society.},

   and Indigenous Food Sovereignty},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {38-57},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to understand how historical oppression
   has undermined health through environmental injustices that have given
   rise to food insecurity. Specifically, the article examines ways in
   which settler colonialism has transformed and contaminated the land
   itself, impacting the availability and quality of food and the overall
   health of Indigenous peoples. Food security and environmental justice
   for Gulf Coast, state-recognized tribes has been infrequently explored.
   These tribes lack federal recognition and have limited access to
   recourse and supplemental resources as a result. This research fills an
   important gap in the literature through exploring the intersection of
   environmental justice and food insecurity issues for this population.
   Partnering with a community-advisory board and using a qualitative
   descriptive methodology, 31 Gulf Coast Indigenous women participated in
   semi-structured interviews about their healthcare experiences and
   concerns. Through these interviews, participants expressed concerns
   about (a) the environmental impacts of pollution on the contamination of
   food and on the health of tribal members; and (b) the impact of these
   changes on the land, such as negatively impacting gardening practices.
   The authors of this study document how environmental changes have
   compounded these concerns and contribute to the overall pollution of
   food and water sources and unviability of subsistence practices,
   severely effecting tribal members' health. In conclusion, we show how
   social and environmental justice issues such as pollution, industry
   exploitation, and climate change perpetuate the goals of settler
   colonialism through undermining cultural practices and the overall
   health of Indigenous peoples.},

Abstract = {Do young people place themselves to a larger extent on right-wing
   positions? Common wisdom suggests that young people tend to be more left
   leaning than older individuals. However, evidence about how age is
   associated with ideological preferences is scarce. In this article, we
   analyse how age relates to citizens' ideology. Three mechanisms are
   explored: age in itself, life cycle effects, and cohort or generational
   effects, derived from the context when individuals were socialised. Our
   findings, using data from the CIS and the Eurobarometer, show that
   current youth, even if they keep placing themselves on left-wing
   positions to a larger extent than adults, have moved to more right-wing
   ideological positions compared to those young people who were socialised
   during the sixties and seventies of the XXth century.},

Abstract = {Organized crime is both a liability and an asset for rebel movements.
   Illicit channels of supply - notably for arms and fuel - are often the
   only possible ones. Yet, this can come at the costs of political
   de-legitimization. The state resisting violent separatism as well as
   adherents or bystanders may consider separatists illegitimate for
   associating with readily-vilified criminal actors, and rebel groups
   cannot publicly embrace it without opprobrium. But why are some
   separatists stigmatized more than others for their criminal alliances?
   This article focuses on separatist rebel movements in order to explore
   the unique challenges of legitimacy and stigma that smuggling poses.
   Based on a comparative analysis of six case studies, I analyze variance
   in the legitimacy costs associated with criminal practices. I argue that
   the stigmatization of organized criminal smuggling in separatist
   governance depends on whether the smuggling is symmetrical, matched and
   shared by host state institutions, or asymmetric, unmatched by and
   unrelated to the host state.},

Abstract = {Building on the original corpus of OSCE monitoring reports, the article
   analyses quarter of century of election monitoring in Europe and
   assesses the congruence of OSCE written assessments with expert views.
   We show that, overall, the OSCE monitoring reports are highly correlated
   and congruent with expert assessments. More importantly, the level of
   congruence between the two increases with time. However, we also
   identify various forms of biases rooted in strategic interests and
   institutional preconditions. Mainly, we show that OSCE has a strong and
   positive bias towards Russia and its allies when it comes to election
   assessments indicating defensive and lenient stances. We theorize this
   mechanism as a pushback effect and show that although Russia's effort to
   cripple the activities of OSCE in the past two decades was not
   successful, OSCE was effectively forced into a defensive position
   producing less critical assessments than reality warrants.},

Abstract = {How do politicians in post-war societies talk about the past war? How do
   they discursively represent vulnerable social groups created by the
   conflict? Does the nature of this representation depend on the
   politicians' ideology or their record of combat service? We answer these
   questions by pairing natural language processing tools and a large
   corpus of parliamentary debates with an extensive data set of
   biographical information including detailed records of war service for
   all members of parliament during two recent terms in Croatia. We
   demonstrate not only that veteran politicians talk about war differently
   from their non-veteran counterparts, but also that the sentiment of
   war-related political discourse is highly dependent on the speaker's
   exposure to combat and ideological orientation. These results improve
   our understanding of the representational role played by combat
   veterans, as well as of the link between descriptive and substantive
   representation of vulnerable groups in post-war societies.},

   points in the same direction, namely that a weakening of the cooperation
   across the Atlantic has taken place. This article proposes an
   alternative view, arguing that the relationship has strengthened in
   recent years despite Donald Trump and his erratic policy. The article
   applies a theoretical framework combining international as well as
   domestic variables. Based on an analysis of four cases???NATO, the US
   pivot to Asia, the sanctions policy towards Russia, and the Afghanistan
   debacle???it is concluded that the transatlantic relationship is strong.},

Abstract = {The Great Recession in 2008 hit Iceland earlier, more suddenly and
   harder than most other countries. The outsized economic shock is the
   country's biggest crises since gaining independence in 1944. Remarkably,
   the combined bankruptcy of the three major banks ranks as the
   third-largest bankruptcy in world history. An astounding statistic for a
   country of around 350,000 inhabitants. This book is dedicated to
   evaluating the extent to which the Great Recession led to changes in the
   Icelandic party system and politics. Studying political developments
   after those dramatic events allows us to assess different perspectives
   and evaluate to what extent the changes we observe are driven by the
   crisis. By doing so, we contribute to the growing literature on the
   political consequences of economic crises in modern democracies. In this
   introductory chapter, we outline the theoretical framework used to
   understand developments following the collapse of the Icelandic
   financial system, focusing on how and why such economic crises as the
   Great Recession impacts politics, both short term and in the long run.
   We explain why the Icelandic case is interesting and important and we
   compare the Icelandic experience with other crisis countries in Europe.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this article was to identify the characteristics
   of a school that effectively becomes a learning organization and the
   need to improve it in the political context of the learning
   organization. To reveal the theoretical and empirical bases of the
   article, methods of analysis, synthesis, quantitative research and
   results processing were applied. The results presuppose that school
   administration, peer support and favorable infrastructure have a
   positive impact on the development of personal skills of community
   members. In this sense, the improvement of learning competence and
   innovation is identified with openness to the environment, to other
   communities and a high level of internal communication culture. It is
   concluded that, schools as fundamental learning organizations to
   identify themselves and their environment as a team, to develop an
   intuitive systematic sense (part of the system; we-system), need to
   drive a clear and effective communication structure, in coherence with
   the strategic and systemic processes of adequate response to the needs
   of the community, all of which legitimizes it with social approval and
   more internal and external supports.},

Abstract = {Apparently unnoticed by its advocates, a prominent effort to improve the
   troubled US presidential-election system-the National Popular Vote
   Interstate Compact (NPVIC)-is on a collision course with another effort
   at electoral change-{''}ranked-choice voting{''} (RCV, known previously
   by less ambiguous names). The NPVIC is a clever device intended, without
   constitutional amendment, to elect as president the nationwide
   popular-vote winner (i.e., the plurality-vote winner) rather than the
   electoral-vote winner. Election results in 2000, 2016, and 2020 enhanced
   its support. However, the (constitutional) ability of even one state to
   replace its plurality voting with another voting system causes the
   popular-vote total posited for the NPVIC to be undefined, thereby
   rendering the NPVIC unusable. Maine and Alaska recently switched from
   plurality voting to RCV for presidential elections. Consequently,
   tangled results and turmoil could occur with the NPVIC. To improve
   presidential elections, replacing plurality voting with other systems
   appears to be more sensible than pursuing the NPVIC.},

Title = {REGIONALISM AS A DRIVER OF EUROPEAN REGIONS' ACTIVITY IN THEIR RELATIONS
   WITH NATIONAL AUTHORITIES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2022},
Number = {6},
Pages = {38-54},
Abstract = {Over the past decades, decentralization has become one of the driving
   forces in the institutional transformation of EU member states. Regions
   have achieved greater authority both in their own power (self-rule) and
   in their involvement in decision-making at the national level
   (shared-rule). Nevertheless, the use of these powers varies greatly
   across the regions from both a national and a subnational perspective.
   There is a good reason to suppose that regionalism, which is defined as
   a movement seeking greater regional autonomy and is primarily expressed
   by regionalist parties, is one of the main factors of this variability.
   Testing this hypothesis, we focus on two instruments of shared-rule, the
   rights of the regions to submit legislative initiatives to the national
   parliament, and to appeal to the constitutional court against the
   national authorities. We identified all regionalist parties and their
   strength in regional legislatures (77 parties in 34 regions), regional
   initiatives (2610) and appeals (1444) over 2001-2020 in Italy, Germany,
   Spain, and Switzerland, where all the regions have these rights. OLS
   regression confirms that the strength of regionalist parties has a
   positive and statistically significant impact on the activity of the
   regions in both legislative initiatives and appeals to the court, in
   combination with the less significant influence of such factors as
   resource capacity and regional specificities. At the same time, we find
   substantial cross-national differences in using two instruments of
   shared-rule.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the topic of populism has become one of the most
   popular in Political Science. At the same time, the very content of the
   concept of populism remains subject of scientific debates, which
   inevitably af-fects empirical studies, because it is the theoretical
   framework that determines the choice of specific analysis tools. The
   article intends to serve as a kind of navigator for those who plan to
   engage in an empirical study of populism, to outline the set of
   conceptualizations of this phenomenon that are currently used. The
   article considers three theoretical approaches to populism -
   ide-ational, political-strategic, and performative. The author briefly
   touches upon the history and content of each of these approaches,
   discusses their empirical application, as well as their inherent
   advantages and disadvantages, after which he shows in what type of
   research they can be productive. According to his conclusion, ideational
   approach is optimal for conducting cross-national studies or extensive
   quantitative studies within one country. Political-strategic ap-proach
   could be useful when studying populism in Latin America or in
   coun-tries, where parties are poorly institutionalized. Performative
   approach could be a better choice if the study focuses on populist
   interactions with the media, or on a particular case study.},

Abstract = {There has been a proliferation of social media usage over the past
   decade. Social media platforms offer a convenient mode for virtual
   social interaction by providing relatively simple access to most people.
   However, there has been a recurring theme of harassment or bullying by
   way of hateful speech that causes social harm especially following the
   Christchurch terrorist attacks in 2019. New Zealand is at a point of
   inflexion when it comes to updating its laws to combat online hate
   speech. The manner in which statutory duty of care is proposed as law in
   other comparative jurisdictions (such as the UK and Australia) will be
   explored in order to establish whether it is beneficial and necessary to
   be adopted in New Zealand.},

   Comments in Germany and Austria},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {185-196},
Abstract = {Covid-19 and the government measures taken to combat the pandemic have
   fueled populist protests in Germany and Austria. Social media played a
   key role in the emergence of these protests. This study argues that the
   topic of Covid-19 has triggered populist user comments on Facebook pages
   of German and Austrian mass media. Drawing on media psychology, this
   article theorizes populist comments as an expression of ``reactance,{''}
   sparked by repeated ``fear appeals{''} in posts about Covid-19. Several
   hypotheses are derived from this claim and tested on a dataset of N =
   25,121 Facebook posts, posted between January 2020 and May 2021 on nine
   pages of German and Austrian mass media, and 1.4 million corresponding
   user comments. To measure content-based variables automatically, this
   study develops, validates, and applies dictionaries. The study finds
   that the topic of Covid-19 did trigger populist user comments and that
   this effect grew over time. Surprisingly, neither the stringency of
   government measures nor mentions of elitist actors were found to have
   the expected amplifying effect. The study discusses the findings against
   the background of governing the ongoing crisis and worrisome
   developments in the online public sphere.},

Title = {COMPETING CONCEPTIONS OF JUSTICE IN WORLD POLITICS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2022},
Number = {2},
Pages = {99-114},
Abstract = {Different conceptions of justice are often employed during negotiations
   by states looking for an ethical anchor for their postures or trying to
   signal their commitment to prevail in a conflict. Major powers often
   support their claims of upward adjustment of their status by reference
   to useful conceptions of justice. For the purposes of this article,
   justice is defined as a fit between benefits and entitlements. The
   article avoids falling into the trap of contested entitlements by only
   considering claims of entitlement and justice based on widely recognized
   universal ethical principles and/or salient points. The article
   classifies justice conceptions relevant for international politics by
   source and target and groups them into dyads, or ``justice dilemmas.{''}
   These dilemmas include reciprocity vs. restraint; parity vs.
   proportionality; status quo vs. accelerated progress; effectiveness vs.
   procedural justice, and others. A concept may be advanced by and/or
   targeted at individual actors (states) or the international community as
   a whole, represented by activist groups or political entrepreneurs. The
   positions of different sides in major international disputes as well as
   in the global and regional order debates may often be described and
   sometimes modeled as a competition between basic conceptions of justice
   championed by the sides. The outcome of these conflicts and debates may
   depend on the prevailing concepts of justice as much as on the balance
   of forces between the conflicting sides.},

Abstract = {The appearance of COVID-19 brought with it effects on all levels of the
   way of life of humanity. This essay wants to cover and analyze political
   decisions during this juncture, especially, about political figures of
   rulers as is the paradoxical case of the current President of Mexico
   Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador AMLO, who served and conducted himself with
   an ad hoc and sui generic treatment. in the face of the pandemic
   situation, this with his designs assumed thoughts, behaviors, and
   actions of a personalistic nature, which only came to attack the lives
   and fundamental rights of Mexicans (such as the right to life, autonomy,
   among others). So, with his position and subsequent public acts he
   demonstrated an unfathomable incompetence, a transgressive management
   about respect for the fundamental rights of his fellow citizens and
   himself. The result obtained from the article reflects and evidences the
   lack of interest in both the right to life, dignity, social welfare, and
   human solidarity. As a preliminary conclusion, the phenomenal so-called
   political personalism was observed analytically, which has become a
   characteristic of the particularized governance, charisma and leadership
   that have been installed in certain democratic nations.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian leaders around the world often fight against corruption in
   an effort to win public support. Conventional wisdom holds that this
   strategy works because leaders can signal their benevolent intentions by
   removing corrupt officials. We argue that fighting against corruption
   can undermine regime support. By revealing scandals of corrupt
   officials, corruption investigations can alter citizens' beliefs about
   public officials and lead to disenchantment about political
   institutions. We test this argument by examining how China's current
   anti-corruption campaign has changed citizens' public support for the
   government and the Communist Party. We analyze the results of two
   original surveys conducted before and during the campaign, and employ a
   difference-in-differences strategy to show that corruption
   investigations, at the margin, suppress respondents' support for the
   central government and party. We also examine our respondents' prior and
   posterior beliefs, and the results support our updating mechanism.Y},

Abstract = {Russia's war is meant to destroy Ukraine as a state. Military attacks
   also target symbols of modern statehood, which include infrastructure
   and industrial facilities. Industrial modernisation and technical
   infrastructure were central to Ukraine's nation-building process. This
   is particularly evident in the case of the country's nuclear power
   plants and its electricity grid. An important period of Ukrainian
   nation-building took place in Soviet Ukraine and is bound up in
   traumatic experiences. This is the source of the fractured and
   ambivalent relationship that today's Ukrainians have toward their
   history of modernisation. Russia completely negates this story.},

Abstract = {The state and its administration have been constantly confronted with
   profound changes, which they not only faced, but which must be shaped in
   order to better fulfil their diverse tasks and be able to fulfil their
   responsibilities. One such modern and fast-moving change is
   digitalization, which affects every area of life. The potential of
   digitalization has, of course, also affected the administrative activity
   of the state, from the design of optimal framework conditions for the
   economy and society through the improvement of infrastructure to more
   efficient administrative work. The aim of the article was to identify
   the key moments in building e-Government in Germany and, in the context
   of assessing its current state, to identify the main shortcomings of
   German e-Government. In this context, we have focused on defining and
   clarifying the nature of e-Government, introducing the positives and
   negatives. In the second part, we have focused on a brief analysis of
   the development and current state of implementation of the e-Government
   concept in Germany. The biggest shortcoming of the German public
   administration in terms of digitalization is the issue of effective
   interconnection of online services into one functioning overall system.
   There is still no central portal in Germany that contains all the
   information and service offers from a single source. It is still in the
   process of building. Even public registers, i.e., data collection and
   office archives, are not sufficiently interconnected. It requires, first
   and foremost, political will, an attractive range of services, initial
   investment as a driving force and a source of inspiration, and
   municipalities and Lander are also key in this process as the first
   points of contact for citizens},

Abstract = {What are the long-term effects of authoritarian repression on political
   trust in a post-democratization context? Using the Gwangju Massacre in
   South Korea as a case study, this article finds that indirect and direct
   experience of state-perpetrated violence of the critical-period
   cohort-who were aged 17-25 during the incident-can have long-term
   negative effects on trust levels towards the government.
   Difference-in-difference analysis of national survey data collected in
   2008 and 2012 reveals that experience with violence has long-term
   negative consequences on government trust. Results are robust even when
   including significant covariates of institutional theories and cultural
   theories, such as interpersonal trust, evaluation of government
   performance, as well as satisfaction with the economy. Drawing from
   memory studies, this article argues that the effects are due to
   collective memory formed during the critical period.},

Abstract = {Recent studies suggest that solidarity frames are a fruitful instrument
   to characterise the programmatic supply of political parties and to
   dimensionalize the political sphere. However, although it makes sense to
   look at the party supply in terms of different solidarity frames, it is
   still an open question whether these solidarity frames also make sense
   to voters and whether the favourite frames of the parties are also
   popular among their electorates. We concretely test the congruence of
   the partisan solidarity frames (supply) with the solidarity preferences
   of their electorates (demand) in the context of Belgium (Flanders) with
   a fragmented party system challenged by increasing economic and cultural
   openness. Our analyses suggest that voters distinguish solidarity frames
   and electorates tend to prefer those solidarity frames that are
   primarily used by their favourite party.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a considerable amount of work on the
   transformation of formerly rebel groups into political parties. However,
   there is little work that examines the organizational types of parties
   that formerly armed groups become. Are these parties more likely to
   exhibit certain organizational characteristics when compared to other
   parties? This is an important question especially as scholars consider
   the role these former rebel parties play in the development of peace and
   democracy in post-civil war politics. Using data from Daly (2020) and
   Tuncel and Manning (2022), as well as recently released data from V-Dem
   on political parties (Coppedge et al 2020) we find that former rebel
   parties are more clientelistic and personalistic than other parties,
   even compared to parties in countries where they compete. We suggest
   that these parties are unlikely to play a constructive role in post
   conflict democratization.},

Abstract = {Volunteer-based voter contact presents multiple potential
   principal-agent problems for political campaigns. Conflicting potential
   solutions to these principal-agent problems generate two opposing
   expectations about campaigns' preferences for ideological types of
   volunteers. Concerns about volunteers substituting their own ideological
   messages for the moderate and noncommittal ones campaigns prefer should
   make moderate volunteers more desirable; concerns about maximizing
   volunteer work-hours should lead to preferences for volunteers whose
   ideology matches the candidate's. Using interviews with campaign
   operatives, a conjoint experiment, and a correspondence experiment, we
   show campaigns prefer volunteers whose views align with the candidate -
   interpreted by campaign operatives as a signal of likely enthusiasm and
   dedication - rather than moderate volunteers. However, even without
   resource constraints, these preferences are weak and fade in the
   presence of stronger indicators of commitment. They are absent in
   real-world volunteer recruitment. Overall, campaigns are more concerned
   with volunteers shirking responsibilities than they are with volunteers
   going off-message.},

Abstract = {How do politicians in advanced democracies get away with violating
   political norms? Although norm violators confront a powerful
   establishment that can penalize them, norm violations currently occur in
   many advanced democracies. This article analyzes the conflicts between
   norm-violating challengers and established politicians and parties as
   norm defenders in multiparty systems to contribute to the discipline's
   understanding of norm erosion processes. Based on diachronic and
   synchronic comparisons of conflicts over norm violations in Austria and
   Germany, the article reveals how political challengers can already
   damage democratic norms from a position of institutional weakness. Norm
   violators that make ambiguous provocations and can leverage their
   previously acquired democratic credentials, can more credibly dispel
   attempts to stigmatize them as undemocratic. In doing so, they turn the
   tables on the political establishment and portray its sanctions as a
   form of `excessive retaliation' that constitutes a norm violation in
   itself. The article concludes with the unsettling finding that (verbal)
   norm protection can facilitate norm erosion.},

Funding-Text = {Our thinking about conflicts over norm violations was initially inspired
   by the rope-a-dope' metaphor, which Muhammad Ali had used to describe
   his provocative strategy of attrition against George Foreman in the
   Rumble in the Jungle'. However, since this metaphor would have equated
   today's norm violators with one of the greatest athletes of all time, it
   was out of the question to use it in the article. The authors want to

Abstract = {This article contrasts the liberal idea of a ``sleeping sovereign{''}
   with the democratic one of a ``sovereign awakened.{''} The right to
   protest is defended as an expression of popular sovereignty, envisaged
   as a right to popular ``self-awakening{''} instigated by an imperative
   call of duty not reduc-ible to a set of liberal individual rights. In
   contrast to some approaches of agonistic democracy, it is argued that
   democratically breaking the rules of the game of liberal democracy is an
   indispensable dimension of democratic protest. Taking into account
   etienne Balibar's thoughts about a rule -break-ing right to have rights,
   it is suggested we revisit the French Constitution of 1793, in which a
   popular duty to insurrection is enshrined. The article ends with the
   proposal to supplement insurrectionary accounts of sovereignty with a
   Gramscian view that would insist on the necessity of hegemonically
   constructing a democratic ``collective will.{''}},

Abstract = {In the face of current democratic backsliding and autocratization
   processes, research has rediscovered issues of autocratic legitimation.
   However, the question of whether rulers' personalist rhetoric to bolster
   their legitimacy is followed by congruent political action remains
   underspecified. Using new expert-coded measures for 164 countries from
   the Varieties of Democracy project, we examine the political
   rhetoric-action link using using fixed effects models. The results
   confirm that shifts towards personalist legitimacy claims are no cheap
   talk but oftentimes important warning signals for a substantial
   deterioration of democratic quality, manifested in weaker judicial and
   legislative oversight of the executive branch. However, in contrast to
   much current concern, we show that liberal democracies seem to largely
   escape the negative repercussions of government discourses that
   increasingly stress the uniqueness of the ruler.},

Abstract = {Manipulations checks are postexperimental measures widely used to verify
   that subjects understood the treatment. Some researchers drop subjects
   who failed manipulation checks in order to limit the analyses to
   attentive subjects. This short report offers a novel illustration on how
   this practice may bias experimental results: in the present case,
   through confirming a hypothesis that is likely false. In a survey
   experiment, subjects were primed with a fictional news story depicting
   an economic decline versus prosperity. Subjects were then asked whether
   the news story depicted an economic decline or prosperity. Results
   indicate that responses to this manipulation check captured subjects'
   preexisting beliefs about the economic situation. As a consequence,
   dropping subjects who failed the manipulation check mixes the effects of
   preexisting and induced beliefs, increasing the risk of false positive
   findings. Researchers should avoid dropping subjects based on
   posttreatment measures and rely on pretreatment measures of
   attentiveness.},

Abstract = {Do salient normative claims about politics require moral premises?
   Political moralists think they do, political realists think they do not.
   We defend the viability of realism in a two-pronged way. First, we show
   that a number of recent attacks on realism as well as realist responses
   to those attacks unduly conflate distinctly political normativity and
   non-moral political normativity. Second, we argue that Alex Worsnip and
   Jonathan Leader-Maynard's recent attack on realist arguments for a
   distinctly political normativity depends on assuming moralism as the
   default view, which places an excessive burden on the viability of
   realism, and so begs the question. Our discussion, though, does not
   address the relative merits of realism and moralism, so its upshot is
   relatively ecumenical: moralism need not be the view that all apt
   normative political judgements are moral judgements, and realism need
   not be the view that no apt normative political judgements are moral
   judgements.},

Abstract = {The Air Force in Nigeria is a compelling subject for sociological
   enquiry, with an entirely different formative process to the Army. At
   its inception in 1964, Army officers, not career airmen, commanded the
   force until 1975. However, whereas the Army cast a long shadow over NAF
   identity, the Air Force had other institutional pathologies. The ``Quota
   System `` of ethnicized recruitment within the military, introduced to
   balance out ethnic representation, was one such issue. The paper
   examines how this system, along with the tumultuous politics of 1960s
   Nigeria, ethnicism and Army influence, shaped the NAF's formative years.},

Abstract = {Governments can grant political concessions to induce quasi-voluntary
   compliance with taxation, yet empirical evidence probing the
   taxation-representation connection remains inconclusive. We contend that
   this association remains valid but it is primarily confined to business
   elites in nondemocratic regimes because the same wealth that exposes
   them to state predation also incentivizes them to endorse tax policies
   that offer greater political representation. We test our argument by
   evaluating preferences for hypothetical tax reforms in separate samples
   of business elites and ordinary citizens in China. We find that business
   elites show stronger preference than nonelites for tax policies that
   include advances in political representation. We explore various
   mechanisms for our results and find support for government credibility,
   tax ownership, and tax salience considerations.},

Abstract = {In path-breaking work, Weingast et al. argue that there is a positive
   relationship between legislature size and inefficiency in public
   expenditures. Their proposition is currently known as the `law of 1/n'
   and has been widely debated in political science and public
   administration. However, recent studies have questioned the validity of
   the theory. In this letter, we conduct the first meta-analysis that
   assesses the generality of the `law of 1/n'. Based on a sample of thirty
   articles, we find no robust evidence suggesting that legislature size
   has either a positive or a negative effect on government budgets. Yet,
   the aggregate results mask considerable heterogeneity. Our findings
   provide moderate support for the `law of 1/n' in unicameral legislatures
   and in upper houses, but they also indicate that studies using
   panel/fixed-effects models or regression-discontinuity designs report
   negative public spending estimates. We find only limited evidence that
   electoral systems impact public spending, which suggests that
   proportional representation systems may not be more prone to
   overspending than majoritarian ones.},

Abstract = {Political elites increasingly express interest in evidence-based
   policymaking, but transparent research collaborations necessary to
   generate relevant evidence pose political risks, including the discovery
   of sub-par performance and misconduct. If aversion to collaboration is
   non-random, collaborations may produce evidence that fails to
   generalize. We assess selection into research collaborations in the
   critical policy arena of policing by sending requests to discuss
   research partnerships to roughly 3,000 law enforcement agencies in 48
   states. A host of agency and jurisdiction attributes fail to predict
   affirmative responses to generic requests, alleviating concerns over
   generalizability. However, across two experiments, mentions of agency
   performance in our correspondence depressed affirmative responses - even
   among top-performing agencies - by roughly eight percentage points. Many
   agencies that initially indicate interest in transparent, evidence-based
   policymaking recoil once performance evaluations are made salient. We
   discuss several possible mechanisms for these dynamics, which can
   inhibit valuable policy experimentation in many communities.},

Abstract = {Conspiracy theories and misinformation (CTM) became a salient feature of
   the Trump era. However, traditional explanations of political attitudes
   and behaviors inadequately account for beliefs in CTM or the deleterious
   behaviors they are associated with. Here, we integrate disparate
   literatures to explain beliefs in CTM regarding COVID-19, QAnon, and
   voter fraud. We aim to provide a more holistic accounting, and to
   determine which political, psychological, and social factors are most
   associated with such beliefs. Using a unique national survey, we find
   that anti-social personality traits, anti-establishment orientations,
   and support for Donald Trump are more strongly related to beliefs in CTM
   than traditional left-right orientations or other frequently posited
   factors, such as education, science literacy, and social media use. Our
   findings encourage researchers to move beyond the traditional correlates
   of political behavior when examining beliefs that express anti-social
   tendencies or a deep skepticism of social and political institutions.},

Abstract = {Anti-elite and anti-political resentment have become a permanent feature
   of political life in many if not most contemporary democracies, leading
   to support for populist parties, systematic anti-incumbent voting, and
   new types of movements, such as the Yellow Vests protests that shook
   France in 2018-2020. The aim of this paper is to explain the unusual
   popular support they mobilized. Going beyond the somewhat tautological
   ``populist{''} label attached to the movement this paper proposes a
   class-based explanation. Using original data from a survey run after the
   European Elections of 2019, it shows that social precarity, combined
   with a lower /working class position, is the main driver of affinity
   with the YV. The movement is disproportionately supported by the most
   insecure segments of production workers (mostly men) and service workers
   (mostly women), giving an identity to those who feel excluded and not
   represented by mainstream parties and unions. This disaffected
   ``precariat{''} can be seen as a magnifying glass of the crisis of
   political representation affecting most Western democracies. A reservoir
   of discontent that is here to stay and that the economic and political
   impact of the Covid-19 pandemic could revive.},

Abstract = {Redistricting is a politically fraught exercise. Recently, new
   technology has emerged that has the potential to improve the
   redistricting process by providing information to aid in judicial
   oversight. These scientific advances create the potential to improve
   societal governance but are also potentially manipulable by partisan
   interests. To avoid these negative externalities, we must thoughtfully
   design the processes, implement safeguards, and have clear policies that
   regulate and steer the emerging AI toward democratically favorable
   goals. We propose institutional changes toward these aims.},

Title = {When ``Home{''} Becomes the ``Field{''}: Ethical Considerations in
   Digital and Remote Fieldwork},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the unpredictability and
   instability of fieldwork as a method for data collection. As the
   pandemic prompted unprecedented political dynamism and social and
   economic disruptions at both domestic and global levels, in-person
   fieldwork became challenging, if even possible, in the two years
   following March 2020. While scholars are again using traditional
   fieldwork methods, we have seen an increased use of digital tools to
   conduct research remotely since the pandemic due to international travel
   bans and social distancing measures. Although not yet widely discussed,
   these new approaches pose new ethical questions as understandings of
   both our ``fields{''} and ``homes{''} evolve. In this paper, we stress
   the need for scholars to reconsider how we conceive of our ethical
   obligations in situations wherein we have conducted research without
   ever physically accessing our field sites or interacting in person with
   our participants. We particularly urge researchers to re-evaluate their
   ethical responsibilities around transparency and replicability in the
   dissemination and publication of findings when engaging in fieldwork
   ``from home.{''} These considerations were necessary prior to 2020 but
   are especially relevant within the context of the pandemic as scholars
   enter new field sites remotely or return to those previously visited in
   person. As a result, this paper starts a critical conversation about
   ethical practices in remote and digital fieldwork, which will continue
   to prove significant as digital and remote methods are used for data
   collection in a post-pandemic world.},

Abstract = {How do politicians distribute government resources in regimes with no
   electoral considerations? We propose that new politicians minimize
   political risks by favoring politically important actors: state-owned
   enterprises (SOEs), but they adjust their behavior as they establish
   personal ties with private businesses. Using firm-level subsidies data
   after the 2008 stimulus in China, we find that new provincial governors,
   immediately after taking office, distribute a significantly larger
   proportion of subsidies to SOEs relative to private firms. The effect
   attenuates as new governors learn about local conditions and establish
   connections with private firms. We find suggestive evidence that
   governors who adopt such a strategy are more likely to be promoted.
   Contrary to conventional wisdom that the state always favors state-owned
   firms, we show that SOEs benefit from the stimulus package only in the
   short-run.},

Abstract = {The present crisis of the Covid-19 is just the last episode of the
   permanent crisis that had lasted at least for the last 50 years.
   Contemporary theory has attended to many of its aspects, which together
   had contributed to the extremely vulnerable condition of today mankind.
   In this paper, we propose to reconstruct the critic of the many changes
   in the relations between theory and practice in Modernity that is
   possible to find in Hans Jonas's writings, changes that were, in his
   view, at the heart of the causes of our crisis, and to expose the
   fundamentals of a potential way out of this pathological situation: the
   recovery of the essential elements that will made possible an ethics for
   our the techno-scientific civilization.},

Abstract = {At the center of contentious debates concerning U.S. asylum policy are
   immigration judges, bureaucrats who decide life and death cases on a
   daily basis. Congress, the executive and the courts compete for
   influence over these key actors - administrative judges distinct from
   those examined in much of the bureaucratic control literature. They are
   hired, fired, promoted or demoted by executive officials; face
   congressional oversight; and must follow circuit law. We argue that,
   because of the fear of reversal, immigration judges will look most to
   the courts in the decision-making process. Our results support our
   theory. Examining over 900,000 immigration judges' decisions, we find
   that, although IJs are influenced by a fear of pushback from the elected
   branches, the impact is conditional on circuit preferences. Our findings
   inform scholarly understanding of judicial behavior and bureaucratic
   accountability, and support the pursuit of judicial independence and due
   process in immigration courts.},

Abstract = {Based on field research with asylum-seeking children in reception
   centres, the article looks at the situation of unaccompanied minor
   migrants in Slovenia through the lens of the child-centred approach and
   from a procedural justice perspective. Initially it highlights the
   commonalities between procedural justice and the child-centred approach
   in terms of voice, dignity and respect and impartial decision-making,
   and thereafter describes migrants' perceptions and experiences of asylum
   reception and determination procedures from the perspective of the
   child-centred approach and procedural justice. Interviews with
   unaccompanied migrant minors revealed that their experiences of
   reception and the asylum process were most influenced by respect for
   dignity and voice. Finally, the article discusses the relevance of the
   child-centred approach to the inclusion of non-citizen children at the
   intersection of different rights regimes.},

Abstract = {A key question for today is how far the apparent loosening of austerity
   following the COVID-19 pandemic in the form of the July 2020 European
   Recovery Plan of 750 billion euros, constitutes a first step towards
   debt mutualization (sharing of debts to fund recovery among EU Member
   States) but also whether it signals a move away from the neoliberal
   legal and political limits associated with neoliberal new
   constitutionalism measures, epitomized in the EU by the Maastricht
   Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. We think this prospect is
   unlikely - in the absence of significant political pressures demanding
   and creating alternative futures and promoting radical change. In lieu
   of paradigmatic change, Next Generation EU resembles a pragmatic shift -
   with indeed some innovative traits - triggered by two main motives:
   responding to the urgent pandemic shock, but most importantly tackling
   the lasting effects of economic and political imbalances, in an attempt
   to tame some of the socio-political tensions and risks of disintegration
   resulting from the mismanaged Eurozone crisis.},

Abstract = {In 2005, Missouri and Tennessee tightened eligibility for their public
   health insurance programs, resulting in widespread coverage losses.
   Leveraging county-level variation in subsequent disenrollment, I show
   that voters in Tennessee punished the incumbent governor for the
   Medicaid cuts. In Missouri, by contrast, disenrollment had no impact on
   the subsequent gubernatorial election but did increase support for
   Democrats in 2006 state legislative elections, possibly due to the
   strategic entry and exit of candidates. In both states, the loss of
   Medicaid coverage was associated with lower support for Democratic
   presidential candidates, although these declines appear part of a
   longer-term trend that preceded the coverage loss. The results speak to
   the potential political costs of welfare spending cuts and the electoral
   consequences of reducing income-targeted social programs.},

Abstract = {State governments are tasked with making important policy decisions in
   the United States. How do state legislators use their public
   communications-particularly social media-to engage with policy debates?
   Due to previous data limitations, we lack systematic information about
   whether and how state legislators publicly discuss policy and how this
   behavior varies across contexts. Using Twitter data and state-of-the-art
   topic modeling techniques, we introduce a method to study state
   legislator policy priorities and apply the method to 15 US states in
   2018. We show that we are able to accurately capture the policy issues
   discussed by state legislators with substantially more accuracy than
   existing methods. We then present initial findings that validate the
   method and speak to debates in the literature. The paper concludes by
   discussing promising avenues for future state politics research using
   this new approach.},

Abstract = {Historically, Brazilian diplomacy has centered its foreign policy
   strategy on multilateral institutions. Multilateralism has not only been
   an instrument to share the political costs of international decisions
   but also a defensive mechanism, due to Brazil's modest military
   capability. In this article, we consider that Bolsonaro's multilateral
   foreign policy represents the rupture of narrative. Departing from the
   premise that foreign policy is a public policy, hence subjected to
   domestic constituencies, Bolsonaro's conservative project is constructed
   in the intersection between domestic politics and the international
   system. First, we introduce our main hypothesis, that he employs an
   ideology of anticommunism, antiglobalism, and negationism to assure the
   loyalty of specific constituencies despite potential disruptions to
   collective interests and national long-term strategies. Next, we connect
   the internal to the external by comparing Bolsonaro's approval in public
   opinion polls and his proposition or support of domestic laws to
   Brazil's stance in multilateral forums. To verify the validity of our
   argument, we aim to identify patterns of external behavior that
   correspond to the president's political ideas and guidelines and to
   concrete interests of domestic constituencies.},

Abstract = {In 2009, the Australian Senate rejected the government's ambitious
   Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. In the prevailing narrative
   surrounding these events, the Labor government, under Prime Minister
   Kevin Rudd, made a series of strategic errors that led to the scheme's -
   and ultimately, Rudd's and the Labor Party's - downfall. However, by
   taking a closer look at of some aspects of Australia's parliamentary
   system, including the norms of partisan voting and the numbers game in
   parliament, a different story is apparent. A counter-narrative is that
   the Rudd Labor government's approach was reasonable at the time, but
   that institutional factors and election outcomes presented significant
   obstacles to passing climate legislation of any kind. Correcting this
   narrative will enable a better understanding of the political
   circumstances in which environmental policies are enacted in Australia,
   a country with the potential for regional policy leadership on climate
   change.},

Abstract = {How do voters in a developed economy react to political violence at the
   ballot box? Most of the current literature suggests that a social
   movement turning violent dampens its support. To this end, we examine
   the effect of violent clashes and indiscriminate state repression on
   Hong Kong's 2019 municipal election. Using original geocoded data, we
   proxy violence and repression by the frequency of police shooting tear
   gas rounds at protesters. Despite the movement turning in part violent,
   the presence of indiscriminate state repression reduces regime support.
   We offer evidence that repression de-mobilized pro-regime voters. We
   discuss possible explanations behind our findings and how the
   specificity of political violence may matter in shaping public support
   in protest movements.},

Abstract = {The French Yellow Vests movement offers a case study for examining the
   logics and effects of the avoidance of institutional politics. The
   movement brought together seasoned activists and a large share of
   first-time protesters, i.e. social actors with no prior experience in
   collective action or party politics. Drawing on in-depth ethnographic
   biographical interviews conducted with the latter, we argue that,
   paradoxically enough, avoiding politics was a condition of possibility
   for their entry and continuation in the mobilisation. Moreover, they
   became political insofar as they acquired a sense of entitlement to
   speak out publicly as citizens, and a new appetence for current affairs.
   Even though first-timers' interest in politics and their forms of
   knowledge remained very unequal, we urge to study the avoidance of
   institutional politics as political tactics that might, under certain
   circumstances, foster politicisation among the most disenfranchised
   groups.},

Abstract = {The persistence of political dynasties in developed and developing
   countries has been an interesting puzzle as democracy does not
   automatically obliterate the domination of familial ties in politics.
   Prior studies suggest that women are more likely to be dynastic than
   men. However, it remains unclear on how parties are allocating dynasts
   into committees and whether it is gendered or not. This paper introduces
   new observational data on female parliamentary representation, dynastic
   background and committee membership of 575 sitting parliamentarians in
   Indonesia. The findings suggest that one in every four members of
   parliament are dynasts and the proportion among female lawmakers has
   increased from 42\% in 2009 to 44\% in 2019. However, the experience of
   dynastic women in relation to committee assignment is not uniform. The
   critical variable that influences their placement appears to be the
   political party to which they belong, particularly in terms of
   nomination and internal structure. This paper offers initial leads for
   future research endeavours in connecting the intersectionality between
   political dynasties and committee assignments in other countries.},

Abstract = {The 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil conveyed - by its slogan, mascot,
   posters and ceremonies - the idea of a Mulatto Brazil (an inventive and
   festive nation under the sign of two idiosyncratic worlds). We argue
   that such a reference - based on the duality between Dionysius and
   Apollo (as contemplated by Nietzsche and brought to the context of
   Brazil and football by Freyre) - was used as a means of bringing forward
   an idea of the exceptionality of Brazilian society (based on nationalist
   concepts of ethnicity) to attract tourists, ease social tensions and
   justify the event's costs.},

Title = {Do citizens demand transparency from co-partisans? Evidence from a
   pre-registered experiment in Mexico},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {80},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Government transparency is vital for democracy because it serves as a
   tool for citizens to engage in oversight over and hold accountable
   government officials. In the absence of procedural rules requiring
   government transparency, politicians' actions are unobserved and cannot
   be easily rewarded (punished) in response to fulfilling (failing)
   constituent demands. Additionally, transparency eases the transition of
   power between political parties by giving non co-partisans a tool to
   monitor the party in power. Government transparency is important,
   however its integrity as a procedural tool is dependent on it being
   demanded by government officials regardless of co-partisanship. If
   citizens allow co-partisans to undermine government transparency, it
   ceases to be a tool for the perpetuation of democracy. In this article I
   utilize a novel pre-registered survey experiment among Mexican
   respondents to better understand under which contexts citizens demand
   transparency. Surprisingly, Mexican respondents demand for transparency
   from co-partisans and non-co-partisans is statistically
   indistinguishable. This is a meaningful result because it suggests that,
   at least in the case of Mexico, partisanship does not always undermine
   support for democratic procedures. Additionally, I find that citizens
   demand greater transparency about their representatives' political
   activities compared to private activities. Surprisingly transparency is
   not dependent on the level of political office.},

   independence in the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European
   Union, by examining firstly its general definition and considering its
   anatomy on the basis of its two main manifes-tations: its status as a
   necessary quality for a court or tribunal of a Member state to be
   considered as such with regard to preliminary rulings and its nature as
   a sine qua non requisite of the Rule of Law. Likewise, some
   considerations are made on the conse-quences of such configuration
   within the Union's own legal system, as well as its interaction with
   other standards of judicial independence that dialogue with the
   Community standard.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {102-120},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article analyses the extent to which European Union (EU) directives
   allow for variation in domestic implementation. Such flexibility in
   implementation may be used to deal with heterogeneity among member
   states. Based on an original dataset of 164 directives adopted between
   2006 and 2015, we find that the use of flexibility is associated more
   with efforts to accommodate differences between national policies
   (substantive use of discretion) than with attempts to facilitate the
   decision-making process in and between EU legislative institutions
   (strategic use of discretion). Although flexibility may be used to
   address some of the same concerns that drive differentiated integration
   (DI), the situations in which each is most likely to be used are
   distinct because they approach the divergences between member states
   differently.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have discussed the effects of electoral competition on
   corruption, but only a few explored the effects of political power
   shifts - the results of electoral competition. To fill the gap, this
   study tests hypotheses that three types of political power shifts (the
   shifts of individual local government heads, local government ruling
   party, and local council majority) reduce the corruption (overall,
   external, and internal), with a panel data set of 226 Korean local
   governments. The empirical study shows that only shifts in the local
   government head reduce internal corruption. The other dependent and
   independent variables do not have any significant relationships. This
   can be because of structural matters of Korean local politics such as
   strong mayor-weak council and the closed local elite networks.},

Abstract = {Elections at the municipal level are often treated as second-order
   elections (SOE), subordinate to the national electoral arena in a manner
   similar to the European elections. The original SOE model expects
   incumbent national parties to perform worse, while predicting smaller
   and ideologically extreme parties to perform better at the second-order
   electoral arena compared to the first-order (national) one. Based on a
   dataset covering aggregate election results in three Nordic countries
   (Denmark, Norway and Finland) with party-dominated local governments and
   a time span of more than three decades, we find that the performance of
   parties in municipal elections only to some degree conforms to the
   expectations of the model. Parties in national government usually suffer
   losses in municipal elections, but the effect of incumbency is
   contingent upon the party size: only large incumbent parties are
   punished in local elections. We find very weak support for the
   hypothesis that extreme parties perform better than moderates and
   suggests that this can be explained by the organisational effort
   required to field the candidates and campaign in multiple jurisdictions.
   We conclude that the SOE model should not be applied as a default to
   municipal elections when explaining political parties' electoral
   performance.},

Abstract = {Information disclosure has become a ubiquitous component of public
   policy. The virtues of information disclosure partly rest on citizens
   acting on disclosed information. Through a survey experiment, this
   article evaluates citizens' responses to local environmental information
   from the Toxics Release Inventory, a major environmental information
   disclosure program in the U.S. The results suggest that individuals
   adjust their concern for self and family and sense of personal
   obligation to act based on new information relative to their prior
   knowledge. The information, however, has no impact on policy preferences
   and behavioral intentions. While citizens do not completely reject new
   information, the findings underscore the challenges of using information
   disclosure to motivate meaningful behavioral changes. They also
   contribute to the understanding of the relationships between
   information, political knowledge, attitudes, and preferences.},

Abstract = {How should an excessively large parliament be effectively reduced in
   size without violating constitutional principles? This is a question
   that the German Bundestag has discussed since the introduction of the
   2013 electoral reform measure. Facing a Bundestag consisting of 709
   members and some public dissatisfaction, a reform measure to decrease
   the parliament's size was adopted in 2020. However, the 20 Bundestag,
   elected in September 2021, again increased in size to 735 members. The
   newly adopted electoral law still uses plurality voting to select the
   directly elected lawmakers. It is widely known that selection using the
   plurality rule is flawed because it violates the principle of majority
   decision. Aside from this aspect, this paper demonstrates that the
   plurality rule itself contributes to the excessive size of the
   parliament. By removing the flaws caused by the plurality rule and
   replacing this voting scheme with a Condorcet method (simple-majority
   rule), the targeted reduction of the size of the Bundestag can be
   achieved.},
