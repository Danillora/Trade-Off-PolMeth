Abstract = {In recent years, political scientists increasingly have used
   data-science tools to research political processes, positions, and
   behaviors. Because both domestic and international politics are grounded
   in oral and written texts, computerized text analysis (CTA)-typically
   based on natural-language processing-has become one of the most notable
   applications of data-science tools in political research. This article
   explores the promises and perils of using CTA methods in political
   research and, specifically, the study of international relations. We
   highlight fundamental analytical and methodological gaps that hinder
   application and review processes. Whereas we acknowledge the significant
   contribution of CTA to political research, we identify a dual
   ``engagement deficit{''} that may distance those without prior
   background in data science: (1) the tendency to prioritize
   methodological innovation over analytical and theoretical insights; and
   (2) the scholarly and political costs of requiring high proficiency
   levels and training to comprehend, assess, and use advanced research
   models.},

Abstract = {Popular dissatisfaction with representative democracy has encouraged
   governments and legislatures worldwide to experiment with democratic
   innovations. However, despite calls for a `systemic' approach to the
   study of democratic engagement and participation, empirical knowledge is
   limited about the diffusion of democratic innovations within civil
   society, and, in particular, about the connective mechanisms that bring
   the `voice' of citizens to the `ears' of political elites. This article
   responds to this gap, presenting original empirical research examining
   the UK House of Commons' e-petitions system. This research maps public
   engagement with parliamentary e-petitions across a range of expressive
   spaces, and highlights the facilitative role of non-institutional
   intermediaries. However, it also underlines the predominant role of
   institutional actors in structuring public participation, and shows that
   effective transmission between the informal public and formal political
   spheres remains contingent on both `designed-in powers' of institutional
   coupling and `developed practices' of public engagement. Through this
   analysis, the article makes an important contribution to debates
   concerning democratic innovations, political participation, and
   institutional design.},

Abstract = {How can we close persistent gender gaps in political participation? We
   develop a theory highlighting the role of male household members as
   ``gatekeepers{''} of women's participation in patriarchal settings and
   argue that the answer involves targeting these men. We conduct a field
   experiment in Pakistan and find that targeting women with a nonpartisan
   get-out-the-vote campaign has no effect on their turnout in a national
   election. However, women's turnout increases substantially when male
   household members are canvassed to support women's participation.
   Households where both men and women are canvassed see the largest
   increases in women's turnout and additional increases in political
   discussion and men's practical support to help women vote. Using a
   costly behavioral measure, we also demonstrate lasting effects on men's
   supportive behavior in these households two months after the election.
   Our results address the importance, and tangible benefits, of engaging
   men to ease constraints that hinder equal participation.},

Abstract = {Gender differences in political knowledge are a well-known empirical
   finding in public opinion research. Scholars working in this area have
   proposed various explanations for this phenomenon, often focusing on
   issues regarding the format and content of factual knowledge batteries.
   Yet, there are surprisingly few works that focus on how scholars might
   diversify the content of political knowledge measures to develop items
   that are less biased toward male areas of expertise. In this paper, we
   propose an inductive framework to develop more gender-balanced knowledge
   batteries by including political issues that are of particular relevance
   to women and women's lives. Employing gender-balanced measures of
   political knowledge reveal instances where women and men demonstrate
   equivalent levels of political knowledge and higher levels of political
   interest and efficacy among women-engagement that is often masked by
   conventional measures of knowledge.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the contemporary South Korean political economy of
   crisis and recovery to visualize the material conditions of
   working-class lives and the ways in which their capacity to reproduce
   labor and life contradicts the regionally specific logic of `progress'.
   I visualize three critical scenes of workplace death that chart the ways
   in which the social reproduction capacity of the working class is
   fatally contracted in the era of neoliberal reforms. These scenes of
   death mirror the process of neoliberal transition that the financial
   crises of 1997 and 2008 accelerated in the region. In doing so, I
   articulate the notion of `progress by death' as the intensified
   necropolitical logic of neoliberal capitalism that is led by the
   post-developmental state and fully transnationalized chaebol capital in
   South Korea. Building on feminist theories of social reproduction and
   the studies on the financialization of life, I argue that the logic of
   `progress by death' as a constitutive element of financial capitalism
   reproduces the uneven patterns of growth and the transnational relations
   of violence, debt, and dispossession across Asian economies.},

Abstract = {What determines the credibility of opinion polls, and for whom? Opinion
   polls assessing voting intention are an increasingly prominent aspect of
   pre-election media discourse, yet they often vary in terms of their
   estimations, who conducted the poll, and where the poll is ultimately
   published. This letter considers the determinants of pre-election poll
   credibility when citizens are exposed to conflicting polls, contributing
   to a growing field which considers the subjectivity with which
   partisan-relevant information is perceived in polarised contexts. Using
   a conjoint analysis in Turkey, this paper produces strong evidence that
   polls are perceived differently across partisan lines. Whereas
   government supporters rely almost exclusively on a poll's result,
   opposition supporters place considerably more weight on the media source
   when determining poll credibility.},

Abstract = {Statistical modelling of terrorism has advanced the understanding of its
   underlying drivers. However, numerous questions remain, some have not
   been empirically tested, and regional dynamics differ. In recent
   decades, the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) and Central Asia have been
   focal points of terrorism. An extensive review of global and regional
   statistical models of terrorism at the country-year level was conducted
   and hypotheses re-tested on a database for MENA and Central Asia for
   years 1998-2017. The analysis indicates that the primary drivers of
   terrorism in this region are corruption, war, state terror, weak
   democracy, and unemployment. Fuel exports, ethnic and religious
   fractionalization, youth bulges, and internally displaced persons (IDPs)
   have little or no statistically significant relationship to terrorism in
   the region. Collectively, these results indicate that certain factors
   can anticipate terrorism in the region. Further analysis indicates that
   some factors have the potential to erupt suddenly and therefore require
   constant monitoring and sound contingency planning.},

Abstract = {Argentine history has had long periods of institutional instability. In
   this article we try to evaluate some of the causes of this instability.
   The purpose of this article is to identify the factors that explain the
   variation in government survival in Argentina. This analyzes the set of
   presidents who governed the Argentine Republic from 1862 until the
   present, emphasizing the effect that the ways of access to power have on
   the longevity of governments. The results show different patterns that
   explain differences between the survival of presidents who came to
   office by popular vote and those rulers who acceded throughout other
   mechanisms. The latter register greater risks of bankruptcy when they
   assume the government, a situation that diminishes as the presidency
   goes on. On the other hand, the rulers who acceded by popular vote face
   the opposite situation: the risk increases along their mandates.
   Therefore, we can argue that the probabilities of replacement in
   governments with a different origin than electoral result from conflicts
   of interest that expressed their lack of legitimacy of origin and
   undermine their capacity to govern. On the contrary way, governments
   that results of electoral processes suffer from political erosion that
   occurs in the medium or long term.},

Abstract = {We map the current state of parliamentary and legislative studies
   through a survey of 218 scholars and a bibliometric analysis of 25 years
   of publications in three prominent sub-field journals. We identify two
   groupings of researchers, a quantitative methods, rational
   choice-favouring grouping and a qualitative methods,
   interpretivism-favouring grouping with a UK focus. Upon closer
   examination, these groupings share similar views about the challenges
   and future of the sub-discipline. While the sub-discipline is becoming
   more diverse and international, US-focused literature remains dominant
   and distinct from UK-focused literature, although there are emerging
   sub-literatures which are well placed to link them together.},

Abstract = {New parties pose a challenge to the claim that time is an essential
   element in the construction of partisanship. By definition, new parties
   have not been around for much time, so the opportunities for the
   construction of meaningful attachments could be considered limited. In
   this paper, we test this expectation, unpacking the dynamics and
   implications of the attachment to new parties. Using panel data
   collected in Spain during a period of profound party system change, we
   estimate the extent to which partisanship with new parties is stable and
   strong, works as a heuristic for preference formation, and predicts vote
   choice. Our data suggest that attachments to new parties can be as
   meaningful as those that citizens have with old parties. These findings
   seem particularly relevant in a context where new parties are on the
   rise.},

Abstract = {We examine the rise and mobilizational dynamics of social democracy,
   employing data reported by the Swedish authorities on the distribution
   of voting eligibility, turnout and partisan vote in local elections
   during the 1910s at a high level of disaggregation (by narrow income
   segments and administrative units). In line with the existing
   literature, we show that electoral socialism depended on both the
   extension of the suffrage to its `natural' electorate, that is, the
   urban working class, and the organizational capacity of trade unions and
   other civic associations. In addition, we show that socialist support
   was not uniform within the working class - even for a highly homogeneous
   society. Instead, the social-democratic vote was initially stronger
   among low- to middle-income workers, only expanding to poor voters later
   in time. We complement our local data with an interwar panel analysis of
   socialist vote and post-war survey data.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the social-psychological mechanisms behind how
   citizens deal with uncertainties stemming from the COVID-19 vaccine
   developments in societies with prominent social/political cleavages. We
   argue that existing social/political tensions influence individuals'
   trust in institutions that are responsible for coping with crises
   through a motivated reasoning mechanism, which eventually shapes
   citizens' COVID-19 vaccine intentions. Using a nationally representative
   face-to-face survey conducted in the pre-vaccination period in Turkey,
   we demonstrate that both self-identifying as a Kurd or feeling close to
   an opposition party are associated with lower trust in institutions
   actively dealing with the pandemic, which in turn, results in weaker
   intentions for getting vaccinated. Testing our full theoretical model
   reveals that while ethnic and partisan identities do not directly
   influence vaccine intentions, they exhibit an indirect negative effect
   via institutional trust impeding the fight against the pandemic. We show
   that it is difficult to tackle a sudden collective threat that requires
   public cooperation with health policies if the society is strongly
   polarized. Our findings offer key policy implications for the
   vaccination phase of the pandemic, and contribute to the domains of
   public health, conflict studies and individual judgment and
   decision-making about social risks.},

Abstract = {A growing literature demonstrates the importance of both race and skin
   color in one's lived experiences, including interactions with police.
   Media discourse and anti-police brutality movements consistently
   emphasize race while little, if any, attention is given to skin color.
   This paper seeks to examine how Black Americans navigate the
   multidimensionality of race with respect to organizing efforts against
   institutionalized racism. Do Black Americans perceive skin color as
   informing police interactions or support incorporating skin color into
   anti-brutality movement messaging? Is self-identified skin color
   associated with these views? A combination of sixty-seven in-depth
   interviews and two national surveys of Black Americans reveals
   widespread recognition that darker-skinned Black people are more likely
   to be brutalized by police and feelings that Black Lives Matter
   organizing is implicitly associated with skin color. Yet there is
   general hesitancy for movement messaging to explicitly engage with
   subgroup disparities based on characteristics like skin color or gender.
   Among self-identified darker-skinned individuals, skin color is
   perceived as even more tightly interwoven with policing and there is
   more openness to discussing skin color alongside race. Overall, this
   mixed-methods project highlights how Black Americans perceive the
   multidimensionality of racialized interactions and, in search of
   justice, strategize responses through social movement organizing.},

Abstract = {In the politics of welfare, citizens often prioritize natives over
   immigrants. What conditions reduce welfare discrimination against
   immigrants? Original survey experiments from the United States, the
   United Kingdom, France, and Italy reveal that the divide between natives
   and immigrants remains the fundamental cleavage in the politics of
   welfare. All immigrants face welfare penalties, including immigrants
   from Western countries. Even young, progressive, highly educated, and
   economically secure native citizens strongly penalize immigrants.
   Although immigrants never fully overcome identity barriers, the welfare
   support gap between natives and immigrants decreases when immigrants
   have a long work history. A history of employment provides evidence of
   reciprocity through past contributions and signals immigrants'
   commitment to the community. Other immigrants' characteristics, such as
   higher education and proactive work attitude, fail to decrease the gap.
   This article contributes to the study of solidarity in diverse societies
   and the impact of immigration on the welfare state.},

Abstract = {This article starts from the premise that those who debate and study the
   expansion of demoi/electorates - from practitioners to empirical
   scholars and normative theorists - should consider more seriously that
   migrants are always immigrants and emigrants at the same time. Doing so
   implies, first, that states can regulate their electorates through four
   distinct ``enfranchisement regimes{''} in times of transnational
   mobility: (1) national, (2) territorial, (3) generally inclusive, and
   (4) generally exclusive. Second, because the spread of dual/multiple
   citizenship is strongly intertwined with the expansion of the
   electorates beyond residency and/or nationality, various enfranchisement
   regimes have inherent consequences for the architecture of the
   international order and for political equality. Arguing that they have
   been largely overlooked, in this article we systematically tease out
   these consequences. We then apply our conceptual insights in a public
   opinion survey conducted among resident citizens across 26 European
   countries. We ask them about their preferred composition of the
   electorate, offering them all four regulatory options. Two results stand
   out. First, generally exclusive and generally inclusive regimes receive
   unexpectedly strong support. Second, support for different
   enfranchisement regimes varies strongly across European countries. We
   conclude by stressing how these insights are relevant to related
   normative and empirical discourses.},

Abstract = {Territorial politics research often emphasizes the importance of
   relative state/substate identities. Conventionally, researchers capture
   relative national identity through the Linz-Moreno question, but
   previous research demonstrates the limitations of this measure. Many
   researchers now use Relative Territorial Identity (RTI) as an
   alternative. However, the potential limitations of this approach are yet
   to be explored. I provide that examination here. After reiterating the
   limits of the Linz-Moreno question, I use data for England, Scotland,
   and Wales to highlight that RTI has similar issues to the Linz-Moreno
   (linearity, intensity, dual identity). Following this, I use data from
   Flanders and Wallonia to demonstrate the limits of conflating attachment
   and identity when using RTI, as respondents treat the concepts
   differently. Overall, these results highlight the limits of existing
   measures of relative identity, which have important implications for how
   researchers examine substate territories.},

Abstract = {Despite often being characterized as the ``model minority,{''} Asian
   Pacific Americans (APAs) have several challenges when it comes to their
   roles in the discipline of political science. Even the categorization of
   APAs as a single entity runs into problems when we consider the many
   countries that constitute Asia and the distinct experiences of Asians
   vs. those of Asian Americans within our discipline. In addition, the
   issues facing APAs also differ significantly based on gender. Each of
   these layers adds complexity to create a common experience from which we
   can learn and share important lessons. However, there are several themes
   that reemerge and can help APA faculty prepare for the challenges they
   face in the discipline, help our colleagues better support APA faculty,
   and help universities create more inclusive environments that will
   benefit both faculty and students alike. In this essay, I focus on three
   areas of importance to understanding the challenges APAs, and more
   specifically APA women, face in our discipline. First, I address the
   unique set of challenges many APAs face in the classroom. Second, I
   discuss the problems many APA women face with their colleagues or within
   their institutions. Finally, I analyze how institutions of higher
   education and our discipline, in general, can offer more support to the
   study of the APA experience. The goal of this essay is to not only raise
   awareness of the challenges APAs face, thereby offering support to other
   APA faculty, but to also offer suggestions for ways to improve the
   discipline of political science to make APAs fed more included and
   supported.},

Abstract = {This essay responds to Fikret Adaman and Pat Devine's application of the
   negotiated-coordination framework to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and
   climate crisis. It does so by contextualizing these crises in the light
   of capitalism's racialized and imperialist history, thereby
   problematizing their use of Polanyi's embeddedness framework and
   socialist democracy. Specifically, if the consequences of racial
   capitalism and imperialism are not actively addressed, the economic will
   be subordinated to social and political institutions that retain their
   racialized and imperialist character. The essay thus explores the
   consequences of the dispossession of racialized people and of the Global
   South in the context of the pandemic and the climate crisis,
   concretizing and illustrating those concerns and concluding that a
   system of negotiated coordination limited to stakeholder democracy is
   insufficient. Instead, this coordination must prioritize the needs and
   knowledge of racialized people and the Global South.},

Abstract = {2021 has been a year marking a turning point in the struggle against the
   pandemic and a time of economic and social transition in European Member
   States (MS). Italy has fared quite well in comparison to other MS, both
   with regard to the efficacy of its vaccination campaign and with regard
   to the drafting of its National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP).
   Most of these successes can certainly be explained by the change of
   government, and by a revolution in the style of leadership, due to the
   arrival in office of the new prime minister, Mario Draghi. Yet, it is
   not entirely clear to what extent Draghi's leadership has substantially
   changed Italian politics, especially in the management of periods of
   crisis. To what extent have unresolved problems in Italian politics been
   tackled, and to what extent do they persist? Is Draghi's new leadership
   style a fleeting phenomenon, or has it triggered a substantial change in
   the functioning of the Italian polity? After establishing the
   distinguishing characteristics of Draghi's leadership, the article
   describes the most significant of the positive and successful measures
   adopted by the Government, not forgetting those that were less positive
   and less successful. Then we discuss the impact of those political,
   institutional and policy legacies that could have hindered the scope and
   efficacy of the Government's actions.},

Abstract = {The ``right to development{''} (RTD) is an important third generation
   human right that interrelates political and economic rights, challenging
   traditional economistic conceptions of development. However, the
   abstract arid socially neutral human rights framework of the RTD results
   in problematic ambiguities. The relative weights of individual and
   collective rights to development, and political and economic aspects of
   the RTD are unclear. This renders the RTD ``operationally
   meaningless{''} and vulnerable to co-optation. I argue that capitalism
   is inimical to the realization of the RTD, owing to its exploitative,
   alienating, arid crisis-ridden character. Development cannot be properly
   understood as an abstract right but must be conceived as a concrete
   historical process of socialist transition. Development is neither a
   purely technical nor a purely ethical process, but a fundamentally
   social and intersocietal one. The dialectic of forces and relations of
   production is at the heart of this process, therefore development
   necessitates going beyond capitalist relations of production. Thus, the
   framework of socialist transition foregrounds the systemic roots of
   underdevelopment, and in doing so provides a basis for prioritizing
   between contradictory development policies. Hence, development should be
   understood and pursued through historical materialism and socialist
   praxis rather than a rights-based approach.},

Abstract = {This article has an analytical and a constructive aim. The former
   consists in providing a taxonomy of the different ways progress can be
   defined, according to two variables: whether progress is conceived of in
   either a teleological or a processual way, and whether it relies on
   either a realist or a moralist approach to political normativity. After
   laying out the four resulting combinations, I proceed with the critical
   aim. This consists in proposing an argument for how political progress
   should be conceived of. To do so, I first show that some teleological
   accounts of progress paradoxically risk being conservative, while
   processual ones are politically progressive and should therefore be
   privileged over the former. Second, and relatedly, I shed light on which
   are the standards for a genuinely progressive notion of political
   progress. Finally, I argue that a processual realist notion of political
   progress is more able than the rival conceptions to comply with these
   standards.},

Abstract = {Does comparative advantage explain legislators' support for trade
   liberalization? We use data on potential crop yields as determined by
   weather and soil characteristics to derive a new plausibly exogenous
   measure of comparative advantage in agriculture for each district in the
   United States. Evidence shows that comparative advantage in agriculture
   predicts how legislators vote on the ratification of preferential trade
   agreements in Congress. We show that legislators in districts with high
   agricultural comparative advantage are more likely to mention that trade
   agreements are good for agriculture in House floor debates preceding
   roll call votes on their ratifications. Individuals living in the same
   districts are also more likely to support free trade. Our analysis and
   results contribute to the literature on the political economy of trade
   and its distributional consequences and to our understanding of the
   economic determinants of legislators' voting decisions.},

Title = {When Autocrats Threaten Citizens with Violence: Evidence from China},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {52},
Number = {2},
Pages = {671-696},

Abstract = {When do autocrats employ propaganda to threaten citizens with
   repression? Do threats of repression condition citizen behavior? This
   article develops a theory of propaganda-based threats in autocracies
   that builds on insights from experimental psychology. It argues that
   even credible threats of repression are costly, and so are reserved for
   moments when collective action is most likely. Since threats of
   repression are employed sparingly, the authors also expect them to be
   effective. The theory is tested using data from China, the world's most
   populous autocracy. The study analyzes all 164,707 articles published
   between 2009 and 2016 in the Workers' Daily, a state-run newspaper that
   focuses on domestic issues and targets a non-elite audience. It finds
   that the Chinese government employs propaganda-based threats of
   repression primarily around the anniversaries of ethnic separatist
   movements in Tibet and Xinjiang regions. Using an instrumental variables
   strategy, the study shows that these threats decrease protest rates by a
   substantively meaningful margin.},

Abstract = {Do individuals reveal their true preferences when asked for their
   support for an ongoing war? This research note presents the results of a
   list experiment implemented in the midst of the Russian invasion of
   Ukraine. Our experiment allows us to estimate the extent of preference
   falsification with regard to support for the war by comparing the
   experimental results with a direct question. Our data comes from an
   online sample of 3000 Russians. Results show high levels of support for
   the war and significant levels of preference falsification: when asked
   directly, 71\% of respondents support the war, while this share drops to
   61\% when using the list experiment. Preference falsification is
   particularly pronounced among individuals using TV as a main source of
   news. Our results imply that war leaders can pursue peace without
   fearing a large popular backlash, but also show that high levels of
   support for war can be sustained even once the brutality of the war has
   become clear.},

Abstract = {The article deals the economic leadership in the first presidential term
   of Felipe Gonz??lez (1982-1986). He served as a charismatic and
   innovative leader among an economic team of young ministers, with an
   elitist and technical profile, as well as with extensive university
   training. The ministers and the socialist president led deep reforms of
   liberalization and modernization of the national economy to address the
   economic and industrial crisis. Some of these reforms are analyzed
   through historical and biographical methods, considering the
   perspectives and autobiographic stories of the economic responsible of
   the first government of Gonz??lez. It is shown that the economic reforms
   were carried out under a team and choral leadership between the
   president and his economic ministers, especially Joaquin Almunia, Miguel
   Boyer and Carlos Solchaga. Both the President and the aforementioned
   ministers were guided by a pragmatic character and avoided classical
   socialism. This implied addressing economic problems that remained
   pending in the Transition, and also failing to fulfill various electoral
   promises of the PSOE in the general elections of 1982.},

Title = {Trust in Public Policy Algorithms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 APR 1},
Abstract = {Algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in many areas of
   public policy. Yet, we know surprisingly little about the degree of
   trust individuals are willing to place in these algorithms. This article
   reports on a series of experiments on trust in algorithms for
   forecasting political events and criminal recidivism. Contrary to
   previous literature on algorithm aversion, we find that people show high
   levels of trust in algorithms relative to other sources of advice, even
   with minimal information about the algorithm. We also explore evaluation
   of combined human and algorithm advice. We find that, when experts make
   decisions in light of algorithm advice, the relative weight given to
   their judgments increases, but the algorithm's guidance is not
   disregarded. Finally, using a conjoint experiment, we evaluate the
   factors that influence people's preferences for algorithms, finding that
   risk aversion, data size, human in the loop, and developer reputation
   play an important role in engendering trust.},

Abstract = {Past findings on the connection between class position and political
   preferences are overwhelmingly derived from cross-sectional studies,
   which provided a limited basis for inferring causality. This study uses
   long-term panel data on thousands of British respondents to measure the
   impact of intra-generational class mobility across a range of political
   identities and preferences. Upward class mobility leads to small
   increases in economic conservatism, but party choice, class identity and
   attitudes to non-economic issues do not change. This updating of
   economic values is much smaller than cross-sectional differences between
   classes. These results are consistent with the short-run effects of
   class mobility operating primarily through a limited economic
   self-interest mechanism. Beliefs that are plausibly unconnected to
   economics are unaffected. The overall association between class and a
   range of identities, opinions and preferences is therefore more likely
   to be caused by early life experiences and longer-term socialization
   than by the immediate material interests associated with jobs.},

Abstract = {We use Volden and Wiseman's (2014) Legislative Effectiveness Scores and
   Interest and Legislative Effectiveness Scores to estimate the effect of
   legislative effectiveness on House members' success at raising campaign
   funds from political action committees (PACs) from 1992 through 2014. We
   show that legislative effectiveness is rewarded by PACs, the rewards are
   greater in policy domains relevant to business PACs, and the fundraising
   value of legislative effectiveness is larger in policy areas that are
   more gridlocked. PAC directors are able to identify and direct funds to
   effective lawmakers in the policy contexts in which they are most
   effective. Our results demonstrate the ability of well-heeled PAC
   sectors to reward legislators who are active on their issues,
   reinforcing concerns that the interest group system biases voice toward
   wealthier interests in American society.},

Abstract = {Despite the rising electoral success of independent local parties in
   many European countries, empirical evidence about their members is still
   rare. Therefore, the study aims to answer three questions to reach new
   insights: Who are these members? Which incentives motivate them to join,
   and how is intra-party participation structured? Based on a
   cross-sectional postal survey in Germany, the results show that members
   of independent local parties and national parties have mostly the same
   socioeconomic background and thus differ from the average general
   population. Independent local party members join their organisations
   mainly to promote an apolitical style of local decision-making and
   facilitate local democracy. Within independent local parties, different
   types of participation are present; while some members are fully
   engaged, others are mainly involved as elected representatives in public
   office or interested in social exchange. The interplay of membership
   incentives, civic skills and individual resources explains the variation
   of intra-party participation, whereby membership incentives are the most
   powerful explanatory factor. This study shows that independent local
   parties represent an alternative for those who have joined national
   parties, to date. Thus, they provide an essential linkage between
   citizens and the (local) political system.},

Abstract = {The effects of COVID-19 on democracy and mental health are still under
   investigation. In this article, it is considered that, on average,
   higher COVID-19 stressors and symptoms of distress are associated with
   lower political support and that higher COVID-19 stressors are
   associated with higher symptoms of mental/emotional distress. This
   formulation was tested by conducting two online surveys in Britain in
   August 2020 and March 2021. Strong support was found for this
   hypothesis. Greater worry about COVID-19 life changes is associated with
   a lower evaluation of government performance on the pandemic and with a
   lower perceived responsiveness of the political system; higher COVID-19
   stress resulting from anti-pandemic measures is associated with a poorer
   evaluation of government performance and, subsequently, with less trust
   in government. It was also found that higher COVID-19 worry and stress
   were associated with more symptoms of mental/emotional distress. These
   findings highlight that pandemic-related stressors may influence
   people's political engagement and mental health.},

Abstract = {The goals of this study are to identify the determinants of the fear of
   cyberterrorism and to compare these to the determinants of the fear of
   terrorism as well as the fear of a terrorist attack. As no empirical
   study has yet tested what predicts the fear of cyberterrorism, the
   current research used variables from the fear of terrorism literature to
   explore the impact of these factors on the fear of cyberterrorism. Based
   on nationally representative data from the 2018 American Fears Survey (N
   = 1190), our analytic results indicated that fear of cyberterrorism is a
   distinct fear when compared to terrorism and terrorist attacks in terms
   of their predictors, and age and education are significant determinants
   for fear of cyberterrorism, but not for the two terror-related fears in
   our sample. Other similarities and differences between the three
   measures of terror-related fear are also discussed in the study.},

Abstract = {Over the last several decades, Gallup data shows an increased
   willingness among members of the public to support presidential
   candidates from a wide range of religious backgrounds, though a
   nontrivial proportion of the public is still unwilling to vote for an
   Atheist, Mormon, or Muslim. What underlies this opposition? We argue
   that voters evaluate candidates from religious out-groups more
   negatively on a wide range of dimensions considered desirable for
   political office, and that this bias should be more pronounced among the
   highly religious. We show support for these arguments using a survey
   experiment fielded with YouGov. Atheists and Muslim candidates were
   perceived more negatively on a large set of traits considered desirable
   for political office compared to candidates from religious in-groups,
   and Mormon candidates fall somewhere in between. The Atheist and Muslim
   candidates were also perceived as less competent on a diverse set of
   issues.},

Abstract = {The UK Government's decision to establish the Women and Equalities
   Committee in 2015 redressed an institutional deficit at Westminster-the
   lack of a Departmental Select Committee holding the Women's Minister and
   Government Equalities Office to account. This `effective' reform was by
   no means a foregone conclusion, however. A feminist institutionalist
   (FI) approach demonstrates the limitations of traditional accounts of
   institutional change in accounting for this reform. With greater
   analytical space given to women's agency and introducing the concept of
   gendered parliamentarianism, FI captures the gendered constraints and
   conducive conditions that marked this moment of parliamentary
   re-gendering: identifying the critical role of women MPs; the new
   relations between them and women parliamentary Clerks and officials and
   the wider-crucially gendered-(extra) parliamentary actors and dynamics
   in play.},

Abstract = {We use the case of education interest groups to examine how and when
   policy changes lead interest groups to polarize in their support for
   political parties. Using over 145,000 campaign contributions from all 50
   states from 2000 to 2017, we test whether the passage of private school
   choice, charter laws, and labor retrenchment policies led to the
   polarization of education interest groups over time. In 2000, teachers
   unions were the dominant group and mostly aligned with Democrats.
   Meanwhile, Republicans lacked support from any education groups. This
   pattern was consistent across states. Over time, coalitions in some
   states became polarized, meaning unions grew even more aligned with
   Democrats and reform groups with Republicans, while other states did not
   experience such polarization. We show that private school choice
   programs, but not labor retrenchment or charter laws, contributed to

   both sides and a wide variety of interest groups and parties. We
   contribute to filling this gap by making several interconnected new
   datasets publicly available. The Party-Interest Group Relationships in
   Contemporary Democracies (PAIRDEM) datasets include cross-national data
   from three different surveys of (1) central party organizations, (2)
   legislative party groups, and (3) interest groups. A fourth dataset
   based on coding of party statutes and party finance data was established
   together with the Political Party Database The datasets contain novel
   indicators on party-group relationships in up to 21 mature democracies.
   In this research note, we first present the main content of the datasets
   and the research design. Second, we present descriptive statistics
   documenting the extent of organizational ties between parties and groups
   in contemporary democracies. Third, we illustrate more advanced usage
   through a simple application.},

Abstract = {Central to the debate of what constitutes tolerance has been what is
   tolerable-and who is tolerant. While the existing literature has engaged
   with the role of religion in tolerance, there is almost no empirical
   work on individuals without religion. Not surprisingly, theory relevant
   to this question is largely absent in the current literature. Therefore,
   using extensive work in political theory, we derive the notion that the
   non-religious and atheists will show greater tolerance given a stronger
   adherence to the value of pluralism. We merge this theory with the
   modern empirical literature and use four waves of the World Values
   Survey (waves 3, 4, 5, and 6) to provide a substantive test using a
   novel measure of tolerance as a crucial individual value. We find that
   the value of pluralism does distinguish tolerance levels among the
   self-identified non-religious, although less so for atheists.},

Title = {Spillover Effects in Political Advertising: Evidence from Judicial
   Elections},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 25},
Abstract = {We develop a simple theory of information spillovers within political
   advertising: individuals use information conveyed by candidate-specific
   ads to evaluate other candidates seeking different offices. We test the
   theory by linking state court of last resort election returns with a
   complete set of gubernatorial, congressional, and state supreme court
   political advertisements in 2010. We show that up-ballot advertisements
   about crime have spillover effects on judicial race outcomes.
   Specifically, fearful references to crime in non-judicial campaign
   advertisements decrease judicial incumbent vote share, while
   enthusiastic references to crime increase incumbent vote share. We
   estimate that cumulative spillover effects from crime ads in
   gubernatorial and congressional advertising campaigns in 2010 decreased
   incumbent justices' average expected vote share, affecting the outcome
   of at least one state supreme court election in 2010. We show that ads
   affect vote choice by providing information to voters, rather than by
   priming local crime rates. We also conduct two placebo tests to validate
   our results. Overall, these findings provide evidence of ads' political
   effectiveness, while our research design proposes a conceptual framework
   for understanding advertising effects in context.},

Abstract = {My five critics all raise important points, giving reasons for viewing
   my account as either insufficiently or overly realist or utopian. By and
   large, I stick to my guns in regarding my version of a realistic Utopia
   of a republican association of states as the most plausible way of
   achieving a non-dominating global order capable of meeting the moral and
   functional challenges to state sovereignty posed by cosmopolitanism and
   globalisation respectively.},

Abstract = {With the announced end of Angela Merkel's tenure as Chancellor, the 2021
   German federal election was particularly charged. In stark contrast to
   the Social Democratic Party, which became more united as the election
   approached, the Christian Democrats were not able to consolidate the
   fissures unveiled by Merkel's departure. The Greens, emboldened by the
   polls, for the first time joined the traditional major parties in
   nominating a chancellor candidate. The result was a campaign period that
   centred heavily on the three-way race between Olaf Scholz (SPD), Armin
   Laschet (CDU/CSU) and Annalena Baerbock (Greens). The electoral outcome
   reduced the large number of coalitions discussed against the backdrop of
   a fragmenting party system and eventually led to a novel partnership on
   the federal level, a so-called traffic light coalition between the
   Social Democrats, Greens, and the Liberals. The formation of this
   coalition was facilitated by the refusal of Social and Christian
   Democrats to even consider renewing their `grand' coalition, a newfound
   self-confidence on behalf of Greens and Liberals as well as the symbolic
   benefit that this novel alliance brought together the election winners.
   In many ways, the electoral result and the coalition it engendered
   represent new beginnings in German politics but significant hurdles to
   the consolidation of these patterns remain.},

Abstract = {Both urbanization and a high share of youth ({''}youth bulge{''}) have
   been shown to correlate with higher levels of political violence, in
   general, and terrorism, in particular. In this article, we test the
   hypothesis that urbanization and general youth bulge (share of aged
   15-29 in the adult population) should produce a particularly significant
   impact on the level of terrorist activity when acting together due to
   the interaction effect. Performed negative binomial regressions (both
   with and without interaction term) support this hypothesis. We also test
   the impact of ``urban youth bulge{''} (share of urban youth in the total
   adult population), and it turns out to be a much more significant
   predictor of terrorism than either general youth bulge or urbanization
   taken separately. This finding is shown to have substantial practical
   implications, indicating that urban youth bulges are likely to retain
   their relevance in the forthcoming decades, in contrast to general youth
   bulges.},

Abstract = {A growing number of left-wing scholars criticize practices of
   transnational solidarity. Pointing to the cooptation of ``globalism{''}
   by neoliberal capitalism, these scholars utilize this critique to
   advance leftwing nationalism. In this article, I reconstruct symptomatic
   texts of this genre and identify the critique of (liberal)
   cosmopolitanism as the common denominator in their calls for
   nationalizing the Left. As a consequence of their opposition to
   cosmopolitanism, these authors reject freedom of movement or global
   justice activism. In order to examine whether the project of
   transnational solidarity is affected by this critique, I reconstruct its
   justifications in Critical Theory and postcolonial-feminist theory.
   Hauke Brunkhorst and Chandra Mohanty exemplarily theorize transnational
   solidarity in different ways, but each based on a substantial critique
   of liberal cosmopolitanism. By that, I show that a principled return to
   nationalism derived from a critique of cosmopolitanism is informed by
   coincidental evidence that rejects practices of transnational solidarity
   because of their alleged embeddedness in cosmopolitan reason. Drawing on
   La Via Campesina, I illustrate principles of a transnational solidarity
   project that is not justified with liberal cosmopolitan ideas. Their
   experiences challenge the nationalist/statist critique while not falling
   back into naive and/or neoliberal cosmopolitanism.},

Abstract = {The Public Accounts Committee is the oldest and, reputedly, most
   influential oversight committee in the British parliament. Since 2012,
   the government has published an unprecedented volume of data explaining
   its actions in response to the PAC's inquiries. By tracking all 615 of
   the Committee's recommendations from 2010 to 2012 across the first 14 of
   these `progress reports', we explore how effectively this novel
   reporting mechanism serves to inform parliament about the executive's
   responsiveness to scrutiny. We find the reports to yield rich data on
   the fate of many individual recommendations, but only limited
   information on the overall timeliness and quality of implementation.
   Flexibilities and inconsistencies in reporting style also make the
   arrangements vulnerable to gaming. We identify potential improvements
   and research opportunities.},

Abstract = {There is no evidence that the founders of the Caucus for a New Political
   Science (CNPS) put much thought into the organization's name because it
   was initially founded as an ad hoc caucus and there was no expectation
   that it would still exist more than a half-century later. However, even
   in the intellectual context of the late 1960s and early 1970s, the name
   ``New Political Science{''} was something of an oddity as comparable
   dissident movements in other social science and humanities disciplines
   were adopting the terms Radical or Critical to name their new insurgent
   organizations. After decades of debate, the CNPS finally voted in
   September 2021 to change its name to the Caucus for a Critical Political
   Science and to adopt a new mission statement identifying it as ``an
   association of critical scholars committed to making the study of
   political science relevant to building a more democratic and egalitarian
   economic, social, and political order.{''}},

Abstract = {In this paper I critically discuss the pros and cons of working with
   research brokers from a political science perspective. I do this by
   sharing my experiences of collaborating with two types of local
   ``fixers{''} - cultural and communal brokers. I argue that even if
   similar approaches risk introducing a number of broker-induced biases,
   countermeasures can be taken to mitigate their effect: e.g. continuous
   triangulation, interviewing ``sleepers{''} and asking in-depth questions
   to exclude interviewees who misrepresent themselves. However,
   researchers must be aware that working with multiple brokers can also
   generate methodological and ethical challenges that need to be taken
   into consideration.},

Title = {The effect of economic downturns on voter turnout in Africa},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The academic literature provides two competing hypotheses about the
   effect of economic downturns on voter turnout: the `mobilisation'
   hypothesis, according to which people go to the polls to express their
   discontent with the government's performance; and the `withdrawal'
   hypothesis, according to which people stay at home on election day,
   either to attend to more immediate, pressing concerns or to punish the
   incumbent. In this paper, we test these hypotheses against novel data
   from 317 presidential elections in 40 African countries over the period
   from 1960 to 2016. We find that economic growth has a positive effect on
   voter turnout, consistent with the `withdrawal' hypothesis. The paper
   contributes to the literature in three ways. First, it provides the most
   comprehensive macro level analysis of voter turnout in Africa to-date.
   Second, it proves that African voters respond to changes in aggregate
   economic measures, thus contributing to the growing literature on
   economic voting in Africa. Finally, it demonstrates that African voters
   behave in a way that is consistent with the `withdrawal' hypothesis.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {379-389},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {This article describes a simple two-player game which illustrates basic
   concepts of brinkmanship, to include calculations of probability and
   expected outcomes, and risk-taking profiles. The game befits a single
   50-minute class period with introduction, gameplay, and discussion. The
   game can supplement the study of conflict from classic Cold War case
   studies of crisis bargaining, to arms control, or negotiating
   international protocols for global climate change such as the Paris
   Agreement. The Brinkmanship Game was developed for the seventh week of a
   10-week graduate course called Game Theory and Decisionmaking: Exploring
   Strategic Situations. The course features a flipped classroom with class
   time devoted to experimentation, gameplay, and discussion of readings
   and games; lectures are online. The Brinkmanship Game would be
   appropriate for students in any advanced undergraduate or graduate level
   course in international relations, security studies, negotiation, or
   game theory. The Brinkmanship Game provides an active learning
   opportunity that can be valuable for encouraging students to come to
   their own understanding of concepts of mutual risk-taking. The authors
   have found the game to be effective in the classroom and hope it may
   prove valuable to those searching for ways to motivate students and to
   help them learn.},

Title = {Going into Government: How Hiring from Special Interests Reduces Their
   Influence},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {485-498},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Governments routinely decide to involve special interests in the
   development of public policy, a practice that can distort policy
   outcomes away from the public interest. Many are concerned that these
   policy distortions increase when special interest aligned
   individuals-such as lobbyists, activists or industry insiders-go into
   government. Using a formal model that centers the role of policymaking
   capacity in the development of policy, we demonstrate this is not always
   what happens. Our analysis provides two core insights. First, when an
   individual from a special interest group goes into government, this can
   paradoxically reduce the special interest's influence over public
   policy. Second, this individual has an endogenous incentive to enter
   government even though doing so weakens the special interest, whose
   preferences the individual shares. The model suggests that politicians'
   efforts to stop the practice of hiring individuals from special interest
   groups can counterintuitively increase special interest influence over
   politics.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {315-332},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Business associations engage in dialogue with policy makers-and
   sometimes succeed in influencing policy outcomes. One strategy-largely
   overlooked by researchers-involves seeking appointment to government
   boards and committees. This is an important omission since many
   committees review, draft and implement policies and regulations.
   Securing representation on government committees could thus lead to
   considerable influence but little is known about the extent to which
   interest groups seek such appointments. And very little is known about
   dialogue in developing countries, especially those that seek a
   consensual rather than an adversarial approach to policy formulation.
   This research, based on desk research of government committee membership
   and interviews with business associations, thus addresses two gaps. It
   has been undertaken in a developing country, Kenya, since there is a
   relatively small number of interest groups compared to other countries
   of a similar population. This research focuses on the efforts of
   interest groups, and business groups in particular, to place nominees on
   government committees. This article highlights the level of regulatory
   activity in Kenya effectively delegated to government boards and
   committees and demonstrates the apparent success of business
   associations in securing participation in a majority of the committees
   with a regulatory function. It argues, however, that interest groups
   could be more professional and more strategic when they are represented
   on government committees.},

Abstract = {Social scientists have documented rapid polarization in public opinion
   about COVID-19 policies. Such polarization is somewhat unsurprising
   given experimental studies that show opinions on novel issues can
   diverge quickly in the presence of partisan frames. In this paper I
   describe a different process that operates alongside polarization: not
   centrism but a lack of opinion formation. Drawing on four rounds of
   in-depth interviews with 86 Midwesterners, conducted between June 2019
   and November 2020, I take an inductive approach to understanding
   variation in the processes by which people gathered and interpreted
   information about COVID-19. I find that those with universal distrust in
   all media struggled to adjudicate between conflicting interpretations of
   reality, particularly if they also had low political knowledge. The
   result was that they felt little confidence in any opinions they formed.
   These findings suggest that deteriorating trust in media is an important
   and understudied factor shaping trajectories of opinion formation.},

Abstract = {Defections within the ruling elite often endanger authoritarian rule,
   emboldening opposition groups and paving the way for regime breakdown.
   Yet, the consequences of elite defections are better understood than
   their causes. Why do some authoritarian regimes experience more
   defections to the opposition than others? This paper develops a theory
   of the origins of elite defection and tests it using a novel dataset
   based on the political careers of 15,013 legislative deputies and
   ministers in 12 electoral autocracies. The theory predicts that regime
   elites defect when there are greater opportunities to capitalize on the
   discontent of other regime elites and voters. Regimes with weak party
   mechanisms that are also supported by many factions experience more
   defections. Finally, defections increase during economic downturns and
   when the government's control of mass media declines, which helps
   potential defectors coordinate with anti-regime voters.},

Abstract = {While the literature on the definition, features, and establishment of
   hybrid regimes has been extensive, a gap exists about their internal
   dynamics. The article develops a four-stage model of the political cycle
   to trace changes in input and output legitimacy. Using Hungary as a case
   study, it shows a downward spiral of corruption and ideological
   degeneration due to the inherent contradictions between the initial
   promises and the real objectives of governance. These developments have
   undermined output and input legitimacy as shown by the changing
   composition of government supporters toward poorer, less educated,
   rural, older people and the increasing manipulation of the electoral
   process. Such dynamics imply significant vulnerabilities for the regime.},

Abstract = {Many policy problems require taking costly action today for future
   benefits. Examining the case of climate change, this paper examines how
   two institutions-electoral rules and interest group
   intermediation-structure the distributional politics of climate change
   and as a result, drive variation in climate ``policy investments{''}
   across the high-income democracies. Proportional electoral rules
   increase electoral safety, allowing politicians to impose short-term
   costs on voters. Concertation between industry and the state enables
   governments to compensate losers, defusing organized opposition to
   policy change. Moreover, the joint presence of both institutions
   generates complementarities that reinforce their independent effects,
   pushing countries onto different climate politics trajectories. Newly
   available data on climate policy stringency provide empirical support
   for the arguments. Countries with PR and interest group concertation
   have the highest levels of policy stringency and distribute higher costs
   toward consumers. The analysis points to causal mechanisms that should
   structure policy responses to a more general set of long-term
   challenges.},

Abstract = {We explore whether including cultural reforms in an intra-state peace
   accord facilitates its success. We distinguish between accommodationist
   and integrationist cultural provisions and employ a mixed research
   method combining negative binomial regression on a data set of all
   intra-state political agreements concluded between 1989 and 2017, and an
   in-depth analysis of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement for Northern
   Ireland. We recognize the important reassuring effect of
   accommodationist cultural reforms in separatist conflicts. However, we
   also find that they have an important and hitherto overlooked
   reputational effect across all conflict types. By enhancing the
   reputation of negotiating leaders, accommodationist cultural provisions
   contribute to ending violence by preventing leadership challenges, rebel
   fragmentation and remobilization across all civil conflicts. By the same
   logic, and despite the overwhelming emphasis of peace agreements on
   integrationist cultural initiatives, integrationist cultural reforms
   problematize leaders' ability to commit to pacts and to ensure
   compliance among their rank and file.},

Abstract = {Do parties matter for climate policy-making? This question is not only
   relevant because domestic efforts are essential to the global climate
   governance regime, but also because climate politics has often been
   perceived as more party politicised than environmental politics in
   general. In this article, we address this question at the local level,
   which has rarely been analysed in research on the ``parties matter
   hypothesis{''}. Focussing on the State of Hessen in Germany, we first
   investigate whether party differences play a role in the decision of the
   Hessian municipalities to join the climate network ``Hessen aktiv: Die
   Klima-Kommunen.{''} Second, we study whether party differences matter
   with regard to the preparation of mandatory action plans by the network
   members. Our analysis draws on an event history analysis of all Hessian
   municipalities from 2009 to 2020. The results tentatively suggest that
   the probability of membership increases with a Green Party mayor. We
   find no indication that the party affiliation of mayors is related to
   the preparation of action plans, and therefore to a more concrete
   climate political commitment. However, the probability of preparing an
   action plan increases with a stronger representation of the Greens in
   municipal councils. Taken together, these heterogeneous results
   demonstrate that partisan theory might also contribute to explaining
   differences in local climate policies and that the local level deserves
   further scholarly attention in this regard.},

Abstract = {Political scientists and legal scholars debate the value of judicial
   elections, including the degree to which elections effectively hold
   incumbent judges accountable. In this paper, we provide a causally
   identified estimate of the incumbency advantage in judicial elections.
   We assemble an original dataset of over 5300 partisan, single-member
   trial court elections from six U.S. states. Employing a regression
   discontinuity design, we demonstrate that incumbents enjoy electoral
   advantages of more than twenty percentage points due solely to being an
   incumbent. In contrast to research from other electoral settings, we
   find that these advantages are due largely to a scare-off effect, where
   even a narrow victory dramatically decreases the probability that an
   incumbent party will be challenged in the next election. Our findings
   highlight the sizable electoral returns to holding judicial office,
   reveal how the nature of the incumbency advantage varies across
   electoral settings, and provide compelling evidence of the challenges to
   holding trial court judges accountable through elections.},

Abstract = {Russian leaders first tried to poison him, then unlawfully imprisoned
   him, and now are publicly torturing him. His enemies see him as an
   illegitimate pretender to the Russian throne. His fans are captivated by
   his ability to survive assassinations and withstand torture. I was among
   those who nominated Alexey Navalny for the Nobel Peace Prize. Though he
   has not received it, this failure exposes meaningful though
   underappreciated truths about Russia and about the world. My story will
   leap back and forward between Navalny's individual actions, the
   peculiarities of Putinism, and global issues of neoliberal governance.},

Abstract = {This essay discusses the relation between Theodor W. Adorno and Herbert
   Marcuse, with their dialogue on the political events of the 1960s
   student movements as its main axis. While these two critical theorists
   are usually taken as antithetical in their positions regarding this
   issue, the essay problematizes such a dualist conception by resorting
   not only to their theoretical works but also to their unpublished
   correspondence and other public interventions. The aim is to
   contextualize such texts and letters to present a more complex view of
   the debate in question.},

Abstract = {This paper offers a rethinking of the concept of teleology in Marxist
   theory. In particular, I propose some reflections on Gyorgy Lukacs's
   teleology of labour, addressed in The Young Hegel and subsequently
   reworked in The Ontology of Social Being. Lukacs challenged an idealist
   notion of teleology understood as realisation of a transcendental
   principle posited a priori. He redefined the concept by showing how
   Hegel and Marx reintroduced the question of purpose as an essential
   quality of human labour. Against idealist conceptions, Lukacs reimagined
   teleology as a secular purpose inherent to human praxis and the key to
   thinking agency within a materialist concept of history. Accordingly, a
   Marxist concept of teleology should highlight what Ernst Bloch described
   as the ``anticipatory{''} character of consciousness, whereby teleology
   means the positing of an end that does not yet exist in reality and that
   exceeds the temporal horizon of the present. However, in his critique of
   Hegel, Lukacs illustrates the ambivalent and contradictory dimension of
   teleology, a perspective that constantly relapses into temporal closure
   and determinism. While proposing a radical reading of Hegel, Lukacs
   oscillates between the two extremes of a dialectical notion of teleology
   that he nonetheless helped to formulate.},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {How do nonprofit organizations (NPOs) engage in advocacy in dosed
   political regimes? This article studies nonprofit advocacy in Russia by
   focusing on strategies and explanatory factors. We argue that Russian
   NPOs rely on collaborative rather than confrontational strategies. They
   use official channels, person\& contact with state officials, strategies
   for resource exchange and evidence-based advocacy. Based on empirical
   research in eight regions, we show that nonprofit advocacy depends on
   both external (contextual) and internal (organizational) factors. NPOs
   have greater opportunity to engage in advocacy when the subnational
   institutional context and the policy field allow for their active
   participation in policy formation and implementation. Moreover, NPOs are
   more successful in their advocacy when they strategically use their
   capabilities (e.g., knowledge, expertise and skills) and emphasize
   mutual trust, loyalty and readiness to compromise. Our findings point to
   the relevance of collaborative forms of advocacy, particularly in
   constrained political environments such as Russia.},

Title = {Poland's Extra-EU Trade After the EU Accession},
Journal = {SIYASAL-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {117-135},
Abstract = {When Poland joined the European Union (EU) on May 1, 2004, it
   transferred its national competences in the field of external trade
   policy to the EU institutions. As a result, on the one hand, as of that
   date Poland may neither change duties on goods imported from outside of
   the EU, nor may it conclude trade agreements with third countries.
   Nowadays, Poland's intra-EU trade has reached ca. 65-75\% of its total
   foreign trade at the expense of the exchange with the rest of the world.
   Although the aforementioned numbers are high, they have not changed
   substantially since Poland's accession to the EU. However, due to the
   legal circumstances and limited national competences in the shaping of
   external trade relations, one could expect that geographic and product
   structure of Polish foreign trade havr changed and reshuffled over the
   last few years. Therefore, the article aims to identify changes in both
   directions and products in Poland's extra-EU imports and exports since
   the EU accession. To this end, we analysed changes in the value of
   Poland's foreign trade with partners from outside of the EU as well as
   some indices that show the concentration of Poland's trade and
   similarities or differences to the EU average. In order to get a closer
   look at Poland's position, we compared the aforementioned indices to
   those reported for other Visegrad Group (V4) countries. We examined
   changes that took place in the period of 2004-2019 and have identified
   trends in Poland's extra-EU trade that provide evidence of its greater
   similarity to the EU average, an effect of EU integration and higher
   diversification in the mix of partners from outside the EU.},

Abstract = {The European Union was the first international actor to realize the
   consequences of climate change and the impact it could have on European
   and global security. This process required decades of consistent study
   of climate risks, the development of measures to counteract
   environmental shocks and the conceptualization of climate security
   issues. With the adoption of the concept of strategic autonomy, the
   leadership of the European Union came to the conclusion that in order to
   become a full-fledged center of power in world politics, environmental
   security must be placed at the center of the common foreign, security
   and defence policy. This approach should include both theoretical
   innovative approaches and practical measures aimed at the systemic
   revival of climate and environmental security in Europe and beyond. The
   integration of climate security into the common security and defense
   strategy of the European Union has become a new and important area of
   its activity. Keywords: climate change, European security, European

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CYBER WARFARE AND TERRORISM},
Year = {2022},

Number = {1},
Abstract = {The global terrorism database (GTD) shows that 3.5\% of the total terror
   attacks across the world between 1970 to 2019 were targeted at tourists.
   A terror attack can be perpetrated by either a lone wolf or an
   affiliated terrorist. The analysis of the GTD conducted in this study
   shows that a terror attack targeted at tourists is 4.3 times more likely
   to have been perpetrated by a lone wolf than by affiliated terrorists.
   Since lone wolves operate individually, this finding implies that access
   control measures at tourist centers must regard individuals such as
   hawkers, newspaper vendors, freelance journalists, etc. who come around
   to do various businesses around tourists as potential terrorists until
   proven otherwise. Since lone wolves do not work for a terror group,
   tourist attraction centers located in the regions, territories, and
   countries with no presence of terror groups must not relax their
   counterterrorism control measures under the impression that they are
   safe from terror attacks.},

Abstract = {The peasant identity, the narrative as research, the citizen resistance
   and the critical pedagogy processes, have been acquiring importance in
   Colombia every day because the country is going through a
   re-signification period. That is why, making readings of these issues in
   different specific territories provides new conclusions on realities,
   indignations and possibilities of transformation. In this way, the
   present article analyzes the contributions to the peasant identity in
   the inhabitants of Mochuelo, a bogotan neighborhood in the Ciudad
   Bolivar area. The information were collected by a group of four teachers
   who have been carrying out critical pedagogical practices between 2015
   and 2020, around three central ideas: art as a component of cultural and
   identity transformation; education as a process to co-construct
   realities between teachers and communities; and the resistance as a life
   process that allows to change, move and mobilize. With this in mind,
   narrative research were applied, generating a discursive loop between
   the narrations of the teachers, videos made by the community and
   Freirean perspectives.},

Abstract = {Once again, the Ukrainian crisis has re-emerged after the Belarus-Russia
   joint defence exercise near the eastern border around October/November
   2021. In December 2021, almost 100,000 troops were sent by Russia
   towards the Ukrainian borders. In this context, the article explores all
   the possible dimensions of the current crisis and the responses of Kyiv.
   Moreover, it also assesses the role of the European Union in the
   empirical setback of Ukraine. To validate the arguments, the study
   incorporates qualitative content and discourse analysis in order to
   phenomenological evaluation of the speeches by governmental and European
   officials. The latest findings suggest that there was an ongoing
   dialogue between the Western alliance and Russia to escalate tensions.
   Moscow had shown that they don't have any intention to attack on Ukraine
   if the Russian interests are recently compromised. Then, there would be
   serious consequences.},

Abstract = {We analyze recent developments in Bolivia's politics through the lens of
   political cleavage theory, in particular cleavage displacement.
   Bolivia's current party system is characterized by a stable and dominant
   MAS at one end of the spectrum, and at the other a fractious, unstable
   collection of parties, movements, and other vehicles that have failed to
   articulate a coherent set of political ideas. It emerged when the
   previous party system collapsed in 2003-05, shifting politics from a
   conventional left-right axis of competition unsuited to Bolivian
   society, to an ethnic/rural vs. cosmopolitan/urban axis closely aligned
   with its major social cleavage. But society did not freeze in 2005. We
   analyze the deep roots of Bolivia's current politics, and explore
   emerging or changing generational, ethnic, urban-rural, regional, class,
   and religious divides. Understanding how cleavages interact to determine
   political outcomes allows us to make sense of the deep tensions and
   sources of instability that both Bolivia, and the MAS internally,
   currently face, and to shine a light on major coming challenges.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},

Abstract = {For many autistic performers in arts and entertainment, the stage can be
   an important site of self-advocacy and creative expression. Whereas
   everyday social interactions may be unpredictable, being onstage can
   allow autistic performers to work from a script and anticipate audience
   responses. This article explores the affordances and challenges of
   performance for young autistic adults in Canada through interviews with
   four autistic performers (two singers and two stand-up comics). While
   solo performance was the focus, participants discussed the creative
   employment of diverse media platforms, from the stage to screenwriting
   and children's books, and emphasized the need for autistic people to be
   involved in all creative realms. This research follows a Critical
   Disability Studies (CDS) framework which challenges deficit models of
   autism (McGuire, 2016), ``supercrip{''} tropes (Clare, 2015, p. 2), and
   narratives of overcoming autism (Chong; 2017). While one participant
   noted being uncomfortable with the sense that they were a source of
   inspiration for non-autistic audiences, each found it encouraging that
   autistic audiences relate to their work and might be motivated to
   participate in similar forms of self-advocacy; in particular, they noted
   the value of performance in building confidence. As previous CDS
   literature is wary of disability as spectacle (Darke, 1994), this
   research provides insight into how young autistic adults use their work
   onstage and behind the scenes to promote and perform self-advocacy.},

Abstract = {The introduction articulates some of the conceptual questions that
   emerge in investigating women's political thought in early modernity, in
   Europe and beyond. Four aspects are particularly crucial: the nexus
   between politics and theology, in the light of the pervasiveness of
   religion in everyday life and women's intellectual elaboration; the
   relationship with political power, that women both criticize and
   legitimate; the challenge they pose to patriarchal authorities who
   claimed to hold the monopoly of the sacred; and women's entrance into
   the rising public sphere. Furthermore, the introduction shows the
   continuities and discontinuities between the Middle Ages and the early
   modern era with respect to women's political thought and suggests the
   necessity to rethink traditional periodizations which emphasize breaks
   more than the different faces of transition.},

Abstract = {Populism represents one of the major trends in contemporary politics
   across all European democracies. A key element in the success of
   populist parties is their communication strategy, with social networks
   that have become an ideal platform for populist political communication.
   Concerns about the success of populist groups marked also the recent
   European Parliamentary elections in May 2019. This also applies to the
   Czech Republic, where populist rhetoric is mainly represented by the
   Freedom and Direct Democracy party (SPD). The main objective of the
   article is to reveal how SPD is framing migration in the political
   communication on Facebook during the period of three months before the
   elections to the European Parliament. It mainly focuses on its content
   and form regarding the posts' visual elements and technical parameters.
   As migration was the main topic of populist political communication,
   special attention is paid to the communication regarding this
   phenomenon, incl. an analysis of selected frames and manipulation
   techniques in the SPD political communication. The result shows, that
   migration played the most important role but was communicated
   selectively and manipulatively. Only the negative effects of migration
   were emphasised, it was framed in connection with other negative
   phenomena (especially rape, crime, and terrorism) and illustrated by
   pictures of aggressive Muslims, emotions of fear, anger, and hatred were
   evoked among the supporters, which further contributed to the
   radicalisation and sustainability of the mobilisation of the electorate.},

Abstract = {The publication provides the theoretical and conceptual foundations of
   the rule of law, with a particular focus on the importance of judicial
   independence as a component of the rule of law. It analyses the
   relationship between judicial independence and the three components of
   the rule of law: the legislature and government must be able to identify
   a legal basis for their actions; laws should be capable of guiding
   people's conduct so that they can plan their lives, knowing the legal
   consequences of their actions; and, as a substantive concept, the rule
   of law must be based on rights, justice and the ideal of accountable
   government. It also develops systemic deficiencies and partiality as the
   main risks that threaten judicial independence. Finally, the principle
   of the rule of law is explored in the context of the European Union as a
   prerequisite for the effective application of European law and for
   mutual trust between Member States.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {To what extent does the public prefer local government officials to be
   selected via nonpartisan, as opposed to partisan, elections? Do
   preferences vary across different types of local offices? Do Democrats
   and Republicans systematically differ in their preference for
   nonpartisan versus partisan local elections? Using a novel dataset based
   on the 2018 and 2020 CES, I find that while nonpartisan elections are
   the modal preference for local offices, the proportion of voters
   favoring this model varies with office-type, party ID, and whether
   respondents live in counties with a majority of their co-partisans.
   Specifically, Democrats are more likely to prefer nonpartisan elections
   for local offices than are Republicans, but there is only evidence for
   these inter-party differences in Republican-leaning counties. County
   partisanship also has a significant effect on intra-party variation in
   preference for nonpartisan elections to certain local offices.},

Abstract = {In this article we analyze the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the
   Italian anti-violence system, through the eyes of the pratictioners of
   anti-violence centers, who are historically at the forefront in
   supporting women survivors of male violence. Their perspective is
   particularly relevant because, in Italy, anti-violence centers hold a
   ``borderline{''} position, which lies between the political role of
   transformation and that of an actor of the private social provider of an
   `essential' public service. On the basis of international
   recommendations, our analysis distinguishes two main areas of
   intervention on which national policies have been called to intervene:
   on one side, the protection of women victims of violence, and on the
   other their empowerment. Analyzing either official statistics and data
   collected through an online survey addressed to the practitioners of
   anti-violence centers during the lockdown, we highlight strengths and
   weaknesses of the policy measures implemented in Italy from their
   situated perspective, with reference both to the protection and the
   empowerment of survivors.},

Abstract = {Using the analytical method, the article discusses issues related to
   compensation for property damage, moral damage and damage to business
   reputation caused by a criminal act. To understand the essence of
   property damage, the following signs of property subject to criminal
   usurpation are distinguished: physical, legal, and economic. This
   classification of the attributes of the property makes it possible to
   determine its legal understanding to create the conditions for
   compensation for material damage caused by a crime. The hypothesis that
   corporate reputation is an integral element of a concept such as ``moral
   damage caused by a crime{''} has been demonstrated. This makes it
   possible to express the idea of the need to unify the understanding of
   the essence of moral damage and the possibility of including in its
   content the damage to the business reputation, as well as a unified
   approach to the procedure for its compensation in case of a criminal
   offense. It is concluded that the damage to the business reputation and
   the moral damage are the same in their essence and content, therefore,
   when compensating for the damage caused to the business reputation, the
   rules on compensation for moral damage apply.},

Abstract = {In November 2017, the government of Malawi launched the country's first
   National Peace Policy (NPP) to systematically promote sustainable peace
   and unity. Malawi already had infrastructures for peace (I4P) that had
   been developed separately by the state, non-state actors and other
   stakeholders for various purposes. However, there was no integrated and
   coherent national peacebuilding framework which was focused on proactive
   conflict prevention and the promotion of sustainable peace and unity.
   The outbreak of deadly violence between police and civilians in July
   2011 was a major manifestation of shortcomings and failures of the
   uncoordinated and mainly reactive top-down and bottom-up peace
   infrastructures established by the state and non-state actors,
   respectively. In response to the violence, the United Nations' (UN)
   preventive diplomacy and facilitation of national dialogue in Malawi
   helped de-escalate tensions and mitigate conflict risk. This culminated
   in the development and approval of the NPP. The NPP is a bedrock
   strategy of a coherent and credible National Peace Architecture (NPA) to
   serve as the national pillar for peacebuilding. The NPP is being
   implemented by complementary state and non-state actors working closely
   with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in compliance with
   regional, continental and international instruments relating to the NPA.
   The case of Malawi presents an opportunity for building integrated
   local, national, regional, continental and international peace
   architectures.},

Abstract = {The article discusses some problems of military and civilian
   administrations operating in Ukraine with the aim of maintaining the
   national security regime. In particular, the authors investigate the
   social and political reasons behind the decision to create special
   government agencies, in the form of civil military administrations. In
   addition to the comprehensive analysis of the relevant legislative
   framework, reference has been made to the practical functions of these
   administrations. The study methodology includes a variety of research
   tools aimed at improving the analysis and a problem-oriented approach.
   The conclusions are focused on improving the legislative as well as
   organizational frameworks of civil-military administrations in the
   Donbass region. In particular, based on the basic principles within the
   civil society, including the supremacy of civil society over the armed
   forces, the discussed Law should be effectively renamed as the Law ``On
   civil-military administrations{''} with a continuous approach,
   potentially within a specially drafted project. It is suggested to
   include a chapter of the Law, on military support of civilian
   authorities and official efforts of reconstruction of public order in
   certain areas of Donetsk and Lugansk regions.},

Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {34},
Number = {SI},
Abstract = {This article delves into a topic that has been little addressed in
   previous studies on Colombian foreign policy: decision-making processes.
   I rely on two classic decision-making models (Putnam and Allison's) and
   use them to analyze the decisional procedure that led Colombia to join
   the Pacific Alliance in 2012. The case study shows that certain actors
   in the private sector (mainly economic associations) strongly influenced
   the executive branch's actions regarding Colombian foreign policy.
   Generating such strategies in the country departs from traditional views
   of how public policy is generated, showing that in this particular
   field, it can be influenced by the privileged actors closest to the
   President. This research highlights the need and the various
   opportunities for further work on Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA) for the
   Colombian case.},

Title = {Sanctioning Capacity in Trade and Sustainability Chapters in EU Trade
   Agreements: The EU-Korea Case},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {58-67},
Abstract = {Although sanctions targeting political regimes receive the most media
   attention, the EU can also sanction states for labour rights violations
   through its trade policy. Although in practice such sanctions are
   applied only in extreme cases, the possibility of suspending trade
   preferences increases the EU's leverage. In modern trade agreements, the
   EU incorporates Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) chapters for
   labour and environmental matters. However, trade sanctions for
   non-compliance with this chapter are absent. Instead, a dedicated
   dispute settlement arrangement exists, leading to recommendations by a
   panel of experts. In 2019 the EU launched proceedings against South
   Korea for failing to uphold commitments to ratify and implement
   International Labour Organisation core conventions regarding trade
   unions under the 2011 EU-Korea Trade Agreement. In 2021, the panel of
   experts sided with the EU's interpretation of commitments under the TSD
   chapter. This initial case represents the EU's intention to focus on the
   implementation of TSD chapters. Using data from official documents, this
   article process-traces the dispute with Korea. It argues that the
   outcome of the case, and Korea's ratification of fundamental
   International Labour Organisation conventions in 2021, demonstrate the
   potential of the TSD chapter, when forcefully enforced, to partially
   redress the weak sanctioning capacity in TSD chapters. It also uncovers
   important caveats regarding state capacity and alignment with government
   objectives as conditioning the effectiveness of TSD chapters'
   non-legally binding sanctioning mechanisms.},

Title = {(Re)configuring the sexual violence imaginary from an antifeminist
   perspective: the ideological work of the Spanish manosphere},

Abstract = {For some years now, we have been experiencing a polarization of the
   public debate regarding the issue of gender equality, with sexual
   violence committed against women being a hot spot in this discussion.
   Parallel to the advance of a feminist ``fourth wave{''}, an antifeminist
   movement has been consolidated that is articulated around the
   vindication of the rights of men and the denial of the existence of
   violence with a specific gender component, which it has been articulated
   primarily on and from the Internet. The depth of affective-ideological
   discourses in society in general (and in certain groups in particular),
   is being evidenced in studies that show the growing tendency among young
   men to affirm that violence with a gender component does not exist, but
   rather it is an ``ideological invention{''}. In this article, we provide
   explanations about the emergence, configuration and pollination of
   anti-feminist discourses that arise from misogynist communities on the
   Internet (from the so-called Spanish manosphere) and that are decisive
   in shaping the social perception of sexual violence committed against
   women. in Spain. We have obtained the results through a multi-technical
   qualitative research that combines multi-platform digital ethnography,
   qualitative interviews with experts and the socio-hermeneutic analysis
   of memes. In our study we conclude that through memetics and other
   digital social practices in the Spanish manosphere, a fundamental
   ideological work is being carried out that contributes to the
   trivialization, normalization and legitimization of sexual violence
   committed against women in its various forms.},

Abstract = {Mainstream parties in Western Europe are increasingly struggling to hold
   together their base of support. As a lens for exploring this changing
   electoral landscape, this article focuses on the growing share of the
   electorate that is cross-pressured between conservative and progressive
   attitudes on economic and cultural issues. It argues that a stable
   asymmetry characterizes Western European mass attitudes: while support
   for the left is common among voters with progressive attitudes on both
   issues, it is enough to be conservative on one issue to turn right.
   Analyzing survey data collected from 1990 to 2017, the study shows that
   cross-pressures are resolved in favor of the right and examines the
   trade-offs this poses to center-right parties. These findings contribute
   to debates on electoral dealignment and realignment and shed light on
   the electoral choices of the center-right.},

Abstract = {Like no other event, war tests the ability of political leaders to act
   calmly and rationally. It unrelentingly punishes those who do not bring
   their ambitions into line with their capabilities. One should start a
   war only when the vital interests of the state are actually threatened
   and all non-military means have been exhausted beforehand. Before making
   the decision to go to war, one must make sure one has complete political
   support at home and abroad. With his decision to launch a special
   military operation, Vladimir Putin disregarded all of these principles.},

   Through a case study, using qualitative research tools like documental
   analysis, interviews, and network analysis, from an analytic
   perspective, the article relates four necessary factors for the
   occurrence of the phenomenon. The hypothesis is that the crisis of
   representation is not the only condition for the rise of this Outsider
   and the political, social and economic context are factors that played a
   crucial role. Likewise, the article ensures that the election of the
   2000 portray a landmark in the electoral competition logics.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {445-455},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Human trafficking affects millions of people globally,
   disproportionately harming women, girls and marginalized groups. Yet one
   of the main sources of data on global trafficking, the annual
   Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Reports, is susceptible to biases because
   report rankings are tied to political outcomes. The literature on human
   rights measurements has established two potential sources of bias. The
   first is the changing standards of accountability, where more
   information and increased budgets change the standard to which countries
   are held over time. The second is political biases in reports, which are
   amended to comply with the interests of the reporting agency. This
   letter examines whether either of these biases influence the TIP
   Reports. In contrast to other country-level human rights indicators, the
   State Department issues both narratives and rankings, which incentivizes
   attempts to influence the rankings based on political interests. The
   study uses a supervised machine-learning algorithm to examine how
   narratives are translated into rankings, to determine whether rankings
   are biased, and to disentangle whether bias stems from changing
   standards or political interests. The authors find that the TIP Report
   rankings are more influenced by political biases than changing
   standards.},

Abstract = {European mainstream right parties are increasingly choosing to include
   radical right parties in coalition governments or other types of stable
   and committed cooperation. How does this cooperation affect voters'
   perceptions of party positions? This article examines whether coalition
   signals have a significant impact on voters' perceptions of the specific
   policy issues that were at stake in the bargaining process. More
   specifically, does the issue ownership of the radical right cause voters
   to perceive mainstream parties as radicalizing on immigration issues
   pertaining to asylum and multiculturalism? I compare the perceptions of
   Dutch parties before and after two coalition formations that (formally
   and informally) involved a radical right party: the coalition with the
   List Pim Fortuyn in 2002 and the support agreement with the Freedom
   Party in 2010. Furthermore, I examine the long-term effects of the
   Danish mainstream right government's reliance on the support of the
   radical right Danish People's Party in 2001-11.},

Abstract = {Poland's solidarity with Ukraine in its defensive war against Russia is
   by no means a given. Just a few decades ago, the two nations were
   enemies. The impetus for reconciliation came from the Polish exile
   magazine Kultura with its far-sighted thinking. Since the 1990s, the
   number of Polish-Ukrainian contacts has grown exponentially. Today,
   almost every Polish family has acquaintances in and from Ukraine. This
   is the result of Ukrainian labour migration and cultural cooperation.
   Authors and the literary scene played a central role: with their books,
   writers such as Yurii Andrukhovych and Serhii Zhadan stirred an enormous
   interest in Ukraine. Poland became the hub of Europe for Ukrainian
   literature and culture. At the same time, Andrukhovych \& Co. acted as
   ambassadors of Polish culture in Ukraine.},

   Political Duty},
Journal = {AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {52-61},
Abstract = {Kelsen's critique of absolute sovereignty famously appeals to a basic
   norm of international recognition. However, in his discussion of legal
   obligation, generally speaking, he notoriously rejects mutual
   recognition as having any normative consequence. I argue that this
   apparent contradiction in Kelsen's estimate regarding the normative
   force of recognition is resolved in his dynamic account of the
   democratic generation of law. Democracy is embedded within a modern
   political ethos that obligates legal subjects to recognize each other
   along four dimensions: as contractors whose mutually beneficial
   cooperation measures esteem by fair standards of contribution; as
   autonomous agents endowed with equal rights; as friends who
   altruistically care for each others' welfare, and as fallible agents of
   diverse experiences and worldviews.},

Abstract = {Andreas Kappeler, a historian of Eastern Europe, looks back on his
   personal discovery of Ukraine as a nation at a time when the mere
   mention of the word ``nation{''} was considered disreputable. He
   explains where the stereotype of Ukrainians as nationalists and
   anti-Semites comes from. In his view, however, the widespread Western
   disinterest in Ukraine has been overcome, and Ukraine is now recognized
   as an equal subject within the international community of nations. As a
   historian who thinks long-term, he refuses to believe that a
   megalo-maniacal dictator in the Kremlin can chart a new course in the
   history and historiography of Europe in just a few years.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study was the analysis of the implementation of the
   reform of primary education as a structural model of the formation of
   the preparation of the future elementary school, for the design of the
   educational environment. The research methodology used included the
   analysis of legislative documentation to determine the requirements for
   the professional activity of an elementary school teacher. The procedure
   and features of actions for the development of a structural-functional
   model, of the formation of the readiness of future elementary school
   teachers to design an educational environment include: analysis of
   objects; choice of the form of the model; theoretical, methodical,
   spatio-temporal, material-technical, legal substantiation; the choice of
   a factor of formation of the system; establishment of connections and
   dependencies of the main components. The content of the developed main
   blocks of the model: meta - purpose and task; methodological -
   approaches and principles; content-procedure - updated content of the
   discipline content of the vocational and practical training cycle, forms
   of organization of the educational process, methods, means of training
   and diagnostics; organizational and pedagogical conditions; stages:
   adaptation, intensification and identification. It is concluded that the
   developed model reflects the actual educational process of achieving the
   expected results.},

Abstract = {In order to explain differences in political interest, two strands of
   literature point to the relevance of either dispositional or situational
   factors. I remedy this and show how political interest is shaped by the
   interplay between personality differences and the political environment.
   Specifically, I demonstrate that people with a stable motivation for
   engaging with new ideas are more interested in politics when exposed to
   new political events, e.g. during election campaigns and when unexpected
   events unfold. The results have implications for our understanding of
   political inequalities in democratic engagement and shed light on how
   citizens' interest in politics can be relatively stable over time as
   well as responsive to the political environment in predictable ways.},

Abstract = {Both autistic adults and families of autistic children rely heavily on
   blogs and other digital platforms to create community and gain
   experiential knowledge about autism, but research on autism blogs has
   failed to distinguish between the perspectives of autistic adults and
   neurotypical parent bloggers. Furthermore, intersections in the
   experiences of BIPOC autistics are rarely examined Using a content
   analysis with a feminist Critical Disability Studies lens, I explore six
   autism parent blogs from diverse demographics: a white neurotypical
   father, a white autistic mother in an interracial relationship, a white
   neurotypical mother, an Indigenous autistic trans father, a Black
   autistic nonbinary mother, and a Black neurotypical mother. I examine
   the attitudes of these bloggers to get a sampling of their opinions on
   autism, how they parent autistic children, and how their social
   location, specifically race, impacts their experiences. More
   intersectional research needs to be done to boost the perspectives of
   BIPOC autistics and the expertise of autistic parents.},

Abstract = {In this article, electoral personalization is measured on the basis of
   the percentage of voters casting a preference vote instead of a list
   vote. A multilevel regression analysis of the 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018
   Lower Chamber elections in Colombia, with 971 open lists at the
   constituency level as units of analysis, shows that the electoral
   personalization has remained remarkably stable, in spite of the party
   system changes during the investigatedperiod. Even so, leveraging the
   unique feature of the Colombian system that parties can opt for either a
   closed or an open ballot format, we find that the personalization of the
   open lists decreases with the number of closed lists, but only in the
   small constituencies. At the list level, personalization increases with
   the number of candidates on the list. When this effect is controlled
   for, we find evidence of a proximity effect in the sense that a larger
   number of voters in the district coincides with a lower level of
   personalization.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article was to identify the priority areas of
   application of project management in the public sphere. General and
   special scientific methods have been used in the article, such as:
   analytical, synergistic, systemic, statistical, generalization and
   prognostic analysis. The authors have suggested dividing the priority
   areas of project management approach in the field of public
   administration into three blocks: pre-war (peaceful), military and
   post-war periods of development of Ukraine. It has been concluded that
   the priority areas of application of project management methods and
   tools in public management for peaceful development of the state are:
   the sphere of regional development and development of united territorial
   communities; the sphere of cultural development and information
   technology; the sphere of education and science. It has been shown that
   the perspective areas of the use of project management technologies in
   public administration for the development of Ukraine in the war and
   post-war periods will be the following: reconstruction of destroyed and
   damaged infrastructure, reconstruction of certain settlements, renewal
   and transformation of the state economy and support of the army, among
   others.},

Title = {TRANSFORMATION OF DISTRICT-LEVEL COMPETITION IN MONGOLIAN ELECTIONS,
   1992-2020: TOWARDS TERRITORIAL HOMOGENIZATION (NATIONALIZATION) OF VOTER
   BEHAVIOUR?},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Pages = {109-141},
Abstract = {This paper tests the effects of the electoral reforms in all Mongolian
   elections between 1992 and 2020 by analysing national and district-level
   results. Especially, we address the question whether the pattern of the
   national competition is replicated also at the local level and the
   presence or absence of a (party system) projection from the local to the
   national level can corroborate the so-called nationalization thesis. We
   take different approaches. First, we use the Gallagher
   disproportionality index (LSq Index) to measure the disproportionality
   of an electoral outcome. Second, we use Laakso and Taagepera's effective
   number of parliamentary parties (ENPP) as a measure of parliamentary
   fragmentation, and effective number of electoral parties (ENEP) as a
   measure of concentration in the distribution of votes across parties.
   Third, we use graphic tool, simplex representation, to analyse the
   nature of competitiveness at district level. We have come to several
   conclusions. First, our analysis has shown that the tendency to
   symmetrical two-party competition was present in less than half of the
   elections, together with the increasing trend against bipolarization of
   Mongolian electoral politics. A very important finding has been also the
   confirmation of the continued importance of the urban-rural cleavage in
   Mongolia, which resulted in a different shape of party competition
   between the countryside and the capital city of Ulaanbaatar. Finally,
   the equilateral simplex representation has broadened our understanding
   of district-level electoral competition, when we address the so-called
   nationalization thesis. While some previous studies found the presence
   of some form of two-party system in almost all Mongolian elections, the
   simplex visualization of the competition showed that the district-level
   party system was far from nationalized, i.e., with the two nationally
   strong parties being strongest in the districts as well - quite the
   opposite.},

Abstract = {In this article, the experience of older adults around international
   migration is analyzed, as well as their role within migrant families and
   in transnational exchange relations that arise with this situation. The
   objective is to analyze their psychosocial experience in the face of
   migration when their expectations are confronted as they age, transform
   their support networks or actively participate within migrant families.
   Some analytical categories are proposed for reflection 1) the role of
   older people in migrant families, 2) how migration affects their
   experience in old age, and 3) the way they make sense of migration and
   their experiences. The experience being analyzed is that of
   international migration from Mexico to the United States based on
   information recovered from studies previously conducted in the state of
   Michoacan, Mexico and from various investigations conducted in different
   countries.},

Abstract = {The primary question we seek to answer in this chapter is if, and then
   how, the economic crisis impacted political participation and engagement
   in Iceland. The crisis may have had a short- or long-term effect; it may
   have stopped, reversed or accelerated trends that were already in
   progress. Overall, Western democracies have seen indicators of
   conventional political participation, such as turnout and party
   membership, decline since the 1980s. However, there is not much evidence
   that the Great Recession resulted in a shock to turnout, although it may
   have affected different groups in different ways. In this chapter, we
   examine the following four indicators of political participation and
   engagement: turnout/electoral participation; party identification; party
   membership; and political interest. In doing so, we consider whether
   they have changed significantly after the global credit crunch. The
   results show that a downward trajectory in turnout had started before
   the economic crisis, and the path remained largely unchanged during and
   after the crisis. Membership in political parties and party
   identification show an acceleration of a downward trend after the
   crisis, from what was perhaps an unsustainable high point in 2007.
   Political interest remained stable during the period. The results do not
   show sorting in participation based on demographic groups following the
   recession. Overall, the pattern for political participation is similar
   to that observed in other chapters of this book: people did not abandon
   the broad system of democracy, but they turned away-at least
   temporarily-from particular actors within the system (the political
   parties).},

Abstract = {In Chapter 7, we established the loss of the dominant status of the four
   established parties in Iceland and that party fragmentation has
   increased since the Great Recession. The increase in the number of
   parties alone does not tell us about the depth of the change. In this
   chapter, we focus our attention on the new post-crisis parties and
   compare them both with former new parties prior to the crisis and the
   established parties. One of the main differences between new parties
   before and after the crisis is that pre-crisis new parties were almost
   always short-lived splinter parties from one of the established parties,
   while most of the new post-crisis parties have roots outside of the
   established party system. Analysing the profile of both the voters and
   the candidates of the post-crisis parties, we find that, in both groups,
   the new parties differ among themselves when it comes to support for the
   political system and their issue profiles. This has also had
   consequences for a government bargaining process where three or more
   parties are needed to form a majority government coalition, whereas two
   parties were usually needed before. We conclude that the new post-crisis
   parties can be taken as one symptom of a party-system change, but their
   survival will depend on several factors, such as how effective they are
   in organising their infrastructure and whether they will successfully
   take part in governments in the future.},

Abstract = {The role orientation of political representatives and candidates is a
   longstanding concern in studies of democratic representation. The
   growing trend in countries to allow citizens abroad to candidate in
   homeland elections from afar provides an interesting opportunity for
   understanding how international mobility and context influences ideas of
   representation among these emigrant candidates. In public debates,
   emigrant candidates are often portrayed as delegates of the emigrant
   constituencies. However, drawing on the paradigmatic case of Italy and
   an original data set comprising emigrant candidates, we show that the
   perceptions of styles of representation abroad are more complex.
   Systemic differences between electoral districts at home and abroad are
   relevant for explaining why and how candidates develop a trustee or
   delegate orientation.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes the recruitment system of the political elites of the
   Italian Republic based on the analysis of the Presidency of the Council
   of Ministers, which is a key institution in the set of
   parliamentary-type political systems. . The research starts from the
   conceptual definition of the fundamental elements of the Italian
   political system since 1948 and analyzes the personal, educational,
   professional and political variables that define the profile of the 30
   Presidents of the Council of Ministers. The article confirms that the 30
   heads of government that have existed in Italy between 1946 and 2021
   have been characterized by a very broad professional and, above all,
   political qualification, as well as by the existence of centralist and
   endogamous parameters in the recruitment spaces.},

Title = {Water planning and shared government or the link between sustainability
   and federalism},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The Spanish water policy, particularly after the Water Framework
   Directive, is being designed and implemented according with the
   multilevel governance paradigm as it is the case in other European
   countries. Particularly in the inter-regional basins, this new model
   challenges the so-called autonomous State as it requires new
   collaborative inter-administrative procedures in order to integrate
   different regional interests into nation-wide decisions. Water policy is
   going to demand new practices of shared government, which is not easy to
   fit into a system like the Spanish one, in which a relatively low
   development of its dynamics of intergovernmental collaboration has often
   been highlighted, both due to certain institutional characteristics as
   for a certain political culture and territorial perception not very
   consistent with federalism.
   The aim of this paper will therefore be to explore and describe the
   general characteristics of a specific dimension of water policy such as
   hydrological planning, presenting it as an example of shared governance
   based on the specific reference of the Spanish case and its territorial
   model. An analysis that we believe goes beyond the merely descriptive,
   in that we conclude that the spatial projection of certain public
   policies linked to environmental sustainability could induce the
   participating actors to modify the traditional ways of understanding the
   territory, internalising values such as diversity and interdependence
   and, in short, deepening the transition to federalism.},

Abstract = {The aim of the research was to assess the specific levels of fixed
   capital investment per capita in all regions of Russia. The research was
   based on official 2019 statistics on the volume of fixed capital
   investments in 82 regions of Russia, as well as data on the population.
   In the research, the analysis of clusters associated with the
   unification of the objects studied in relatively homogeneous groups
   based on the study of the values of the compared indicators was applied.
   The normal distribution function was used in modelling to estimate the
   distribution of specific values for most regions. The following results
   and conclusions were obtained: it has been shown that the formation of
   five groups is optimal. In addition, it was shown that in 2019 nine
   regions were characterized by an extremely high level of investment due
   to the tasks of their strategic development to meet federal challenges.
   They also identified regions with relatively low values of specific
   investments in fixed assets. Everything indicates that specific
   investment values have a significant differentiation in several regions
   of Russia.},

Abstract = {Increased computing capacity and the spread of computational knowledge
   has generated the expectation that organizations and municipalities use
   large quantities of data to drive decision making. However,
   municipalities may lack the resources to meaningfully use their data for
   decision making. Relatedly, political science and public administration
   programs face the challenge of training students for success in this
   environment. We believe one remedy is the adoption of coproduction as a
   pedagogical strategy. This article presents a case study of a
   partnership between a university research team and a municipal emergency
   communications center as a demonstration of how coproduction can be
   harnessed as a teaching tool. Findings from this project were presented
   at the Southern Political Science Association Annual Meeting, January
   8-11, 2020, in San Juan, Puerto Rico.},

Title = {Loud and Negative: Exploring Negativity in Voter Thoughts About Women
   and Men Politicians},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {374-383},
Abstract = {Negative information about political candidates is readily available in
   contemporary political communication. Moreover, negativity is tightly
   connected to gendered expectations about what constitutes appropriate
   behavior for politicians. Yet, existing theoretical models of negativity
   and candidate evaluation typically do not address the role of gender and
   the available empirical evidence remains inconclusive regarding the
   electoral consequences of the interaction of negativity and gender. This
   article tackles these gaps in two studies to investigate how negativity
   manifests in voters' thoughts about women and men politicians in
   response to negative media cues and how these thoughts affect vote
   preference. Study 1 uses a mixed methods think-aloud approach to trace
   the first impression formation and subsequent decision-making pro-cess
   (N = 78). Study 2 replicates the design as an online thought listing
   survey experiment (N =142). A similar quantitative pattern emerges
   across both studies: (a) Negative cues elicit similar amounts of
   negativity in voters' thoughts for women and men politicians, (b) these
   negative thoughts strongly lower candidates' electoral chances, (c) but
   less so for women candidates. The qualitative analysis suggests that
   negative cues heuristically affect earlier stages of impression
   formation while voters are likely to rely on gender cues when they
   rationalize their vote decision.},

Abstract = {Russia's war against Ukraine is in its second year. Militarily, Ukraine
   cannot win the war against Russia. But a Russian victory is also
   unlikely because the West supports Ukraine. It will come down to
   negotiations to end this war. The leadership around Putin is not ready
   for this. It will engage in negotiations only if Ukraine is able to
   repel Russia's spring offensive and bring pressure to bear on the
   attacking forces. After that, an extensive negotiation process will be
   necessary, during which a ceasefire and its monitoring will have to be
   determined, as well as the status of occupied Ukrainian territories. As
   during the CSCE process in the 1970s, this will require staying power,
   confidence building, negotiations at several levels, and the involvement
   of indirect warring parties such as the United States, the members of
   the European Union, Turkey, and China. The aim will be to restore
   Ukraine's territorial status quo ante within the framework of a new
   European security order.},

Abstract = {This article provides an overview of small state studies and offers a
   comparative study of the respective 2008 United Nations Security Council
   campaigns by Austria and Iceland. It examines how quantitative and
   qualitative characteristics between small states play a decisive role in
   mounting successful UNSC bids. The analysis indicates that Austria's
   `smallness' did not significantly impact the country's ability to garner
   votes towards a seat, and that its size and status was utilised in
   concurrence with skilful diplomacy to meet objectives. Iceland, on the
   other hand, was thwarted not only by its limited size, but also by a
   lack of political and diplomatic commitment to the cause, and an
   inability to `absorb' an untimely exogenous shock that damaged the
   country's reputation.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research is the basic characteristics of the
   management of financial activity in countries such as: France, Germany,
   United States of America, Great Britain, and Sweden. The organizational
   structure of financial management bodies was studied and the
   participation of state legislatures in financial policy was emphasized.
   Also, a review of materials and methods was carried out based on the
   analysis of documents for the regulation of public financial activity.
   The methodology included a comprehensive analysis and generalization of
   the available scientific and theoretical material, as well as the
   formulation of relevant conclusions. During the research, the methods of
   scientific cognition were used: terminological, logical-semantic,
   functional, system-structural, logical-normative, comparative. It is
   concluded that the participation of all the higher powers of government
   is fundamental in the formation and implementation of public policy in
   the field of finance; this requires a wide range of bodies and
   institutions exercising control over financial activities; concentration
   of financial management in a single-line ministry, as well as
   distribution among several ministries and a clear division of powers
   between financial management bodies, among other aspects.},

Abstract = {Democracies without democrats are not sustainable. Yet, recent studies
   have argued that Western citizens are turning their backs on the system
   of self-governance, thereby eroding the societal foundations of
   consolidated democracies. This study contributes to discussions about
   citizen support of democracy by (1) analyzing new cross-national survey
   data in 18 European countries that facilitate assessments of the
   temporal and geographical generalizability of previous findings, (2)
   disentangling age, cohort and period effects, thereby aligning the
   analytical methods with the theoretical arguments and (3) transparently
   reporting all evidence derived from pre-registered analyses to avoid
   cherry-picked findings. The findings show that citizens of consolidated
   democracies continue to endorse self-governance. Yet in some (but not
   all) countries, there is evidence of a growing number of `democrats in
   name only', particularly among the young generation. These findings
   suggest a second phase in research on democratic fatigue that broadens
   the analytical scope for the multi-faceted nature of democratic support.},

Abstract = {With the aim to win support for its political project, Basque
   nationalism has traditionally sought to get an increasingly larger
   number of people to share a national identity. However, in the twenty
   first century, we can appreciate another discourse, which goes beyond
   national sentiment, and includes aspects that are more related to social
   and personal wellbeing. This second discourse has given rise to a new
   attitude to the independence of the Basque Country, which can now be
   shared by people who are not necessarily Basque nationalists, but are,
   on the other hand, interested in a project for a state as it could
   afford them personal benefits. This study explores how both discourses
   are spread and whether there has been a perceptible change in the
   attitude to independence in non-Basque nationalist sectors.},

Abstract = {Recent elections around the world have seen young voters come out in
   large numbers to support young leaders running for office, such as New
   Zealand's Jacinda Ardern in October 2020. At the same time, however,
   young voters have shown strong support for relatively older candidates
   such as Jeremy Corbyn in the United Kingdom and Bernie Sanders in the
   United States. While the former is consistent with the descriptive
   representation literature, the latter is not. This article deploys an
   experimental design involving 1000 young participants to analyse young
   voter support for older candidates. We find that young voters are
   significantly more likely to support older candidates if they are aware
   that these candidates champion general left-wing policies, but the same
   is not true for young candidates. We also find that ceteris paribus
   younger voters do not prefer younger candidates to older candidates.},

Abstract = {Democratic backsliding has become a global reality which in the past
   decade has curiously occurred together with populism and the
   polarisation of societies. How do these phenomena interact? Through a
   comparative study of two iconic cases of democratisation and democratic
   backsliding from different world regions, Hungary and Tunisia, we find
   that polarisation - typically instrumentalized by populists along the
   socio-cultural axis - harms social trust, setting a context in which
   societies accept democratic backsliding. Based on a
   most-different-systems design, our findings confirm the causal link
   between populism and democratic backsliding and represent a starting
   point for further analysis focused on the effects of the socio-cultural
   dimension on institutional change.},

Abstract = {We conceptualize broad purges, which extend far below top powerholders
   in authoritarian regimes and operate according to a logic fundamentally
   different from coup-proofing purges that target rivals to the supreme
   leader. Broad purges induce risk reduction in decision making because
   they grossly exacerbate uncertainty and raise the likelihood and cost of
   political error. Empirically, we analyze political appointment decisions
   before and during a massive corruption crackdown in China. We estimate
   purge impact on appointments of prefectural Communist Party secretaries
   during 2013-17. To signal to Beijing that they are not building
   factions, party bosses of these officials can be expected to reduce risk
   by biasing appointments against their own clients, with variation in
   bias reflecting geographic heterogeneity in purge intensity. We find a
   large effect of purge intensity on anti-client bias during this broad
   purge but not in previous smaller-scale anticorruption crackdowns. This
   study contributes to knowledge about purges under authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a ``methods lab{''} approach to teaching
   undergraduates about different types of research in political science.
   In this approach, students are given explicit instruction on what a
   specific research method entails and the opportunity to practice it
   before conducting their own research. Methods labs can help students
   craft more creative research designs as well as understand the strengths
   and potential pitfalls associated with each method, making the
   subsequent process of writing a research paper or thesis easier. We
   provide two sample methods labs focused on conducting archival research
   and developing survey and interview questions. We discuss our
   experiences in implementing the labs in a thesis course, describe how
   the modular lab approach could fit into multiple types of courses, and
   offer suggestions for those interested in developing labs for other
   types of research methods.},

Abstract = {How does exile affect online dissent? By internationalizing activists'
   networks and removing them from day-to-day life under the regime, we
   argue that exile fundamentally alters activists' political opportunities
   and strategic behavior. We test the effect of exile on activists' public
   discourse in the case of Venezuela, through an analysis of over 5
   million tweets by 357 activists spanning seven years. Our results
   suggest that after going into exile activists increasingly emphasize
   foreign-led interventions to shape their home country politics, focus
   less on local grievances, and become more harshly critical of the
   regime. This is partly due to the changes in exiles' networks: after
   leaving, activists increase their interactions with foreign actors and
   tweet more in English. This work contributes to our understanding of the
   relationship between exile-one of the most ubiquitous yet understudied
   forms of repression-and dissent in the digital age.},

Abstract = {In this article we address the question of how residents of several
   Russian urban centers perceive museums with displays highlighting Soviet
   political repressions (in particular, the Gulag). The empirical base
   consists of focus groups with different age groups. The method of
   intergenerational analysis was used to compare respondents' narratives
   in order to understand how their different life experiences and time
   distances from the tragic events of Soviet history affect their
   attitudes to such museums in urban spaces and their perceptions of how
   these museums shape local identities.},

Abstract = {The research note considers the impact of mobilization events on
   Polish-Belarusian relations. I analyze and characterize the states'
   relations prior to the protests in Belarus in 2020, and identify the
   most important problems in their relations. Poland's attitude toward the
   mass mobilization of Belarusian society and its reception by the
   Lukashenko regime is described. In the last section, I explain the
   impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war on Poland's relations with Belarus.
   The research demonstrates that the events analyzed transformed bilateral
   relations, generating a crisis between the states.},

Volume = {117},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1215-1227},

Abstract = {What is the point of ideology critique? Prominent Anglo-American
   philosophers recently proposed novel arguments for the view that
   ideology critique is moral critique, and ideologies are flawed insofar
   as they contribute to injustice or oppression. We criticize that view
   and make the case for an alternative and more empirically oriented
   approach, grounded in epistemic rather than moral commitments. We make
   two related claims: (a) ideology critique can debunk beliefs and
   practices by uncovering how, empirically, they are produced by
   self-justifying power and (b) the self-justification of power should be
   understood as an epistemic rather than moral flaw. Drawing on the recent
   realist revival in political theory, we argue that this genealogical
   approach has more radical potential, despite being more parsimonious
   than morality-based approaches. We demonstrate the relative advantages
   of our view by discussing the results of empirical studies on the
   contemporary phenomenon of neopatriarchy in the Middle East and North
   Africa.},

Title = {Emigrant external voting in Central-Eastern Europe after EU enlargement},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The European Union's Eastern Enlargement of 2004-2007 triggered a large
   wave of migration. While the influence of Central-Eastern European (CEE)
   migrants on Western European politics has been studied, the impact of
   outward migration and political remittances ``sent{''} by expatriates
   remain unexplored, despite the salience of democratic backsliding and
   populist politics in the region. We ask how external voting among
   migrants differs from electoral results in homelands over time, drawing
   on an original dataset gathering voting results among migrants from six
   CEE countries in fifteen Western European host countries. Using models
   estimated with Bayesian ordinary least squares regression, we test three
   hypotheses: two related to the disparity of diaspora votes from homeland
   party systems over time; and one to the ideological leanings of
   diasporas. We observe a growing discrepancy and note that diaspora votes
   follow the ideological fluctuations in the country of origin but distort
   it, with CEE migrants voting for more liberal and more economically
   right-wing parties than voters `at home'.},

Abstract = {Citizens are increasingly concerned with environmental issues and some
   of them take contentious political actions or adapt their lifestyles to
   reduce their environmental footprint. Research finds that there is an
   eco-gender gap in everyday environmental behaviours, with women more
   active than men. However, studies of the eco-gender gap have
   infrequently looked at other forms of pro-environmental political
   behaviours and focused mostly on young people. We contribute to the
   literature by examining to what extent older women and men differ in a
   range of pro-environmental political behaviours, using a unique dataset
   based on a survey of individuals 64 years and older. We find strong
   evidence of a gender gap in everyday behaviours and political
   consumerism, but not in relation to contentious forms of political
   participation. This gender gap in relation to everyday behaviours and
   political consumerism diminishes with age.},

Abstract = {Debate on Irish unification has increased in recent years, yet public
   attitudes on the processes that might lead to it are underexplored. This
   article examines the results of an online public consultation carried
   out in Northern Ireland in the summer of 2020 on how any future
   referendums on the unification question would best be conducted. It
   shows that hopes and fears on this question exist across society in
   Northern Ireland. It also reveals that public views are yet to
   crystallise on many of the design features of a referendum. There are
   some exceptions to this: there is a widespread feeling that the Brexit
   referendum process should not be replicated; and there are signs of
   divergent views emerging between communities on the franchise,
   referendum threshold, and use of citizens' assemblies. Nevertheless, we
   conclude that the lack of hardened views on most questions of process
   points to an opportunity for policymakers and impartial observers to
   foster agreement on how a referendum process should be conducted.},

Title = {Identity, Populism and Direct Democracy. Regarding the Impact of
   National Identity On the Relationship Between Right-Wing Populist
   Attitudes and the Preference for Direct-Democratic Decision-Making
   Procedures},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},

Abstract = {Under the impression of increasing dissatisfaction with the political
   system and distrust in elected representatives, the demand for
   direct-democratic forms of participation is currently particularly
   associated with right-wing populism. However, the specific relationship
   between populism and procedural preferences at an individual level, and
   the question of how exactly populist attitudes are related to procedural
   preferences, still remains open. This paper proposes a social
   psychological explanation of identity loss and formation as an addition
   to the debate on procedural preferences and provides a theoretical
   argument on the role of national identity in capturing the relationship
   between right-wing populism and procedural preferences. This is followed
   by an empirical analysis addressing the question to what extent populist
   attitudes and national identification can explain preferences for
   direct-democratic decision-making procedures. The findings suggest that
   right-wing populist attitudes on the one hand and national
   identification on the other are associated with preferences for direct
   democratic procedures. The expected moderating effect of national
   identification on the relationship between populism and procedural
   preferences is not confirmed. Against the background of these findings,
   the article discusses the importance of socio-psychological approaches
   to political science disputes with procedural preferences.},

Abstract = {Capitalism is usually associated with inequality. The Indian variant of
   capitalism creates its specific structure of inequality. The recent
   trends of capital concentration in India, facilitated by the political
   decision-making, shape particular patterns of the rise in inequalities.
   The nature of capitalism in India is linked to the nature of capital
   concentration and the low bargaining power of the labour. The article
   discusses these links. The article discusses the recent attempts at
   social and political legitimization of the prevailing kind of capitalism
   under the current political regime. The focus is on long-term issues,
   and instead of a detailed account, the attempt is to paint a picture
   with a very broad brush.},

Abstract = {Russia is trying, through its bombs, attacks, and brutality, to erase
   what Ukraine was. Therefore, it is a war effort to keep remembering how
   Ukraine in peace looked like, how it smelled, tasted, and felt. And to
   never forget that this is a war against Ukraine, in its own right. Not
   as a representative of the West, and not as a representative of
   democracy. But because Ukraine is of such importance to Russia, that a
   break between the two is unthinkable for Putin. That was what Leonid
   Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, realized already in 1991. He, and
   Ukrainian leaders after him, tried to protect their territory while at
   the same time reassuring Russia that relations could still be friendly.
   But Russia has never changed in a similar way.},

Journal = {INSIGHT TURKEY},

Abstract = {The negative consequences of climate change are becoming increasingly
   evident in environmental, economic, social, and political realms day by
   day, and no country in the world is exempt from these effects.
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports reveal that climate
   change will be severe, which means that the world can expect more and
   more conflict. Climate migration and national security problems will
   emerge due to factors such as natural disasters and resource crises.
   This article aims to evaluate the relationship between climate change
   and migration and examine the consequences that may arise in the context
   of climate security in the world and in Turkey. We conclude that all
   countries will be affected equally severely, though in different ways,
   by the risks and consequences that will gradually emerge in the context
   of climate security in parallel with climate change, and that the number
   of climate migrants and refugees will increase globally in the coming
   period. Further, migration to Turkey will not only be from neighboring
   countries but will increase from wider geography in the future due to
   Turkey's geopolitical eminence.},

   question, Alex Hochuli, George Hoare and Phil Cunliffe's The End of the
   End of History reads Francis Fukuyama's diagnosis of the `end of
   history' thesis through the lens of political economy, while anatomizing
   its demise in the populist 2010s. This roundtable contribution assesses
   Hoare, Cunliffe and Hochuli's diagnosis in light of recent developments.
   Stalked by inflation, resurgent militarism and so-called hyper-politics,
   the 2020s present both challenge and vindication to the `Aufhebunga'
   approach to post-post-history.},

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Western officials and media have portrayed Russia as a rogue state that
   seeks to undermine the fundamental foundations of the Western lifestyle,
   which are based on democratic and liberal principles, especially more
   since the invasion of the remaining Ukrainian territories began on 24
   February 2022. According to this perspective, Russia allegedly launched
   its strike to prevent Ukraine from joining the club of liberal nations.
   This move would have been a clear message to any other post-Soviet
   countries, further strengthening Russian control over them. It would be
   unfair to completely dismiss this argument, yet, justifying the
   simplification of the procedure and the continuation of conflict on
   these reasons goes much beyond presenting the facts. A thorough
   examination of the many issues involved is necessary to comprehend the
   Russian motivations for the ongoing war. This calls for an in-depth
   analysis of the Crimean Question, focusing on how Russia uses
   demographics in its foreign strategy. In addition, within the broader
   context of The Russian World (Russkiy Mir) Vision, it is crucial to
   understand the relevance of Russia's unique perspective on Ukraine. The
   objective of this study is to provide an analytical framework
   concentrating on these apparently most visible factors for Russia's
   willingness to raise tensions in Eastern Europe further and invade the
   remaining territory under the sovereignty of Ukraine.},

Abstract = {How does the social nature of focus groups shape what researchers learn
   about preferences? This article delineates three preference
   types-private, publicly expressed, and group preferences-and introduces
   a new method for measuring each in a focus group setting. Original data
   on people's preferences for punishing rape, wife beating, and theft
   across 80 focus groups in 20 villages in eastern Democratic Republic of
   Congo reveal clear differences across preference types, featuring more
   extreme punishment preferences in the public sphere. A within-subject
   experiment also shows that focus group discussions affect people's
   private preferences by making them more extreme, which has ethical
   implications for researchers who use focus groups worldwide. The social
   nature of preferences observed in Democratic Republic of Congo
   underscores that scholars must adopt clear and transparent approaches to
   data comparison to learn about sensitive issues in the face of contested
   norms.},

Abstract = {Many countries worldwide resort to quotas in order to favour the
   employment of disabled people. Yet, the quota as a policy tool has an
   ambivalent meaning: while it has been conceived as an advanced form of
   antidiscrimination policy tool in domains such as gender and racial
   inequalities, in the sector of disability, it has tended to be theorized
   as an outdated measure, belonging to a social welfare perspective
   opposed to the more recent equalitarian policy frame. This article
   revisits this theoretical debate on the disability employment quota by
   shifting the focus from a normative discussion to an empirical
   investigation of the meanings policymakers have endowed it with. I draw
   on the case of France, where the quota scheme is a cornerstone of
   disability employment policy: post-World War I provisions were at the
   origin of a series of reforms extending and reinforcing the quota, in
   1957, 1987 and 2005 - leading to the current 6\% disabled worker quota
   imposed to private and public organizations of 20 employees or more.
   Tracing the historical trajectory of this policy tool and its uses by
   means of parliamentary debates and secondary sources, I show how quotas
   in France have had more complex meanings than what the social welfare
   versus antidiscrimination dichotomy suggests. Before the rise of
   antidiscrimination policy, they were thought of as a progressive form of
   social policy, as opposed to more segregative interventions such as
   pensions or sheltered employment. The adoption of antidiscrimination
   provisions in 2005 then led to a hybridization between quotas and
   antidiscrimination policy.},

Abstract = {In 2016, the trial of Peter Liang for murdering Akai Gurley galvanized a
   charged debate among Asian Americans; some defended Liang as a victim of
   racial profiling, while others in solidarity against anti-Black violence
   argued for his conviction as a police officer. Many have viewed this
   trial as an example of increasing conservatism among Asian Americans,
   yet what does the specific figure of the Asian cop reveal about Asian
   American support for policing? Working through a theoretical
   reinterpretation of Liang's trial, I argue that policing acts as the
   material process for the incorporation of Asian Americans as subjects of
   American empire as long as they are willing to police in its interests.
   Through a transpacific lens that connects domestic anti-Black policing
   to the policing of militarized spaces in Asia, I show how the unique and
   uneven incorporation of Asian peoples through American policing produces
   the contemporary terrain of political struggle over such topics as hate
   crime legislation and abolition. By recognizing how transnational
   policing incorporates Asians as American subjects, this structural
   analysis complements attitudinal studies of Asian American politics to
   show how Asian American activists either reject or reproduce their
   alliance with the American state's police power.},

Abstract = {The GLES Open Science Challenge 2021 was a pioneering initiative in
   quantitative political science. Aimed at increasing the adoption of
   replicable and transparent research practices, it led to this special
   issue. The project combined the rigor of registered reports-a new
   publication format in which studies are evaluated prior to data
   collection/access and analysis-with quantitative political science
   research in the context of the 2021 German federal election. This
   special issue, which features the registered reports that resulted from
   the project, shows that transparent research following open science
   principles benefits our discipline and substantially contributes to
   quantitative political science. In this introduction to the special
   issue, we first elaborate on why more transparent research practices are
   necessary to guarantee the cumulative progress of scientific knowledge.
   We then show how registered reports can contribute to increasing the
   transparency of scientific practices. Next, we discuss the application
   of open science practices in quantitative political science to date. And
   finally, we present the process and schedule of the GLES Open Science
   Challenge and give an overview of the contributions included in this
   special issue.},

Abstract = {The ``new, new trade theory{''} argues that firm-specific attributes
   such as size explain why large firms predominantly engage in foreign
   direct investment (FDI) and thus reap most of the rewards of
   globalization. However, studies have neglected the importance of firms'
   political influence over core financial institutions. I argue that large
   firms engage in greater FDI in part because of their political
   connections, which allow them to receive government loans in support of
   FDI. Using a unique, hand-coded dataset that includes 4936 directors of
   South Korean firms and these firms' FDI announcements, I show that firms
   that place elite financial officials on their boards engage in greater
   FDI than firms without such board-member connections. Therefore, the
   outsized gains that large firms receive from globalization are dependent
   on their political ties to their home government.},

Abstract = {International rivals often employ foreign aid to shape international
   institutions and alliances. This paper asks whether Americans are more
   supportive of allocating aid to Latin America when they learn about
   China's aid programs in the region. Since the average citizen lacks
   detailed knowledge about foreign policy, communication frames could
   influence citizens' support for aid. We, therefore, examine how various
   framing devices (national pride, humanitarian value, and instrumental
   value) affect public support for aid. Drawing on social psychology's
   model of self-identifying with a group, we argue that one's awareness of
   donor competition should boost support for aid. We innovate by using two
   dependent variables: support for giving US aid and the willingness to
   donate one's own resources. A survey experiment with a high-quality
   sample of 2700 respondents reveals that rivalry has a different effect
   on these dependent variables: informing respondents of donor rivalry
   increases support for US aid but has no effect on respondents'
   willingness to donate their own reward. Additionally, exposing subjects
   to the combination of rivalry and all three frames boosts approval for
   using tax dollars as aid; however, only national pride and humanitarian
   value appeals strengthen the respondents' willingness to donate their
   own earnings.},

   context},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {80},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Spatial and valence models are the workhorses of research on electoral
   behaviour. Yet, little is known about the common factors that influence
   the strength of both these determinants of the vote. I argue that the
   political context affects the prevalence of spatial and valence
   considerations in voters' minds. I investigate this by combining all the
   available data of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) with
   information on the political context. The results of models based on
   more than 160 elections in 56 countries show that ideological
   considerations are more important for the vote when all party leaders
   are disliked, incumbent coalitions are large, and polarisation is high.
   Valence evaluations are more important when all parties are
   ideologically distant from the voter, there are few parties to evaluate,
   and polarisation is low. These results indicate that the political
   context needs to be taken into account when interpreting voters'
   electoral signal.},

Abstract = {The article studies theoretically and empirically the strategies
   deployed by business actors with the aim of blocking the advancement of
   environmental policies or regulations that may put a limit on the
   expansion of their productive projects. The selected cases are three
   productive sectors (hydrocarbons, metal mining and livestock) in three
   Argentine provinces (Neuqu \& eacute;n, San Juan and Tierra del Fuego).
   Two data construction techniques were used for this research: the
   analysis and systematization of documents and in-depth interviews with
   business and state actors. The results show that entrepreneurs deploy
   three types of actions combined to influence environmental regulations:
   the use of the economic weight of the sector in the provincial economy,
   social legitimacy and links with provincial state officials.},

Abstract = {This paper considers whether the rules governing state political parties
   help to explain primary election outcomes. I theorize political parties
   will see lower levels of competition during primary elections when they
   have bylaws that centralize power within the state central committee. To
   test this expectation, I created a dataset of state-level party rules by
   collecting and coding provisions within the bylaws of all 100
   state-level Republican and Democratic parties. I operationalize party
   centralization of power as whether or not elected officials are
   represented within each party's formal membership, their state central
   committee, and whether or not each party has an endorsement or
   neutrality policy when it comes to contested primaries. I find the
   centralization of party power does correlate with lower levels of
   competition in primary elections for the House of Representatives in
   2018 and 2020. Specifically, parties are more likely to see uncontested
   primaries when they guarantee ex-officio state committee membership to
   their co-partisan elected officials and are more likely to see fewer
   candidates in general when they guarantee ex-officio state committee
   membership to their co-partisan elected officials and when they do not
   have rules that require the state central committee to remain neutral
   during contested primary elections. While evaluating the causes of this
   trend is beyond the scope of this paper, these findings appear to be
   driven by Republican primaries.},

Abstract = {To fully understand state policy outcomes or elections in the US, we
   need valid over-time measures of state-level public opinion. We
   contribute to the research on measuring state public opinion in two
   ways. First, we respond to Berry, Fording, Hanson, and Crofoot's (BFHC)
   critique of Enns and Koch's measure of state policy mood. We show that
   when BFHC's analysis is performed using the same states and examining
   annual change, it validates the Enns and Koch measure and raises
   questions about the Berry, Ringquist, Fording, and Hanson measure.
   Second, we generate a new measure of state policy mood building on Enns
   and Koch's approach. The new measure has even better properties than the
   previous measure and relates to state presidential vote and state policy
   liberalism in similar ways to Caughey and Warshaw's measure of state
   economic liberalism. We conclude with recommendations for using the
   various direct measures of state public opinion.},

Abstract = {This article examines three Japan-South Korea postwar compensation
   cases: the comfort women issue, the Sakhalin Island forced labor issue,
   and Korean atomic bomb survivor issue. These compensation movements
   produced vastly different results, even though the basic policy
   directions for compensation provision in all three cases were similar.
   Japan's approach toward the comfort women problem has been a complete
   failure, while its treatment of the Sakhalin forced labor issue and the
   atomic bomb issues has been more successful. This article's explanation
   of the different outcomes focuses on the character and geographical base
   of the civic groups leading these compensation movements. In South
   Korea, women's rights activists spearheaded the comfort women
   compensation movement and related victim-relief activities. The Korean
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that assisted the comfort women
   treated this problem not only as a women's rights issue, but also as a
   nationalist issue. In contrast, the Red Cross, a politically neutral
   international organization, promoted the Sakhalin forced labor and
   atomic bomb issues. In short, the different receptions accorded to those
   championing the comfort women issue and those promoting the Sakhalin
   forced labor and atomic bomb issues depended on the principal agent of
   each compensation process. This article aims to provide some
   implications for successfully implementing postwar compensation
   policies. It suggests that, if successful postwar compensation policy
   depends on successful perpetrator-victim reconciliation, establishing
   solidarity between perpetrator and victim countries' civic groups is
   important. This can only be facilitated through the depoliticized and
   transparent operation of leading NGOs both inside and outside the
   redressal-seeking nation.},

Abstract = {Graduate student writing is an under-attended to challenge for many
   incoming graduate students, whose skill levels often do not match the
   expectations of their graduate programs. Utilizing socialization theory
   as a foundation, we propose a Writing Bridge Program model to quickly,
   affordably, and clearly, develop graduate student writing, improve
   retention, and demystify the hidden curriculum. This article lays out
   the need for explicit graduate writing instruction and offers a model
   for meeting this need, particularly in low-resource environments. In
   order to evaluate the success of the program, we look at qualitative
   student comments regarding their experience in the Writing Bridge
   Program. We offer evidence for how dedicated writing programs can impact
   student attitudes toward the writing process through improved confidence
   and familiarity, and by decreasing feelings of impostor syndrome and
   isolation.},

Abstract = {The benefits of experiential learning are well-documented, but large
   course enrollment can be seen as a barrier to providing meaningful
   experiential learning experiences. Political science literature on
   experiential learning in large undergraduate classes has prioritized
   simulations of political processes over direct student engagement in
   actual political processes. This multiple case study analyzes two
   in-class electoral candidate debates, one municipal and one federal,
   organized in a 300-student introductory social welfare course. Detailing
   the tensions inherent to organizing for maximum student engagement, and
   drawing on qualitative data from 73 student reflections, we found that
   in-class electoral candidate debates are feasible and effective as an
   experiential civic education activity. Though preparation work was
   complex and substantial, in-class candidate debates resulted in a rich
   learning foundation for the whole course. Key components for effective
   learning included student generated topics and questions and a wide
   range of candidates. Debriefing was also essential given the varied
   levels of prior knowledge inevitable in large classes. This paper
   extends the literature on teaching in the large policy classroom to a
   promising new experiential learning activity. It provides useful
   guidance for others who wish to harness the benefits of experiential
   civic education in large classes.},

   of the British electoral coalitions? And (ii) how have these group bases
   of support changed in the past decades? We determine which social group
   memberships significantly influence vote choice by using British
   Election Study data. We then incorporate demographic data to measure how
   many votes each social group contributed at each general election from
   1983 to 2019. We find that the Labour Party has been obtaining fewer
   votes from union members and manual labourers, primarily due to
   shrinking group size and declining turnout. Yet, it is attracting more
   support from university graduates and ethnic minorities-groups growing
   in relative size. The Conservatives attract more votes from whites,
   homeowners and Anglicans. These groups are shrinking as a share of the
   population, but turn out at rates higher than the national average.
   Overall, our analysis reveals the changing cleavage structures in
   British politics.},

Abstract = {How much can automatic voter registration (AVR) increase turnout? Unlike
   in many democracies, most American voters face the additional cost of
   registration, resulting in potential disenfranchisement. Automatic voter
   registration is naturally expected to promote turnout, but its causal
   effects have rarely been quantified due to violations of crucial
   assumptions. I show that a variation of AVR that targets existing
   registrants as opposed to eligible nonregistrants-termed automatic
   reregistration (ARR)-increases turnout by 5.8 percentage points. I
   exploit a natural experiment in a novel administrative dataset; election
   officials in Orange County, California, notified existing registrants
   who moved within-county that their residential addresses were
   automatically updated. The treatment alleviated registrants of
   reregistration burdens, but only for those who moved before the legal
   cutoff date, enabling a quasi-random treatment assignment. Contrary to
   the popular narrative, ARR had no significant effect on the turnout of
   registered Democrats, but Republicans' and nonpartisans' turnout
   increased by 8.1 and 7.4 percentage points, respectively.},

Abstract = {The papers in this symposium use Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate
   the consequences of estimating time series models with variables that
   are of different orders of integration. In this summary, I do the
   following: very briefly outline what we learn from the papers; identify
   an apparent contradiction that might increase, rather than decrease,
   confusion around the concept of a balanced time series model; suggest a
   resolution; and identify a few areas of research that could further
   increase our understanding of how variables with different dynamics
   might be combined. In doing these things, I suggest there is still a
   lack of clarity around how a research practitioner demonstrates balance,
   and demonstrates what Pickup and Kellstedt (2021) call I(0) balance.},

Abstract = {Do attempts to level the financial playing field lead more candidates to
   run for office? In theory, public financing should increase competition,
   presumably because additional funding from taxpayers motivates more
   challengers to run for office. I provide a novel test of this logic with
   data on all candidates running for state legislature across all US
   states between 1976 and 2018. The results suggest that public financing
   exerts a generally positive effect on the total number of candidates
   running for state legislative office and specifically increases the
   number of candidates running in elections for every additional year
   after the passage of public financing. This effect is amplified in
   states that offer greater amounts of public funds. I conclude that the
   availability of public financing can be an equalizing force in
   elections, and that state legislative elections continue to experience
   increased competition in the years after the introduction of public
   financing.},

Abstract = {Even the most zealous interpreters of Adam Smith as an advocate of free
   markets and commercial progress have long acknowledged his support for
   public education. Yet the comparatively little scholarship on Smith's
   educational theory never fully articulates his defense of public
   education, often framing it as a corrective to economic and moral
   problems generated by the market while ignoring its political
   importance. We argue here that Smith saw public education as much more
   than anesthesia to treat the wounds inflicted by the market. For Smith,
   compulsory public education not only promotes distributive justice,
   develops moral judgment, and cultivates good citizenship-it is vital for
   securing all three. A compulsory education affords citizens the
   opportunity to sympathize with others and be objects of sympathy while
   teaching them how to be skeptical of the rhetorical efforts of others.
   As such, this paper argues that Smith's major works offer a potent
   defense of public education as a precondition for political judgment
   rather than a mere program ``needed to offset the social costs of the
   division of labor.{''}},

   Evidence from the US Capitol Insurrection},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {117},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1130-1136},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {An unprecedented number of major U.S. companies announced changes to
   their campaign contributions following the Capitol insurrection on
   January 6, 2021. We analyze the role of corporate stakeholders in these
   announcements as well as their implications for democratic institutions
   and business-government relations. Mirroring polarized public reactions
   to the Capitol insurrection, companies with more Democratic-leaning
   stakeholders (e.g., employees, consumers, shareholders) were more likely
   to publicly refuse contributing to Republican legislators who objected
   to the electoral college results. Moreover, these pledges held up in
   available campaign finance records through the third quarter of 2021,
   implying significant losses in corporate political action committee
   contributions for said Republican legislators. Given increasing
   polarization and heightened expectations of the civic responsibility of
   businesses, the partisanship of corporate stakeholders may prove
   important in mobilizing businesses to protect democratic institutions.
   However, such stakeholder pressure may also weaken businesses'
   bipartisan legislative coalitions and compel corporate influence-seeking
   activities to go dark.},

Abstract = {In this article, the efforts of civil society organizations to influence
   climate change policymaking in three countries with very different
   traditions of democratic decision making are compared: in a newly
   developed democracy (Indonesia), in an established democracy in the
   Global South (India), and in an established democracy in the Global
   North with an exceptionally strong civil society (Finland). The
   empirical material consists of 57 in-depth interviews with Civil Society
   Organization (CSO) representatives. The following three arguments about
   CSO influence in climate change politics are made: (1) the nation-state
   is an important avenue of influence for most CSOs, alongside global
   institutions; (2) CSOs influence states through specific contact points,
   rather than by challenging the state as a uniform entity; and (3) CSO
   actors' perception of influence in climate politics may be stronger
   where state capacity is weaker, rather than where civil society itself
   is strong.},

Abstract = {This work concerns the think tanks (TTs) linked to political parties
   that have proliferated recently in Latin America. Specifically, it aims
   to identify the main TTs collaborating with 19 Latin American parties,
   examine their strategic utility for the parties in question and observe
   any variations between them. A content analysis of the websites of the
   TTs has been used to create an index that allows for the measurement of
   the strategic relevance the TTs have for the parties. The analysis
   demonstrates notable variations in relation to the TTs' utility in the
   achievement of the parties' objectives, in such a way that, in some
   cases, they may even acquire the nature of centres of power for the
   parties. Similarly, an exploratory observation has been carried out of
   how certain characteristics of the parties and contexts lead to the
   parties establishing stronger links with the TTs and use these links
   strategically.},

Abstract = {When distributing the benefits produced by social cooperation, Rawls's
   difference principle targets a specific group (i.e., the least
   advantaged group) and requires its expectations to be maximized. One
   natural worry is whether the practical application of the difference
   principle comes with a significant cost to other groups in society.
   Rawls was quite aware of this potential worry and gave his earnest
   efforts to respond to it. His solution comes from his notions of chain
   connection and close-knitness. Rawls's claim was that whenever society
   satisfies both chain connection and close-knitness, the practical
   implementation of the difference principle will (a) always lead to
   strict Pareto improvements, and, as a result, (b) the final state will
   be Pareto optimal. In this article, it will be shown that under close
   scrutiny neither of these claims holds even when society is both chain
   connected and close-knit.},

Abstract = {The possibility of a European space without borders is based on the free
   movement of citizens between the different member states, which, in
   turn, hinges on elementary mechanisms such as cross-border healthcare.
   The eHealth Network (eHN), which emerged as a backbone system in the
   absence of a European health system, faces the objective of implementing
   an interoperable model of electronic prescription at a community level.
   The European Union has formalized a pilot program structured around a
   complex system of community technology networks and based on an
   essential semantic interoperability model. To this end, the project
   begins under certain conditions that pose important similarities with
   the interoperability system of Electronic Prescription of the Spanish
   National Health System.},

Abstract = {Human Development Index (HDI) determines human prosperity in different
   countries using value assets. In general, the primary measurement
   includes the three basic indices, namely education, health, and a decent
   standard of living. HDI is a measure of development and governance
   success in terms of economic growth and human development. Generally,
   studies on HDI take place at the national and regional levels, and
   comparisons of its achievements between countries, while those at the
   municipal level are limited. Studies on the determinants of the success
   of increasing HDI tend to focus on local governments' fiscal capacity
   and political will and rarely touch the capacity of public
   administration in managing government, specifically in the development
   planning stage. This study examined the increased success of the Malang
   City's HDI by adopting a logical framework (log-frame) analysis with
   secondary data from the Malang bureau of statistics. The results showed
   an 80.89 increase in HDI from 2014 to 2018, including the education and
   health indexes, with a decent standard of living. The increased success
   is shown by the Regional Medium Term Development Plan (RPJMD), including
   basic education development program, regional public hospital service
   programs, and food security program for education, health, and
   purchasing power indices. Therefore, the local government needs to
   maintain and enhance the HDI in both medium- and long- term plans. The
   novelty of this study lies in the use of a logical framework in
   preparing regional development plans that support efforts to increase
   HDI consistently in the medium term. This reinforces the need to
   strengthen the perspective of how to achieve development goals compared
   to other studies that focus more on the perspective of the substance of
   development.},

Abstract = {This article explores whether legislators in the U.S. House of
   Representatives talk about the issues important to Latinos on Twitter.
   Other work has emphasized the importance of descriptive representation
   for the substantive advancement of the interests of minority
   constituents. Building on that work, I argue that Latino legislators are
   more likely than their non-Latino peers to discuss issues important to
   the Latino community. In addition, given majoritarian constraints and
   work showing how minority legislators are marginalized in the
   legislative process, I argue that minority legislators - Latinos
   included - are more likely to post symbolic messages than their
   colleagues because they are not able to change the status quo and
   advance the interests of their co-ethnic/racial constituents. I explore
   these hypotheses using data collected from the Twitter profiles of
   members of the 115th U.S. House of Representatives. After accounting for
   other factors, I find that Latino legislators are more likely to post
   about immigration and Hurricane Maria during the 115th Congress. I also
   find that Latino legislators are more likely to post symbolic messages
   when communicating with the public. Both of these findings corroborate
   the notion of minority distinctiveness and add to our understanding of
   Latino representation, minority behavior, and legislative communication.},

Abstract = {While the public image of legislative debates is often less than
   favourable, parliamentary deliberations can be an important indicator of
   policy preferences, issue saliency and cohesion within political
   parties. We consider the case of a parliamentary debate that had a
   considerable long-term political legacy, forging a party system that
   endured for almost a century. The debates in the Irish parliament over
   the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty were a critical juncture that split a
   dominant party, resulting in, first, a civil war and, later, a new mode
   of party competition. We analyse the text of the debates from this
   period to see if they contribute to a greater understanding of the
   ensuing split. Few differences between the two sides in parliament are
   found, which might explain why few were the differences between the key
   actors in the party system that evolved.},

Abstract = {Recent fiscal crises in Detroit and Puerto Rico have brought Financial
   Oversight Boards (FOBs) to the forefront. In spite of these
   developments, there is a notable gap in the literature as social
   scientists have barely studied this type of oversight organization and
   its implications. This article highlights intergovernmental and
   political dynamics that arise with the imposition of FOBs in localities
   facing fiscal distress by studying the case of the Puerto Rican FOB,
   commonly known as la junta. By focusing on the governance of the largest
   debt restructuring in the history of the U.S. bond market, in the
   context of a newly established territorial bankruptcy regime, this
   article explores how the presence of the Puerto Rican FOB has been
   linked to contentious dynamics that challenge local autonomy and
   democratic principles. By analyzing a variety of legal cases, this
   article shows how the creation of the Puerto Rican FOB has also put into
   question the foundations of the unincorporated territory's
   self-governance status.},

Abstract = {Using statistical analysis of 29 European democracies, this article
   looks at the impact of geopolitical threat on democracies' soft power
   reliance. For the time-period of 1999-2010, geopolitical threat is a
   statistically significant variable that boosts soft power use. This
   geopolitical theory posits that political elite create a narrative that
   focuses on national security and start to rely on a higher level of soft
   power to balance against threats. The findings provide answers regarding
   countries' alliance-building processes as well as suggest that the three
   main paradigms of international relations are more compatible than
   previously stated.},

Abstract = {As international trade flourishes, Americans can choose from an
   increasing number of foreign products even at their local grocery
   stores, allowing consumers to directly experience the consequences of
   globalized trade in a simple and intuitive way that does not require
   much political expertise. Yet, most prior scholarship on political
   consumerism assumes that consumers are aware of the political and
   economic implications of their choices at the checkout lane. We move
   away from this assumption, focusing instead on more fundamental
   psychological predispositions such as ethnocentrism that may guide daily
   consumer choices. Using a discrete choice conjoint experiment, we show
   that Americans, on average, exhibit ethnocentric consumer preferences,
   with demand for products falling as they are produced in more culturally
   and ethnically distant places. Additionally, we show that this effect is
   more pronounced among those with higher levels of ethnocentrism. Our
   results provide evidence for a ``naive{''} form of political
   consumerism.},

Title = {Armed and dangerous: Legacies of incumbent-military ties and electoral
   violence in Africa},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {80},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While a growing literature explores the danger that authoritarian
   military legacies pose for regime break-down, there is little research
   on the effects of similar legacies in the context of multiparty
   politics. This is an important gap in the literature since in many cases
   the introduction of formal democratic institutions has led to neither
   democratic consolidation nor regime breakdown. We start exploring this
   lacuna by developing a theory that links the use of violent electoral
   tactics to the ties of the executive with the authoritarian era's
   military. We argue that incumbents with close ties to the authoritarian
   regime's military are more likely to instigate election violence.
   Empirical tests on a sample of 230 elections in 39 African countries
   since 1974 show that election violence is more prevalent in countries
   where such ties exist. These findings speak to several areas of study,
   including those on election violence, and on military legacies.},

Abstract = {On the basis of an attempt to sort political theorizing into ideal
   types, a basic program for a utopian critical political theory is
   outlined. In order to elaborate its specific epistemological interest
   and procedures, the concept of prefiguration, which has recently been
   revitalized in the context of social movements, is used. An endeavor
   that integrates the prefigurative in a threefold way can, in the best
   case, take a step beyond the often negativistic forms of critical
   theorizing without falling into purely ideal-theoretical trajectories.
   To outline this program, the paper searches for traces among
   representatives of the so-called first generation of critical theory and
   also draws from other contexts, such as utopian studies and social
   movement research.},

Abstract = {Since the Eurozone crisis, intense political debate has resurfaced about
   deservingness judgements in European solidarity. To contribute to this
   debate, this article proposes a refined concept of `multi-level blame
   attribution'. It postulates that public support for EU-level welfare
   policies crucially depends on how citizens attribute responsibility for
   economic outcomes across different levels of agency. Results from an
   original public opinion survey conducted in 10 European Union member
   states demonstrate that attributing blame to individuals decreases
   citizens' willingness to show solidarity with needy Europeans, whereas
   attributing blame to the EU increases support. The role of attributing
   blame to national governments is dependent on the country context;
   beliefs that worse economic outcomes are caused by national governments'
   policy decisions tend to dampen support for EU targeted welfare policies
   only in the Nordic welfare states. The article concludes by discussing
   the implications of multi-level blame attribution for the formation of
   public attitudes towards European solidarity.},

Abstract = {Political connections provide substantial benefits to firms. We
   emphasize the ownership of firms as an important channel through which
   political connections operate and identify a resulting link between
   political turnover and turnover in the ownership of firms: Political
   turnover prompts newly politically connected individuals to take, and
   newly disconnected individuals to cede, ownership of firms. This pattern
   should be more pronounced in countries with weaker property rights,
   among firms with publicly recorded owners, and among firms with more
   immobile assets. Moreover, firms that experience changes to ownership
   during periods of political turnover should have elevated political
   connections and therefore pay less taxes and earn higher profits.
   Analyses of the ownership structure of firms in 87 countries are
   consistent with the theory. Because politically connected owners allow
   firms to compensate for other vulnerabilities, the theory also explains
   mixed findings in prior work on the consequences of asset immobility.},

Abstract = {It is commonly thought that British governments can rapidly recover from
   mid-term unpopularity and go on to secure success in general elections
   at the end of their term in office. However, it is in fact very
   difficult to gain a working majority for a full term, and then secure a
   further working majority for a further full term. Thirteen of the twenty
   administrations in the postwar period failed to achieve this. Only three
   administrations managed to recover from serious mid-term unpopularity.
   The 1979-1983 government was, uniquely, saved by the Falklands War. The
   1987-1992 administration recovered from unpopularity in the mid-term by
   brutally dispatching the patriotic war leader of 1982. Only the
   1955-1959 Macmillan government came back for more humdrum reasons, such
   as lower interest rates and improving living standards. In short, if
   politicians think they can readily shake off the mid-term blues, postwar
   British history has some uncomfortable lessons for them.},

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, leaders and society at large invoked
   militarized rhetoric and war metaphors to elevate essential workers and
   inspire collective action. Using a survey experiment we investigate
   whether this type of framing affects public views about (1) individual
   responsibilities, (2) targeted polices, and (3) perceptions of those
   called heroes and soldiers. We find that the war metaphor has minimal
   effects on public attitudes toward policies and individual actions in
   response to the pandemic. Framing the response in militaristic terms
   does, however, appear to affect perceptions of essential workers.
   Counter to our hypotheses, subjects who saw essential workers called
   heroes or soldiers viewed them as more motivated by compensation rather
   than service, and expressed less respect for them, than respondents in
   the control. These findings, including the nulls, make important
   contributions to our understanding of the limits of framing effects in a
   polarized context.},

Abstract = {Survey research shows that those with university degrees are more
   left-liberal along a number of dimensions than their peers without
   higher education. There is even some evidence to suggest a growing
   social and political cleavage centered on educational attainment. Yet,
   claims about the liberalizing effect of universities on political
   ideology and partisan identification rest on observational evidence
   where many assumptions are required to reach causal inference. This may
   account for conflicting findings in published research.
   Here, we employ a fuzzy regression discontinuity design situated in
   Romania, where students who pass a national baccalaureate exam are
   uniquely qualified to enter university. We find that university
   attendance causes more liberal party preferences along the cultural
   dimension of party politics-though not along the economic or left-right
   dimensions of party conflict.},

Abstract = {Over the last decade, the field of political science has been exposed to
   two concomitant developments: a surge of Big Data (BD) and a growing
   demand for transparency. To date, however, we do not know the extent to
   which these two developments are compatible with one another. The
   purpose of this article is to assess, empirically, the extent to which
   BD political science (broadly defined) adheres to established norms of
   transparency in the discipline. To address this question, we develop an
   original dataset of 1555 articles drawn from the Web of Science database
   covering the period 2008-2019. In doing so, we also provide an
   assessment of the current level of transparency in empirical political
   science and quantitative political science in general. We find that
   articles using Big Data are significantly less likely than other, more
   traditional works of political science, to share replication files. Our
   study also illustrates some of the promises and challenges associated
   with extracting data from Web of Science and similar databases.},

Abstract = {Prior research reveals a relationship between various political system
   outputs and the citizens' satisfaction with democracy (SWD). The current
   study contributes to this line of inquiry and demonstrates that the
   perception of the district legislators' overall performance positively
   correlates with the citizens' democratic satisfaction. The multivariate
   analysis of Hungarian panel data from 2018 reveals that the effect is
   most salient in the case of the winners of the election, and less so for
   the losers. Results are robust to a variety of changes in the model. The
   findings indicate that the focus on individual politicians and their
   work has the potential to increase democratic satisfaction even if
   representative political institutions such as parties, governments and
   parliaments are not able to win the citizens' trust.},

Abstract = {Against a backdrop where critical thinking is lauded as a tool to
   navigate the unpredictability of contemporary warfare, Sophy Antrobus
   and Hannah West argue in this article that the military, as an
   institution, and the soldier, as scholar, struggle to listen to a truly
   critical voice. If critical thinking comprises `reason assessment'
   (understanding, analysing, arguing) and `critical spirit' (disposition,
   attitude of mind, culture), how does an institution that values, indeed
   relies on for its effectiveness, uniformity and group identity encourage
   diversity of opinion and develop the critical spirit of its people? Our
   journey, as two women veterans, from insiders to outsiders, has led us
   to argue that professional military education is something of a `black
   box' where we could observe outcomes but found it almost impossible to
   see back inside these institutions.},

Abstract = {Resolutions are a common item of debate in legislative bodies; however,
   they are a relatively understudied aspect of parliamentary procedure,
   particularly in relation to their scope and power. Drawing upon the
   author's experience in the Australian and United States Senate, this
   article develops a typology of resolutions to understand the impact of
   resolutions inside and outside of the chamber. The article proposes that
   resolutions can be categorised as procedural, opinion, or statutory.
   Examining the resolutions proposed in both Senate's in 2021, the article
   finds that they have commonalities in procedural and opinion resolutions
   but have a significant divergence in their statutory capacity and that
   these differences can be linked to their respective institutional
   design.},

Abstract = {The present article analyzes the political influence of the
   anti-neoliberal social movement in Ecuador in the face of the
   negotiation process of the Multipart Trade Agreement (MTA) with the
   European Union ( EU), between 2006 and 2016. The empirical investigation
   pursues the goal of understanding the shift in trade policy of the
   Ecuadorian government through the socioeconomic context on the domestic
   and global level. Different approaches to Critical International
   Political Economy (CIPE) were combined with the concept of political
   opportunity structure in order to trace the influence of the Ecuadorian
   anti-neoliberal movement in the face of the MTA with the EU. This
   process tracing is based on more than 20 qualitative interviews with
   relevant actors and a profound review of secondary sources. The article
   concludes that the political opportunity structure of the investigated
   movement deteriorated during the period of study. The alternative
   discourses to free trade lost influence within civil society and within
   the policy agenda of Rafael Correa's government. In this context, the
   subscription of the MTA represents the inauguration of a new phase of
   open trade policy in Ecuador, and therefore a defeat of the country's
   anti-neoliberal movement.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the controversy against the Jesuits in
   seventeenth-century Italian libertine culture, particularly in the
   republic of Venice. At least three phases of this debate can be
   distinguished. In the first phase we find the militant anti-Jesuitism of
   Paolo Sarpi, who describes the Jesuits as an instrument of the papacy
   and Spain to impose dominion over Italy. In a second phase this polemic
   resumes with the writings of Pallavicino, Loredan, and the Accademia
   degli Incogniti. These writers use the novel to continue their political
   struggle against the papacy and the Jesuits, not without taking up
   themes typical of Sarpi's works. After 1657, with the return of the
   Jesuits to Venice, the anti-Jesuit polemic would be revived by Gregorio
   Leti, a writer active in Geneva who published several of Sarpi's works
   and took up themes characteristic of Pallavicino's works.},

Abstract = {Although there have been attempts to theorise state-Civil Society
   Organizations (CSOs) relations in the Counter-Terrorism (CT) context,
   including the ``co-option and containment{''} and ``duality of
   coercion{''} perspectives, these two-way articulations have failed to
   account for the range of strategic options open to the state in
   regulating CSOs. This study presents the framework of Strategic
   Exclusion, Co-option and Containment (SECC) to underscore the general
   patterns of state engagement of CSOs in the context of CT. It mapped
   secondary evidence in 19 countries and used three illustrative case
   studies (Australia, Uganda and Russia) to examine the elements of SECC,
   namely, states' exclusion of CSOs in law and policymaking on CT, the use
   of strategic ambiguity in enacting and interpreting CT laws,
   delegitimizing or criminalising advocacy and influencing the
   transformation of CSOs into state adjutants. This pattern of engagement
   with CSOs is transforming voluntary and associational life in precarious
   ways. The article advances the Copenhagen School and rational-actor
   model of global strategic decision-making, and contributes to discourses
   on the closing of civic spaces, democratic recession and the resurgence
   of authoritarianism. It lays a foundation for generalisable theory and
   future empirical research on state behaviour towards CSOs in the context
   of violence, conflict, and security.},

Abstract = {The energy market is shifting from fossil fuels to renewables. This
   transition is creating new geopolitical dynamics. In the past,
   traditional energy geopolitics focused on the concentrated distribution
   of fossil fuel resources and the conflicts and dependencies that this
   created. In contrast, the `new' renewable energy geopolitics emphasises
   the dispersed distribution or decentralisation of production capacity
   and the independence of states this generates. However, the market for
   lithium, which is essential to renewable energy storage through being a
   key component of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, does not entirely fit
   theoretical conceptions of the renewable energy market's dynamics. By
   focusing on China as a critical case, this article shows that lithium
   geopolitics has potentially created new (inter)dependencies and
   opportunities for conflicts, while also paradoxically enhancing state
   interindependence in renewable technology energy production. Thus, this
   hybrid form of energy geopolitics necessitates revising conventional
   energy security explanations to match these new market conditions.},

Abstract = {We document the effectiveness of automated (robo) calls for increasing
   voter participation in contrast to most published research which finds
   little or no effect from automated calls. We establish this finding in a
   large field experiment which mimics campaign behavior with a targeted,
   partisan get-out-the-vote campaign. Our findings show that across all
   treatments, automated calls led to three additional votes for every
   thousand subjects called during the 2014 midterm general election.
   Additionally, our experimental design allows for testing how the number
   of calls in a treatment, that is dosage, affects voter turnout. Here,
   results show that three extra calls increase the treatment effect to
   seven additional votes per thousand subjects called, but that too many
   additional calls decrease that effect to statistical insignificance in a
   six-call treatment.},

Abstract = {Throughout American history some members of Congress are beset with the
   unfortunate predicament of facing a fellow incumbent in their bids for
   reelection. One culprit is responsible for these atypical contests:
   redistricting. Using district and sub-district level data, this research
   note provides the first systematic coverage of all dueling incumbent
   general election U.S. House races from 1843 to 2018. We chronicle and
   analyze when we expect to see dueling incumbent races, the ability of
   parties to target out-party incumbents, and the electoral value of
   previously represented constituents for incumbents in reconfigured
   districts. Although incumbent duels are uncommon, they comprise a
   substantial number of incumbent general election defeats in contests
   following redistricting.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {A growing literature in comparative Latin American Politics highlights
   how policy feedback effects help explain the resilience of neoliberal
   reforms in the region. These works emphasize private actors/interest
   groups to explain neoliberal policy continuity. Nonetheless, given their
   focus on continuity, these works do little to explore other instances in
   which neoliberal feedback cannot preclude change. This paper presents an
   instance in which powerful private actors favored by neoliberal reforms
   were incapable of resisting change. An Act of the Peruvian Congress
   adopted in 2016 opened the door for individual pensioners to withdraw up
   to 95.5 percent of all their accumulated savings at the point of
   retirement. Ensuing reforms approved by Congress during the COVID-19
   emergency (2020-2021) further weakened private administrators of these
   pension funds (AFPs). The case shows how the conflicting interests
   between private service providers and future pensioners make the service
   providers vulnerable; a divide also found in other neoliberal reforms.},

Abstract = {The misalignment of goals among researchers, external organizational
   partners (OPs), and study participants is thought to pose a challenge to
   the successful implementation of collaborative research projects.
   However, the goals of different collaborative team members almost never
   are elicited, making identification of misalignment and its potential
   consequences a difficult task. In this evaluation of a United Nations
   Nonviolent Communication Program conducted in Bangladesh, the Maldives,
   and Sri Lanka, I collected qualitative and quantitative data on OPs' and
   study participants' expected program impacts. I find that there are
   differences in OP and participant goals and that misalignment appears to
   bear some responsibility for participant dissatisfaction with the
   program. I also observe evidence that as the program progressed,
   participants' expected program impacts began to more closely approximate
   those of the OPs. I conclude with thoughts on the benefits of explicitly
   measuring research team goals and expectations and addressing their
   misalignment.},

Volume = {22},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The notion of vulnerable groups has gained relevance in international
   legal instruments while being criticised in philosophical literature for
   its disabling potential and disempowering consequences. The article
   argues that the category of group vulnerability should not be abandoned,
   being an opportunity for resistance, visibility, and a place for
   dissent: vulnerable groups can both function as a sounding board for
   claims and make demands for recognition, resetting the political agenda
   and the topics of public debate, and allow the level of collective needs
   to emerge from the level of individual interests, thereby guaranteeing a
   fairer distribution of resources. For this purpose, the article provides
   two definitions of group vulnerability that avoid both the risks of
   essentialism and of labelling outcomes. The article also analyses the
   political value of vulnerable groups, highlighting that it is
   conceivable as an enabling condition, a source of political agency and
   mobilisation.},

Abstract = {How should ideology be understood, and should we be concerned if
   Americans lack it? Combining widely used survey questions with an
   incentivized coordination game, we separately measure individuals' own
   policy preferences and their knowledge of what other ideological group
   members expect them to believe. This allows us to distinguish knowledge
   of ideological norms-what liberals and conservatives believe ought to go
   with what-from adherence to those norms. We find that a nontrivial
   portion of those reporting ideologically inconsistent preferences do so
   knowingly, suggesting their lack of ideological constraint can be
   attributed to pragmatism rather than innocence. Additionally, a question
   order experiment reveals that priming ideological norms before measuring
   policy preferences promotes ideological adherence, suggesting
   ideological constraint is at least partially attributable to
   norm-conformity pressure. Together, these findings raise the question
   whether ideology is actually desirable or if it instead allows elites to
   reverse the direction of accountability.},

Abstract = {Public opinion regarding EU integration has become increasingly
   important in light of both increasing public scepticism to integration
   and the EU's gradual shift towards integration of core state powers
   (CSPs). This article contributes to an emerging literature studying
   support for integration of core state powers by investigating whether
   such integration, given its greater potential for polarisation and
   activation of nationalist identities, is more likely to be opposed than
   regulatory integration. The results show that some CSP integration may
   meet greater support than regulatory integration. They also show that a
   larger number of exclusively national citizens support externally,
   rather than internally, oriented CSP integration. This suggests that
   what policy area a policy belongs to may be more important for
   predicting contestation of its integration than whether it is a core
   state or regulatory power.},

Abstract = {Many socially conservative settings oppose pro-LGBT+ advocacy because of
   its perceived threat to ``traditional values.{''} Can messaging on these
   issues from sources considered to have similar values be more effective
   than messaging from sources considered to have different values? This
   research uses the move towards legal protection of certain LGBT+ rights
   in Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, and South Africa to understand whether
   signals of changing social norms from African sources are better able to
   shift perspectives of those elsewhere on the continent than primes from
   Western sources. Using a survey experiment conducted in Uganda, I show
   that neither one-off messaging from African sources nor one-off
   messaging from Western sources shifts beliefs or behavior on LGBT+
   issues. Rather, these messages produce backlash to both African and
   Western sources. This work highlights the challenges of attempting to
   rapidly change perspectives on LGBT+ issues in the most socially
   conservative settings.},

Abstract = {Ramzan Kadyrov's regime in Chechnya has been shaped by a republic-level
   nation-building process. To outbid his nationalist and religious rivals,
   the Chechen leader has followed a political strategy that bears some
   similarities to korenizatsiia, the early Soviet policy of establishing a
   strong interconnection between administrative structures and ethnicity.
   Under Kadyrov, Chechen nationalism has thoroughly penetrated the state
   institutions of the republic. A new ethnic Chechen bureaucracy has
   emerged, one with durable connections to federal institutions. Thus,
   with this sustained emphasis on Chechen nationalism, Kadyrov has made
   Chechen society far more deeply integrated with Russia than it has been

Abstract = {This article investigates the concept and measurement of regulatory
   decentralization with a focus on minimum wages and renewable electricity
   standards. These two policy areas are chosen because they admit of a
   clear interpretation in continuous terms and vary substantially across
   jurisdictions. Concurrent central and subcentral regulatory competencies
   have a straightforward quantitative interpretation in these two policy
   areas. The article presents data on the effective autonomy of subcentral
   governments to determine their own minimum wage rates and renewable
   energy standards. It then tests whether more decentralized minimum wage
   and renewable energy regulatory regimes yield a consistently lower level
   of regulation and higher degree of interregional policy variation. I
   find that central governments are more likely to set regulatory minimums
   than maximums in these areas, and that therefore regulatory
   centralization does promote a higher level of regulation, but likely not
   through a competitive dynamic, and less policy variance.},

Abstract = {The article contributes to the study of the relationship between
   religion and populist mobilization strategies of non-right-wing-populist
   actors in the post-Soviet space. It analyzes how religious references
   are employed to appeal to voters' collective identities in the Republic
   of Moldova. The analysis of two Moldovan parties' electoral campaigns in
   2019-2020 highlights how notions of ``religious values{''} and
   ``traditional values{''} are used to evoke the ``cultural toolkit.{''}
   By stressing the homogeneity of voters or the dichotomy between ``the
   people{''} and ``the elite,{''} the parties tie their religious
   references to different geopolitical narratives and society's sets of
   core values.},

Abstract = {South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham is one of the most powerful actors
   in American politics and has been for over a quarter-century.
   Unquestionably, Graham fits the bill of a strategic and progressively
   ambitious politician. Interestingly however, in a time of increasing
   partisan and ideological polarization in the U.S. Congress, Graham has
   moderated his representation. In this article, we situate the political
   career of Lindsey Graham within the broader milieu of the changing
   partisan dynamics of Congress, his state, and southern politics. With a
   bevy of data, we show that the sorting of the American electorate and
   nationalized voting behavior have undermined Graham's political support
   across the partisan aisle. Nevertheless, this development has not placed
   Graham in electoral jeopardy because of the impressive Republican
   advantage in South Carolina, which should persist for years to come
   despite evidence of a gradually growing Democratic opposition.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article was to analyze the dialectic of rights and
   responsibilities in education. The importance of education is so great
   that the thesis of the responsibility of the person to receive education
   has now been recognized. In order for the right to education to be
   exercised, the domestic law of states provides for a set of
   responsibilities for participants in the educational process, the
   implementation of which actually guarantees access to education. The
   real economic opportunities of States have a great impact on the real
   content of the dialectical process of interaction of rights and
   responsibilities in the field of education. The relationship between the
   participants in the educational process is regulated at several levels:
   first, the rules of domestic law and then the contractual level,
   represented by the statutes of educational institutions, comes into
   force. It is concluded that, in the most advanced systems, there may be
   a level of intra-group agreements that are completely voluntary. The
   practical content of the educational process is influenced by several
   factors, including ideology, the objectives set by a given society, the
   traditions and customs that have developed in it.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article was to conduct a theoretical analysis of the
   political causes of the Ukrainian revolution. The methods of analysis,
   synthesis and correlation used made it possible to study political
   conditions and factors in relation to psychological, economic and
   cultural factors. It was determined that the causes of the revolution
   are a permanent political crisis, a conflict between the government and
   the opposition, the ineffectiveness of the actions of the institutions
   of government and the actions of the opposition; together with changes
   in the socio-economic structure, the religiosification of society and
   the influence of political factors on the development of abnormal social
   behaviors, among other factors. The research carried out allows us to
   conclude that a relationship of stable factor ``social disorientation -
   social anomie - social cynicism - social madness{''} has been formed in
   the Ukrainian public consciousness. Therefore, the algorithm for the
   growth of revolutionary feelings under the influence of socio-political
   factors shows that this relationship has a tendency to repeat itself and
   is characterized by a narrowing over time.},

Abstract = {Deterrence studies have experienced four waves. The three first ones
   mainly focused on nuclear deterrence and the fourth one was aimed at
   deterring terrorism and the so-called ??rogue states??. However,
   deterrence below the threshold of war ???that is, the conflict in the
   gray zone??? has received little attention. This article proposes an
   exploratory theoretical framework to deter escala-tion within conflicts
   in the gray zone. First, and based on a review of both classical and
   recent liter-ature some fundamental principles of deterrence theory
   applicable to gray zone escalation are presented. Then, the why and how
   of escalation in the gray zone are discussed. Next, the article analyzes
   the challenges to deterrence in the first two rungs of the scalation
   ladder. Finally, the article presents a series of theoretical keys for
   the practice of deterrence of conflicts in the gray zone.},

Abstract = {This document focuses on a type of relationship between the media and
   the penal system, through the work of a case study around a recent
   femicide in Colombia, presented by the television program Septimo Dia.
   It inscribes the sensationalist communication matrix of this within a
   scopic regime that discriminates against some types of violence over
   others that it hides, for political reasons, and correlates the
   visibility of femicide with that of the murder of social leaders in the
   country. It involved the review of the press, audiovisual material and
   databases, and made it possible to create a proposal to read this type
   of relationship between the media and the criminal justice system within
   what will be presented here as fiscal journalism.},

   assistance},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {125},
Pages = {211-242},

Abstract = {In democratic contexts, the institution of rights strategically operates
   as the political conduction of citizens by the State. Especially in the
   context of social policies, a set of actions and programs work to govern
   vulnerable populations, in order to control fortuitous events and manage
   social risks. In the face of these gears, this article aims to analyze
   how the Benefit of Continued Provision (BPC) has served to biopolitical
   strategies of neoliberal rationality as an instrument of knowledge and
   control of the population. Methodologically, the study makes use of
   indirect, documentary and bibliographic sources, characterizing itself
   as a theoretical essay, based on analyzes carried out through Michel
   Foucault's concepts-tools. The problematizations produced from the
   analysis show that social assistance policies, including the BPC, act
   within a democratic governmentality that, by constituting subjects as
   subjects of rights, in the same movement constitutes them as governable
   subjects. Such governance practices end up subjectivizing subjects in
   order to lead them to the standards of normality, modulating the social
   risks that cross the population. Although social assistance policies
   should not be rejected, they are not justified in themselves, which is
   why they must be described, analyzed and problematized.},

Abstract = {Over the last 15 years, the shale gas boom has transformed the US energy
   industry and numerous local communities. Political representatives from
   fracking areas have become more conservative, yet whether this elite
   shift reflects mass preferences is unclear. We examine the effects of
   fracking on the political participation of voters and donors in boom
   areas. While voters benefit from higher wages and employment, other
   fracking-induced community changes may dampen their participation. In
   contrast, donors experience more of the economic gains without the
   negative externalities. Combining zip code-level data on shale gas wells
   with individual data on political participation, we find that fracking
   lowers voter participation and increases donations. Both of these
   effects vary in ways that benefit conservatives and Republicans. These
   findings help explain why Republican candidates win more elections and
   become more conservative in fracking areas. Our results show broadly
   positive economic changes can have unequal political impacts.},

Abstract = {Citizenship can be seen as successive moments of heightened
   consciousness about belonging. Contests over citizenship in the
   contemporary world may be construed in terms of a constitutional moment
   which has transformed the Constitution into an `insurgent' text -
   recasting the constitutional order from a fetter on democracy to one of
   re-iteration of the principles that were adopted by `We, the people'.
   The resurgent `people' have claimed the power to `launch something
   unprecedented' by recalling the constitutional moment. A range of
   innovative protests in India have inserted new idioms of constitutional
   citizenship through rallies and sit-ins, street art, and theatre, asking
   for a democratic conversation on the constitution and law. These
   iterations have led to a resurgence of citizenship by making the
   Constitution popular.},

Abstract = {Since the 1980s, rising Asia has opened up our understanding of liberal
   citizenship to the forces of a globalizing world economy. Previously,
   scholars have treated citizenship as an ideal type - a construct of
   politico-legal and spiritual elements - determined by the nation-state.
   My approach situates the unstable character of citizenship within the
   vicissitudes of global capitalism and competitive nations. By
   investigating citizenship not as a fixed construct, but as a contingent
   category subject to transnational forces, I emphasize the interaction of
   newcomers and nation-states in shaping the mutations of citizenship.},

Abstract = {Opinion polling of public attitudes on the UK's intelligence agencies
   reveals that Britons are often still ambivalent around issues of agency
   activity and powers despite increasing engagement and outreach activity.
   Drawing parallels with similar polling in North America and Europe, this
   article suggests that while public support for national agencies remains
   relatively strong, with high levels of `trust', views on what
   intelligence agencies do - and who `does intelligence' - remain deeply
   wedded to James Bond-like cliches. Daniel W B Lomas and Stephen Ward
   argue that, while popular perceptions of intelligence have traditionally
   offered cover and even increased awareness of agencies such as the
   Secret Intelligence Service, the lack of public awareness is dangerous
   as agencies build a `licence to operate' in the 21st century.},

Abstract = {The article takes the lively discussion of citizenship in the 1990s as
   its point of departure, focusing in particular on the works by etienne
   Balibar and Engin Isin. The author shows how the (illegal) migrant
   emerged as a paradigmatic figure in that discussion in the wake of the
   struggles of the sans-papiers in France and elsewhere in Europe. What
   characterizes the discussion of citizenship and migration since the end
   of the 1990s is an attempt to theoretically grasp the multifarious
   tensions between processes of deprivation and dispossession on the one
   hand and migrants' agency and even the autonomy of migration on the
   other hand. It is working within this field of tensions that many
   scholars focused their analysis on the blurring of the boundary between
   inclusion and exclusion, pointing to migrants' capacity to open new
   spaces of citizenship. Borders - external as well as internal - came
   therefore to play an increasingly important role in the debates
   surrounding citizenship and migration. In the last section, the article
   discusses the ongoing conjuncture of crises, underscoring both the
   persistent predicament of migration to and in Europe and the crucial
   role of migrants in the building of coalitions for social justice.},

Abstract = {Vastly increased transnational business activity in recent decades has
   been accompanied by controversy over how to cope with its social and
   environmental impacts. The most prominent policy response thus far
   consists of international guidelines. We investigate to what extent and
   why citizens in a high-income country are willing to restrain companies
   to improve environmental and social conditions in other countries.
   Exploiting a real-world referendum in Switzerland, we use choice and
   vignette experiments with a representative sample of voters (N = 3,010)
   to study public demand for such regulation. Our results show that
   citizens prefer strict and unilateral rules (with a substantial
   variation of preferences by general social and environmental concern)
   while correctly assessing their consequences. Moreover, exposure to
   international norms increases demand for regulation. These findings
   highlight that democratic accountability can be a mechanism that
   motivates states to contribute to collective goods even if not in their
   economic interest and that awareness of relevant international norms
   among citizens can enhance this mechanism.},

Abstract = {The first mover advantage is a critical factor for the productivity of
   firms that enter new markets. Surprisingly, however, the importance of
   timing is rarely explored in studies of interest groups and their
   influence on new policy agendas. In this article, we therefore develop a
   theory of first mover advantages in lobbying. We argue that especially
   more resourceful and more highly affected organizations should be able
   to benefit from early lobbying. Using granular survey data on the timing
   of lobby efforts by interest groups on Covid-19 related policies in 10
   European democracies, we test this novel theory. Our results show that
   timing is an important predictor of lobbying influence, but that
   interest groups which are hardly affected by a new policy cannot benefit
   from early mover advantages in the same way as affected organizations.
   Moreover, we give evidence for differences in first mover advantages
   depending on organizational staff resources.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic illuminates possibilities for creating states of
   exception while simultaneously destabilizing the Mexico-U.S. border
   through the politics of fear. Specifically, the Migrant Protection
   Protocols (MPP), Zero Tolerance Policy (ZTP), COVID-19 CAPIO, Asylum
   Cooperative Agreements (ACA), and Title 42-using the pandemic under an
   arcane section of U.S. law to immediately expel asylum seekers and
   refugees, in particular-highlight the formation of a state of exception
   consistent with the work of Agamben. They also document how the politics
   of fear is used to reinforce hegemonic narratives targeting asylum
   seekers while attempting to reinforce political agendas that lean toward
   a specific brand of nationalism using the lens of public health as a
   context. The U.S. government under the Trump administration, and the
   Biden administration to a lesser extent, constructed these policies
   aimed primarily at refugees and asylum seekers from El Salvador,
   Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, thereby violating laws and
   international treaty obligations.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Sectarian activists in Pakistan are occasionally arrested by law
   enforcement agencies in sectarian-terrorism crimes but very rarely
   convicted by the courts. Contemporary research mainly relates slow
   convictions in sectarian crimes to defects in the state's criminal
   justice system. But this article connects anti-terrorism courts' (ATCs)
   slow convictions and large-scale acquittals in sectarian-terrorism
   crimes to vague anti-terror laws, judges' and witnesses' security
   concerns and the incompetence of the prosecution and judges. The article
   applies the mixed method of research by using data from personal
   interviews, online sources, newspapers, research journals, articles and
   books. It argues that undefined anti-terrorism laws, judges' security
   concerns and sectarian activists' terrorization of judges and
   eyewitnesses add to the ATCs' slow convictions in sectarian-terrorism
   crimes in the Punjab. Moreover, prosecution and judges' incompetence and
   their inclination towards Islamic principles in judgements show bias in
   the application of sectarian-terrorism related laws that have been
   causing large-scale acquittals in the ATCs.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the Cold War, the EU aims to advance to a relevant and
   autonomous actor in international politics-especially concerning
   security and defense politics. Scholars interested in whether the EU
   member states actually converge in their security and defense
   preferences often analyze strategy papers qualitatively, focusing on
   selected countries at specific points in time. In this article, we
   propose a dictionary approach for analyzing the development of security
   and defense preferences within the EU over the last three decades using
   quantitative text analysis. We make use of 163 strategy papers,
   published by all EU member states and the EU itself since 1994. The
   findings show that EU member states react similarly to international
   events, but do not converge substantially in their preferences.
   Furthermore, there is no substantial convergence to the position of the
   EU itself. We finally discuss usefulness and validity of quantitative
   text analysis in comparative research more broadly.},

Journal = {TOCQUEVILLE REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {69-87},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {It has become increasingly common for students and scholars to criticize
   Rawls's work as irrelevant, or worse, when it comes to issues of race
   and justice. Though he clearly judges both structural and systemic
   racial hierarchy and interpersonal racial disrespect to be
   non-controversially unjust, Rawls does not much explore, either in his
   ideal theory or in his non-ideal theory, issues at the intersection of
   race and justice. In this essay, drawing from both his texts and
   biography, I highlight some of Rawls's thoughts on, and the seriousness
   with which he approached, these matters. Though I do not attempt to
   answer all the criticisms that have been raised regarding Rawls's
   approach to issues of race and justice, I answer a few and to point the
   way toward resources that might prove fruitful in answering others. With
   respect to issues of race and justice, there are good reasons, better
   than critics typically acknowledge, to continue exploring the extent to
   which working from within a Rawlsian framework we can successfully think
   through our aspirational ideals and eliminate existing injustices.},

Abstract = {In June 2022, Spain hosted one of the most consequential summits in
   NATO's history. The doors of the Alliance were opened to Finland and
   Sweden, leaders made clear that they would continue to support Ukraine,
   outlined the largest reinforcement of Alliance deterrence and defense in
   decades, and agreed NATO's new Strategic Concept. For the first time,
   Indo-Pacific partners were invited to join a NATO Summit. These and
   other key decisions taken at the Summit will ensure NATO continues to
   adapt and protect its citizens in a more competitive and dangerous
   world. This article provides an overview of these decisions in the
   context of the more unpredictable security environment facing the

Abstract = {Despite growing attention to electoral brands, political scientists have
   largely remained ``color blind,{''} neglecting parties' chromatic
   choices. Moreover, scholars dedicated limited attention to how party
   organizations converge on the use of similar structures and
   communication strategies, thereby engaging in a process of institutional
   isomorphism. We seek to simultaneously fill both gaps by examining the
   logos of more than 300 parties in 35 democracies during the latest
   political elections. Our findings show that a strong relationship exists
   between ideology and the use of certain color hues: left-wing party
   logos mainly display hues at the red end of the color spectrum, while
   blue hues prevail among right-wing parties. Likeminded parties'
   chromatic isomorphism, however, is moderated by country and
   party-specific factors. Notably, the correlation between color hue and
   ideology is stronger in Western Europe and among older parties.},

Abstract = {Relying on theories of motivated reasoning, I hypothesize that
   individuals who favor a nominee will prefer a legalistic confirmation
   hearing, while those who oppose a nominee will prefer a politicized
   confirmation hearing. Analyzing survey data from five recent nominees
   and a survey experiment, I find support for this hypothesis. The results
   have implications for how the public interacts with the nature of the
   Court's hybrid institutional structure. Specifically, I argue the
   results support the notion that the public engages in a political
   calculation when making judgements about the Court. When it serves their
   preferences, people will view the Court as a legalistic institution;
   however, when individuals believe there is an advantage in viewing the
   Court as a political institution, they are more likely to desire the
   Court to be evaluated in political ways.},

Abstract = {The idea of citizens being mere spectators who ``watch{''} politics is
   widespread in public and academic debates. Scholarship in relation to
   democratic theory tends to see spectatorship as a state in which
   citizens are politically uninterested, isolated, and passive. Although
   this understanding aptly captures the problems about the idea of
   spectatorship, it is only a partial awareness and prevents us from
   seeing that positive forms of spectatorship are also possible. I show
   that positive spectatorship occurs when citizens show an interest in one
   or more political problems and, together with others, strive to
   understand them better. I consider the distinctive elements of this form
   of spectatorship characterized by careful observance, relationality, and
   proactivity. I argue that it is normatively desirable, and I reflect on
   the ways in which positive spectatorship helps thinking about
   democratizing politics. Relatedly, I also revisit the theatrical
   metaphor of politics, which is often associated to the concept of
   spectatorship as something negative for democracy. I argue that, when
   combined with a proper understanding of spectatorship, the theatrical
   metaphor can be used originally to envisage ways forward in the
   democratization of our societies.},

Abstract = {Duverger's law holds that single member district rules produce two-party
   systems, but third party voting remains an important feature of these
   institutional contexts. To explain the discrepancy between theory and
   empirical reality, Gary Cox specified four conditions that are necessary
   for the theoretical expectations to bear out. Yet, subsequent research
   has focused mostly on just one of these conditions, namely, that voters
   have correct information about the competitiveness of their preferred
   party in the district. The purpose of this paper is to assess the role
   of all four conditions. Using original survey data from the 2015 United
   Kingdom general election, the analysis suggests that violations of the
   information condition matter, but that violations of the short-term
   instrumental rationality condition can be a significant factor as well.
   Consequently, future research should pay more attention to this
   condition when seeking to explain third party voting.},

Abstract = {The Portuguese elections of early 2022 took place during the most severe
   wave of COVID-19 infections in Portugal. Nevertheless, the pandemic was
   not the most important issue in the campaign. Although opinion polls
   forecast a narrow election, the Socialists gained their second absolute
   majority in history. The electoral results marked a breakthrough for the
   radical right and Liberals. Every other traditional party had its worst
   electoral night in democratic history. The Christian Democrats and the
   Greens ended up exiting the parliament. The 2022 general elections saw
   the Socialists rise to dominance and the end of the Portuguese
   exceptionalism in keeping the radical right at arm's length.},

Abstract = {The examination of the interaction between the institutions in American
   state politics has long suffered from a dearth of data. This is the case
   despite the importance of understanding the separation of powers in the
   states and the specific effects on policy making and policy outcomes. In
   this article, I introduce a new, original dataset of court-curbing
   introductions by state legislators. The data include information on more
   than 1,200 state legislative bills that would restrict the power of the
   courts. In this article, I provide descriptive statistics for the data,
   employ the data to test hypotheses, and explain how this data may be
   used in future scholarly research on the interactions between state
   legislators and state courts.},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Examining the writings of more than 150 IRA prisoners, this article
   explains why a majority of jailed republicans supported the movement's
   strategic reorientation between the anti-criminalisation protests of the
   late 1970s and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. First, it argues,
   experiences of prison protests, culminating in the hunger strike of
   1981, inclined prisoners to endorse electoral interventions to counter
   their isolation. Sinn Fein's subsequent successes impelled prisoners to
   back electoralism more constructively, envisioning an all-Ireland
   `pan-nationalist' front. By the end of the 1980s, many republican
   prisoners regarded tactical eclecticism as vital for their campaign's
   advance. Second, the article contends, throughout the 1980s and 1990s,
   prisoners pragmatically approved new methods as open-ended experiments.
   Electoralism, pan-nationalism, and, in the 1990s, peace talks were
   supposed to aggregate and strengthen the struggle. Tactics were
   dispensable, and worthwhile only insofar as they enhanced the perceived
   prospects of victory. By the Good Friday Agreement, prisoners espousing
   a transitional, constitutional route to Irish unification regarded even
   the IRA's `armed struggle' as suspensible. Woven through prisoners'
   voluminous acclaim for tactical adaptability, traditions of
   intra-movement discipline and unity cohered the bulk of the IRA's prison
   population.},

Abstract = {Taking place amid a global pandemic, the 2021 Senedd Election saw Welsh
   Labour returned as the largest party at the sixth consecutive occasion
   since the institution's founding in 1999. Results for opposition parties
   were mixed: the Conservatives achieved their highest ever vote share but
   their seat tally fell short of pre-election expectations, and Plaid
   Cymru again made little progress. Using data from the 2021 Welsh
   Election Study, we explore the election campaign and results, and offer
   a first analysis of vote choice. We find that Labour not only benefitted
   from incumbency advantages drawn from voters' approval of the Welsh
   Government's handling of the pandemic, but through its use of symbols,
   branding and messaging, the party continues to remain attuned to a
   national identity position that broadly aligns with that of the
   electorate as a whole.},

Title = {Political regimes matter: Participation practices in the context of a
   competitive oligarchic policymaking in water management in Duque de
   Caxias, Brazil, 2007-2017},
Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLICY},

Abstract = {This article covers all types of participation in water policy processes
   in the city of Duque de Caxias in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   Even though open opposition to the government is legally permitted since
   Brazil's democratization process, barriers remain for activist leaders
   to formulate and signify their preferences toward the government. The
   current literature on direct participation practices in policy processes
   tends to leave out political regime variables. This case study aims to
   show that, in fact, political regime variables are crucial. The article
   reintroduces participation practices in power dynamics in local water
   policymaking, building a model based on competitive oligarchy,
   multilevel policy coalitions, and political capacity literature. It
   argues that the political regime matters in understanding participation
   practices and that, despite legal democratization that opened rights to
   organize opposition and participation in Brazil in 2008, local activist
   leaders are restrained by a particular kind of oligarchy an oligarchic
   technical-political-productivist policy coalition that ``owns{''} policy
   through direct participation in the policy process. This case study
   shows that four decades after the policy shift in the 1980s, in some
   territories and sectors Brazilian democracy may be on the pathway of
   competitive oligarchy very open to opposition rights, but still closed
   to the participation of this opposition in policy and decision-making
   processes.},

Abstract = {We propose a probabilistic control-system model to measure gradations of
   organizational coherence. Our model expresses the four flows of the
   Communicative Constitution of Organizations, and moves beyond common
   network-based analyses to quantify the emergence of organization through
   communication. In the model, an organization's leadership selects from a
   set of discrete strategies, the number and complexity of which are
   regulated by membership negotiation and self-structuring. Activity
   coordination constrains the internal response of the organization to the
   selected strategy, and institutional positioning shapes its ultimate
   outcome in the environment. Our model introduces a new partition of the
   four flows between those that affect the set of available strategies
   versus the precision of organizational control. The model informs proxy
   measurements of the maturation of a partial organization, such as an
   insurgency. Its quantified approach enables testing of the
   interrelationships and tradeoffs among flows in an agent-based
   simulation of varying levels of partial organizations competing and
   cooperatively exploring for resources. The most consequential flow in
   our scenario, measured in comparison to baseline data, is membership
   negotiation. Complex behaviours emerge in simulation results, such as
   information asymmetries, tradeoffs between power and efficiency, the
   contrast between short- and long-term gains, and individual versus group
   utility.},

Abstract = {This intellectual incursion seeks to analyze, on the one hand, in the
   combined study of the already existing bibliography on Cuentame Como
   Paso, and the theoretical diatribes about the specificity of mass
   culture in Modernity, a mediating synthesis that is in a position to
   provide us with the intellectual tools required for an analysis of the
   underground ideological elements of one of the most successful series
   and audience in the history of television in Spain.
   The objective of our invective will be marked by the attempt to tear the
   ideological veil of one of the most successful productions of mass
   culture in our country. The study that concerns us will shed light on
   the objective that we have set ourselves, that is, that the history of
   the Alcantara family will serve as a prototypical model for the veiled
   defense of the passive Francoist revolution at the mercy of
   industrialism and the fraternal constitution of a new Spanish people
   (structure of feeling) that will end up voting the Constitution of 1978
   and supporting, without ambiguity, the figure of King Juan Carlos I as
   the pilot of change in Spain.},

Abstract = {The extent of our duties to mitigate climate change is commonly
   conceptualized in terms of temperature goals like the 1.5 degrees C and
   the 2 degrees C target and corresponding emissions budgets. While I do
   acknowledge the political advantages of any framework that is relatively
   easy to understand, I argue that this particular framework does not
   capture the true extent of our mitigation duties. Instead I argue for a
   more differentiated approach that is based on the well-known distinction
   between subsistence and luxury emissions. At the heart of this approach
   lies the argument that we have no budget of substantial, net-positive
   luxury emissions left. In a world in which dangerous climate change has
   begun, we must expect all further substantial, net-positive luxury
   emissions to cause harm. Since they lack the kind of justification
   needed for them to be nevertheless permissible, I conclude that we must
   stop emitting them with immediate effect. I also briefly discuss the
   difficult case of subsistence emissions and offer some first thoughts on
   the morality of a third category of emissions, what I call `transition
   emissions'.},

Abstract = {Libertarian ideas of self-ownership and the priority of bodily autonomy
   have featured prominently in the political debate over vaccination
   programmes and the justifiability or otherwise of restricting the
   liberty of the unvaccinated. In this article we look at a selection of
   recent right-libertarian literature to show that there is a considerable
   divergence between the application of consistent libertarian principles
   to this issue by academic libertarians and the strident opposition to
   vaccination programmes and vaccine mandates expressed by people who
   profess to be libertarians in the public-political debate.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {5},
Pages = {645-660},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {While the discussion on the individual level variables that affect
   responses to political scandals has focused mainly on variables such as
   partisan identity or political cynicism, we suggest that media
   skepticism could also moderate whether and how individuals respond to
   political scandals. To test this relationship, we rely on panel data
   from the United States gathered before and after the Trump-Ukraine
   scandal occurred (Wave 1 in June 2019, Wave 2 in October 2019). Our
   results show that individuals who rank higher on media skepticism hold
   comparatively more positive views of Trump after the scandal, even when
   previous evaluations and alternative explanations are controlled for.
   Conversely, we find no effect of media skepticism in trust toward the US
   political system and government. We believe our findings have
   significant consequences to understanding the relationship between the
   governed and those governing in times of widespread media skepticism.},

Title = {A `north star' in governing global labour migration? The ILO and the
   Fair Recruitment Initiative},
Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {303-322},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In 2014, the International Labour Organization (ILO) launched the Fair
   Recruitment Initiative (FRI) with the aim of tackling labour
   exploitation widely associated with the recruitment of low-wage migrant
   workers. To date, scholars have largely neglected the ILO's role in
   developing `fair recruitment' as a mechanism of global social policy. In
   response, this article analyses the ILO's harnessing of fair recruitment
   to the global governance of migration. Through engaging in significant
   knowledge production activities, the ILO has promoted `fair recruitment'
   as a new norm, generating consensus from these partners, despite its
   absence from international legal standards. In utilising multiple and
   varied tools, the article argues that the FRI is an example of the
   `coordinated governance' which the ILO has had to pragmatically resort
   to in externally and internally challenging environments, and regardless
   of whether states have ratified its main convention on recruitment,
   C181. However, as of 2022, the concept of fair recruitment remains a
   muted challenge to the hegemonic precarity and inequalities associated
   with international labour migration in the 21st century.},

Abstract = {Trump and Bolsonaro are perceived as erratic presidents, but they may
   actually be quite rational. We explore two channels of manipulation in a
   polarized society. One relates to swing voters and their perception of a
   president's competence. The other one captures the effort by a president
   to appeal and mobilize her base voters. We model erraticism in dealing
   with the COVID-19 pandemic, but our model could also be applied to other
   realms of political manipulation. We find that erratic freedom
   propaganda directed against state-administered lockdowns may help a
   president in her re-election bid. Paradoxically, if the challenger gains
   popular support or increases voter mobilization against the president,
   it is optimal for the president to further increase erratic propaganda
   in order to increase the mobilization of her own supporters. Our
   predicted surge in voter mobilization is actually a main outcome of the
   2020 US elections.},

Title = {Uncooperative society, uncooperative politics or both? Trust,
   polarization, populism and COVID-19 deaths across European regions},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {62},

Abstract = {Why have some territories performed better than others in the fight
   against COVID-19? This paper uses a novel dataset on excess mortality,
   trust and political polarization for 165 European regions to explore the
   role of social and political divisions in the remarkable regional
   differences in excess mortality during the first wave of the COVID-19
   pandemic. First, we investigate whether regions characterized by a low
   social and political trust witnessed a higher excess mortality. Second,
   we argue that it is not only levels, but also polarization in trust
   among citizens - in particular, between government supporters and
   non-supporters - that matters for understanding why people in some
   regions have adopted more pro-healthy behaviour. Third, we explore the
   partisan make-up of regional parliaments and the relationship between
   political division - or what we refer to as `uncooperative politics'. We
   hypothesize that the ideological positioning - in particular those that
   lean more populist - and ideological polarization among political
   parties is also linked to higher mortality. Accounting for a host of
   potential confounders, we find robust support that regions with lower
   levels of both social and political trust are associated with higher
   excess mortality, along with citizen polarization in institutional trust
   in some models. On the ideological make-up of regional parliaments, we
   find that, ceteris paribus, those that lean more `tan' on the `GAL-TAN'
   spectrum yielded higher excess mortality. Moreover, although we find
   limited evidence of elite polarization driving excess deaths on the
   left-right or GAL-TAN spectrums, partisan differences on the attitudes
   towards the European Union demonstrated significantly higher deaths,
   which we argue proxies for (anti)populism. Overall, we find that both
   lower citizen-level trust and populist elite-level ideological
   characteristics of regional parliaments are associated with higher
   excess mortality in European regions during the first wave of the
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {Contemporary analyses of Athenian democracy have focused on binaries
   such as mass/elite, free/slave, and male/female, overlooking the
   urban/rural divide. In this article, I argue that urban/rural was a
   central cleavage in the Athenian demos. Ancient thinkers including
   Thucydides, Aristophanes, Plato, Xenophon, and Aristotle paid close
   attention to urban/rural differences and their consequences during the
   fifth century. Plato and Aristotle in particular developed sophisticated
   institutions and strategies to mitigate urban/rural divisions. Attending
   to the Athenian urban/rural divide deepens our understanding of the
   demos and highlights the importance of attachments to place, home, and
   customary ways of life for democratic stability.},

Month = {2022 APR 17},
Abstract = {Focusing on the contemporary US context, this article examines the
   ethical quandaries raised by partisan gerrymandering, where constituency
   boundaries are manipulated for electoral benefit. More specifically, it
   will examine the ethics of retaliatory gerrymandering. Though
   gerrymandering cannot be defended as a political practice by any agent
   who assigns intrinsic value to democracy, it might be justified as a
   `dirty hands' (DH) practice, where it is all-things-considered justified
   as a lesser evil that still leaves a moral residue. However, it does not
   work as a standard DH problem, as the stakes of gerrymandering are
   usually less extreme and the causes more structural, making the usual
   language of DH a poor fit. The core moral intuition behind DH, of doing
   wrong to do right, is still appropriate, but is best understood within
   the context of retaliation. When others set the terms of the competition
   to make a practice such as gerrymandering essential for political
   victory, a proportionate use of these practices might be necessary to
   compete.},

Abstract = {The emergence of criminal groups?{''}armed bandits{''} in the local
   parlance?in the northwest geopolitical zone has compounded the security
   conundrums in Nigeria. The dominant explanation for the ongoing banditry
   draws on the ``ungoverned spaces{''} theoretical framework to contend
   that the phenomenon is a by-product of the state's abject failure to
   monopolize violence over its territory. The failure on the part of the
   state to impose order on its territory leaves much room for loosely
   organized vicious armed groups to wreak havoc on local communities in
   the northwest region. The proponents of this perspective inevitably
   recommend a military solution to the security problem. In this article,
   I take a different position that counteracts the ``ungoverned spaces{''}
   thesis. I argue that the ``ungoverned spaces{''} thesis blatantly
   ignores the socioeconomic context within which banditry is embedded and
   how such context nurtures crime and deviance. Drawing on the relative
   deprivation theory, I contend that banditry owes not so much to
   ``ungoverned spaces{''} but to the ethnic cum material grievances of
   some pastoralists who have taken to criminality for survival and who
   pinpoint discrepancies between what they had, what they have, and what
   they think they should have. I argue that resolving banditry would
   require attending to pastoralists' grievances through apposite
   socioeconomic interventions.},

   a subset of issues. But what role does race play in shaping these

   is at play where racial attitudes permeate one's perceptions of which

   racialized issues while non-Whites often credit Democrats. This study
   finds that racial attitudes among racially-conditioned partisans
   influence perceptions of party's owned issues and shape attitudes toward

Abstract = {This paper analyses the unexpected return of social concertation in the
   Netherlands under the Rutte II government (2012-2017). Despite political
   fragmentation, electoral volatility and intensified EU budgetary
   surveillance, between 2012 and 2017 the Netherlands witnessed several
   social pacts that proved vital to the enactment of long-awaited reforms,
   allowed the government to turn post-crisis fiscal deficits into
   surpluses, and helped regenerate economic growth. After describing the
   contextual differences with the Dutch `miracle' years of the 1980s and
   1990s, we reveal a novel institutional logic of responsive corporatism
   whereby, first, a social pact with civil society actors is agreed which,
   then, becomes a launching pad for the de facto minority government to
   enlist parties from the `constructive opposition' in these agreements to
   deliver anticipated reforms. Unlike the 1980s and 1990s, however,
   pro-active engagement with the social partners did not pay out
   electorally, in particular for the social democrats.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyze the use of social media by the members of
   the European Parliament. More specially, we examined whether members of
   the European Parliament use Facebook and Twitter for different purposes.
   To reach our goal, we contacted all 705 members of the European
   Parliament by email. The vast majority of members of the European
   Parliament who decided to participate in our survey replied that they
   use Facebook and Twitter for different purposes. One of the main
   differences most often mentioned was that Twitter is used for an
   international audience, and Facebook, for a national audience.
   Therefore, we decided to examine Facebook and Twitter posts on the
   accounts of all members of the European Parliament to see what languages
   predominate in their communication. We analyzed 253,660 Facebook posts
   and 485,862 tweets. We found that members of the European Parliament use
   their national languages almost exclusively on Facebook. On Twitter, the
   use of English significantly varies from country to country, and in some
   countries, members of the European Parliament only rarely use their
   national languages, as they aim for an international audience.},

Abstract = {In the essay ``Police Power: The Biopolitical State Apparatus and
   Differential Interpellations,{''} Banu Bargu developed the notion of the
   Biopolitical State Apparatus (BSA). This essay deploys Bargu's notion of
   the BSA within what it claims is a militarized police power in the
   Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Illustrating how the
   functioning of militarized police power underpins the implementation of
   public-health policy and the enforcement of laws that complement such
   power, the essay will further demonstrate through the BSA concept what
   police power says about the state under the Duterte regime, how this
   regime relates to the state of exception and posttruth politics, and how
   its policing operates in contrast to other states.},

Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {What is the rational kernel of Hegel's dialectic that Marx famously
   speaks of? How can it be extracted from the mystical shell in which it
   is embedded in Hegel's philosophy? Hegel sets out the general principles
   of his dialectic in the opening sections of his Logic. Starting from
   pure abstract ``Being,{''} he claims to derive the concepts of
   ``Becoming{''} and ``Determinate Being{''} by a purely logical process.
   These arguments are fallacious. However, there is a rational kernel in
   them. Following Marx, I show how this can be extracted by inverting
   Hegel's argument. To understand things concretely, we must see them as
   in relation to other things within a larger totality and as changing. I
   show how these fundamental tenets of dialectic are implied in Hegel's
   claims, and I defend them against opposing empiricist ideas.},

Abstract = {A robust economy is assumed to bolster leaders' standing. This ignores
   how benefits of growth are distributed. Extending the partisan models of
   economic voting, we theorize executives are more likely rewarded when
   gains from growth go to their constituents. Analyses of presidential
   approval in 18 Latin American countries support our pro-constituency
   model of accountability. When economic inequality is high, growth
   concentrates among the rich, and approval of right-of-center presidents
   is higher. Leftist presidents benefit from growth when gains are more
   equally distributed. Further analyses show growth and inequality inform
   perceptions of personal finances differently based on wealth, providing
   a micro-mechanism behind the aggregate findings. Study results imply
   that the economy is not purely a valence issue, but also a position
   issue.},

Abstract = {Leaders need resources to maintain power. To secure these resources,
   states can develop their own extractive capacity or seek external
   support to help subsidize their costs. In this study, we argue that
   extractive capacity and external support are not always alternatives. We
   focus on how US support can foster local property rights, which
   subsequently builds extractive capacity. We then argue that states with
   more capacity are better able to either alleviate rebels' grievances or
   deter rebels from mounting a military challenge. We use mediation
   analysis to test these expectations with a data set on capacity, US
   support, and civil conflict from 1970 to 2012. We find empirical support
   for the role of property rights and capacity as mediating factors
   between US support and civil conflict. Our results have implications for
   international explanations of civil conflict and the role of US
   patronage in capacity development.},

Abstract = {It is well established that a country's institutional features can
   weaken economic voting because voters find it hard to attribute
   performance to specific parties. We argue that local-level party system
   institutionalization similarly moderates the link between the economy
   and vote choice. We focus on one manifestation of party system
   institutionalization: the strength of party-candidate linkages in
   elections, operationalized by manually tracing the rerunning patterns of
   some 80,000 candidates in Indian state elections between 1986 and 2007.
   Using rerunning patterns to measure party-candidate linkages and
   rainfall data to measure the state of the economy, we show that voters
   were more likely to reward incumbent parties for economic performance
   when parties and candidates were aligned in consecutive elections. We
   address concerns of endogeneity in rerunning patterns, by showing that
   the results are robust to alternate measures of local-level party system
   institutionalization. They are also robust to alternative measures of
   the state of the economy and to using individual-level survey data.},

Abstract = {While current research shows that the government dominates the policy
   agenda in parliamentary democracies, little is known about the role of
   the opposition in challenging this dominance. Taking a closer look at
   the parliamentary policy-making process, we examine whether opposition
   support for partisan control of committee chairmanship makes challenges
   to government bills through amendment proposals more or less likely. By
   analysing about 7400 government bills from three parliamentary
   democracies over 35 years, our results show that, under opposition
   chairmanship, a high likelihood of opposition support fosters amendment
   proposals, but, under coalition partner chairmanship, the likelihood of
   government bills being challenged only increases when the likelihood of
   opposition support is low. This suggests that a unified opposition not
   only makes challenges to the government's agenda more likely but also
   conditions how coalition partners manage collective governance.},

Abstract = {In this paper I consider the ``Jeffersonian problem{''}: whether one
   generation has the right to bind future generations to an inherited
   constitutional order. Thomas Jefferson's challenge rests on fundamental
   democratic principles of equality and consent, and therefore-while there
   may be substantial pragmatic reasons to be wary of his argument-any
   response must also remain true to those moral ideals. I argue that
   through the crisis of slavery and the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln was
   compelled to revisit the basis of the American political regime, and in
   doing so articulated a conception of democratic politics that answers
   Jefferson's challenge. He does so in two ways: first, Lincoln's
   political religion revives reverence for the ancestral in a democratic
   context; second, Lincoln's concept of rededication allows each
   generation to affirm that revered past while simultaneously manifesting
   its own sovereign power through novel applications of past principle. I
   conclude by arguing that the inclusion of generational obligations is

Abstract = {This study examined if and for whom prosecution of politicians for hate
   speech undermines support for the legal system and democracy. Three
   research designs were combined to investigate the case of Dutch
   politician Geert Wilders, who was convicted for hate speech against
   minorities in 2016. First, an experiment showed that observing a guilty
   verdict decreased support among `assimilationists' who oppose the
   multicultural society. This deterioration of support was found among the
   entire group of assimilationists, regardless of whether they voted for
   Wilders. Secondly, a quasi-experiment demonstrated that assimilationists
   who were interviewed after Wilders' conviction indicated less support
   than those who were interviewed before the verdict and compared to a
   pre-test. Thirdly, a nine-year panel study suggested that these effects
   accumulate into long-term discontent. This case therefore demonstrates
   that hate speech prosecution can damage the democratic system it is
   intended to defend.},

Abstract = {Australia China relations are at a turning point 50 years after
   diplomatic recognition. While the past five decades have witnessed
   extensive growth in economic exchanges, in recent years, bilateral ties
   have experienced serious deterioration. Australia's alliance with the
   United States, domestic politics-in particular the two major parties'
   approaches to foreign policy-and economic interdependence are important
   variables in Canberra's approach to China. There will be no exception
   for the incoming Australian Labor Party government to deal with these.},

Abstract = {This research note has two objectives. First, we present the Relative
   Confidence Index (RCI), a new measure of potential for growth and of
   solidity of the vote based on voters' expressed likelihood to vote for
   the parties in their constituency. We look in detail at the benefits of
   the RCI and show that it can be used to assess the potential for growth
   and the solidity of the vote for political parties at the constituency
   and provincial levels. Second, we apply this index to the case of the
   Parti Quebecois, using large samples collected during the 2012, 2014,
   and 2018 Quebec election campaigns. This allows us to illustrate and
   draw conclusions about the potential for growth of the Parti Quebecois.},

Abstract = {Emerging work suggests that Blacks, Asians, and Latinos sometimes share
   a strong sense of solidarity as people of color (PoC), which unifies
   their political opinions on issues that strongly implicate some of these
   racial groups (e.g., Black Lives Matter). Yet much uncertainty remains
   about whether other non-White groups, beyond these traditional three,
   are compelled to engage in politics as PoC via this same mechanism. We
   investigate this with two studies focused on Middle Eastern and North
   African (MENA) individuals: a minoritized group with deep U.S. roots,
   but sparse theoretical and empirical attention in political science.
   Study 1 draws on in-depth interviews with MENA adults (N=20), who
   suggest that, insofar as they sense solidarity with other people of
   color, it is because they feel racially marginalized as foreigners.
   Study 2 builds on this insight with a pre-registered experiment on MENA
   adults (N=514), which randomly assigned them to read an article about
   Latinos, who are also marginalized as foreign (vs. control article). We
   find that exposure to treatment reliably heightens MENAs' expression of
   solidarity with other PoC, which then significantly boosts support for
   flexible policies toward undocumented immigrants (which implicate
   Latinos, but not MENAs) and reduces belief in negative stereotypes of
   Latinos.},

Abstract = {This study examines the dynamic nature of voting in modern elections
   with wide voting windows. Our stylized two-period model predicts that,
   if voters are not myopic, turnout in the current period tends to
   increase as the costs in the other period increase. The model also
   predicts that overall turnout does not always decrease even when the
   costs increase. We test these predictions using novel data from Japan's
   General Election in 2017 with a weather disruption caused by a powerful
   typhoon. Our analyses show that the tremendous costs on Election Day
   shifted the timing of voting and did not decrease overall turnout in
   2017, as compared to 2014. Our model and findings build a new benchmark
   to understand how voters decide their timing of voting. This study also
   has implications for the unprecedented popularity of early voting in the
   2020 U.S. presidential election.},

Abstract = {This article aims to understand paradiplomacy practices in Indonesia by
   identifying the characteristics of Aceh's paradiplomacy and reviewing it
   comparatively with the paradiplomacy of Quebec, Canada. The data was
   collected by documentation study, interview, and literature search. The
   practice of paradiplomacy in Indonesia is framed in a unitary state
   system in which the central government still dominates regional foreign
   activities and the regional awareness for the need of foreign relations
   is still minimal. This is different from the Province of Quebec in
   Canada wherein Quebec is one of the most active provinces to take part
   abroad for the fulfillment of their regional interests. We conclude that
   the characteristics of paradiplomacy are determined by the
   institutionalization of paradiplomacy in the regions and the pattern of
   relations between the central and regional government which usually
   refers to the form of the state whether unitary or federalist.},

Abstract = {The article explores why women are better represented in municipal
   councils in Norway than in Denmark. This comparative case study offers a
   most similar systems design, as these two countries are similar on most
   relevant institutional variables, such as local government systems,
   electoral systems, party systems and societal gender equality, but they
   deviate on the dependent variable of women's representation. Two unique
   comparative data sets are analysed: representative voter surveys and
   register data on all candidates (from the 2019 Norwegian and 2017 Danish
   municipal elections). The study focuses on demand-side explanations and
   concludes that institutional explanations do not appear relevant.
   Instead, the parties' candidate selection matters: Norwegian parties are
   more concerned with gender balance than their Danish counterparts.
   Finally, the article discusses why this is the case and asks whether
   gender equality plays a more prominent role on the societal agenda in
   Norway than in Denmark.},

Abstract = {The contemporary literature on political parties has identified their
   gradual but consistent shift away from civil society and towards the
   state. As parties are becoming ever increasingly dependent on state
   resources and exclusively interested in governing, as Mair (Ruling the
   void: The hollowing of western democracy {[}Verso Books, 2013])
   suggested, and patronage is a fundamental to that relationship, the
   degree and modes of party patronage becomes pivotal to understanding
   their performance, and the ways they organize and govern. In this paper
   we argue that party patronage is likely to be structured by the nature
   of political competition and explore the effects of political
   polarization, which is a feature of political competition relatively
   independent from the precise format of a party system, on patronage
   practices. We advance a theoretical argument which systematically links
   different types of political polarization with different patterns of
   party patronage, arguing that extreme polarization incentivizes
   political parties to develop heavily partisan strategies of party
   patronage which, in turn, further fuel political polarization. Thus, we
   also contribute to burgeoning literature on political polarization and
   its negative effects on the functioning of both political parties and
   overall political systems.},

   as attitudes on immigration, differ between different age groups in
   adolescence. Using a household survey in the city of Ghent (Belgium),
   first we compare political ideologies and attitudes toward immigration
   for those of age between 15 and 19, and their parents. We find that
   adolescent children tend to resemble the political ideologies of their
   parents, and they also tend to have similar attitudes about immigration.
   Second, we find that ideological resemblance is even higher among
   adolescents that regularly talk about politics with their parents.
   Finally, we do not find evidence that political congruence with parents
   differs by the age of adolescent children or their right to vote.
   Therefore, we conclude that political ideology and positional views are
   formed in an early stage of adolescence, i.e., before the age of 15. Our
   findings have relevance for the debate about lowering the voting age, as
   it points to already clearly formed ideological views and political
   attitudes at early stages of adolescent life.},

Abstract = {Polls asking respondents about their beliefs in conspiracy theories have
   become increasingly commonplace. However, researchers have expressed
   concern about the willingness of respondents to divulge beliefs in
   conspiracy theories due to the stigmatization of those ideas. We use an
   experimental design similar to a list experiment to decipher the effect
   of social desirability bias on survey responses to eight conspiratorial
   statements. Our study includes 8290 respondents across seven countries,
   allowing for the examination of social desirability bias across various
   political and cultural contexts. While the proportion of individuals
   expressing belief in each statement varies across countries, we observe
   identical treatment effects: respondents systematically underreport
   conspiracy beliefs. These findings suggest that conspiracy beliefs may
   be more prominent than current estimates suggest.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, prominent national leaders like Turkey's Recep Tayyip
   Erdogan and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez gained power through democratic
   institutions, only to undermine those institutions once in office as
   part of a broader effort to consolidate authoritarian power. Yet
   attempts at ``executive aggrandizement{''} have failed in other
   countries, with varying consequences for democratic institutions. We
   develop an agency-based perspective to enhance the understanding of
   aggrandizement and to explain when it results in democratic breakdown.
   Relying on comparative case studies of five countries-Bolivia, Ecuador,
   Thailand, Turkey, and Venezuela-our analysis suggests that the
   contingent decisions of opposition actors during the process of
   aggrandizement have a significant effect on regime outcomes. Irregular
   opposition attempts to remove incumbents from office, which are
   especially likely after electoral defeats, contribute to democratic
   breakdown. More moderate responses to aggrandizement, on the other hand,
   help the opposition actors to buy time until the next election, hence
   offering the possibility for democratic survival.},

Title = {`The Politicisation Game': Strategic Interactions in the Contention Over
   TTIP in Germany},

Abstract = {As the third-largest exporting country in the world, Germany is a clear
   beneficiary and proponent of free trade. Few, therefore, expected the
   magnitude of contention that emerged within Germany during the
   negotiations between the EU and the United States for a transatlantic
   trade deal (TTIP). This paper explores the politicisation process of
   TTIP within the context of the broader transformations of German
   politics including not only the entry of new issues and new players in
   the electoral and protest arenas but also the increased hybridisation of
   forms of protest. Theoretically, we draw on the `Players and Arenas'
   framework to put forward a sequential, strategic interactionist approach
   to the unfolding process of politicisation, in which various types of
   players face dilemmas when interacting with each other over time.
   Applying this analytical framework to the politicisation of TTIP in
   Germany, we reveal previously overlooked players, interactions and
   dilemmas, while opening up multiple opportunities for empirical analysis
   of cases beyond this area. We show how the politicisation of TTIP
   brought about an important intensification of relations between
   Germany's protest and electoral arenas, and confronted all players
   involved with choices with long-lasting consequences for both
   mobilisation and coalition building dynamics.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has upended every aspect of American life. State
   governments responded quickly to protect public health and stabilize
   overwhelmed hospital systems. The most restrictive policy, the
   stay-at-home order, was seen by public health officials as a cornerstone
   of successful state mitigation strategies. But like many aspects of
   contemporary politics, support for these efforts took on a distinctly
   partisan hue. In this paper, I argue that party politics significantly
   affected state policy responses to COVID-19, which in turn limited
   mitigation efforts. To this point, I first demonstrate that Democratic
   governors were faster and more likely to adopt stay-at-home orders than
   Republicans. Next, using a synthetic control approach, I show that these
   orders caused residents to practice greater social distancing. Finally,
   I find that greater social distancing worked to ``flattened the
   curve{''} by limiting the growth of COVID-19 cases. Together these
   findings show how party politics affected state pandemic responses and
   have important long-term implications as states begin lifting
   restrictions.},

Title = {Imperative Patriotism and Minority Candidacies: Examining the Role of
   Military Status in Racial Evaluations of South Asian Candidates},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {76},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-59},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {South Asians have seen an increase in representation at all levels of US
   government, from Congress to the Vice Presidency, yet a paucity of work
   has been done examining South Asian candidates in America. The distinct
   nature of South Asian candidacies allows us to examine the intersection
   between race and religious identity and how emphasizing different social
   and political identities impact minority candidate evaluations. We
   theorize the potential effects of racial-political stereotyping of South
   Asians, focusing specifically on how a Hindu or Muslim background may
   negatively influence candidate evaluation. Additionally, we consider
   whether military service has any effect on evaluations of South Asian
   candidates as dangerous or deficient. We test this theory with a survey
   experiment that varies both South Asian religious identity, political
   ideology, and military service. Our findings indicate that white
   respondents are more hostile to South Asian candidates when compared to
   white candidates with similar biographies, and that respondents are
   particularly hostile to Muslim candidates. Cueing military service
   alleviates this handicap for Muslim candidates, but further analysis
   reveals that military service only improves perceptions among Democratic
   respondents.},

   travel},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 18},
Abstract = {The philosophical debate on the freedom of movement focuses almost
   exclusively on long-term migration, what I call, migration as
   settlement. The normative justifications defending border controls
   assume that the movement of people across political borders, independent
   of its purpose and the length of stay, refers to migration as
   settlement. ``Global mobility,{''} ``international movement,{''} and
   ``immigration{''} are oftenused interchangeably. However, global
   mobility also refers to the movements of people across international
   borders for a short length of time such as travel, short-term and
   circular migration. While most scholarly attention has focused on
   long-term migration, the vast majority of cross-border movement of
   people (approximately 85\% of all cross-border movements in 2019) is
   short-term. The existing literature offers normative arguments for
   border controls, which are grounded on states' right to
   self-determination, the freedom of (dis)association, the welfare state,
   the duty to compatriots, and brain drain. In this paper, I argue that
   these arguments do not justify excluding travelers, short-term and
   circular migrants from the territory.},

Abstract = {After defeat in the Civil War, the white South used time as a tool of
   political oppression. Myths of the ``Old South{''} and the ``Lost
   Cause{''} distorted history and public memory; vagrancy laws and labor
   regulations controlled the time of the newly free; grandfather clauses
   distributed rights based on past conditions; and attacks on education,
   labor, and democratic rights undermined progress in the ``New South.{''}
   In this article, I show that Black southerners also recognized the
   political value of time. My source for their sentiments is the Colored
   Conventions Movement. From 1865 to 1900, dozens of conventions gathered
   in the South, at a significantly higher rate than in other regions.
   Delegates deployed temporal rhetoric of the past, present, and future in
   pursuit of equality and justice by (1) publicly recounting African
   American history and national contributions to counter white narratives,
   (2) arguing that emancipation was a new founding moment and the present
   a time of ongoing crisis, and (3) demanding labor and education rights
   to secure the future. Scholars of American political development often
   consider time in studies of institutional change; we should also explore
   the use of time as a political tool and how temporality illuminates
   American racial dynamics.},

   evolving relationship between politics researchers and the organisations
   they study. In this reply, we argue that the party politics sub-field
   reflects the wider discipline in another crucial respect-it continues to
   marginalise gender politics scholarship. We demonstrate that a gendered
   lens fundamentally transforms key questions in the field around what
   party politics scholars study, and how and why they conduct their
   research, with relevant consequences for whose work is included. In
   failing to engage with this scholarship, ``mainstream{''} party politics
   scholars are (re)producing unequal power relations and hierarchies
   within the discipline, while also depriving themselves of the capacity
   to address fully key questions of representation, democracy, continuity
   and change.},

Abstract = {Did parliamentary constraints foster economic activity or was activity
   the cause of constraints? This article addresses the first part of this
   question by examining the long-term effects of belonging to the Duchy of
   Wurttemberg wherein the parliament placed considerable checks on the
   various dukes from 1495 to 1796. I use a geographic natural experiment
   and compare areas just inside of the Duchy with adjacent areas outside
   of it. Economically similar prior to 1495, areas within the Duchy had a
   higher degree of urbanization and commercialization in the subsequent
   period. I provide further evidence that this difference reflects three
   mechanisms: local representation in parliament, improved local
   public-goods provision, and attraction of upper-tail human capital.},

Abstract = {Western Political science cannot adequately address China's development
   in the twenty-first century. The inadequacy is due to a general neglect
   of historical methods and an obsession with progressive views in the
   discipline. As a result, the study of China's political culture is torn
   away from Chinese history and loses itself to become another version of
   modernization thesis. This article calls for the application of a
   historical politics approach and a poly-chronic view of history to the
   study of China's political culture. The article examines four potential
   core value components of China's political culture, namely the quest for
   great unification, the preference for political order, the orientation
   towards substance, and the deference to authority and hierarchy. Results
   show that those values have historical continuity and China-specificity
   thereby demonstrating the value of the historical politics perspective.},

Title = {Oil ``Rents{''} and Political Development: What Do We Really Know About

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Number = {10},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Research on the political implications of oil wealth is now over two
   decades old, and yet still unresolved. Despite many advances in this
   literature, a core concept-resource rents-remains under-theorized, and
   even less well measured. This mis-measurement, we contend, has direct
   and significant consequences for theoretical findings on the resource
   curse. Although rents refer to excessive profits, analyses to date have
   not directly or indirectly focused on the profitability of oil
   extraction; instead they rely more often on estimates of gross receipts
   or exports of natural resources. The largely untested assumption that
   oil sales consistently produce enormous profits has been the bridge used
   to treat these as measures of rents, even as the empirical foundations
   for this claim are shaky. In contrast, we measure the difficulty of oil
   production using data from over 3800 major oil fields around the globe
   between 1980 and 2012 to more accurately estimate the income generated
   by oil production and to calibrate its rent-generating potential using
   important correlates of its cost of production. The results show that
   where oil's cost of production is low, and its profitability high,
   pernicious regime outcomes are observed in keeping with resource curse
   claims. However, as production shifts to more challenging sources, oil
   production loses this association and may well at the extremes be
   associated with modestly more democratic outcomes. In other words, it is
   only ``easy oil{''} that may be a curse for democratic development.},

Abstract = {Most forced migrants around the world are displaced within the Global
   South. We study whether and how de jure policies on forced displacement
   affect where forced migrants flee in the developing world. Recent
   evidence from the Global North suggests migrants gravitate toward
   liberal policy environments. However, existing analyses expect de jure
   policies to have little effect in the developing world, given strong
   presumptions that policy enforcement is poor and policy knowledge is
   low. Using original data on de jure displacement policies for 92
   developing countries and interviews with 126 refugees and policy makers,
   we document a robust association between liberal de jure policies and
   forced migrant flows. Gravitation toward liberal environments is
   conditional on factors that facilitate the diffusion of policy
   knowledge, such as transnational ethnic kin. Policies for free movement,
   services, and livelihoods are especially attractive. Utility-maximizing
   models of migrant decision making must take de jure policy provisions
   into account.},

Abstract = {This article serves as a rebuttal to McLeod et al's criticism of O
   Giollagain and Caimbeul's `Moving Beyond Asocial Minority Language
   Policy' article in this journal, while also offering an analysis of
   McLeod et al's disapproving viewpoint of the conclusions and
   recommendations in O Giollagain et al's The Gaelic Crisis in the
   Vernacular Community (2020). This rebuttal argues for the inclusion of
   the threatened first-language Gaelic vernacular community in Gaelic
   policy, as well as the integration of the protection of Gaelic
   communities in official Gaelic promotion - minority language promotion
   with language community protection. McLeod et al's contribution to the
   debate on the Gaelic vernacular crisis is essentially a collective
   effort to reinforce the relegation of the Gaelic crisis within official
   language promotion in Scotland and to promote a reinvigorated status
   quo.},

Abstract = {This is a short commentary upon five articles. The main themes of these
   articles are the roles of paramilitaries in civil wars, focusing
   specifically on Colombia and the former Yugoslavia. While recommending
   the quality of the articles, this paper explores two lines of criticism.
   The first concerns the insufficient attention paid to ideological
   paramilitaries, who are significant for a number of reasons, including
   their remarkable resilience in combat. Second, while the papers discuss
   how paramilitaries fund themselves, the focus is solely upon the
   commanders. In understanding the paramilitary mobilization it is also
   important to understand how the rank-in-file support themselves.},

Abstract = {The design of election ballots can influence voters' behavior. Features
   of the ballot are particularly important if they systematically harm the
   electoral chances of some groups. In Brazil, voters type the four or
   five-digit number of their chosen candidate into an electronic voting
   machine to cast a ballot. Some numbers have sequences that are easier to
   memorize and recall than others. I show that candidates with memorable
   numbers receive a boost in their vote share. Moreover, I demonstrate
   that women are less likely to be assigned memorable numbers. This paper
   highlights the importance of thinking thoroughly about the implications
   of seemingly innocuous characteristics of voting procedures.},

Abstract = {The 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart called for a constitutionally
   enshrined Voice to parliament, and a Makarrata Commission to supervise a
   process of treaty-making and truth-telling. The recommendations were
   rejected by the Turnbull government and appear unlikely to be
   implemented under a Morrison government. Initially, the main objection
   to the Voice from government MPs was that it would upset the balance of
   Australia's bicameral system by creating a third chamber. Other concerns
   include the potential of an Indigenous Voice to divide Australians and
   create special privileges for a particular group. Drawing on Chaim Gans'
   theory of egalitarian Zionism, this article introduces the idea of
   egalitarian nationhoods. It argues that the Voice does not provide
   privilege but equality in allowing First Nations to enjoy
   self-determination and collective rights, something most non-Indigenous
   Australians take for granted.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},

Number = {4},
Pages = {545-549},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The president's agenda-setting ability has a rich research history, with
   studies most often derived from the State of the Union Address. While a
   president communicates many of his policy priorities via the public
   address, the presidential agenda is more complex and variable than can
   be understood in one speech. Presidents have a number of tools to
   articulate their priorities, and how we understand presidential
   agenda-setting is linked to the tool and its intended audience. This
   research note illustrates the important variation in presidential
   agendas across venues by comparing the publicized agenda from the State
   of the Union with the policymaker-focused priorities conveyed in the
   annual Budget Message. Using the coding scheme of the U.S. Policy
   Agendas Project to assess presidential agenda setting over more than 35
   years, we illustrate the audience-driven variability in presidents'
   agendas and highlight how the intended audience reveals presidents'
   strategic choices.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {123-142},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {An emerging consensus among scholars of environmental politics includes
   public participation in the legislative process as a critical condition
   of the transition to sustainability. The select committee process in
   Aotearoa New Zealand has long been celebrated for its apparent openness
   to public participation. We examine the select committee process as it
   functioned in the case of the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon)
   Amendment Bill 2019, employing a quantitative analysis that mapped
   categories of submitters' policy propositions through the constant
   comparative method, and compare them against the recommendations of the
   majority and minority perspectives of the Environment Select Committee.
   In addition, we compare the majority and minority recommendations to the
   Departmental Report. The results of this case study incline us to
   question the assumption that submitters have influence with select
   committees and the extent of committee deliberation. If the transition
   to sustainability depends on the government's capacity for
   transformative change, and that capacity in turn depends on the strength
   of its deliberative system, then our study provides some reason to worry
   about the capacity of government in Aotearoa New Zealand to respond to
   the challenge of climate change.},

Abstract = {This essay reflects on the COVID-19 pandemic, the January 6 attack on
   the U.S. Capitol, and the months since Donald Trump's electoral defeat,
   connecting these to the author's book, The Punishment Monopoly: Tales of
   My Ancestors, Dispossession, and the Building of the United States. It
   argues that an understanding of the present conjuncture depends on
   centering the long history of dispossession and the punishment that
   enables it, and on the theft of land and labor on which U.S. sovereignty
   continues to depend. That foundation is, in the present conjuncture,
   being challenged by invigorated movements for racial and social justice
   and defended by equally invigorated fascistic defense of white supremacy
   and racialized capitalism. The author sees this clash and current ills
   not as a unique moment, but as a continuation of the arc of U.S.
   history, an arc that becomes visible if the history we tell emphasizes
   the foundation of racialized capitalism and its ongoing state-enforced
   theft, dispossession, and punishment.},

Title = {(Un)Natural Disasters: Electoral Cycles in Disaster Relief},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Emergency spending is often exempt from campaign period restrictions and
   procurement guidelines, making it attractive for opportunistic
   politicians, but natural disasters are seen as outside political
   business cycles. However, droughts are frequent but challenging to
   measure, so politicians can leverage discretion for electoral gain. This
   paper analyzes electoral cycles, term limits, and partisan targeting
   around municipal drought declaration in Northeast Brazil. Two sources of
   exogeneity (rainfall shocks, electoral calendar) isolate the effect of
   non-climatic factors on drought declarations. I find that drought
   declarations, which trigger relief, are more likely in mayoral election
   years. Incumbents are more likely to win re-election if they declare a
   drought in the election year, during below or even above average
   rainfall. The results are consistent with interviews suggesting voters
   reward competent mayors and mayors trade relief for votes. This study
   highlights the interaction between distributive and environmental
   politics, which has increasing consequences due to climate change.},

Abstract = {Since the mid-1990s, US federal policy has funneled unauthorized
   migration through remote portions of the Sonoran Desert, resulting in
   thousands of deaths and disappearances. Research about the work to find,
   care for, and identify those who have died at international borders
   largely focuses on forensic authorities or humanitarian volunteers.
   Often left out of such analyses are the families of the missing and
   dead, who I argue are some of the most critical actors in this work.
   Drawing on fieldwork done between 2006 and 2021, in this article I
   discuss how families of missing migrants impact forensic procedures on
   the US-Mexico border. They do this by learning forensic skills and
   developing relationships with state forensic authorities. I argue that
   families of missing migrants are engaged in forms of active citizenship
   that build relationships of care and obligation among themselves, state
   forensic authorities, and the missing and dead.},

Abstract = {This paper critically assesses the (de)legitimation strategies used by
   rising powers against existing formal and informal International
   Organizations (IOs), especially the G7/8, the World Bank and the
   International Monetary Fund (IMF). In doing so, it first analyzes how
   legitimacy relates to multilateralism and vice versa. Then, it examines
   why legitimacy matters to rising powers the two main (de)legitimation
   strategies-regime shift and competitive regime creation-used by rising
   powers when they contest the legitimacy of the existing IOs. Finally, it
   uses the cases of the G20 and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
   (AIIB) to highlight the strengths and limits of regime shift and
   competitive regime creation strategies. This paper argues that rising
   powers' quest for enhanced legitimacy by means of joining alternative
   existing institutions (G20) or creating new institutions (AIIB) seems to

Abstract = {In China, the public has gradually shifted their focus from GDP growth
   to quality-of-life issues, which imposes new challenges for the
   government. The food safety problem, as a salient issue, is one such
   example. This article analyzes how food safety problems affect ordinary
   Chinese people's trust in the government and their attribution of
   governmental responsibility using nationally representative survey data.
   As food safety risks are unequally distributed in China, the political
   impact of food safety problems varies among people of different
   socioeconomic statuses. The results show that food safety problems
   weaken the public's trust in both the central and local governments, but
   this negative effect is attenuated among people with a low level of
   education. Moreover, the Chinese public tends to attribute major
   responsibility to the central government rather than local governments
   when perceiving the severity of food safety problems, and this tendency
   becomes stronger for the low-income population. The results deepen the
   understanding of the local-central political trust patterns and the
   political implications of food safety problems in China.},

Abstract = {While Marx threw off his attraction to Romanticism when he was still a
   teenager, scholars have detected various senses in which deep structures
   of Romantic thought persist in his work. These structures have
   frequently been taken as contributing factors to Marx's alleged
   millenarianism, doctrinaire rigidity, and intolerance. The mature Marx
   does draw on Romantic ideas at crucial moments; but rather than
   reinforcing an image of Marx as an intolerant ideologue, the Romantic
   element in his thought, properly construed, suggests theoretical
   openness and humility before an unmasterable reality.},

Abstract = {When dealing with the complex policy issue of how to maintain social
   cohesion within an increasingly diverse society, decision-makers often
   view civil society organizations as important actors that can provide
   opportunities for intergroup contacts and pathways for immigrants to
   integrate. The present study uses data from a large-scale survey
   directed toward individuals nested within 36 different local communities
   and over 1250 different neighbourhoods with varying levels of visible
   minorities. The results contribute by showing that it is important to
   consider not only the frequency of intergroup contacts but also the
   context in which those who are involved in civil society organizations
   live. Those who are involved in civil society organizations at the local
   level are embedded in local contexts that moderate how respondents
   perceive whether others are to be trusted. Very frequent intergroup
   contacts within civil society organizations correlated more strongly
   with higher levels of community and outgroup trust among those with
   native backgrounds who lived in diverse neighbourhoods. Similarly, the
   results indicated that perceptions of intergroup contact mattered.
   Neighbourhood diversity and outgroup trust were statistically
   significant only for those who perceived intergroup contacts to be very
   positive or rather positive.},

Journal = {OSTEUROPA},

Volume = {72},
Number = {9-10},
Pages = {5+},
Abstract = {Every conversation between Germans and Poles is marked by how the
   visible and invisible asymmetries between the two countries are handled.
   The practices of German-Polish reconciliation and dialogue were social
   mechanisms for creating symbolic symmetry. Since Poland's government has
   increasingly refused to continue these forms of dialogue, resentment has
   come to dominate. At the same time, the Polish right is struggling
   against its opponents at home and Germany's power in the EU. Many
   Germans see in Kaczynskis Poland a country that has gone backwards and
   is posing a threat to Europe's future viability. With this form of
   classification, they at the same time sustain their own interpretive
   supremacy in the present. What was once the German-Polish dialogue has
   degenerated into a collective soliloquy of like-minded people. Thus, the
   once beneficial spaces of German-Polish dialogue have become echo
   chambers. This exacerbates the ongoing crisis between Poland and
   Germany.},

Abstract = {Despite less restrictive governmental Covid-19 measures than in other
   European countries, Denmark also witnessed the rise of mobilisations
   against vaccine measures and corona-related restrictions. While most
   protests did not assemble many participants, nor garnered much media
   attention, the anti-restrictions scene consists of a vast and diverse
   array of activists and organisations united in the call for less
   governmental intervention in the freedoms of the citizens, as also
   witnessed elsewhere across the globe. We conceptualise the
   anti-restrictions groups as `populist counterpublics', since the
   counterdiscourses emerging from the Covid-19 measures deepen the
   antagonist divide between the ordinary people and the elites. We focus
   on three of the most prominent groups: Men in Black (MIB), the Freedom
   Movement's Joint Council(FBF), and Earth Freedom Knowledge 21 (JFK21).
   By analysing arenas and frames, we show how the Danish anti restrictions
   movement uses the diagnostic frames of totalitarian government and
   global complotto blame the Danish government and international elites,
   and the prognostic frames of power and rights to the people and
   individual freedom as solutions to the articulated problems. Although
   these groups employed similar frames and enemy constructions, they
   failed in promoting internal alliances and in shaping a new and accepted
   idea of who makes up `the people', leading to a limited level of public
   support for their cause.},

Abstract = {This article unpacks the meaning of permanent neutrality in Austrian
   foreign policy from a collective memory perspective understood as
   remembrance of the past and expression of the country's ontological
   condition (Sinn von Sein). I argue, first, that while neutrality has
   remained formally a backbone of foreign and security policy, in
   practice, it changed its meaning to incorporate a more active role in
   multilateral institutions. Second, I demonstrate how this can be related
   to collective memory and changing imaginaries and role conceptions,
   showing how Austria's Sonderweg emerges from a normative global ambition
   to contribute to a more positive understanding of order.},

Abstract = {The objective of the article was to analyze the tactical and procedural
   characteristics of conducting a record in the investigation of crimes
   against public security. To achieve the objective in the research
   process, a system of general and special methods is used, such as:
   dialectical method; method of systematic analysis of legal norms;
   comparative legal method; statistical method. Based on the study of
   legislation, scientific sources, the results of the generalization of
   investigative and judicial practice, current issues of normative content
   of the principle of immediacy of the study of evidence and the problems
   of its implementation during criminal procedural evidence. It is
   concluded that this principle determines the responsibilities of the
   persons conducting the trial (questioning suspects, accused, witnesses,
   victims, experts, hearing expert opinions, reviewing physical evidence,
   announcing and examining documents, audio and video recordings), to whom
   correspond the rights of other participants to present evidence, to
   become personally familiar with the materials of criminal proceedings,
   receive copies of procedural documents, participate directly in
   investigative and judicial actions. Finally, attention is paid to
   problematic issues related to the definition of the limits of the
   principle.},

Journal = {POLITIX},

Number = {140},
Pages = {9-20},
Abstract = {While wealth and power now seem to be displayed conspicuously and
   unapologetically, the relationship that unites these two terms has long
   been controversial. In our time democracies, it continues to be
   ambivalent. Indeed, economic capital can drive power relations under
   certain conditions only. These power relations can be better seen if we
   take a step aside and, instead of looking, once again, at the way power
   is converted and transfigured, if we delve into the materiality of
   economic capital. By focusing on elites' lifestyle and consumption
   behaviours, both at work and at home, we gain access to the subtlety of
   some elite usages of economic capital, how it is performed or,
   conversely, concealed, to serve, reach or maintain power positions.},

Title = {Why Are Important Portfolios Important? A Framework for Analysis},
Journal = {POLITICA Y GOBIERNO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Not all portfolios are equally important. But despite recognizing that
   the relative value of portfolios is central to government formation, the
   criteria that determine why certain portfolios are more important than
   others is rarely made explicit and justified. The lack of transparency
   about the criteria that determines the value of portfolios is
   particularly important where party institutionalization is low, where
   single-party governments are the norm and where non-partisan groups
   participate in government formation. In this article we develop a
   framework that proposes measuring portfolio salience based on four
   dimensions: the opportunities the portfolio offers its occupant to
   influence relevant public policies, to influence the governments
   political agenda, to distribute discretional resources, and to intervene
   in the functioning of other portfolios.},

Abstract = {The tourism industry represents a great engine of sustainable
   development for the markets of the 21st century, so that it is a
   promising industry where a differentiated set of actors and factors
   interact: the State, the business sector, organized communities and
   tourists. The objective of the research is to rethink a coherent public
   policy for the promotion of rural tourism in general, with special
   emphasis on communication for development and social change. The
   documentary research methodology and the SWOT analysis technique were
   used as a condition of possibility to visualize the strengths,
   opportunities, weaknesses and threats that the implementation of a
   policy such as the one proposed would have in a specific context. The
   authors conclude that, in any imaginable scenario, political
   communication always enters into the equation for the formulation of
   tourism sector policies: (rural tourism + sustainable development =
   social change), as a space of synthesis that articulates in the
   collective imagination, ideas, concepts, feelings and objectives that
   create and recreate the conditions for social change, as a higher stage
   of sustainable development in the 21st century.},

Title = {CANCEL CULTURE IN WORLD POLITICS: HISTORICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2022},
Number = {5},
Pages = {88-98},
Abstract = {In the West, `cancel culture,' which is spreading at the speed of an
   epidemic, has been turned into a mechanism for applying a `new ethics.'
   Despite the fact that the concept of `cancel culture' remains
   opportunistic, it has become necessary to identify the subject of
   research of this phenomenon from the standpoint of political science and
   methods of historical and philosophical deconstruction in order to
   understand: what is the genesis and true meaning of the cancel culture
   and why it has so widely and promptly acquired such an influence on
   world politics? The hypothesis is that cancel culture is connected by a
   sociogenetic code with the evolution (moreover, mutation) of the deep
   meanings of European culture, dating back to the sacralization of
   antique rituals, Aristotelian `tertium non datur' principle, the
   ideology of the Crusades, to the `contractual truth' of Karl Popper's
   positivist `contractual truth' that gave rise to Soros-type `open
   society' cultural universalism. New media, and social networking par
   excellence, have become instruments of pressure through a cancel culture
   at the international level. The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the
   depth of the crisis of the Open society social project and
   globalization, understood as leveling the values of national cultures,
   including political ones, in congruency with the standards of the
   American worldview. The measures taken by Russia, China, and a number of
   other countries to protect their axiological sovereignty led to a tough
   reaction from the West in the form of `fencing off' and a scheme of
   `punishment' similar to the `canceling of Hollywood movie stars,' that
   is, treating the `dissident' countries as rogue states, interfering with
   the `effective' project of `democratic globalization up to the
   declaration of `dissident countries' as rogue states interfering with
   the `effective' project of `democratic globalization'. In this
   discussion article, the author considers ways to neutralize attempts to
   `cancel Russian culture' and proves that Russia has a `firewall' in the
   form of traditional values opposing the `new ethics' as well as in the
   form of creating new ties and open platforms for interaction at the
   international level. At the same time, it is in Russia's interests to
   avoid self-isolation from the West and build relations with it,
   combining the protection of value sovereignty and the media environment
   with balanced strategic empathy in order to avoid a catastrophic
   escalation of events towards nuclear war threshold.},

Title = {Is ``Constitutional Veneration{''} an Obstacle to Constitutional
   Amendment?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {395-406},
Abstract = {Some constitutional scholars suggest that the US Constitution stands as
   one of the oldest yet least changed national constitutions in part
   because Americans' tendency to ``revere{''} the Constitution has left
   them unwilling to consider significant changes to the document. Several
   recent studies support aspects of this claim, but no study establishes a
   direct link between individuals' respect for the Constitution and their
   reluctance to amend it. To address this, we replicate and extend the
   research design of Zink and Dawes (2016) across two survey experiments.
   The key difference in our experiments is we include measures of
   respondents' propensity to revere the Constitution, which in turn allows
   us to more directly test whether constitutional veneration translates
   into resistance to amendment. Our results build on Zink and Dawes's
   findings and show that, in addition to institutional factors, citizens'
   veneration of the Constitution can act as a psychological obstacle to
   constitutional amendment.},

Abstract = {From the earliest days of British settlement in Australia, petitions
   have been used by the public to voice their opinions on the issues and
   events that concerned them at the time. Often overlooked, they serve as
   a rich primary source of our social history. This Article will examine
   selected petitions from the Parliament of NSW's public website to hear
   directly from people living in the 19(th), 20(th )and 21(st) centuries.
   Case study one examines the very first petition made to the new colonial
   parliament in NSW, which by default became the first petition in
   Australia. By examining the clues left in the petition and what it spoke
   against we learn about life in colonial Sydney. The second case study
   examines petitions written in response to the arrival of the AIDS virus,
   showing attitudes and fears at a time when the virus and its
   transmission were not fully understood and contracting it was considered
   a death sentence. The third case study looks at the growing importance
   of animals to the people of NSW, both as valued family members and in
   concerns for their welfare in the 21(st) century. Examining the voices
   and views contained within petitions at various times allows the people
   of New South Wales to tell our social history.},

Abstract = {The Polish government has submitted an investigative report addressing
   the damage inflicted on Poland by Germany during the Second World War.
   The report puts the amount of reparations due at EUR 1.3 trillion.
   Whether there is a legal basis for such claims is doubtful. Poland
   received reparations from the Soviet zone of occupation in Germany as
   well as the German Democratic Republic, and then in 1953 issued a waiver
   of reparations. The Federal Republic of Germany settled individual
   claims for compensation. The German government views the issue of
   compensation as settled by the 1990 Two Plus Four Treaty. Legally, this
   may hold true, but politically and morally, the question of
   ``compensation{''} remains current.},

   THE WAR IN UKRAINE},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSFORMATION STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {192-205},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the determinants of the
   balancing policy of the Arab states of the Persian Gulf in relation to
   the war in Ukraine and the political and economic consequences of this
   policy. The main hypothesis holds that the foreign policy of the Arab
   states of the Persian Gulf toward the war in Ukraine is primarily a
   function of their relations with the USA and Russia and their own
   political/economic interests/gains (primarily the enhancing of their own
   power position in the international arena). Three research questions
   were posed to verify this hypothesis: 1) Why are the Arab states of the
   Persian Gulf pursuing a balancing policy in relation to the war in
   Ukraine? 2) How do US-Arab and Russian-Arab relations translate into the
   foreign policy strategy of the oil monarchies toward the war in Ukraine?
   3) How will the balancing policies of the Arab states of the Persian
   Gulf affect their relations with the USA and Russia? The paper makes a
   reference to the theory of neorealism, thanks to which selected
   determinants of the policy of balancing/non-involvement in the war in
   Ukraine were indicated.},

Abstract = {This article provides an empirical analysis of the voting behaviour of
   Conservative parliamentarians in the final parliamentary ballot of the
   Conservative Party leadership election of 2019. We construct a dataset
   for the parliamentary Conservative Party and then put forward hypotheses
   that will consider the possible Eurosceptic, party political, economic
   and/or ideological motivations for the voting behaviour of Conservative
   parliamentarians in the final parliamentary ballot. Our findings
   demonstrate that support for Johnson and Hunt was structured around age
   and voting behaviour in the European Union (EU) membership referendum,
   with support for Gove drawn from those who voted for May's Withdrawal
   Agreement in the first meaningful vote. Other factors, such as the
   economic impact of Brexit on constituencies and social liberalism, were
   not found to be statistically significant.},

Journal = {PS-POLITICAL SCIENCE \& POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {171-175},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Building on the concept of a one-minute paper, I suggest students'
   takeaways as a simple technique for inclusive assessment of
   participation in a classroom. Acknowledging cultural and language
   barriers, the takeaways technique allows an instructor to grade
   participation not by observing the frequency of spoken comments but
   instead by the quality of written comments in students' one-point
   takeaway memos completed at the end of each class. In this way, all
   students have an equal chance to be appraised for their participation,
   indicated by being attentive in class. This article surveys the
   scholarship on one-minute papers and participation grading in political
   science, outlines takeaway procedures, and discusses how to adjust this
   technique for face-to-face and online learning environments. I suggest
   that takeaways ensure transparency in grading participation, enable
   equal opportunities to participate, encourage students' attentiveness,
   and create a communication channel for the exchange of immediate
   feedback between a professor and students.},

Abstract = {``Clickbait{''} media has long been espoused as an unfortunate
   consequence of the rise of digital journalism. But little is known about
   why readers choose to read clickbait stories. Is it merely curiosity, or
   might voters think such stories are more likely to provide useful
   information? We conduct a survey experiment in Italy, where a major
   political party enthusiastically embraced the esthetics of new media and
   encouraged their supporters to distrust legacy outlets in favor of
   online news. We offer respondents a monetary incentive for correct
   answers to manipulate the relative salience of the motivation for
   accurate information. This incentive increases differences in the
   preference for clickbait; older and less educated subjects become even
   more likely to opt to read a story with a clickbait headline when the
   incentive to produce a factually correct answer is higher. Our model
   suggests that a politically relevant subset of the population prefers
   Clickbait Media because they trust it more.},

   challenges and further strategic directions of development. EU policy in
   the field of green economy and innovation has been studied. Identified
   core economic systems for << green >> finance. The policy of stimulation
   of eco-innovative activity in the EU and primary financing programs are
   considered. A scheme of the system of sustainable finance and
   eco-innovation in the EU has been elaborated, and the direct relations
   between the elements of this system have been clarified. The
   methodological basis of the article are the fundamental provisions of
   economic science, the theory of green finance and innovative
   development. Dialectical, systematic, logical and historical methods of
   scientific knowledge were used. The conclusions demonstrate the urgent
   need for a green transformation and the importance of developing a
   policy for financing eco-innovation activities in the EU.},

Abstract = {Many foreign companies left Russia after its attack on Ukraine in
   February 2022. But appearances are deceiving: many corporations are
   still active in Russia, especially in the agricultural, food and
   pharmaceutical sectors. They had to struggle with logistical problems
   and experienced a boom in demand. They adapted corporate strategies and
   developed justification strategies. The atmosphere within the labour
   force has also changed. Employees are contextualising themselves with
   new views of themselves and the world in a country that is committing
   war crimes every day. The spectrum ranges from indignation, which is
   openly expressed in circles of like-minded people, to repression and
   jingoism. Nobody wants to make any personal sacrifices for the
   fatherland.},

   structuring comprehensive methods of crime investigation and to form, on
   their basis, effective recommendations for the dissemination and
   investigation of crimes committed in the field of trafficking in
   precious metals and stones. The authors present comprehensive methods
   for investigating crimes in the field of illegal circulation of precious
   metals and stones. An archival 300 criminal cases were examined, the
   preliminary investigation of which occurred between 2015 and 2019, and
   in addition, an online interview was conducted with 220 law enforcement
   officers fighting such crimes. As a result, comprehensive methods have
   been developed to investigate these crimes, as well as a system of
   provisions and scientific recommendations for the dissemination and
   investigation of thefts, trafficking, violations of the rules for the
   delivery of precious objects. He was interested in designing a method
   for declaring, illegal enterprise combined into a single subject of
   investigation with due attention to criminal and forensic prerequisites,
   including the following structural elements: a) comprehensive forensic
   characteristics of such crimes, and b) activities of dissemination and
   investigation of such crimes using the situational approach in its
   various stages.},

Title = {THE EVOLUTION OF NORTH MACEDONIAN CONSOCIATIONAL SYSTEM},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {111-129},
Abstract = {Comparative politics has debated the effectiveness of the two basic
   models of conflict management, namely consociational and integrative.
   According to a widespread opinion, consociational mechanisms preserve
   inter -ethnic tensions and hinder the building of a state identity based
   on citizenship. The article focuses on North Macedonia, where
   consociational mechanisms have been applied since the 2001 armed clashes
   to mitigate the deep contradictions between the Macedonian majority and
   the Albanian minority. Applying comparative analysis and geographical
   method, the study attempts to answer the question of where the
   consociational polity under study is evolving and whether it is possible
   to build a state identity based on citizenship rather than ethnicity.
   The analysis of parliamentary elections in North Macedonia in 2002-2020
   shows that until 2016 the popularity of radical Albanian parties
   declined, though then dramatically increased, and up to the present two
   centripetal tendencies can be seen, which are an increase in ethnic
   minority support for national parties and more active cooperation
   between large and small parties before the elections.},

Abstract = {The literature on the relationship between foreign aid and institutions
   has found that the effects of aid vary across different donor
   characteristics and delivery mechanisms. This article focuses on China's
   resource-related development projects, which have been considered
   controversial due to the relative lack of conditionality. By
   distinguishing between vertical and horizontal dimensions of political
   accountability, the study finds that China's resource-related projects
   are particularly detrimental to the accountability of recipient
   countries' horizontal (legislative and judicial) institutions. These
   projects are often delivered to resource-rich countries, in the form of
   packaging access to resources and infrastructure construction, to
   improve China's own energy access. Local officials may be tempted to
   weaken horizontal institutions so that the projects can be implemented
   quickly. Nevertheless, these projects have little effect on vertical
   accountability, as China has less intention and capacity to
   fundamentally restrain electoral competition in recipient countries.},

Abstract = {The article aims to substantiate the principles of institutional support
   for the development of eco-industrial parks in the conditions of
   formation of circular economy taking into account, the world experience.
   The methodological basis of the study is a systematic approach. It is
   based on the fact that the institutional support for the development of
   eco-industrial parks orients the actions of the authorities at different
   levels to establish certain norms, rules, restrictions, the order of
   their establishment and fulfillment in terms of achieving the goals of
   sustainable development, with interaction with the subjects of
   territorial communities. It is concluded that institutional support,
   should provide effective assistance in the development of public
   policies that underpin the eco-industrial parks, ensuring compliance
   with the rights and freedoms of business entities. In addition, the
   basis of institutional support for park development is based on a
   systemic approach, which is proposed in the form of a recurrent
   functional relationship. Measures aimed at ensuring institutional
   support for these parks are highlighted.},

Abstract = {Post-Weberian definitions see the state???individual relationship as a
   ???do ut des??? one. The state grants protection, education, medical
   care, and its citizens contribute labour, compliance, and taxes. When
   this does not occur, it is generally accepted that the citizens are
   deviating from state goals. However, there are cases where lack of
   compliance stems from the fact that society members do not feel
   protected by formal structures, and they rely on informal ones to
   replace, supplement, or even compete with state institutions. The
   starting point of this article is that this lack of support may result
   from enhanced labour mobility (and migration) across Europe, and may
   enhance the creation and persistence of informal practices. Taking
   advantage of two case studies, Romanian migrants to Spain and ethnic
   entrepreneurs in Croatia, we observe how governance is constructed and
   provide two novel interpretative frameworks. First, we explore the use
   of informality (informal practices) to suggest that apparently
   insignificant actions that are repeated routinely and without much
   thought, are a way to contribute to the construction of the political
   and that everyday governance should receive more attention. Second, we
   use this claim to argue that a better understanding of informality can
   help identify governance areas where interventions are more urgent.
   These are the spheres of public life where it is possible to identify a
   larger gap between the wishes of a state and the ways citizens actually
   act as they informally avoid or bypass its rules.},

Abstract = {Peace agreements may inadvertently increase selective violence against
   civilians when they are incomplete in two key dimensions. First, only a
   fraction of the existing armed groups participates in the agreement.
   Second, the legitimate government fails to establish an institutional
   presence in the areas previously controlled by those who do participate.
   Under these two conditions, the resulting vacuum of power may attract
   active armed groups who engage in selective civilian victimization to
   obtain control. Studying the recent Colombian experience, we find that
   the permanent ceasefire declared by the FARC insurgency in 2014 led to a
   surge in the targeting of community leaders in former FARC strongholds,
   perpetrated by armed groups excluded from the peace process, with the
   goal of consolidating their dominance in those areas. Critically,
   selective victimization is attenuated by some dimensions of state
   capacity and exacerbated in places that are more valuable as proxied by
   the existence of recent land conflicts.},

Abstract = {This article examines state racism and structural violence inflicted
   upon Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers in Israel by surveying various
   exclusionary policies and their harmful effects. It situates
   exclusionary state practices of migration control in Israel's racialized
   social dynamics, contextualized in Israel's origins as a settler society
   and subsequent national ordering. Israel's treatment of African asylum
   seekers is conceptualized as structural violence through an examination
   of unnecessary, preventable, or avoidable harms that were differentially
   inflicted upon this distinct, racialized migrant group both directly and
   indirectly. Claims in the article are based on ethnographic research
   conducted with asylum seekers who had been detained in Israel's Holot
   detention facility. In contrast to Israel's purported adherence to
   international commitments to human rights, including asylum protections,
   understanding asylum seekers' destitution through the lens of structural
   violence enables us to place the onus and responsibility for human
   suffering upon the state.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the question of the legal nature and essence of
   the judicial acts of the Ukrainian courts as a source of law. It also
   analyzes the notion and characteristics of the sources of law according
   to academics. Particular attention is paid to the investigation into
   whether the decisions of the Ukrainian courts can be defined as a
   precedent and whether they have, in turn, binding force for all people.
   Therefore, the analysis of the legal nature of the decisions of the
   European Court of Human Rights, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, the
   Supreme Court, and the administrative courts was of interest. The study
   used general and special scientific methods, the basis of which is the
   application of the results of theoretical research and other generalized
   information on the sources of law in Ukraine. The authors conclude that
   these decisions have a different nature than the judgments of the common
   law system. Although some judicial decisions of Ukrainian courts tend to
   possess some elements of precedent and are binding, not only for the
   parties to the case but for all people. This makes it possible to
   characterize these judicial decisions as complementary sources of law.},

Journal = {CUESTIONES POLITICAS},

Pages = {824-843},
Abstract = {Given the peculiarities of Ukraine's geographical location and military
   conflicts in the east of the country, the harmful effects of smuggling
   on the economic development of the country are constantly increasing.
   The volume of smuggling amounts to about 209-311 billion grivnas. The
   article aims to identify the main determinants of smuggling in order to
   develop measures tailored to the needs of Ukrainian social development.
   In the article we have used various methods of scientific knowledge,
   which allowed us to enrich our research to make it more meaningful.
   Analysis of official statistics, examples of police practice,
   sociological and legal research allowed us to identify the main causes
   of smuggling in Ukraine. The authors conclude that, based on the
   selected determinants of smuggling in Ukraine, it is essential to give
   priority to the implementation of preventive measures, i.e. to prevent
   the conditions of its commission and also the resumption of criminal
   liability for commercial smuggling of goods. In addition, there is a
   need to design more and better public policies to minimize the
   conditions that enable the action of smuggling agents.},

Abstract = {The authors propose the terms of the debate about the controversial and
   aporetic institution of the pardon, which has a difficult fit in the
   scheme of the democratic State based on the separation of powers. To
   this end, the study starts from the background and historical reasons
   for the prerogative of mercy and its regulations in comparative law,
   which allows us to understand the scope of the issue and the complex
   legal nature of an institution, the pardon, which is equates to
   forgiveness and that must be scrupulously delimited from amnesty
   -oblivion-. The most recent national practice serves as an example, in
   the authors' opinion, of the need to move towards a new Spanish
   transitional pardon law, which must become an exceptional and residual
   resource, in fact doomed to extinction. The work harshly criticizes the
   pardons in the case of the << Proces >> -which are classified as fraud
   of the Constitution- and includes a specific proposal of lege lata vel
   ferenda.},

Abstract = {How do criminal agendas affect a peace process with violent non-state
   actors? This article attempts to resolve this question by presenting a
   qualitative analysis of the demobilization process of the United
   Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) during the government of Alvaro
   Uribe using the Peace Triangle as an analytical framework, based on
   three study variables: issues , behavior and attitudes . The review from
   this model aims to make a double contribution to peace studies. On the
   one hand, it fills a gap in academic knowledge about the sustainability
   of peace processes. And, on the other, to examine the relationship
   between criminal agendas and conflict resolution. The research reveals
   that the former Colombian President's inadequate management of criminal
   agendas transformed the peace negotiation into a damage control strategy
   since it did not intend to modify the scale of predatory crimes
   committed by the AUC, but rather to shape its behavior.},

Abstract = {Although in the last few years Colombia has faced significant civil
   society mobili-zation, 2021 represented critical juncture in social
   mobilization that was the result of three converging crises. The
   COVID-19 pandemic, a health crisis, triggered an economic crisis that
   exacerbated existing social and economic inequalities. Toge-ther they
   aggravated a pre-existing governability crisis. Unions and other actors
   convened a national strike on April 28 and the violent police response
   ignited the protest. The strike lasted almost two months and framed the
   legislative and pre-sidential elections in 2022. This paper analyzes
   these events, their effects, and the perspectives for the future.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the optimal types and measures of
   legal liability for crimes in the field of illicit trade in
   pharmaceuticals in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research
   used methods of systematic approach, descriptive analysis, synthesis and
   prognosis, systematic and formal legal and comparative selection. It has
   been established that illicit trade in pharmaceuticals is carried out by
   organized criminal groups and is related to corruption and cybercrime.
   Also, the article has revealed typical legal flaws, which complicate
   international cooperation in this field and lead to noncompliance with
   international standards of criminalization and imposition of sanctions
   for illegal circulation of counterfeit medicines. All this leads to the
   conclusion that the illicit trade in pharmaceuticals manifests itself in
   a series of offenses for which administrative or criminal liability must
   be foreseen. Equally promising is the development of a model for law
   enforcement activity that includes criminalization of trade in
   low-quality, unregistered and counterfeit pharmaceuticals, according to
   international standards; proportional punishments for natural persons
   and influence measures for legal persons and compensation for their
   victims.},

Abstract = {Russia's war on Ukraine inaugurated the new Cold War most feared, and
   some wanted. It demanded that countries pick sides. African countries
   and their elites have been reluctant to do so, not least because for
   some their food or energy supplies will be affected, while for others
   Putin's authoritarian governance model is seductive. Other countries and
   movements are reluctant to weigh in for fear of being swept up in an
   eliteserving great power conflict using Ukraine as its proxy and that
   the invasion exposes hypocrisies. More than anything, peace and a more
   humane future - another kind of world, underlined not by great power
   competition, but solidarity binding ordinary people across borders - is
   even more elusive.},

Abstract = {The article aims to study the theoretical and applied aspects of
   pre-trial research in emergency legal regimes such as: martial law, the
   state of emergency or the area of joint forces operation in Ukraine.
   International legal requirements for due process in criminal proceedings
   during emergency legal regimes are analyzed. It is claimed that the
   existing experience in Ukraine of normative regulation of criminal
   proceedings under the conditions of special legal regimes is
   inefficient, fragmentary, and therefore does not fully correspond to
   modern ideas about human rights and the democratic and legal state. The
   perspectives for the application of the jurisprudence of the European
   Court of Human Rights in criminal proceedings under emergency legal
   regimes are identified. It was concluded that the investigating
   authorities carry out all the means to establish the facts of the
   disappeared persons in the area of Operation of Joint Forces within the
   framework of the criminal process, which will allow to comply, in
   theory, with all the requirements for the effectiveness of the
   investigation. The basis for the formation of legislation on this
   subject should be the relevant law on missing persons.},

Abstract = {This article deals with politologically relevant dimensions of
   contemporary computer games, in particular with their entertainment
   media presentation of politics or political culture. Based on the
   building blocks of a political theory of games, some forms of the
   political imagination of popular culture are explored by means of a
   short case study on the construction and management simulation game
   Tropico 5 (2014). From the political and economic simulations of this
   game, in which one slips into the role of the head of an island state,
   some basic lines of the political as well as some stylistic means of
   their presentation will be elaborated. The main focus is on examining
   the images of the exercise of power, statehood and political conflicts
   as they are conveyed (or criticised) in the game???s narratives. These
   aspects help us to clarify the reservoir of political imagination that
   can be hidden in game worlds.},

   From the UK},

Abstract = {While some research addresses the relationship between religiosity and
   political attitudes, little is known about the rela-tionship between
   religion, conspiracy beliefs, and political culture. Using the concept
   of authoritarianism, we hypothesise that a conspiracy mentality is
   likely to be associated with ethnocentric and anti-democratic attitudes,
   just as some types of religion-e.g., religious fundamentalism-have a
   close affinity to authoritarian attitudes. Using data from an online UK
   survey (N = 1093; quota sample, representative of education, gender,
   age, and region), we enquire to what extent belief in conspiracy
   theories is associated with xenophobic, racist, and anti-democratic
   attitudes, which aspects of religiosity in combination with other
   factors play a role in conspiracy beliefs, and which communicative and
   interpretative practices are associated with belief in conspiracy
   ideologies. Our analysis reveals that both belief in classical
   conspiracy theories and belief in Covid-19 conspiracy theories are
   significantly related to anti-Muslim sentiments, anti-Black racism, and
   right-wing extremism. Moreover, a regression analysis shows that an
   initially discovered relationship between the strength of religios-ity
   and conspiracy mentality disappears once religious fundamentalism is
   included in the model. The effect of religious fun-damentalism is
   moderated by narcissism and the style of social media use-namely,
   trusting posts made by one's friends more than the opinions of experts.},

Abstract = {The economic slump in Russia in 2022 was less severe than forecast. This
   was due to high global market prices for energy commodities, the rapid
   adaptation of companies to Western sanctions, and targeted intervention
   on the part of the state. However, development in the regions varied
   greatly. Oil-producing regions benefited from high prices. The situation
   was difficult due to the departure of international corporations from
   centres of the automotive industry. This also applies to the regions in
   the country's west, where the lumber processing and ferrous metal
   industries play a major role. In the country's west and east, where
   production is geared to the domestic market or export to Asia, this was
   less the case. Regional budgets are stable due to payments from Moscow.
   Unemployment is low. However, aging and emigration are leading to a
   shortage in skilled workers. No recovery is expected in 2023. Growth is
   to be expected only where armaments factories are located.},

Abstract = {The results of an empirical research on political communications through
   Belarusian telegram channels during the country's political crisis in
   2020 are presented in this article. The paper's theoretical framework is
   based on J. Theocharis' and J. Van Det's perspectives on digital
   political engagement, the concept of ``network thinking{''} (V.
   Kurbatov; E. Pronina), as well as previous research related to the study
   of the messenger's role in Belarusian protest communication. The article
   is based on almost 2 thousand posts in eight crucial Belarusian
   political telegram channels of diverse political viewpoints. The
   empirical base was gathered over the course of two weeks, both before
   and after the election (August 9, 2020). The model led to original
   findings on how communication strategies of channels and methods for
   engaging citizens have evolved in light of the current agenda. The
   study's principal method was qualitative and quantitative content
   analysis, with aspects of event analysis. The findings revealed that
   pro-government channels followed a value-oriented strategy
   ({''}similarity mode{''}), attempting to appeal to common
   representations of fundamental Belarusian values. Simultaneously, the
   channels had to reestablish communication to protest in the
   post-election period, conducting counterpropaganda and ``mirroring{''}
   the agenda of opposition channels. Opposition channels employed an
   exposure approach, portraying the existing government's activities in a
   negative light and appealing to the common good that would be achieved
   following the change of authority ({''}regime of criticism and
   justification{''}). Initially, opposition channels concentrated on
   multimedia ``niche{''} content, frequent updates and the development of
   methods for mobilizing citizens and delivering necessary instructions.
   In contrast to pro-government channels, the opposition channels were
   able to sustain consistent indicators of user engagement due to the
   established communication policy.},

Abstract = {The application of blockchain technology to contractual activity has led
   to a decrease in transaction costs, but also an enormous potential cost
   of judicial solutions that order reversal of the effects of smart
   contracts. This research addresses solutions, both from the perspective
   of updating the unforeseen theory and from clauses that are introduced
   to the legal smart contracts to allow reducing the costs associated with
   judicial decisions that declare an anomaly in the contracts.},

Abstract = {High-income and less unequal societies are associated with both lower
   rates of economic crimes and larger public programs to deter crime. This
   paper suggests that redistributive effects generated by a crime-control
   program help to explain these facts. Retirees and honest individuals are
   beneficiaries of the system because they do not offend. Despite paying
   more taxes, high-income dishonest agents become net receivers, as they
   devote relatively less time to criminal activities than poorer agents;
   thus, a regressive intra-generational redistributive effect arises.
   Consequently, a crime-control program may be politically supported by a
   coalition of retirees, honest individuals and high-income dishonest
   young agents.},

   positions based on text mining techniques},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {75},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We scale theoretical/ideological positions of economic research
   institutes over debates. Using only parts of German research institutes'
   business cycle reports that deal with economic policy advice as an
   example, we extract sections from these reports dealing with monetary
   and fiscal policy issues from 1999 to 2020. To these corpora, we apply
   methods of unsupervised text scaling (Slapin and Proksch, 2008;
   Lauderdale and Herzog, 2016), namely Wordfish and Wordshoal. Roughly,
   results are in line with common sense in the public policy discourse.
   For monetary policy texts, we observe a strong, but short-lived
   consensus in debate-specific positions at the height of the financial
   crisis in 2008 and a larger polarization thereafter compared to the
   sample period before. For the fiscal policy text corpus, the
   polarization was similarly high before and after the crisis and
   decreases somewhat during the COVID-19 pandemic. For both policy areas,
   the German Institute of Economic Research (DIW), Berlin, and the
   Institute for World Economics (IfW), Kiel, tend to be the most diverse
   institutes within the spectrum of latent ideological positions. We argue
   that text-mining techniques might be useful to scale underlying
   ideological positions in policy-related publications.},

Abstract = {PurposeIn this paper, the author assesses if the effect of structural
   policies, macroeconomic indicators and demographic factors on employment
   elasticities over the period 2000-2017 can distinguish the former French
   colonies from the Anglophone ones.Design/methodology/approachUsing a
   panel of 44 countries taken from Africa and Middle East Area,
   elasticities are estimated in the first stage by rolling regression.
   Then, both static and dynamic panel models are
   investigated.FindingsResults suggest big difference between the former
   French colonies and Anglophone ones. For the French colonies, product
   and labor market flexibility are found to have significant and positive
   impact on elasticities, while for Anglophone ones, only foreign direct
   investment and government size are found to have significant and
   positive impact. Besides, all reforms and/or economic measures need to
   be complemented by macroeconomic policies aimed to increase economic
   stability.Originality/valueThe results presented in this study highlight
   some of the factors that appear to drive the relationship between
   employment and some structural policies, macroeconomic indicators and
   demographic factors for two groups of former colonies. The paper
   provides policy conclusions based on these results for the two groups.
   This analysis may indeed help to inform future policy discussions, yet
   much additional work is needed to identify macroeconomic ``best
   practices{''} for encouraging employment in the post-2019 covid crisis
   period.},

Title = {Renewable energy expansion or the preservation of national energy
   sovereignty? Norwegian renewable energy policy meets resource
   nationalism},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {99},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Proponents of renewable energy often argue that renewables bolster
   national energy sovereignty. Most of the scholarship however focuses on
   security of supply, imports and enhanced domestic production, not on
   exports. How does exporting renewable energy resources affect
   sovereignty? Here, we turn our attention to Norway, a country that is
   already self-sufficient in renewables, and where renewable energy
   expansion is primarily directed at exports. Drawing on resource
   nationalist scholarship we empirically scrutinize key Norwegian
   renewable energy debates and show how the Norwegian renewable energy
   debates do not include notions of renewables bolstering sovereignty. On
   the contrary, they vary between portraying the relationship between
   renewables and sovereignty as a non-relationship, where renewables are
   immaterial to sovereignty, or an adverse relationship, where renewable
   expansion is perceived to weaken, rather than strengthen, sovereignty.
   The fear of being locked into an asymmetric dependency relationship with
   an EU that gradually wrests away Norwegian sovereignty over natural
   resources triggers resource nationalist imaginaries and is a powerful
   brake on renewable energy expansion. Resource nationalism is also fueled
   by claims of green grabbing and attacks on local self-determination. Our
   findings signal that renewable expansion may trigger political and
   popular backlashes, and that resource nationalist claims about abstained
   sovereignty may constitute considerable obstacles to renewable energy
   transitions.},

Abstract = {As the multiple benefits from exposure to urban green spaces (UGSs) are
   increasingly acknowledged, urban greening policies have become an
   important component of the urban political agenda. Most targeting
   strategies of future UGS development are based on the pursuit of an
   equal distribution of UGSs among residents. These strategies implicitly
   assume that the development of any type of UGS will have the same effect
   on citizens' well-being, provided that their access is guaranteed. This
   paper questions this assumption and addresses the demand side of urban
   greening policies by evaluating which UGS characteristics are sought by
   urban dwellers. We apply a travel time-based discrete choice experiment
   (DCE) to capture the trade-offs between the UGS characteristics (e.g.,
   tree cover, size, presence of water, accessibility) and the travel time
   that citizens are willing to spend to reach a hypothetical UGS compared
   to a ``stay at home{''} option. We discover that all the respondents
   have a disutility in choosing the ``stay at home{''} option instead of a
   scenario of UGS development, especially when the UGS contains trees.
   This disutility is however much higher among outer suburb inhabitants
   living in municipalities with relatively lower urbanization levels and
   rent prices. Further, the global time budget dedicated to reach a UGS is
   much lower for inner-city residents compared to outer-suburb
   inhabitants. Inhabitants living in less urbanized areas place a higher
   value on a large UGS (> 1.5 hectares), while residents living in city
   centres do not seem to be influenced by this UGS characteristic. Our
   results suggest that strategies based on access criteria would benefit
   from being differentiated according to urbanization levels of cities, as
   the inhabitants of city centres value nearby and multiple UGSs but not
   necessarily large UGSs while the inhabitants of suburbs value larger
   UGSs, even when located farther away.},

Abstract = {Each individual in the United States is exposed on average to 9 climatic
   disasters during their lifetime, with possible effects on political
   attitude formation, in particular in the realm of environmental
   policies. Using data on the universe of hurricanes, floods and severe
   storms from 1953 to 2014, I show that exposure to disasters is a key
   determinant of support for environmental public action, and that it is
   lasting over the course of life. A standard deviation of climatic
   disaster in one's lifetime increases the probability of expressing a
   pro-environmental opinion by 9 percentage points and liberal views by 15
   percentage points of a standard deviation. I show that the environmental
   effect is channeled by direct exposure in respondent's own county.
   Investigating heterogenous effects along the partisan lines of
   respondents reveal that it is mostly Democrats who are affected by the
   disaster experience, especially those living in red States. Results are
   also consistent with retrospective voting behaviors, as voters are more
   likely to punish governors who are ideologically less supportive of
   public action after a climate disaster. These results give ground for
   the growing evidence of polarization of US citizens on environmental
   issues.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how legislative inflation relates to private
   credit at the national level. Using a panel data set of 33 countries
   covering 2004-2016, we confirm that government effectiveness moderates
   the relationship between enacting new central laws and domestic credit.
   In environments with more effective governments, legislative creation
   can lead to lending expansion. Consequently, banking systems seem to
   perceive severe changes to the national legislation as ongoing
   improvements to replace inefficient or obsolete laws.},

Title = {The impact of using proportional representation system on the

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of using
   proportional representation system on the fragmentation of the party
   system in the Algerian political system within the period from 1997 to
   2017, in which Algeria has experienced five legislative elections
   regularly every five years by testing a hypothesis about adopting the
   proportional representation system on the basis of the closed list
   during the foregoing legislative elections has obviously influenced the
   exacerbation of the Algerian party system's fragmentation, compared to
   other factors. Design/methodology/approach The essence of the
   theoretical framework of this study is to address the effect of the
   electoral system as an independent variable on the party system as a
   dependent variable. The starting point for that framework is to reassess
   the ``Duverger's law,{''} which appeared since the early 1950s and has
   influenced the foregoing relationship, and then to review the literature
   on a new phase that tried to provide a more accurate mechanism for
   determining the number of parties and their relative weight, whether in
   terms of electoral votes or parliamentary seats. This means that
   researchers began to use a measure called the effective number of
   parties (ENP) for Laakso and Taagepera since 1979. The study elaborates
   the general concepts of the electoral system and the party system. It
   used Laakso, Taagepera index of the ``ENP{''} to measure the phenomenon
   of fragmentation party during the five legislative elections from 1997
   to 2017 in Algeria. Findings The results of the study reveal that the
   proportional representation electoral system - beside other factors -
   had clear impacts on the fragmentation of the Algerian party system by
   all standards, whether on the level of the apparent rise in the number
   of the parties represented in the Algerian parliament from 10 parties in
   1997 election to 36 parties in 2017 election or according to the index
   of Laakso and Taagepera (ENP). The average number of effective number of
   electoral parties in the five elections was around 7.66, and the average
   number of effective number of parliamentary parties in the five
   elections was around 4.39, which puts Algeria in an advanced degree of
   the fragmentation of the party system. Originality/value This study
   about the phenomenon of the fragmentation of the party system, which is
   one of the new subjects in the field of comparative politics - globally
   and in the Arab world. Hence, the value of this study aims to shed light
   on this mysterious area of science, the fragmentation of the party
   system in the Algerian political system during the period from 1997 to
   2017.},

Abstract = {This article examines the political career of Angiola Moretti who was,
   from 1926 to 1930, the National Secretary of the Fasci Femminili - the
   women's section of the Italian Fascist Party. Despite her prominent
   role, this female hierarch has never, to date, been studied by
   historians. The article investigates how she came to be appointed to
   this high-ranking position and her subsequent role and career in the
   Fascist Party, including her eventual nomination in the late 1930s to
   the rank of Ispettrice Nazionale del PNF. The story of Angiola Moretti's
   somewhat improbable career is used as a lens to explore the murky world
   of the Fascist `court' in Rome and its gender politics.},

Abstract = {Efforts supporting domestic revenue mobilisation in developing countries
   are often designed and evaluated based on empirical indicators, such as
   ratios of revenue to gross domestic product, which capture differences
   in achieved outcomes across countries. This article studies a
   complementary approach that also takes into account differences in
   countries??? fundamental economic structures associated with different
   capacities to raise revenue, which are not captured by simple ratios of
   revenue to gross domestic product. Non-parametric data envelopment
   analysis is applied to estimate domestic revenue potential in a panel of
   118 low- and middleincome countries from 2008 to 2019. This approach
   provides a data-driven measure of how efficient each country is in
   raising domestic revenue given its national economic conditions. The
   results indicate that countries??? relative efficiencies do not exhibit
   the same strongly positive correlation with income levels as typically
   observed for ratios of revenue to gross domestic product. Instead,
   countries with low efficiency are spread across all income groups and
   geographical regions. This suggests that looking solely at ratios of
   revenue to gross domestic product might be misleading for drawing policy
   and normative conclusions about how much more revenue a country should
   aim to raise. Finally, panel regression analysis is used to investigate
   the extent to which international support is targeted at countries with
   larger untapped revenue potential.},

Abstract = {The specific historical and political context of Northern Ireland has
   contributed to the development of an expansive visual landscape
   conveying symbolic meanings and messaging through words, pictures and
   colours. Murals, posters and graffiti are common ways in which this is
   seen, drawing a link between the past and the present, with real-time
   political developments not only inspiring new additions to this
   landscape but also shaping how existing images are understood in a
   contemporary context. Brexit, in interacting so intimately with matters
   of identity, economics, politics and the `constitutional question' in
   Northern Ireland, has been one such development. This paper presents key
   findings from a study in which Brexit's impact on the visual landscape
   in Northern Ireland was traced between March 2019 and June 2020. Through
   close analysis of images gathered from across Northern Ireland,
   alongside consideration of political developments during this time and
   desk-based research, we examine not only the emergence of Brexit in such
   imagery, but also what this unveils about the interaction between Brexit
   and localized perspectives on its impact with regard to politics across
   the spectrum, and across different parts of Northern Ireland.},

Abstract = {Objective We seek to determine the antecedents of self-categorization as
   white and white identity salience among Latinx people. We also
   investigate the effects of both on Latinx's political preferences.
   Methods We perform multivariate regression analyses using the 2012
   American National Election Survey (ANES). The survey included 1005
   Latinx U.S. citizens. Results We find that Latinx citizens with a strong
   Latino consciousness and more educated Latinx are less likely to
   self-categorize as white, while those with a higher income are more
   likely to do so. Furthermore, we find that white identity salience
   correlates positively with being a Republican and a conservative and
   with opposition to welfare. Still, it is not a significant predictor of
   anti-immigrant policy preferences. Conclusion Many Latinx show a strong
   attachment to white identity, and these affective ties to whiteness
   correlate with conservative political orientations.},

Abstract = {Sleep is fundamental to life and essential to one's health behavior,
   scholastic achievement, and work performance. Recent years have seen an
   increase in empirical investigations incorporating sleep research into
   political science. This study complements existing sleep-politics
   studies by examining the associations between chronotype (a person's
   preferred time to sleep and wake up) and attitudinal and behavioral
   political outcomes (left-right ideology and social conservatism proxied
   by religious service attendance). We analyze representative samples from
   10 national contexts (Finland, Greece, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands,
   New Zealand, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, and Switzerland) to
   test our hypotheses. The results demonstrate that morning chronotype has
   significant links with political conservatism in six national contexts
   depending on model specification (most robustly in Switzerland).
   Unexpectedly, the morning chronotype may have links to liberalism in
   three other countries depending on model specification (most robustly in
   Russia). The results for religious observance are more uniform,
   indicating a link between morningness and greater religious observance
   across all cases in many specifications (excepting a reversed
   relationship in New Zealand in some models). Urbanization, seasonal
   effects, geographical characteristics, and religious denominations are
   explored as potential confounders.},

Title = {Ungovernability and ungovernable life in Palestine},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {98},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper elaborates the notion of ungovernability as an irresolvable
   condition of living. It begins by identifying three distinct modes of
   ungovernability in current geographical work on Palestine:
   ungovernability as a failure to govern; as a rationale for governing;
   and as a technique of governing. To this we develop a further
   conceptualisation of ungovernability as a condition of living that,
   firstly, remains irreducible to the strategic domain of governing.
   Secondly, we argue, by drawing on prevalent geographical work on
   vulnerability and woundedness, that ungovernability constitutes an
   irresolvable origin of governing that, on the one hand, makes governing
   incapable of sustaining what it claims for itself, while on the other,
   names the starting point of a critical analysis of power. By placing the
   irresolvable ungovernability at the centre of analysis we offer, through
   examples drawn from our fieldwork in Palestine, an approach that does
   not reduce life at the outset to cycles of domination-resistance but
   instead approaches life and its spaces through those ways they remain
   irreducible to, and thus ungovernable for various forms of governing.},

Abstract = {In George Stigler's (1971) economic theory of regulation, the primary
   motive of regulatory intervention is the promotion of private interests,
   not the promotion of the general welfare or efficiency as suggested by
   the public interest theory of regulation (Pigou 1932). More recently,
   Andrei Shleifer (2010, 2012) along with some coauthors (Glaeser \&
   Shleifer 2003; Djankov et al. 2003) has proposed an alternative to
   Stigler's theory, which he calls the enforcement theory of regulation.
   Shleifer's new theory of regulation holds that the rise of regulatory
   institutions over the course of the twentieth century is in fact
   efficient and providing the requisite social control of business,
   largely because the alternative judicial mechanism is so inefficient and
   costly. Contrary to Shleifer, we argue here that because both courts and
   regulation are subject to ex-post defection, individual bias, and
   subversion, neither is categorically preferable. Whether or not courts
   or regulation are more efficient at providing social control of business
   ultimately depends on the features of the specific regulatory or
   judicial institutions as well as the economic problem addressed.
   Institutional environments differ with respect to the severity of
   knowledge and incentive problems and mechanisms for overcoming them that
   are built into them. The comparative efficiency of an institutional
   solution depends more on its institutional features
   (centralized/decentralized, contested/uncontested) than its form
   (regulation, courts, or private orderings). Stigler's (1971)
   contribution acknowledges that concern implicitly by incorporating
   competition between different interest groups as the essential
   mechanisms driving regulatory outcomes.},

Abstract = {Objective Do positive export shocks fuel or dampen criminal violence?
   The predation mechanism predicts that increasing export revenue
   generates a larger contested resource, and it prompts more violence by
   increasing the expected benefit of expropriation. The opportunity cost
   mechanism instead argues that an increase in exports may deter
   individuals from engaging in criminal activity, as it drives up labor
   demand and wages in the formal labor market. I test these competing
   claims using a case of the Mexican avocado industry. Method I test these
   claims by estimating a causal effect of avocado production on criminal
   violence in Mexico. I further address the endogeneity issue with an
   instrumental variable approach, exploiting exogenous variations in
   climatic conditions that affect agricultural crop yields. Result Moving
   from the lowest to the highest level of monthly avocado production, this
   positive change in avocado production reduces the homicide rate by 0.65
   per hundred thousand relative to the average monthly homicide rate of
   2.02. Conclusion This finding suggests that the opportunity cost effect
   is largely at play in the avocado-growing Mexican states, showing a new
   context of theory application. Limitations and future research avenues
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {Government censorship-internet shutdowns, blockages, firewalls-impose
   significant barriers to the transnational flow of information despite
   the connective power of digital technologies. In this paper, we examine
   whether and how information flows across borders despite government
   censorship. We develop a semi-automated system that combines deep
   learning and human annotation to find co-occurring content across
   different social media platforms and languages. We use this system to
   detect co-occurring content between Twitter and Sina Weibo as Covid-19
   spread globally, and we conduct in-depth investigations of co-occurring
   content to identify those that constitute an inflow of information from
   the global information ecosystem into China. We find that approximately
   one-fourth of content with relevance for China that gains widespread
   public attention on Twitter makes its way to Weibo. Unsurprisingly,
   Chinese state-controlled media and commercialized domestic media play a
   dominant role in facilitating these inflows of information. However, we
   find that Weibo users without traditional media or government
   affiliations are also an important mechanism for transmitting
   information into China. These results imply that while censorship
   combined with media control provide substantial leeway for the
   government to set the agenda, social media provides opportunities for
   non-institutional actors to influence the information environment.
   Methodologically, the system we develop offers a new approach for the
   quantitative analysis of cross-platform and cross-lingual communication.},

Title = {Divergent desires for the just transition in South Africa: An assemblage
   analysis},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {97},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper I establish a `just transition assemblage' as a
   theoretical and empirical case-study to explore the plurality of justice
   in South Africa's energy transition. The coal phase-out is complicated
   by the legacies of apartheid, poverty, inequality, unemployment and
   structural crisis in the state-owned power utility. This transition is
   loaded with expectation but there is no consensus on what would qualify
   it as `just'. This assemblage analysis clusters desires around two
   distinct post-carbon imaginaries. The first is an ordering of desires
   for justice in a diffuse, distributional sense, targeting greenhouse gas
   emission reductions and looking to smooth the negative impacts of the
   transition. I label this approach `net justice'. This targets more
   justice overall in defined political spaces, and contrasts with the
   second orientation around recognising, reconciling, and addressing
   specific injustices. These desires are distinguished by a contrasting
   purpose of renewable energy and differing attitudes to its
   appropriateness or fit. There are incoherent spatial effects, where net
   justice is shown to be a territorialising project whilst specific
   injustices need to be de-territorialised. Emphasising desire shows how
   material and history are enrolled and enlivened, contributing to
   post-carbon imaginaries. This approach enables injustice and net justice
   to be understood as conceptually distinct, despite seeming unified calls
   for a just transition. The primary contribution of this paper is to show
   how in some cases, popular uses of the terms justice and injustice refer
   to different things. It forces attention on the question of: `justice
   for whom?'},

Abstract = {This article examines Israel's control of international presence in
   Palestine as an `international mobilities regime' that has damaging
   effects for the provision of services in East Jerusalem, the West Bank
   and Gaza. Focusing specifically on educators and medics, the discussion
   draws on long-term fieldwork to set international visa restrictions in
   the context of the `internal' control of Palestinians' mobilities before
   documenting the effects for education and healthcare provision.
   Discussion then turns to the scale and function of bureaucracy that
   produces a further significant effect: to make nothing happen whereby
   projects are stalled, cancelled or rendered inconceivable. To this
   methodologically elusive function, the approach proposed here is to
   attend to an order of `what would have been' to better understand the
   power of bureaucracy to prevent movement and make people stay in place.
   Two main arguments are made: that Israel has developed an international
   mobilities regime that extends its control over Palestinian spaces; and
   that the scale of control is perceptible only by careful attention to
   the lost possibilities effected by bureaucratic restriction - and key
   contributions are explicated for further enquiry into
   bureaucracy-as-deterrent, the international dimensions of Israel's
   mobility restrictions and a turn to `unspectacular' sites of colonial
   control.},

Abstract = {This article reconstructs the encounter between environmentalism and the
   intellectual discourse of the Left in Britain. It shows how
   environmentalism struggled to converse with British socialism and
   Marxism and why the final politicization of the environment took a quite
   long path to transition. Through the analysis of the discussions in The
   Ecologist, New Left Review, and Marxism Today the article documents
   their contributions to the `greening' of wider political discourse, and
   the important place they had in rethinking the role of left-wing
   politics in the difficult years of the 1980s. While the concept of
   crisis played a central role in the assimilation of environmental
   argument and ecology into the complex ideological configuration of
   socialism and Marxism, it was however an external factor - Thatcherism -
   that forced the Left's intellectuals to come to terms with the changing
   of the political and imposed the idea that the preservation of the
   environment was a `socialist principle'. The article contributes to two
   primary lines of historical inquiry: the field of modern British
   environmental history and the politics of the Labour Party's
   reformulation during the 1980s.},

Title = {The political origins of platform economy regulations. Understanding
   variations in governing Airbnb and Uber across cities in Switzerland},

Abstract = {In the past decade, digital platforms have entrenched themselves within
   key urban sectors, opening the way for radical changes in traditional
   industries. Along with new opportunities for city residents, globally
   operating platforms such as Airbnb and Uber also raised specific
   challenges, sparking calls for adequate responses by city governments
   around the world. The aim of this paper is to explain the diversity of
   regulations across cities. Holding constant national factors, we
   conducted comparative case studies in six Swiss cities (Zurich, Geneva,
   Davos, Montreux, Aarau, and Neuchatel) to investigate political
   processes leading to local regulations of Airbnb and Uber. Four crucial
   factors shape regulatory trajectories. First, intensity of
   platform-related issues in cities is key in shaping the stringency of
   regulatory responses. Second, grassroots and political mobilization
   plays a role: where these issues become politically salient, regulations
   are stricter. Third, the inscription of platform-related issues on a
   city's institutional agenda tends to produce stricter regulatory
   responses. Finally, local governments tend to adopt a stricter control
   over platforms in cities where relevant urban sectors are already highly
   regulated. We conclude that the varying stringency of governmental
   responses to the platform economy lays in the dynamics of politicization
   from which they emerged.},

Abstract = {Objective We explain evolving policy choices made by all 50 states in
   response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States
   against the background of each state's political and public health
   landscape. Method We create an index of eight state preventative
   measures and explain variation in that index by infection and death
   rates, vaccination rates, support for President Trump in 2020, and the
   political party of the governor. We control for population density and
   the health vulnerability of each state. Results State response was
   largely driven by three factors: the death rate from COVID-19, Trump
   votes in 2020 and Republican control of the governorship. Conclusion
   Understanding state response to the pandemic requires going beyond a
   partisan lens and considering the shifting onus of responsibility for
   taking action to protect against the virus from states to individual
   citizens in an increasingly politicized sphere of pandemic response.},

Title = {Neither Absent nor Ambient: Incidental News Exposure From the
   Perspective of News Avoiders in the UK, United States, and Spain},

Abstract = {Scholars have long argued that incidental news exposure (INE) is a
   potentially valuable way citizens gain political information and learn
   about current affairs. Yet growing scholarship on news avoidance
   suggests many people still manage to consume little news, and
   algorithmic curation may decrease the likelihood that they will be
   exposed to it incidentally. In this article, we put the literatures on
   INE, news avoidance, and political talk into dialogue with one another.
   Then, by inductively analyzing over a hundred in-depth interviews
   conducted from 2016 to 2020 with news avoiders in the UK, Spain, and the
   United States, we explore how they encounter news incidentally and to
   what extent they feel the news is accessible and available to them. Our
   audience-centric approach highlights that interviewees often did not
   make a clear distinction between direct encounters with professional
   news ({''}firsthand news{''}) and discussions of news ({''}secondhand
   news{''}), especially online. When they did make a distinction, the
   latter was often more salient for them. We also find that just as news
   consumers have repertoires of news sources on which they habitually
   rely, news avoiders have repertoires of sources for incidental exposure
   to news to stay informed about major events and anything that might
   affect them directly. And yet, those repertoires catch only the biggest
   and most sensational stories of the day and do little to help them
   contextualize or understand the news they encounter, contributing to
   their sense that news is neither entirely absent nor ambient in the way
   scholars have theorized.},

Title = {The response of taxpayer compliance to the large shock of Italian

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {73},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Because of differences in the levels of taxation among pre-unitary
   states, Italian unification in 1861 determined differential increments
   in the tax burden among areas of the country. We constructed an index of
   these tax shocks and collected province-level data on historical and
   current indicators of tax evasion to evaluate the impact of the
   unification on tax compliance. We show that the historical variability
   in tax evasion reduced a lot in the following decades and that the
   convergence process preserved quite well the ranking in compliance among
   provinces. We also find that the shock to the tax burden explains much
   of the historical and current variability in tax evasion. The role of
   local congestion externalities, arising within a decentralized system of
   tax enforcement as that set in Italy, is formally explored to account
   for such evidence.},

Abstract = {An Internet platform carrying information content has dual properties of
   content (information) and technology (medium). We deconstruct the
   complicated relationships of platform governance on content in China and
   the United States by building a theoretical framework of dual-track
   governance of content and technology. China's mechanism of platform
   governance on content focuses more on content governance, while the U.S.
   focuses more on technology governance. China and the U.S. is dominated
   by the state and the market separately, forming the two mechanisms of
   ``Statism with Content Regulation First{''} and ``Marketism with
   Technology Governance First{''}, with four different characteristics.
   TikTok Path, following the ``Separation Principle{''} of content
   governance and technology governance, is a feasible approach for the
   platform company that attempts to go abroad to adapt to different or
   even conflicting governance contexts.},

Abstract = {How do leaders communicate during domestic crises? We provide the first
   global analysis of world leader communication on social media during
   social unrest. We develop a theory of leaders' digital communication
   strategies, building on the diversionary theory of foreign policy, as
   well as research on the role of democratic institutions in explaining
   elite responsiveness. To test our theory, we construct a new dataset
   that characterizes leader communication through social media posts
   published by any head of state or government on Twitter or Facebook,
   employing a combination of automated translation and supervised machine
   learning methods. Our findings show that leaders increase their social
   media activity and shift the topic from domestic to foreign policy
   issues during moments of social unrest, which is consistent with a
   conscious strategy to divert public attention when their position could
   be at risk. These effects are larger in democracies and in particular in
   the run-up to elections, which we attribute to incentives created by
   democratic institutions. Our results demonstrate how social media
   provide meaningful comparative insight into leaders' political behavior
   in the digital age.},

Abstract = {Objective The aim of this study is to examine how situational abortion
   attitudes differ when including additional context related to the
   gestational age of the pregnancy. Method Ordinary Least Squares
   Regression models predicting abortion attitudes across four different
   sets of abortion attitude questions, using data collected from an online
   panel weighted to match U.S. benchmarks. Results Later gestational ages
   are associated with less support for abortion. Although there is some
   variation in the amount that support decreases across different
   socio-demographic groups, the predictors of abortion attitudes remain
   relatively stable across gestational ages. Abortion attitudes questions
   with no reference to weeks' gestation appear to be the most similar to
   questions referencing early weeks' gestation. Conclusion When answering
   abortion attitude questions that do not include any reference to weeks'
   gestation, respondents may be more likely to think about abortion early
   in pregnancy. Including references to weeks' gestation may provide a
   more nuanced and complete understanding of abortion attitudes.},

Abstract = {Understanding the social dynamics of public opposition to religious
   symbols is a pressing issue. This research finds that stereotypes of how
   committed group members are to the national community shape support for
   the right to wear religious symbols in various settings. These social
   perceptions are particularly influential in determining support for the
   rights of Muslims to wear religious symbols. Drawing on data from a
   national survey experiment (N = 974) conducted in Canada, the results
   show Christians benefit from a particularly strong perceived commitment
   to the nation, while religious minorities are stereotyped as less
   committed and identified to the country than the average Canadian. As
   the perceived national commitment of religious minorities increases,
   however, the gap in support shown for the rights of Christians over
   religious minorities disappears and may lead to particularly strong
   support for the rights of Muslims to wear religious symbols in public
   when perceptions of national commitment are high.},

Abstract = {More than 75 women have successfully graduated from the U.S. Army Ranger
   Course since the integration of women into elite military combat
   training. This study sought to identify the psychological
   characteristics and sociological variables that contributed to their
   motivation and success. A guided interview and demographic and
   psychological questionnaires were used to assess characteristics of 13
   women who successfully completed elite military combat training.
   Collectively, these women were college graduates and had well educated
   fathers, possessed high levels of grit and resiliency, and described
   themselves as self-competitive challenge seekers. These women all had a
   strong male influence in their lives. The characteristics of these
   pioneer women may be unique from subsequent cohorts as female
   participation in elite military combat training becomes the norm and as
   attitudes and experiences change for graduates of female combat training
   over time.},

Title = {Neutrality and Equality Aspects in the EU State Aid Temporary Framework
   2020: The Case of the Airline Industry},
Journal = {TALTECH JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-122},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the restrictions
   imposed by the Member States (MSs) of the European Union (EU) led the
   tourism and commercial air transport industry to face serious financial
   difficulties that required airlines to apply for state support. In March
   2020, the European Commission adopted a State Aid Temporary Framework
   (TF) for the COVID-19 period to simplify the process of granting aid,
   allowing the MSs rapid economic interventions. Claims regarding the
   approval of State aid to certain airlines reached the EU General Court
   (EGC), on the grounds of violation of the fair competition principle. It
   became clear that the processes enabled by the TF dispensed unequal
   treatment to airline companies and that the flexibility of the TF
   created competition imbalances. In spite of these events, little
   attention has been given to the way its application ignores the
   requirements of EU State aid control and other procedural justice and
   fairness principles, by failing to ensure neutrality and equality. This
   article addresses the matter using a standard legal interpretive
   approach to explain the imbalances created by the regulation. It
   presents a systematic review of the current regime, identifies the TF
   inefficiencies affecting competition principles, and argues for specific
   adjustments that could enhance its transparency. These contributions are
   useful to improve the existing framework and help prepare for a better
   management of future crises.},

Abstract = {We employ regression analysis of 2017 survey data from 4,067
   Bangladeshis to exposit the lineaments of individual support for
   domestic Islamist violence. Our dependent variables derive from measures
   of public support for the stated goals and violent means of three
   Bangladeshi Islamist terrorist groups. Our study variables include
   participation in communal Friday prayer; indexed measures of other
   pietic practices; preferences for Shari'a and secularism; and gender. We
   include several well-established control variables. We find that
   participation in communal Friday prayers significantly correlates with
   diminished support for militant groups while having no effect upon
   support for their violent means. In four (of 10) models, we find that
   respondents who view Shari'a as being coterminous with scriptural
   literalism and harsh physical punishments are significantly more likely
   to support the groups' goals. Finally, we find women to be consistently
   more likely to support the goals and means of the militant groups.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the mode of environmentalism practiced by those
   not commonly included in studies of environmentalism. Key weaknesses in
   environmental identity literatures are identified: the unacknowledged
   discrepancy between the conceptualisations of researchers and their
   research participants; the overwhelming abstractness of current
   conceptualisations; and the occlusion of those environmental actors not
   covered by movement organisations or designated as activists. A novel
   approach is outlined, whereby environmentalism is perceived as an
   example of implicit religion. A thorough discussion of the study
   sampling is included to demonstrate the applicability of this approach.
   Following a critical analysis of the discourses of environmental
   alienation accessed by interviewees, this article outlines the likely
   negative impact on global environmentalism which may result. The
   conceptualisation of `practical stewardship' is offered to encompass a
   more inclusive notion of environmentalism.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, historians have played down the role of religion in
   colonial New South Wales. This article contributes to a bourgeoning
   scholarly literature that revises this position and deepens our
   understanding of the intellectual culture of colonial New South Wales.
   Through an examination of the colonial press and the work of public
   figures such as John Dunmore Lang, I argue that there was a robust
   debate about liberty of conscience in the first half of the nineteenth
   century. These discussions did not primarily stem from liberalism.
   Rather, advocates of liberty of conscience, across the religious and
   political spectrums, drew primarily upon the natural rights tradition of
   Christian thought which identified liberty of conscience as the
   archetype of a natural right. Advocates of this tradition were in
   dialogue with not only the British imperial world but also across the
   Atlantic, Ireland, and the United States.},

Abstract = {Using an actor-center approach, the present study sheds light on the
   intersection between populist communication and Facebook campaigns in
   the context of the 2019 general elections in Greece. Specifically, the
   study focuses on how populist actors in Greece campaigned on Facebook
   and examines their communicative performance in terms of user engagement
   in comparison with that of their opponents. For this purpose, a
   quantitative content analysis was performed by analyzing the Facebook
   posts published by populist and non-populist candidates over one week
   preceding the July 7 elections. Results suggest that candidates from
   populist parties, such as SYRIZA (Coalition of the Radical Left) and EL
   (Greek Solution), were outpaced by the mainstream New Democracy party
   that won the election. Moreover, significant differences are observed
   between populist and non-populist actors regarding the communication
   strategies utilized. Results suggest that different communication
   strategies have varying effects on user engagement depending on the
   populist identity of candidates, as well as their position in the
   left-right political spectrum. Several practical implications are
   proposed regarding the effective orchestration of Facebook campaigns by
   populist and non-populist actors.},

Abstract = {The ``protection-for-sale{''} motive introduced by Grossman and Helpman
   (Am Econ Rev 84: 833-850, 1994) has been adopted widely in the
   literature, but only a few papers test the theory empirically. To
   provide empirical evidence for the protection-for-sale theory, we
   proceed in three steps. First, we argue that among all existing
   theories, only the mechanism in the protection-for-sale theory depends
   on the government's political strength. Second, we develop a theoretical
   model to rationalize the connection between political strength and
   import tariffs. Our extended protection-for-sale model predicts that a
   government with greater political power generally imposes higher
   tariffs. Third, we propose that political strength can be proxied by the
   share of legislative seats held by the governing party or coalition. We
   test the model prediction using panel data covering 95 product
   categories and 105 countries, from 1996 to 2014. Our estimates provide
   support the protection-for-sale theory. The estimated effects of
   political strength on tariffs are larger in small and democratic
   countries.},

Title = {A shame of inches: Are teams with black head coaches more heavily
   penalized in Division 1 college football?},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {Background A popular line of media discourse has sought to provide
   explanations for college football's lack of diversity in the coaching
   ranks. A related effort has recently sought to explain why black coaches
   are faced with institutional barriers to success in athletic fields.
   While research on race and the sociology of sport has frequently focused
   on racial characteristics and expectations of players for on-field
   penalization, this literature neglected to examine racialized leadership
   positions such as coaching. Further, the vast majority of this line of
   literature that has examined racial leadership has explored the effects
   of race on hiring and promotion decisions off the field rather than
   on-field dynamics. Objective This article fills this gap by exploring
   the relationship between the race of college football coaches and the
   level of on-field penalization their teams incur. Are teams coached by
   black coaches more heavily penalized than those coaches by non-black
   coaches? Methods Using data from a merged unique data set and a two-step
   approach comprising two statistical procedures, we explore this question
   empirically. We first examine the mean levels of penalties at the game
   level using a comparison of means, followed by a panel analysis of
   penalties at the yearly-school level. Results In our comparison of means
   across all games played between white and black coaches in the 2019/2020
   college football season, we find that black coaches are more heavily
   penalized than white coaches in terms of both penalties per game as well
   as penalty yardage. Findings of our longitudinal analysis covering all
   Division 1 college football teams from the college football playoff era
   (2014/2015 season until the 2019/2020 season) reveal that teams coached
   by black coaches receive more penalties per game than do teams coached
   by non-black coaches. Conclusion To conclude, we discuss implications
   for these findings and suggest ameliorative prescriptions to combat bias
   in college sports. We contextualize our findings within the context of
   racialized organizational processes in college sports.},

Abstract = {We use experimental data to explore the conditions under which males and
   females may differ in their tendency to act corruptly and their
   tolerance of corruption. We ask if males and females respond differently
   to the tradeoff between the benefits accrued by corrupt actors versus
   the negative externality imposed on other people by corruption. Our
   findings reveal that neither males nor females uniformly are more likely
   to engage in, or be more tolerant of corruption: it depends on the exact
   bribery conditions-which can reduce or enhance welfare overall-and the
   part played in the bribery act. Females are less likely to tolerate and
   engage in corruption when doing so reduces overall welfare. On the other
   hand, males are less tolerant of bribery when it enhances welfare but
   confers payoff disadvantages on them relative to corrupt actors.
   Females' behavior is consistent across roles when bribery reduces
   welfare, but apart from that, gender behavior is strongly
   role-dependent.},

Abstract = {Although the last two decades have seen a concerted effort to understand
   the role and place of African journalism in covering events on the
   continent, there has been little focus on who journalists chose to quote
   as sources in their stories. This despite scholarship on sources being
   vital to our understanding of how journalists gain the ``raw
   materials{''} to produce stories about events. Thus, while scholarship
   has begun taking Africa's coverage of itself seriously, there has been a
   slower uptick in focusing on whom African journalists give voice to as
   co-constructors of events. This silence is even more perplexing,
   considering that scholars and observers have been critical of who is
   quoted as a source when the global north covers events unfolding in
   Africa. This paper shows that African suffering was made legible for
   African audiences through a combination of American, English, and
   Sudanese voices. Specifically, it finds that African journalists are
   -counterintuitively - vital players in silencing some African voices in
   their construction of knowledge about the atrocities in Darfur. Despite
   the criticism leveled at journalism fields in the global north over
   their perceived silencing of African voices, African journalists are
   similarly engaged in this silencing as well.},

Title = {Forest crisis narratives: Illegal logging, datafication and the
   conservation frontier in the Romanian Carpathian Mountains},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {96},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Environmental crisis narratives escalate around the world. Their
   production and consequences demand scholarly attention. Drawing on the
   analytical tools of political ecology and highlighting long-term
   historical developments, this article examines the shift to a new
   narrative of conservation in forestry, which displaces older structures
   of state forest management. In particular, we explore the emergence and
   unfolding of a crisis narrative of illegal logging, which escalated in
   Romania in the last thirty years. Based on long-term research of digital
   sources, interviews and fieldwork, we analyze the contents of this
   narrative, the way it produced heroes and villains, and its
   entanglements with processes of datafication, criminalization, and the
   surge of forest violence. We argue that (1) the genealogies of the
   forest crisis narrative can be understood in relation to
   frontier-specific processes of deregulation and re-territorialization,
   which generate acute struggles for forest control and legitimacy; (2)
   the narrative of illegal logging unravells as a media spectacle
   surrounding the production of data by a plurality of state and non-state
   actors (3) in the attempts to curtail illegal logging, the emphasis on
   law, surveillance and criminalization posits forest conservation one
   step short of militarization, fuelling the trends for global
   environmental law enforcement and securitization of conservation.},

Abstract = {The changes in the global neoliberal order leading up to the 2008
   financial crisis shaped individual countries' political-administrative
   transformations. One of the most important trends in politics since then
   has been the (re)centralization of scalar politics. Urban
   financialization, which was proposed as a solution for the economic
   contraction in the post-crisis era, required fast and centralized
   decision-making without leaving much room for citizen participation and
   local variation. Turkey is a case in point for this global trend. Amid
   such rapid urban growth, we identify two parallel processes that weaken
   the local institutions and localized development in Turkey: the shifting
   of decision-making powers from municipalities to central state organs,
   especially with regard to the real estate industry; and the shifting of
   decision-making powers from the elected members of the city councils to
   the mayors themselves. We attempt to demonstrate the (re)centralization
   of urban decision-making process in Turkey by looking at the decisions
   and the processes within which those decisions were taken at Ankara
   Metropolitan Municipality City Council between 2014 and 2016. We argue
   that the rise of neoliberal authoritarianism is reinforced by the
   centralization of urban decision-making processes.},

Abstract = {Using data from 225 cantonal government elections over the 1980-2019
   period in Switzerland, we estimate the effect of fiscal performance on
   the vote share of finance ministers seeking re-election. Our estimations
   show that finance ministers benefit statistically and electorally from
   balancing fiscal accounts and presenting budget surpluses. Improving the
   fiscal balance by 1000 Swiss francs per inhabitant in the pre-election
   year raises the electoral result of a finance minister by 1.4-5.4
   percentage points from the vote share of her previous election. We
   present evidence for politician-specific monitoring: the finance
   minister-in contrast to the spending ministers-seems to be the sole
   member of government who benefits, electorally, from debt reduction.
   Correcting for possible selection phenomena, our results suggest that
   the electoral effect of fiscal performance may not be caused by a
   selection bias but rather by the office of the finance ministry itself.},

Abstract = {Online media environments have changed the way young people access news.
   Despite much research on the topic, the expectations of journalistic
   news by young adults who have turned their back on traditional news
   media remain unclear. We use a novel multimethod qualitative online
   study design to investigate the perceived quality, functions, and
   expectations toward journalistic news of young adults in Switzerland who
   use social media as their main source for news and rarely consume
   traditional media. Nineteen young adults between 20 and 25 years of age
   with different educational levels participated in our study in May 2020.
   Our results show that even though the participants only occasionally use
   traditional news media channels, they still consider journalistic news
   relevant and appreciate quality standards of professional journalism
   such as actuality and veracity (Swart 2021b). Among the functions of
   news, the participants highlighted sociability and identification.
   Exchange and discussion of news are, thus, of high relevance online but
   also offline. Also, the participants show a high affinity toward news on
   mobilizing topics, which are of interest to themselves and their peers,
   and motivate them to engage with news more intensely. According to the
   participants, news should be attractively prepared, such as with
   audiovisual formats and easy to understand and integrate into everyday
   life. The participants also expressed a preference to consume news
   articles from different media brands within a single platform. Our study
   outlines a fruitful path for comprehensive qualitative research with
   innovative online tools.},

Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The article interrogates the different ways in which exiled researchers,
   who have migrat-ed from the field of uncertainty created by the
   authoritarian regime to the field of pre-cariousness created by
   extensive marketization, address the issue of displacement in these two
   different fields of uncertainty. The first part of the article will
   elucidate how displacement turns into a transformative experience of
   loss, which is the starting point and direction of movement. In the
   second part, the tensions in the processes of exiled re-searchers
   seeking scholarship and writing in order to continue their careers
   through problematising the displacement that they themselves now
   experience. Following sec-tion aims thematising by an insider's look at
   their efforts to overcome marginalising or exclusionary attitudes that
   emerge through internalized patterns about the experience of being
   exiled and displacement, and to resettle. In short, how exiled
   academics' own ex-periences are reflected in their academic production
   and professions on the axes of gen-der and precarity can be summarized
   as the problematic on which the article proceeds.},

Title = {Do dictators signal strength with electoral fraud?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {What role does electoral fraud play in nondemocracies? In this paper, we
   offer an empirical test of a popular idea that authoritarian governments
   use elections to engineer overwhelming victories with electoral fraud
   thus deterring potential opposition from challenging the regime. Using
   the data from the Russian Parliamentary elections in 2011 and a
   regionally representative public opinion survey, we find that the
   geographical allocation of electoral manipulation was the opposite of
   what the theory would imply: more manipulation happened in the areas
   where the regime was more popular. We also find that higher margins of
   victory for a pro-regime party failed to deter subsequent mass protests.
   We argue that these empirical patterns could be better explained by
   other mechanisms, such as Bayesian persuasion, efficient allocation, and
   information gathering.},

Abstract = {Equating the U.S. government with the national government, historians of
   the AIDS epidemic have hitherto ignored the role of the states in
   shaping the early policy response to the disease. Responding to this
   historiographical lacuna, this article argues that California acted as a
   policy innovator during the initial years of the epidemic, intervening
   more effectively than the federal government in the areas of AIDS health
   care, antibody testing, and prevention education. California's policy
   leadership drew significant impetus from a group of gay policy makers,
   who entered state employment in the early 1980s and relied extensively
   on clandestine and illicit strategies, particularly a network of
   ``closeted{''} bureaucrats. Charting the career arcs of these gay policy
   makers shines a spotlight on the organizational growth of state LGBTQ
   groups in the 1980s and the evolving role of the ``closet{''} in the
   modern gay rights movement.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article will be to show how the rebels established
   the doctrine of not taking prisoners in anti-guerrilla areas since the
   summer of 1936. A strategy that became the basis for Franco???s
   counterinsurgency until 1952, when the Republican guerrilla was finally
   defeated. To analyze these questions I will use the specialized
   bibliography and a series of unpublished documents. The documentation
   generated by the guerrilla groups and the own experience of the
   partisans, their links and the civilian population has shown that the
   application of ??la ley de fugas?? between had the objective of not
   taking prisoners. However, the discovery of various orders and
   communications from the rebel Army and the dictatorship confirms that
   the rebels planned in detail the dirty war that was deployed against the
   guerrillas and the population living in the irregular theater of
   operations.},

Title = {`Theses on Economic Policy': A Document from the Verkhne-Uralsk

Journal = {HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},

Pages = {199-208},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis, and introduces the publication,
   of one of the texts of the documentary complex `The Verkhne-Uralsk
   Political Isolator Notebooks' the `Theses on Economic Policy' of 1933.
   The article (DOI: 10.1163/1569206X-00002252) covers the history of the
   discovery of this complex of documents reflecting the ideological and
   political life of imprisoned members of the Opposition of the Bolshevik
   Leninists (Trotskyists) in the early 1930s, and discusses the context of
   their creation. On the basis of archival materials, the biography of one
   of the authors of the Theses the agricultural economist, and a member of
   the Siberian opposition centre, F.P. Sasorov - is reconstructed. It is
   noted that Sasorov held a special position among the Bolshevik
   Leninists, determined by his economic views. He belonged to the current
   whose adherents were called `neo-Nepists' by their opponents. This
   current advocated not just a return to the NEP cancelled by Stalin, but
   also an expansion of its scope, and this position is presented and
   argued for in the `Theses on Economic Policy'. A comparison of the views
   of Sasorov and his co-author G.A., stated in the Theses, including on
   the explanation of the crisis and the liquidation of the NEP, the policy
   of out-and-out collectivisation and forced industrialisation, with the
   views of Leon Trotsky, allows us to conclude that the thought of the
   imprisoned oppositionists developed independently, and not always in
   accordance with the guidelines of their exiled thought leader. The
   article also examines the forecasts of the development of the economic
   and socio-political situation in the USSR presented in the Theses.},

Abstract = {In recent years, far-right actors and movements have become a growing
   field of scientific research. The specific challenges of this political
   spectrum have led to a number of inter- disciplinary debates on
   methodology and ethics. In this context, questions concerning a critical
   distance in research have played a crucial role since there is a
   constant risk of an involuntary reproduction and thus amplification of
   far-right ideology. The article `The Transnationalization of
   Ethno-nationalism: The Case of the Identitarian Movement' by Petra
   Mlejnkova (published in Intersections) illustrates these pitfalls. It
   shows the conse- quences of a lack of reflexivity when approaching
   far-right activism. As a result, the author's findings appear rather
   one-sided when contrasted with critical debates on far right ideology
   and current methodological discussions. Moreover, the presentation of
   the results creates the impression of, at least implicit, empathy
   towards the Identitarian Movement.' This, in turn, shows the risk of
   scientific research turning unintentionally into a (discursive) ally of
   the far-right and promoting ideologies of inequality.},

Title = {The first Francoist political police for the last republican cities: The
   SIPM Special Detachments (January-September 1939)},
Journal = {HISTORIA Y POLITICA},
Year = {2022},
Number = {47},
Pages = {27-57},
Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the Special Detachments that the Military Police
   and Information Service (SIPM), the Francoist military intelligence
   agency, established during the first third of 1939. Its function was to
   manage the occupations of the last large Republican cities from the
   police and repressive sphere. They arose from the military practice
   during the process of control of these modern urban spaces, which meant
   an unprecedented experiment for the invading troops. In the first place,
   they were in charge of reorganizing the networks of the different
   clandestine organizations of ambush sympathizers that awaited them in
   inside. That is to say, to reorganize the Fifth Column, whose staff was
   the only one tacitly purged by having collaborated with the rebel
   intelligence services during the previous months, if not years. Second,
   they deployed the incipient police tasks from the immediate occupation
   to the establishment of the dictatorial administration in those places.
   This research is based empirically and mainly on the documentation
   generated by the SIPM itself, today kept in the General Military Archive
   of Avila. Other files from different documentary centers are added to
   it. They allow us to affirm that these Special Detachments were the
   first Francoist political police in Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia and
   Cartagena. Also that their presence led to numerous internal conflicts
   for the management and control of urban public order with many other
   institutions created or commissioned for this purpose. And, finally,
   that its exist-ence blurs, even more if possible, the boundary between
   the war and the postwar period.},

Abstract = {Has the recent illiberal surge altered the neoliberal orthodoxy
   prevailing in post-1989 Hungary and Poland towards a more developmental
   modus operandi, or has it just camouflaged embedded neoliberalism with a
   developmental narrative? This article, trying to contribute to answering
   the aforementioned question, is structured as follows. First, we provide
   a general overview of the comparative capitalism approach. We extend the
   original conceptualizations by the framework of varieties of illiberal
   capitalism and present two ideal types of illiberal capitalism. Then, we
   assess five institutional areas of the political economy of contemporary
   Hungary and Poland. We conclude that although Hungary remains faithful
   to the neoliberal economic orthodoxy so far with illiberal political
   forces merely camouflaging its true essence due to political and
   utilitarian reasons, the post-2015 government in Poland managed to move
   its economic model closer to a more developmental modus operandi.},

Abstract = {This article examines the attitude of the Polish elite towards the
   Napoleonic legislation at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Based
   on the primary sources - such as letters, reports, and memoirs - it
   seeks to prove that this attitude was not as hostile as is commonly
   believed. From a broader perspective, the article challenges the
   assumption that the integration of the Napoleonic periphery into the
   Empire was limited and that the Napoleonic legal project was doomed to
   failure.},

Title = {Trust among the poor: African Americans trust their neighbors, but are
   less trusting of public officials},
Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},
Year = {2023},

Number = {3-4, SI},

Abstract = {Many studies document a decline in citizens' interpersonal trust and
   trust in the US government, particularly among African Americans.
   Furthermore, survey research consistently shows that African Americans
   exhibit some of the lowest levels of trust in the US population. Trust
   is essential for understanding the relationship between African
   Americans and government, such as the impacts of documented criminal
   justice disparities for low-income minorities. Using a lab-in-the-field
   experiment, we study a behavioral measure of trust, targeting a
   population of low-income African Americans in an urban US zip code with
   a disproportionately high level of law enforcement for low-level
   offenses (e.g., disorderly conduct). In the incentivized trust games, we
   vary the characteristics of the matched counterpart (i.e., a public
   official or a neighbor). Contrary to the existing survey evidence, we
   see that African Americans' levels of interpersonal trust and
   trustworthiness in the game are considerably higher than a college
   student sample. However, trust in and trustworthiness toward local
   public officials is significantly lower than trust among neighbors. We
   conclude that the poor may be more trusting than inferred previously
   from conventional survey data, but that trust does not carry over to
   government officials.},

Abstract = {China's geoeconomic assertiveness through the Belt and Road Initiative
   and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has a significant impact on
   countries in various parts of the world, and India is one of the major
   countries that have received complicated influences from such
   assertiveness. This article aims to examine India's strategic response
   to China's increasing geoeconomic presence in South Asia and the Indian
   Ocean Region. It argues that India has adopted policy options of
   confrontation and practical cooperation through risk management amid
   China's growing geoeconomic presence, and has pursued a multi-pronged
   engagement, aimed at not taking sides between the United States and
   China and securing `strategic autonomy'. These policy options
   contributed, as a hedging strategy, to defending and enhancing its
   dominant regional status in uncertain geostrategic politics.
   Additionally, India has pursued a hedging-oriented ideational strategy
   of diluting the confrontational nature of the US-led Indo-Pacific
   strategy and advancing its ideational vision for the Indo-Pacific.},

Abstract = {While the scholarship on volumetric territory is now gaining momentum,
   our knowledge of the in-betweens of spheres is still limited. This paper
   studies the voluminous territory through a new lens: the deep interface
   as a destabilizing ontology that invites, enables and disciplines
   movements across the different spheres. The conceptualization of the
   deep interface unfolds in three layers: (1) an effective territory that
   treats territory as formed by the mobility of disruptive object-spaces;
   (2) a deep interface constituted by a series of gates distributed in
   various spheres for the succession of a relay along particular paths;
   and (3) the striation of smooth space by imposing the `royal science' on
   the moving things, translating voluminous space to be a vector of
   political-rational calculations. Tracing the moving aeroplane as the
   disruptive object-space, we demonstrate how the three gates of the Air
   Silk Road scheme, Dara Sakor Airport and the mangrove forests constitute
   a deep interface after the construction of their interdependence by
   instantly allied forces.},

Title = {Exploring macroeconomic imbalances through EU Alert Mechanism Reports},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {75},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The present paper examines the European Commission's decisions to issue
   warrants for in-depth reviews of countries after they have manifested
   signs of macroeconomic imbalances. The analysis carried out can be
   differentiated from its predecessors by its focus on past decisions to
   perform indepth reviews and the associated weakly behavioral, political,
   and institutional factors, which, even though lying outside the scope of
   the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP) Scoreboard, may,
   nevertheless, affect warrant considerations. Thus, this analysis
   endeavors to identify potential additional determinants of the
   decision-making process underlying Alert Mechanism Reports (AMRs). To
   achieve this goal, binary choice models have been used to analyze panel
   data on EU member states constructed from the initial ten rounds of the
   MIP. Apart from the expected impact of indicators obtained from the
   AMRs, the analysis has not provided a sufficient amount of robust and
   conclusive evidence which would confirm the effect of any specific
   additional determinant from those that were examined. Factors that
   showed notable indications of an effect were concurrent reports implying
   a country-specific economic crisis, positive political preferences
   within the country toward the EU, and the perceived level of regulatory
   quality.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis research investigates the impact of collaboration and
   trust on disaster resilience, conducting a comparative analysis among
   groups of the public, experts, and public officials. MethodsThis
   research employs the 2017 National Survey on Emergency Management,
   conducted by the Korean Institute of Public Administration. Using a
   random quota-sampling method, data were collected from a total of 1800
   citizens, 200 public officials, and 56 experts through an online system.
   The study compares the impact of public trust in government on
   organizational resilience perceived by experts, citizens, and public
   officials, employing hierarchical regression analysis. ResultsThe
   analysis results are as follows: First, in the case of citizens, it was
   suggested that government trust and collaboration have a positive effect
   on disaster resilience. Second, in the case of experts, it was suggested
   that government trust and collaboration have a positive effect on
   disaster resilience. Third, in the case of public officials, it was
   suggested that government trust and collaboration have a positive effect
   on disaster resilience.},

Abstract = {After South Asia won its flag-independence from Britain, Pakistani
   artists pursued two distinct strategies for the shared goal of producing
   art in the service of national liberation. A group of communist artists
   sought to innovate new cultural forms to serve movements of the left,
   while others endeavoured to recover the pre-colonial Islamicate culture
   of South Asia to serve state-building efforts. During the Zia coup in
   1977, protest poetry and art of the Pak Tea House, Lahore's art and
   literary salon, inspired resistance against the military dictatorship.
   This protest was framed not merely against the military dictatorship,
   but also against US imperialism more broadly. By examining Walter
   Rodney's and Frantz Fanon's ideal role of the postcolonial artist or
   intellectual, I show how the role of art in leftist politics was
   rethought in the aftermath of the Zia coup by the artists and leftists
   who frequented the Pak Tea House. What the discussions about politically
   engaged art that took place in the Pak Tea House during the Zia Coup
   reveal is that novelty and abstraction are important strategies in
   creating art that can combat imperialist dictatorships.},

   stance towards datafication; they either consider data as a political
   issue or employ it to advance desirable social change. This article
   investigates activists' data epistemologies in a twofold manner. First,
   it poses the question of how activists can simultaneously use a certain
   dataset while questioning its credibility. Second, the article explores
   how activists' data epistemology transforms other domains of
   socio-political grassroots interventions. To answer these questions, I
   turn to the case of the DTP Map - an interactive geoweb map of traffic
   accidents in Russia made by activists using the official governmental
   data. Turning to the concept of contentious data politics, I demonstrate
   how the project transforms by continuously dealing with the data's
   epistemologically ambiguous nature. In their data practices aimed at
   gaining and maintaining the users' trust, activists have tried to ensure
   their project will be employed by various collectives for the common
   goal of reducing traffic accidents in Russia. Their data practices can
   be considered both a repertoire of social change and a stake of activist
   intervention. Crucially, in the process of map-making, activists do not
   gain the epistemologically unambiguous view of data but rather they
   manage to retain this ambiguity and make it a constitutive part of their
   project.},

Abstract = {In countries with high levels of corruption, ruling elites rarely have
   an interest in meaningful anticorruption reforms. Thus, within state
   structures, the opposition is often key in controlling the government.
   At the same time, no state body has wider jurisdiction than parliament.
   Therefore, empowering the opposition to inquire into corruption (and
   other) scandals is a key factor in an integrity system. The German
   system of strong opposition rights in collecting evidence through
   parliamentary inquiry committees has been a unique selling point by
   global comparison until 2014, when it was emulated by Austria. An
   analysis of the 63 inquiry committees of the Bundestag since 1949 shows
   that a significant share concerned corruption cases. Had it not been for
   parliamentary inquiries, most of these cases would have remained without
   any follow-up by a state institution. In stark contrast to this finding,
   international anticorruption guidance more or less entirely ignores
   inquiry committees.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {74},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Political tenure (experience) is a double-edged sword: expediting
   government performance, while increasing political power with
   potentially harmful (corruption) ramifications. Within a
   voters-politician interaction framework, I unravel these two effects of
   political tenure on voters' welfare and examine how term limits affect
   these relations. It is shown that the key factors affecting the
   tenure-welfare relation are the learning curve of incumbents in
   conducting their regular task (public goods provision) and the learning
   curve of opportunistic incumbents in becoming effective embezzlers. I
   find that stricter term limits increase the frequency of corruption
   incidents but reduce the expected cost per incident. The expected cost
   of corruption is shown to depend on three factors which respond
   differently to term limits. Implications for policies aimed at reducing
   corruption are discussed.},

   abound, but there is no systematic normative treatment of the issue.
   This article argues that an important normative principle that governs
   domestic military use is that citizens ought not to be treated as
   enemies. Using examples drawn from the United States, it shows that
   apart from any instrumental considerations such as fears of military
   coups and excessive violence, domestic military use is prohibited in
   principle when it relates to citizens as enemies. To treat citizens as
   enemies undermines their standing as members of the state's political
   community, and so violates governments' duty to not commit expressive
   harms against them. This principle has implications for current dilemmas
   regarding domestic military use, as well as militarized domestic law
   enforcement. The latter gain the normative commitments of militaries as
   they militarize, and in so doing lose permissions to operate
   domestically.},

Abstract = {Personal carbon trading is a downstream cap-and-trade system for GHG
   emissions that targets households. This alternative to a carbon tax is
   present in the public debate in France, in various forms. Based on the
   existing scientific literature, the article discusses what can be
   expected of personal carbon trading along five dimensions: environmental
   effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, equity, operational feasibility and
   acceptability. It systematically compares the properties of personal
   carbon trading with those of a carbon tax and with those claimed by its
   proponents. In terms of equity, the two instruments have similar
   opportunities, despite what has been claimed. The environmental
   effectiveness of personal carbon trading, which is often emphasised, is
   not decisive, while the shortcomings of quotas trading are
   underestimated. Personal carbon trading can raise the visibility of GHG
   emissions to individuals. The effects of this interesting feature are
   still uncertain.},

Title = {A proxy geopolitics of poppies, peasants, and national sovereignty
   Turkey's rhetorical resistance to America's war on drugs},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {98},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Nixon's self-declared war on drugs has been underway for over five
   decades. Not all aspects are well known, and many voices of those
   touched by the campaign were and remain unheard. In the early 1970s, the
   Turkish re-public faced a political crisis. The military installed a
   post-coup leadership that acquiesced to longstanding American demands to
   halt all cultivation of the opium poppy. This was the first sustained
   battle in Nixon's war, and it had socio-economically devastating
   consequences for Anatolian peasants who had for generations farmed the
   crop for licit and illicit markets. To many Turkish citizens, the ban
   was the result of a new stage in Western imperialism and a direct
   consequence of their own leaders' failure to protect the country's rural
   poor majority, on the one hand, and their surrender of national
   sovereignty, on the other hand. Farmers' voices were rarely heard on
   this issue, apart from brief quotes in newspapers and in domestic and
   foreign governmental studies, but their plight attracted sustained
   popular attention due in part to the proxy geopolitics articulated on
   their behalf. Before the recently disenfranchised parliament that did
   not permit sustained discussion or debate of the poppy question, MPs
   nonetheless rendered impromptu testimonies protesting the ban, its
   impacts on farmers, the suppression of democracy, and nation's loss of
   sovereignty. Through an analysis of Turkey's parliamentary re-cord and
   other contemporary sources, I approach this crucial episode in the
   histories of intoxicants and the war on drugs. In so doing, I
   demonstrate the potential and seeming success of proxy geopolitics
   echoed on behalf of a marginalized people and why engagement with such
   sources is essential in the wider practice of critical geopolitics.},

Abstract = {We study the impact of refugee inflows on voter turnout in Sweden in a
   period when shifting immigration patterns made the previously
   homogeneous country increasingly heterogeneous. Analyzing
   individual-level panel data and exploiting a national refugee placement
   program to obtain plausibly exogenous variation in immigration, we find
   that refugee inflows significantly raise the probability of voter
   turnout. Balancing tests on initial turnout as well as placebo tests
   regressing changes in turnout on future refugee inflows support the
   causal interpretation of our findings. The results are consistent with
   group-threat theory, which predicts that increased out-group presence
   spurs political mobilization among in-group members.},

Abstract = {Objective We investigate the influence of social contexts on democratic
   attitudes. Methods We use a novel survey data set with data from a
   nationally representative sample of Polish residents (egos) and their
   friends and acquaintances (alters). Results Controlling for several
   factors defined on the ego- and alter-levels, we find a positive
   relationship between alters' and ego's endorsement of democracy over
   nondemocratic alternatives. This effect is stronger the higher the
   number of close friends and acquaintances and when all friends know each
   other. Conclusion We find a positive relationship between the average
   preference of democracy in the social context and an individual
   endorsement of democracy. Confirmed moderators of this relationship may
   be cautiously interpreted as measuring the degree to which the context
   structures political communication between egos and alters.},

Abstract = {This article critically describes and compares intraregional
   geopolitical imaginaries as they appear in the official discourses of
   two groups of states in EUrope: Soft Eurosceptic discourse of Hungary
   and Poland vs. Europhile discourse of France and Germany. The analysis
   is carried out through application of pragmatic analysis and language
   games analysis of official speeches of the leading politicians of these
   states delivered in the year 2018 on the theme of `Future of Europe'.
   The theoretical framework of Rule-oriented Constructivism and the
   analytical framework of Critical Geopolitics guide this research. This
   research complements existing literature on geopolitical imaginaries
   highlighting the importance of linguistic practices, spatial
   understandings and intersubjective spaces in EUropean integration.},

Abstract = {Background A set of `New Culture Wars' over questions of majority
   identity protection and free speech have become important in American
   politics, but have not received attention from empirical political
   science Objective Compare the relative size of partisan differences on
   issues of `Cancel Culture' and `Critical Race Theory'. Method Logistic
   regression models using attitudes toward real-world Cancel Culture and
   Critical Race Theory examples to predict partisanship. Results Data show
   that Republican voters are no more likely to fear career consequences or
   dismissal for speech than Democrats. Republicans are also more opposed
   to teaching critical perspectives on race and history in schools than
   they are to employees being fired for dissenting speech within
   organizations. Strong white identifiers are both more opposed to
   diversity training which emphasizes white racism and less opposed to
   firing people for disputed cases of racist or sexist speech. Conclusion
   Due to the distinctive moral foundations of conservative voters, this
   paper argues that perceived attacks on white and American identity are a
   more powerful source of grievance for Republican voters than concerns
   over freedom of expression. It is hypothesized that the conservative
   moral foundation of group loyalty helps to explain these findings.},

Abstract = {Research indicates that when mainstream news media report about
   demonstrations, protesters often face delegitimizing coverage. This
   phenomenon, known as the ``(journalistic) protest paradigm,{''} is
   thought to be a default mindset that leads journalists to emphasize the
   method of protesters over their message. However, empirical work has so
   far limited itself to specific protest movements or events and only
   covers brief periods. This study first identifies and then codes the
   main frames in all reports about domestic protest in the United Kingdom.
   Analysing data that covers eight national newspapers during a 26 year
   period (N = 27,496), I provide a more systematic understanding of how
   the mainstream news media in liberal democracies report about protests.
   The analysis shows that a stable majority of articles uses frames linked
   to the protest paradigm throughout the time period. However, a
   substantial and growing number of articles employ legitimizing
   frames-either on their own or co-existing with delegitimizing framing.},

Abstract = {This research investigates the nexus between environmental compliance,
   innovation, and Total Factor Productivity convergence. We use two
   measures of environmental practices: the firm environmental standard
   certification and environmental treatment. As for innovation, it has
   three increasing-levels: no innovation, product or process innovation,
   and both types of innovation. Using a sample of Vietnamese small- and
   medium-sized manufacturing enterprises from 2007 to 2015, the
   environmental practices are not correlated with total factor
   productivity. By contrast, there is a strong correlation between
   innovation and environmental treatment. Factors contributing to the firm
   productivity growth rate, and consequently the speed of convergence, are
   innovation, firm size, and legal form.},

   parent's likelihood of participating in politics. Methods Logistic
   regression analysis and exact matching of data from the November 2010
   and November 2014 Current Population Surveys. Conditional, fixed-effects
   logistic reygression analysis of data from the 2010-2014 Cooperative
   Congressional Election Study Panel Survey. Results Cross-sectional
   regressions and exact-matching results indicate a negative relationship
   between becoming a parent and numerous forms of political participation,
   including voter turnout. However, recognizing potential threats to
   causal inference, analyses that leverage panel data and sensitivity
   analysis applied to the exact-matching estimates provide weaker support
   for a causal claim. Conclusion The introduction of a child into a
   household appears to be associated with attenuated parental civic
   engagement in the near term, but the evidence provides weaker support
   for a causal claim.},

Abstract = {Objective Various shirking behaviors in survey-taking can inhibit
   researchers' ability to draw unbiased inferences from the resulting
   data. We define three types of shirking behavior, identify their
   demographic correlates among survey respondents, show how shirking may
   lead to biased or incorrect inferences, and offer suggestions for
   navigating these threats. Methods We analyze responses from a large
   (N=3,256), representative survey of Americans, identify indicators of
   three types of shirking, and regress these indicators on survey firm
   administrative data on respondent characteristics to discover the
   respondent characteristics associated with different shirking types.
   Results The data suggest women are more likely to break off during a
   survey, while men are more likely to shirk while completing the
   instrument. In addition, young, less educated respondents are more
   likely to use straight-lining or other satisficing tactics. Conclusion
   Systematic differences in shirking behaviors across these demographic
   groups make us likely to misunderstand the (reported) social behavior of
   women and men, young and old, or more and less educated, indifferent
   ways. This is particularly problematic for testing behavioral theories
   that generate gender, age, or education-specific predictions, or,
   predictions regarding attitudes or behaviors that strongly correlated to
   these characteristics.},

Abstract = {Objective Can we gain insight into the outcomes of presidential
   elections, and their determinants, other than through opinion polling or
   prediction markets? This matters because of recent misses in polling and
   the contestation of the 2020 election beyond Election Day. Methods Using
   alternative generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity
   models, we conduct an event study of two U.S. private prison companies,
   whose valuations have depended on their being awarded federal contracts,
   during the 2020 campaign and afterward. Results Comparison around
   Election Day of changes in prison company stock prices based on these
   models and in the predicted probability of President Trump being
   reelected based on a popular prediction market allows inference of the
   effects of the January 6 incident at the U.S. Capitol and the Biden
   inauguration on the subjective probability that Trump would retain
   power. Conclusion The probability of Trump retaining power that was
   reflected in asset markets remained positive up to the Biden
   inauguration-a real-time indication of the fragility of American

Abstract = {For autocrats ruling over religious populations as in many Muslim
   majority countries, threats of mass collective action and religious
   mobilization are risky to ignore, being potentially detrimental to
   authoritarian survival. Religious seasons, such as Ramadan, could raise
   the seriousness of such threats. Accordingly, incumbents might adopt
   expansionary fiscal policies to avoid the escalation of political
   discontent at these times. Focusing on Egypt's fiscal policy between
   2006 and 2019, I find that although the religious season of Ramadan is
   associated with modest increases in government expenditure and welfare
   spending, this relationship is dependent on the level of political
   threats facing the regime. Government spending is higher in Ramadan's
   season when it is preceded by more episodes of anti-regime collective
   action. This evidence suggests that the interaction between the
   religious and political contexts could generate political budget cycles
   outside electoral seasons.},

Abstract = {The ability to hold MPs accountable for their actions is one of the
   cornerstones of modern representative democracy. While it is important
   for MPs to send signals to both their constituents and to their party, a
   large number of MPs remain absent from votes. Those absences are an
   important part of the MP's toolbox, but absences carry limitations,
   rooted in electoral and political constraints. We investigate
   how-conditional on the electoral cycle-some well-established political
   constraints along the government and opposition lines vary in strength.
   We examine the absence probabilities of MPs in the United Kingdom from
   1997 to 2015, and find that as the next elections are approaching,
   political constraints somewhat weaken and electoral ones take over, but
   marked differences emerge between parliamentary sessions.},

Abstract = {The article describes when and in what form the term ???monopoly???
   appeared in theory. First, attention is paid to A. Smith???s classical
   political economy and the neoclassical binary model of competition and
   monopoly presented by A. Marshall. Robinson???s model of imperfect
   competition and Chamberlin???s model of monopolistic competition of 1933
   were turning points in economic theory. The article not only highlights
   the elements that were adopted from Marshall and Pigou of the Cambridge
   Neoclassical School and are common to both theories, but also emphasizes
   the aspects in which the approaches of Robinson and Chamberlin differ
   and highlights their contribution to economic theory and competition

Abstract = {The article deals with the fate of the first governor of the
   Czechoslovak Central Bank after World War II. It analyses his economic
   thinking and the sources that influenced it. The text sees him as deeply
   rooted in non-liberal Central European tradition but with a strong
   impact of Anglo-Saxon economics of the interwar period. The article also
   explores his contribution to the transition of the Czechoslovak economy
   to Soviet-type central planning and proves the hypothesis that his
   influence was much smaller than existing literature indicates.},

Title = {The Making of Tamazgha in France: Territorialities of an Amazigh
   Diaspora-Assemblage},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {1262-1284},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {This article uses an account of the Amazigh/Berber (pl. Imazighen)
   diaspora in France to demonstrate how approaching diaspora using
   assemblage thinking can help us to understand its emergent
   territorialities. It argues that the discourses and practices of
   association members frame the spaces of `Tamazgha' (the `land of the
   Imazighen'), at the same time as framing the internal and external
   boundaries of the diaspora itself. Using assemblage thinking alongside
   theoretical tools from social movement theory and the study of
   nationalism, this article underlines how the diaspora comes into being
   through emergent relationships between human and non-human actors.
   Drawing on recent fieldwork, it outlines how ideas of Amazigh nationhood
   have developed and continue to develop in the process of this
   diaspora-assemblage, rather than simply arising from either a putative
   traditional `homeland', state institutions, or being the invention of a
   purely intellectual or political project. Beginning with the ideal of a
   unified pan-Amazigh imaginative geography of `Tamazgha', the Amazigh
   diaspora's territorialities are now becoming more fragmented and
   regionally specific. As the Amazigh diaspora-assemblage develops within
   wider geopolitical assemblages, its new nationalisms not only challenge
   the existing state-territory configuration in North Africa, but also
   signal a changing sense of group identity for diaspora Imazighen
   themselves.},

Abstract = {Neoliberal reform in healthcare has become global a fact of life, with
   widely varying healthcare policies regularly placed under the pressure
   of both austerity and market reform. Nowhere is this more evident than
   in the most divisive social antagonisms along class, racial, and
   ideological lines. US health reform is surely unique, mostly aimed at
   overcoming shortfalls of market-based healthcare. In contrast, reform in
   other health systems is primarily concerned with the degree to which
   market actors are allowed entry to already existing publicly oriented
   plans. That said, the peculiar nature of the US system, as well as its
   now entrenched conservative shift, may offer valuable insights into
   future healthcare pressures across a global environment besieged by
   similar rightward political trajectories. One major pillar of US reform
   is Medicaid expansion, part of the now decade-plus battle around the
   implementation of the Affordable Care Act of the business community,
   precisely because the program has become a highly lucrative field of
   largely market-administered healthcare delivery. This article suggests,
   as part of a two-pronged argument, that Medicaid now falls squarely
   within what I have previously highlighted as ???adaptive accumulation???
   ??? the pursuit by corporate actors of quasi-public roles in which
   stable and socially-legitimised profit streams can be secured},
