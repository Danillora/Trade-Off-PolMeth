Abstract = {Set against theoretical and strategic debates about theories of radical
   democracy, left populism and the commons, this article analyses and
   evaluates everyday struggles in Greek politics after the global
   financial crisis. It focusses on the cases of Vio.Me - the first
   workers' recuperated factory in Greece - and the Metropolitan Community
   Clinic at Helliniko, which is the largest social solidarity health
   clinic in Greece. Viewed from the perspective of commoning practices,
   the article identifies the logics that sustain the beliefs, values,
   infrastructures and institutions developed at an everyday grassroots
   level, finding traces of an incipient radical democratic ethos and
   rationality at work. The new initiatives highlight crucial and often
   neglected organisational, prefiguring and subjective prerequisites for
   radical democracy, while challenging elements of left populist political
   strategy. Our evolving perspective also problematises their political
   limitations and strategic dilemmas as they struggle to constitute a
   viable hegemonic alternative to neoliberal rationalities and governance.},

Abstract = {Does poverty relief breed corruption? This question has been examined in
   several electoral polities, but not in other political settings. This
   study engages in this academic discussion by proposing a unique
   corruption mechanism in the case of China. The dual causes of National
   Poor Counties' unique exit mechanism and long distance from economic
   hubs create a unique local poli-economic environment, in which local
   bureaucrats share the incentive to stay in the program, which in turn
   leads to an intra-elite alliance and more corruption. I test the
   empirical implication of these mechanisms by first building up a new
   county-level corruption dataset for 881 low-income counties,and then
   leveraging propensity score weighting to evaluate the impact of the
   third wave (2001-2010) of China's poverty alleviation program on county
   level corruption. The results of this test show some evidence that
   counties participated in the third wave of the program are associated
   with approximately 4.4-19.7 percent increase in corruption incidence and
   10.5-23.5 percent increase in numbers of convicted persons compared to
   similar non-participant counties. These findings highlight the
   importance of proper institutional designs in poverty alleviation
   regimes to lower the corruption incentive of local bureaucrats.},

Title = {How can non-elected representatives secure democratic representation?},
Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Research on the democratic legitimacy of non-elected actors influencing
   policy while acting as representatives is often lacking in governance
   literature, despite being increasingly relevant worldwide. Recent
   theories of representation argue that there are non-electoral mechanisms
   to appoint such non-elected representatives and hold them responsible
   for their actions. Consequently, democratic non -electoral
   representation can be achieved. Through empirical analysis, this article
   explores democratic non-electoral representation in governance networks
   by comparing how non-elected representatives, their constituents and the
   decision-making audience understand the outcome of representation to
   benefit the constituency, authorisation and accountability. The research
   findings conclude that all three groups mostly share the understanding
   of democratic non-electoral representation as ongoing interactions
   between representatives and constituents, multiple (if any)
   organisational and discursive sources of authorisation and deliberative
   aspects of accountability. All of these are non-electoral mechanisms
   that secure democratic representation. These findings make an important
   contribution to the literature on non-electoral representation in
   policymaking.},

Abstract = {Ever since the launch of the World Press Freedom Index almost 20 years
   ago, Finland has always been among the top five countries of that index.
   According to the annual Reuters Digital News reports, Finnish people
   also have the highest level of trust in the news media and one of the
   highest levels of press readership in the EU. Most of the media
   companies are doing quite well, while Google and Facebook have a much
   less dominant role in the advertising market than elsewhere in Europe.
   In this context, you might expect Finland to have a comprehensive and
   visionary media and communications policy to support democracy. However,
   our meta-study of Finnish media and communications policy based on two
   recent reports to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, other
   earlier studies, along with official documents as well as statistical
   data suggests that is not the case. Our analysis shows that most
   decisions have been pragmatic ad hoc solutions serving economic
   interests rather than any specific media and communication policy goals.
   A closer examination also proves that Finland does not fit into the
   Nordic Media Welfare State model either, despite a long, shared history
   and cultural ties.},

Abstract = {The open Russian military invasion of Ukraine supported by Belarus
   launched in February 2022 has changed the usual state of affairs and
   caused the economic, humanitarian, and migration crises. Several
   millions of Ukrainian people had to move to safer regions of the
   country, and a significant share of them (mostly women, children, and
   elderly people) have left abroad in search of safer living conditions,
   which has become the worst migration crisis since the World War II. Many
   Ukrainian citizens have been forced to move to Russia. Poland hosts the
   largest number of Ukrainian citizens among the EU countries (about 60\%
   of all refugees), much less left for Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and
   Germany. Almost every European country helps Ukraine in some way or
   another, hosting its residents and providing asylum. The aim of this
   article is to investigate the tendencies and changes of forced migration
   in Ukraine in the conditions of war.
   The collective protection of displaced persons allows immediate
   assistance to many people in conditions of emergencies and reduces
   pressure on the system of asylum provision authorities. This decision
   provides the right to Ukrainians to live, work, and receive assistance
   in the EU countries avoiding the lingering process of asylum application
   submission and long waiting for the respective decision. The article
   highlights the comparison of standards for providing temporary
   protection of displaced persons in the EU countries that have accepted
   most of them.
   Certainly, the situation with the mass movement of people or leaving
   abroad will have negative consequences for Ukraine. The return of
   forcibly displaced from Ukraine will depend on what way of legal stay
   abroad they choose (status of ``forced{''} tourist, refugee, or
   temporary protection). Moreover, the duration of hostilities and
   efficiency and complexity of actions taken by state and local
   authorities to implement economic and social reforms will have much
   effect. The article offers various development scenarios for Ukraine and
   ways and incentives for returning Ukrainian citizens to their
   Motherland.},

Title = {Local Participation at Stake: Between Emancipatory Goals and Co-Option
   Strategies. The Case of Territorially Focused Development Programs in
   Colombia},

Abstract = {Objective/Context: We examine how participatory peacebuilding projects
   create emancipatory outcomes by investigating the implementation of
   Territorially Focused Development Programs (Programas de Desarrollo con
   Enfoque Territorial, PDETs), one of the centerpieces of the Colombian
   peace process. We define ``emancipatory outcomes{''} as allocations of
   decision-making power (e.g., control over budgets, project priorities)
   and/or material benefits (e.g., new infrastructure, public goods) to
   marginalized groups in society. Methodology: The article is based on a
   combination of ethnographic peace research and semi-structured
   interviews with key government and civil actors involved in the design
   and implementation of the PDETs both at the national and local levels.
   We focus on the PDET of the department of Choco, where both authors
   conducted ethnographic work during the design and implementation of the
   peace program between January 2018 and March 2020. Conclusions: We argue
   that the emancipatory outcomes of a participatory project are never
   fixed in advance: the degree to which such projects serve bottom-up,
   emancipatory goals rather than top-down state expansion are contingent
   on the outcomes of contestation and cooperation processes between actors
   within and outside the state. Originality: Critical scholarship tends to
   understand participatory peacebuilding programs as top-down programs to
   co-opt grassroots actors and expand the reach of the state rather than
   emancipatory projects that create real shifts in existing political
   settlements. Our contribution lies in the study of the dynamics of these
   peace processes to identify the potential spaces they open for
   emancipatory goals.},

   affect each other-but less attention has been drawn to the linkages
   between efforts to resolve them. The article focuses on the phenomenon
   of ``interlocking peace processes,{''} in which parallel peacemaking
   efforts take place among interlinked conflicts. This article examines
   how progress in one peace process can influence an interlocking process,
   and the conditions under which a breakthrough in one process can trigger
   progress in a parallel process or undermine its advancement. It offers a
   theoretical framework for the analysis of interlocking peace processes,
   outlining three main arguments, which rest on three influence patterns:
   complementing peace processes, competing peace processes, and a
   paving-the-way peace process. The discussion considers how the
   mechanisms of diffusion, identity formation, and legitimization serve as
   dominant tools in these processes. The article uses the interlocking
   peace processes in the Arab-Israeli conflict as a case study, examining
   the relationship between four processes in the Middle East: the Israeli-
   Egyptian, Israeli-Palestinian, Israeli-Jordanian, and Israeli-Syrian
   peace processes.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic posed several
   challenges to the Brazilian health system, among them the general
   context of ambiguity and uncertainty and the conflicting positioning of
   the government in power concerning scientific advice resources.
   Different aspects can be analyzed to explore the dynamics of
   strengthening and resilience of the system. This paper focuses on its
   analytical capacity, examining how it was developed and recently
   challenged. The investigation employed survey data, analysis of official
   documents and newspaper articles, and in-depth interviews with
   specialists and federal bureaucrats. The research shows the magnitude
   and relevance of that dimension of policy capacity in the federal health
   system and how it was crucial to the resilience of the system in
   defining the directions of the fight against COVID-19 in Brazil,
   although scientific-based recommendations were rejected by political
   leaders.},

Title = {Great Power Intervention and War},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Great powers often extract concessions whether they intervene during or
   after other states' wars. I analyze crisis bargaining between two
   primary disputants and a great power that may intervene to extract
   concessions from the victor. When disputants face commitment problems,
   the threat of intervention discourages declining states from attacking
   and enables rising states to make otherwise-incredible commitments to
   avoid war. When disputants face information problems, uninformed states
   find risking war less attractive, and informed states accept less
   favorable proposals, regardless of their private information. The
   mechanism by which the threat of intervention discourages war depends on
   great powers' military reach and the side(s) against which they
   intervene. The model shows how (i) changing great power capabilities can
   lead to the outbreak of war between other states, (ii) these effects are
   mediated by hierarchical relationships, and (iii) great powers can
   create international order not with principle but with selfishness.},

Abstract = {The Russian state requires companies to invest in welfare provision and
   to conclude socio-economic cooperation agreements (SECAs) with regional
   administrations. Based on empirical evidence from Khanty-Mansi
   Autonomous Okrug, this article analyses state-business interactions at
   the subnational level. We show that state and business actors have
   formalised their resource exchange in the SECAs. Because of the
   agreements' adaptive nature, both parties are able to manage their
   respective obligations and risks within an authoritarian and highly
   volatile environment. We identify four patterns of contractual
   relations, depending on the companies' production capacities and their
   commitment to providing social investments in the region.},

Abstract = {Spoken administrative language is a critical element in the relationship
   between citizens and the state, especially when it comes to face-to-face
   interactions between officials and citizens during the delivery of
   public services. But preceding work offers little insights into the
   verbal features of street-level bureaucracy. Drawing on communication
   studies, we argue that administrative language differs along both a
   relational and an informational linguistic component. To test the
   consequentiality of this theory, we design a factorial survey experiment
   with a representative sample of 1,402 German citizens. Participants
   evaluated audio recordings of a hypothetical service encounter where we
   systematically varied the language used by the official and the service
   decision, measuring participants' service satisfaction as the main
   outcome. Based on regression analysis, we find that relational elements
   of administrative language improve citizen satisfaction, independent of
   the service outcome, but that the effect does not hold for the
   informational component. These findings emphasize the importance of
   relational communication in citizen-state interactions, which tends to
   be neglected in public administration theory and practice.},

Abstract = {This research investigates the role of public sector innovation
   outcomes, e.g. trademark innovation, information and communication
   technology (ICT), renewable energy, and governance, in the sustainable
   development of Bangladesh during 1980-2019. Utilising the dynamic
   autoregressive distributed lag (DARDL) simulation approach, this study
   divulges a favourable long-term influencing profile of public sector
   innovation outcomes, i.e. trademark innovation, ICT, and renewable
   energy on sustainable development, while governance has a heterogeneous
   impact. Besides, the findings from the DARDL simulations area plots
   display 10\% counterfactual shocks to the public sector innovation
   outcomes on sustainable development. Furthermore, the Kernel-based
   regularised least square machine learning algorithm approach used in the
   study examines the marginal effects of the public sector innovation
   outcomes on sustainable development for robust findings. Therefore, the
   policy suggestions are solely concerned with the public sector's
   adoption of more innovation dynamics through appropriate policy
   formulation.},

Abstract = {Informal groupings have proliferated in EU foreign policy over the past
   decade, despite the enhanced role of the High Representative tasked with
   ensuring the coherence of this policy domain under the Lisbon Treaty.
   This article analyzes how the decision of select EU member states to act
   on certain policy issues through informal groupings, bypassing the EU
   framework, affects the High Representative's room for maneuver. Drawing
   on the principal-agent model, the emergence of informal groupings is
   conceptualized as a manifestation of pathological delegation, which
   undermines High Representative's role. The findings reveal two factors
   that may nevertheless increase the agent's discretion in cases of
   delegation anomalies: the low heterogeneity of member state preferences
   toward the informal grouping and the interaction between agents in the
   same domain, facilitating agent's performance. By examining agent's
   discretion when delegation anomalies arise, the article may be useful
   for scholars investigating delegation and agency in international
   organizations.},

Abstract = {Many new models of governance are presented as offering potential to
   more effectively confront environmental challenges in the Anthropocene
   by transforming the underlying logic of decision-making. A common
   feature of these models is the imperative to integrate multiple forms of
   knowledge, disciplinary perspectives, and diverse networks of actors
   both within and outside the academy. These calls for pluralism are not
   just about it as a democratic principle, but part of improved `knowledge
   governance' more equipped to address the multi-faceted causes and
   consequences of environmental degradation. Yet the principles behind
   these improved practices can be lost in translation. While pluralism is
   elevated as ideal, when decision-makers are faced with political and
   social realities of bringing in more voices, the result is often more
   populist than pluralist, and conflicts difficult to manage. This paper
   explores how these issues play out by examining co-production in
   Australian wildfire governance, revealing concerns about whose knowledge
   is considered credible and legitimate and how knowledge is used to
   bolster narratives about both change and the status quo. It also
   contributes to debates about how populism influences the use of
   knowledge in policy, and how values influence interpretation and action
   in relation to new evidence.},

Title = {Towards planetary nexus governance in the Anthropocene: An earth system

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},

Abstract = {Nexus governance recognises that sustainability concerns such as water,
   energy, and food security are interlinked and provides an alternative to
   fragmented governance. Although it has been applied mostly in the
   domestic context, the need for nexus governance is also apparent at a
   planetary scale, as highlighted by interacting planetary boundaries,
   global telecoupling, and global tipping cascades. However, international
   environmental law is unable to facilitate what we call `planetary nexus
   governance'. This is mainly because international environmental law
   lacks an ecological Grundnorm and because its primary rules of conduct
   remain fragmented in the absence of effective secondary rules on how
   primary rules should relate to each other. Recognising this challenge,
   scholars have recently proposed earth system law as a new framework to
   rethink, in an integrated way, law in an Anthropocene context. Building
   on this framework, we suggest that international environmental law
   should adopt a unifying Grundnorm such as planetary integrity. We also
   suggest that international institutional law, as a body of secondary
   rules, has an important role to play in facilitating planetary nexus
   governance by bringing together fragmented bodies of international law.
   We briefly discuss ways in which international environmental law could
   reorientate itself to better facilitate planetary nexus governance.},

Abstract = {Central American integration is a process that has brought benefits to
   its members in various areas. An expected product of this process is the
   strengthening of the institutional capacities of its participants and
   their consequent economic and institutional development. However,
   although the members of the Central American Integration System,
   especially Costa Rica, have shown progress in different areas of the
   concept of institutional capacities, the evidence points to divergences.
   Based on the operationalization of the concept of institutional
   capabilities -with some indicators of interest and secondary sources of
   information-, this paper argues that a possible process of clustering of
   institutional development and, therefore, of human development in the
   region has been avoided, differentiating between the countries of the
   Northern Triangle, those that do not belong to this zone and those that
   are outside the Isthmus. As a consequence, the importance of integration
   as a provider of anchors for institutional development and how the
   process in Central America can help member countries to improve their
   institutional capacities and their prospects for human development is
   discussed.},

Abstract = {System Justification Theory posits that individuals are less prone to
   engage in radical action against a system on which they depend. In the
   present research, we investigated how the association between
   system-justifying tendencies and radical intentions is moderated by
   individuals' orientation towards power differentials, namely their
   ``power distance.{''} A stronger power distance orientation implies that
   individuals perceive power differentials as a fixed feature of society,
   curtailing prospects for change. We hypothesized that, at lower levels
   of power distance orientation, system-justification tendencies would be
   associated with reduced radical intentions. We contend this will occur
   because individuals feel dependent on a system perceived as malleable
   (dependency hypothesis). Conversely, at higher levels of power distance
   orientation, we expected system-justification tendencies to be
   associated with stronger radical intentions. We argue that this effect
   reflects the rejection of dependency on a system perceived as fixed
   (counterdependency hypothesis). This dependency-counterdependency
   dynamic was tested using a multigroup latent structural equation model
   and samples from four countries (N-Total = 2,502), South Korea, Italy,
   the United Kingdom, and the United States. Results were consistent with
   the hypothesized dynamic across all countries. Theoretical implications
   of the findings, limitations, and future research directions are
   discussed.},

Title = {Abortion and euthanasia: Explanatory factors of an association in
   Thanatos. Analysis of the European Values Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The European Values Study (EVS), and also the World Values Survey (WVS),
   have for decades included a question that asks about the degree of
   justification of different behaviors and actions, including abortion and
   euthanasia. Our research aims to study which factors influence the
   abortion/euthanasia association in Spain and whether this association is
   also observed in other countries. A factor analysis of the Spanish
   sample shows that a number of items related to sexuality and death tend
   to cluster together. This factor could be called ``Eros-Thanatos,{''}
   and includes the justification of abortion and euthanasia, in terms of
   ideological consistency. The analysis shows that in Spain, as well as in
   Europe generally, not being a religious person is the principal factor
   associated with the greater justification of abortion and euthanasia.
   The article analyses whether this association in the Spanish data is
   something that can be generalized to other European countries or
   whether, on the contrary, there are factors such as culture and the
   historical past of the countries that modify the relationship.
   Correspondence analyses applied to different questions in the
   questionnaire show that it is possible to establish different dividing
   lines in Europe according to the values of its citizens, shaping a
   north-south axis and a west-east axis, in which the processes of
   secularization in Western Europe or the rise in institutional religion
   in the former Soviet republics might lie behind.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Pages = {639-653},

Abstract = {Legal waivers in the business and human rights context are an agreement
   corporations use to provide compensation to victims in exchange for
   waiving their right to file future claims in a court of law in corporate
   human rights abuses. Corporations use legal waivers to further secure
   legal immunity from potential future claims for adverse human rights
   impact. In contrast, right-holders accept legal waivers as they provide
   quick resolution of grievances, mainly in the form of monetary
   compensation. This article investigates the inequality of bargaining
   power under which legal waivers operate. It advances the central claim
   that the use of legal waivers in private remedial processes reflects
   corporate attempts to renegotiate human rights standards by exercising
   authority. I use the Porgera case study to shed light on how power
   inequalities between corporations and right-holders distort the nature
   of business actors' governance authority in business and human rights. I
   further argue that legal waivers strengthen the power of corporations
   while simultaneously not serving the public interest that corporations
   claim to uphold in facilitating a private remedial process for
   right-holders. I conclude that the power inequalities exacerbate the
   ``power{''} element of authority without affecting the legitimacy of
   corporations but distorting the nature of their governance authority.},

   life that were co-opted by the German authorities into the lowest level
   of rule in occupied Poland from 1939-1945. It identifies these
   institutions as key meso-level structures that shaped the behavior of
   individuals on the ground. Specifically, it places the axis of analysis
   on the figure of the village head (soltys). It argues that the village
   security system, combined with the introduction of collective
   responsibility and imminent violence, was at the heart of a process of
   community-making, in which village heads inescapably played an important
   role. In this new dynamic of accountability, notions of ``community{''}
   and ``belonging{''} evolved relative to notions of ``security{''} and
   ``self-preservation{''} in the changing circumstances of life under
   occupation. The reimagined community forged in this wartime crucible was
   one of transformed identities, ingrained ethnic categories, new lines of
   solidarity, and new antagonisms. A collective biographical approach to
   village heads in this period culminates in the collective ethical
   dilemma as a category of historical analysis. The article draws
   primarily on testimonies found in postwar August Decree trials of
   individuals tried for collaboration in historic Western Galicia or
   District Krakow of the General Government. It employs a thick
   description of the subject to map personal narratives onto the broader
   social processes under examination.},

Abstract = {In this study, a synthesized framework based on the policy advisory
   system (PAS) and the politics-administration (PA) dichotomy is applied
   to Hong Kong, a jurisdiction in transition from its previous status as a
   colony influenced by the Westminster system to a special administrative
   region of China. Based on interviews and questionnaire responses from
   policymakers and advisors in different structural positions of the PAS,
   the study finds that politicized public-service appointment has
   increased political control over the content of policy advice through
   three pathways: the selection of alternative policy advisors, the
   restructuring of sources of policy advice, and the opening-up of extant
   policy-advisory processes. Unlike in some non-Western and state-centered
   regimes, centralized political control in Hong Kong has both
   internalized and broadened the range of policy alternatives. The case of
   Hong Kong demonstrates that the dynamics of PA dichotomy provide
   pathways to policy advice politicization in the PAS, although the hybrid
   Westminster and Confucian traditions of Hong Kong shape the pathways
   toward, the degree, and the content of policy advice politicization.
   These findings affirm the PAS theory that the political-technical
   dimensions of policy advice do not fit neatly with the location or
   structural roles of policy actors.},

Abstract = {Russian companies, with their long-established tradition of social
   responsibility, still operate social and infrastructure projects at the
   regional and local levels. Adopting the framework of organisational
   ``bricolage{''}, this article explores how managers combine various
   ideas and understandings about social responsibility, creating
   narratives addressed to multiple audiences, including the market, state,
   employees and local community. The analysis builds on 116
   semi-structured interviews with company representatives and
   stakeholders, conducted in Russia in 2018. The empirical findings show
   that managers construct a bricolage of social responsibility that
   prioritises business interests and highlights loyalty towards the
   authorities; Soviet-era remnants are of minor importance.},

Abstract = {Financial scarcity is a fundamental condition for recipients of social
   welfare. We draw on scarcity theory to suggest that the condition of
   scarce resources may have a range of important psychological
   consequences for how welfare recipients' cope with their problems,
   navigate citizen-state interactions, for their perceived ability to deal
   with their problems, and for their psychological well-being. In a field
   experiment using Danish unemployed social assistance recipients (N =
   2,637), we test the psychological consequences of scarcity by randomly
   assigning recipients to be surveyed either shortly before payment of
   their social assistance benefits, shortly after, or mid-month. We find
   no impact of the scarcity manipulation and thus our main findings run
   counter to the idea that short-term changes in scarce financial
   conditions influence the mindsets of social welfare recipients. However,
   a series of exploratory cross-sectional regressions show that subjective
   scarcity, that is ``the feeling of having too little{''}, is associated
   with an increased focus on solving problems, but negatively associated
   with psychological well-being, sense of mastery, and job search
   self-efficacy. We conclude that these correlates may reflect more
   long-term consequences of scarcity but that more and stronger causal
   evidence is needed given the cross-sectional nature of these data.},

Abstract = {Terrorist attacks have important social, political, and economic
   effects. One of the effects of terrorism involves the impact on foreign
   direct investment (FDI). While existing research suggests that terrorism
   negatively impacts FDI by increasing political risks, it is unclear how
   the effects of terrorism are conditioned by host country institutions.
   Political institutions may affect investors' perceptions of political
   risk following a terrorist attack by shaping expectations of future
   political risk. We argue that the conditional effect of institutions and
   terrorism is non-linear: Terrorism has a negative effect on FDI inflows
   to countries with a medium level of institutional effectiveness only.
   Using quantitative analyses of FDI flows and political risk ratings, we
   show that terrorism has no effect on FDI in host countries with very
   high or very low levels of political institutional effectiveness. In a
   qualitative analysis of FDI and terrorism during the civil wars in
   Algeria and El Salvador, we demonstrate that concerns about
   institutional effectiveness played an important role in producing
   disinvestment by foreign investors. This research contributes to the
   literature on the determinants of FDI, effects of terrorism and
   political risk, and suggests that institutions play an important role in
   affecting how investors perceive political risk.},

Title = {An Approximation of Ethnographic Contributions to Diplomatic Studies},
Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {112},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Objective/context: This research aims to bring closer contributions of
   the ethnographic approach to diplomatic works, both at a specific and a
   general level, in the discipline of International Relations,
   establishing connections, homologous methods, critical points, and
   inflections. Methodology: The article uses a qualitative methodology
   with an ethnographic approach to stress some classical and ontological
   categories of the international discipline, allowing a discussion of the
   scope, contributions, and novelty of the ethnographic method
   specifically for diplomatic studies. It also presents a review of
   specialized literature by authors who have studied the cultural variable
   in diplomatic studies. This approach allows examining basic premises of
   the discipline of International Relations, such as national interest,
   the constitution of the state, and state exclusivity in the diplomatic
   field, among other classic categories, that do not fully account for the
   existence of processes and emerging actors invisible in the
   internationalist debate. Conclusions: The article argues that the
   discipline of International Relations challenges its most representative
   arguments and categories by adhering to anthropological reflections. The
   results suggest that ethnographic approaches stress certain classical
   terms and ontologies of the international discipline, which has been
   possible through discussing the scope, contributions, and novelty of the
   ethnographic method specifically for diplomatic studies. Originality:
   This unpublished research study reveals a counterpoint between two
   large, apparently dissimilar theoretical corpora: anthropology and
   international relations.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with crucial areas of research potential in regional
   conditions of the 14 Czech self-governing regions in years 2015 and
   2020. For the analysis 11 indicators of research and development (R\&D)
   are applied by use of multivariate methods. The results showed internal
   similarities of the Czech regions by the three created R\&D factors in
   2020. We investigated the relationship in Czech regions between the
   created factors of research potential (in the public sector, the
   business enterprise sector, potential human resources) on one side and
   economic level of regions and total R\&D expenditures as percentage of
   regional GDP on the other side. The achieved findings from
   self-governing Czech regions can be a valuable source for creators of
   regional R\&D strategies in the Czech Republic.},

Abstract = {This article explores Gustaw Herling-Grudzinski's largely forgotten
   travel diary ``A Journey to Burma.{''} It argues that the strategy
   Herling-Grudzinski employed to describe the postcolonial world was a
   unique one. It did not belong to the ``socialist postcolonialism{''}
   narrative, nor was it a part of Western orientalist discourse.
   Herling-Grudzinski's Eastern European past and identity deeply
   influenced his account. Despite some simplification, he was able to
   summarize Burmese reality surprisingly accurately. The article claims
   that Herling-Grudzinski's travelogue represents a new angle to the
   narrative of the relations between Eastern European people of letters
   and inhabitants of colonized countries.},

Abstract = {This article examines how creative industry workers engage with
   diversity, absent a formal organizational mandate to do so. Through
   in-depth interviews with independent music industry personnel (N = 50),
   the article identifies how marquee quotas-racially diverse
   representation on rosters and festival bills-are used to pursue and
   implement diversity. Such quotas are justified via four distinct
   valuations of diversity: aesthetic, economic, reputational and moral.
   Both people of colour and white participants justify the importance of
   diversity on moralistic grounds. By contrast, white participants more
   often justify the value of diversity by making claims about the
   aesthetic, economic and reputational benefits of marquee quotas. The
   deployment of these more self-serving valuations has consequences for
   the extent to which people of colour can feel authentically included.
   The analysis contributes to critiques of the socio-economic role and
   consequences of diversity valuations, within the context of a creative
   industry.},

Title = {Resilience and governance of dispersed sub-Saharan migration in Morocco:
   The case of the refuge-cities of Tiznit and Taza},

Abstract = {This article aims to contribute to the construction of theoretical and
   empirical milestones of the concept of urban resilience by applying it
   to the field of sub-Saharan migration geography in Morocco. Our analysis
   is based on participatory action research conducted between 2017 and
   2020 with a cohort of 215 migrants dispersed by the Moroccan state from
   the northern border areas of the country and forcibly relocated to the
   peripheral cities of Tiznit (south) and Taza (northeast). These two
   territories, to which the state delegates de facto responsibility for
   receiving and assisting dispersed migrants, have been transformed into
   refuge-cities. By mobilizing a set of indicators, we present an
   operational definition of resilient urban governance of sub-Saharan
   migration. While exploring the link between resilience and local
   hospitable mobilizations, we highlight the processes underlying the
   construction of urban initiatives to host dispersed migrants. We show
   that the framework of urban resilience is revelatory of inclusive
   reception dynamics, of the autonomous agency, and the innovative
   capacity of refuge-cities in the core of a debordering process.},

Abstract = {International trustee courts embody a specific form of delegation, in
   which state principals confer on such courts the authority to interpret
   and apply treaties agreed by the states in order to realize specific
   values and interests. Human rights courts help states resolve commitment
   and enforcement problems that are inherent in human rights treaties.
   This study seeks to answer the question, what happens when states
   parties seek to reduce or eliminate the authority of a human rights
   court? To answer these questions, the article assesses six human rights
   treaty regimes: the Council of Europe; the Organization of American
   States; the African Union; the Economic Community of West African
   States; the East African Community; and the Southern African Development
   Community. The article identifies four types of de-delegation possible
   with respect to international human rights courts and assesses the
   extent to which states have sought to de-delegate from them. With one
   exception (the SADC Tribunal), the regimes examined here have so far
   successfully withstood the challenge of de-delegation.},

Abstract = {Despite surging attention to child soldiers and modern slavery over the
   past decades, their links remain politicized and neglected. This study
   develops a human rights approach that deepens application of
   international slavery law; exposes child soldiering as a neglected
   slavery issue; and confronts underlying legal, political, and ethical
   challenges. It addresses challenges of using slavery law to identify
   contemporary cases, then analyzes global data on child soldiering
   specifically, revealing patterns and trends with robust equivalencies to
   slavery. Ethical challenges are addressed by confronting slavery myths
   that distort legal discussions and intersectional elements of child
   soldiering. These legal, empirical, and ethical arguments reveal
   international law on child soldiering as deeply insufficient and support
   a paradigmatic shift in thinking toward antislavery rights as
   appropriate legal, moral, and programmatic tools to end child
   soldiering. This, in turn, demonstrates how a rights-based approach
   helps fulfill the promise of anti-slavery law even in politicized cases.},

Abstract = {The insertion of artificial intelligence technologies (AITs) and
   data-driven automation in public policymaking should be a metaphorical
   wake-up call for critical policy analysts. Both its wide representation
   as techno-solutionist remedy in otherwise slow, inefficient, and biased
   public decision-making and its regulation as a matter of rational risk
   analysis are conceptually flawed and democratically problematic. To
   `outsmart' AI, this article stimulates the articulation of a critical
   research agenda on AITs and public policy, outlining three
   interconnected lines of inquiry for future research: (1) interpretivist
   disclosure of the norms and values that shape perceptions and uses of
   AITs in public policy, (2) exploration of AITs in public policy as a
   contingent practice of complex human-machine interactions, and (3)
   emancipatory critique of how `smart' governance projects and AIT
   regulation interact with (global) inequalities and power relations.},

Abstract = {Free trade agreements (FTAs) have become the main vehicle of trade
   liberalisation. Both North-South and South-South FTAs increasingly go
   beyond the removal of trade barriers and link free trade with social
   standards, including labour and environmental provisions. Australia has
   been at the forefront of bilateral trade liberalisation, signing
   multiple FTAs, but conspicuously avoided incorporating social standards
   in the agreements it initiated. In doing so it has become a real outlier
   in the OECD world. What accounts for Australia's resistance to the
   inclusion of social standards in FTAs? Scholars have advanced various
   explanations for the issue-linkage between social standards and FTAs,
   including cross-national diffusion, societal interests, domestic
   institutions and bargaining. We evaluate their explanatory power and
   argue that Australian policy-makers view social standards primarily as
   protectionist tools that could hurt trade. This perception is reinforced
   by the broad acceptance of free trade among the Australian public. We
   explore the framing of social standards by Australian trade policy
   officials and the public to uncover why Australia has failed to link
   social standards with its trade agreements. Our analysis adds to the
   growing literature on FTA design and non-trade issues using Australia as
   a deviant case.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) faces many challenges. Chief among them are (1)
   the growing electoral appeal of EU-skeptic parties, (2) the prevalence
   of negative narratives about the EU, and (3) frequent marginalization of
   government leaders openly advocating EU membership. It is hence
   unsurprising that the EU attitude literature focuses heavily on ways in
   which leaders undermine (rather than bolster) confidence in the EU. The
   aim of this conceptual article is to fill this void and to shine a
   spotlight on how leaders seek to restore confidence in the EU. Rather
   than to merely describe what pro-EU leaders say in public, we propose a
   conceptual model that combines older EU attitude research (into
   ``nested{''} social identities and perceived identity compatibility),
   with more recent social psychology research (into ``identity
   mobilization{''} and ``identity leadership{''}). By combining insights
   from both fields, our framework enables us to gain a deeper
   understanding of why certain pro-EU narratives can be expected to ``take
   hold{''} and instill faith in the EU among the public at large. The
   discussion focuses on the implications for EU leadership.},

Abstract = {Our project uses the narrative policy framework (NPF) to explore
   narrative effects on attitudes about transgender rights. The framework
   focuses on the stories that are told about public policy. As opposed to
   conceptualizing communications as informational, NPF suggests that
   getting lost in the story is primary for attitude change. We also
   incorporate a perspective taking exercise to examine its effects on
   individual attitudes. Using an experiment on 1784 American adults, we
   found that individuals who received the inclusive transgender policy
   narrative by either watching or reading the narrative held views more
   supportive of transgender rights, with the effect greater for watching
   than reading. Those who experienced greater narrative transportation,
   being more lost in the story, reported more supportive attitudes. We
   further find that those with traits that lead them to become more
   imaginatively involved in stories occasionally are more greatly affected
   by watching policy narratives than those who are less imaginatively
   involved. However, perspective taking did not influence attitudes and
   weakened the treatment effects of the narratives. Our findings suggest
   stories can affect policy attitudes and beliefs, which may be
   conceptually distinct from traditional framing-based accounts and
   implies distinctive causal mechanisms that result in attitude change.},

Abstract = {We take the demand-side perspective of Sputnik V, trying to answer why
   facing vaccine scarcity, some countries opt for Sputnik V, and others do
   not. To show how the pandemic tests the institutional safeguards and
   soft guardrails of liberal democracy, we compiled a unique dataset and
   combined statistical analysis and case studies. While our quantitative
   analysis shows that the illiberalism of the party in power is the main
   explanatory factor in the import of Sputnik V, our qualitative case
   studies illustrate under what conditions institutional guardrails
   withstand the pressure of populist and illiberal leaders.},

Abstract = {Ten years after the attacks in Benghazi that killed US Ambassador J.
   Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, Libya is again on the
   brink of a civil war. The attacks sapped the United States' willingness
   to engage on Libya, leaving room for external actors to pursue their own
   agendas in the country. Four problematic narratives emerged, including
   one from former president Barack Obama himself, who declared that
   `failing to plan for the day after' the intervention in Libya was the
   worst mistake of his presidency. Despite American reluctance to deeply
   engage in addressing Libya's political and security disorder, the Biden
   administration could take several practical steps to help bring
   stability to a potentially prosperous country. These include limiting
   foreign interference and sanctioning one of Libya's most polarising
   actors, Khalifa Haftar.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the Philippines' response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this
   article examines two key objects used to mitigate the widespread
   transmission of the virus. To answer the research question, ``What is
   the meaning of face masks and shields in the Philippines during the
   COVID-19 pandemic?{''} a patchwork ethnography research method was used
   to triangulate data from a variety of sources, including academic
   scholarship, mass media, grey literature, and personal experience. Using
   Tom Scott-Smith's theoretical interpretation of Karl Marx's ``commodity
   fetishism{''} as a framework, the article traces the concealment,
   transformation, and mystification of face masks and face shields as
   humanitarian objects , and explores the social, political, and cultural
   role they play in the lives of Filipinos during the COVID-19 era.},

Abstract = {The adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Conservation and
   Sustainable Use of Marine Biodiversity beyond National Jurisdiction
   (BBNJ) (known as the ``High Seas Treaty{''}) is the product of almost
   twenty years of international negotiations. In an international context
   where Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) states are traditionally
   presented as occupying a peripheral position, this article examines the
   influence of LAC states in the normative development process affecting
   the regulation of the high seas. To this end, a qualitative analysis
   using process-tracing is applied to the period 2008-2022, drawing on a
   variety of sources (UN sites, semi-structured interviews, research
   projects, grey literature). The article is thus positioned at the
   crossroads of two debates: the first, on LAC States in international
   environmental and oceanic negotiations; the second, on the place of LAC
   in the development of global standards.},

Abstract = {Does authoritarian propaganda change in response to public criticism? Do
   counterarguments compel regimes to shift their narratives? The
   literature on authoritarian propaganda focuses on how propaganda affects
   public opinion but not vice versa because scholars rarely expect public
   opinion to change propaganda. Through text analysis of the Chinese state
   media's reporting on human germline gene editing, this study illustrates
   the mechanism of a case where authoritarian propaganda changed its own
   discourse and responded to public opinion. Responsive propaganda emerges
   when the benefits outweigh the costs of shifting discourse. Possible
   conditions for responsive propaganda include public opinion crises,
   opinion crises leading to risks of social unrest, and low costs of
   shifting positions. Responsive authoritarianism entails not only
   responsive policies but also responsive propaganda.},

Abstract = {The evidence-based policy (EBP) movement argues for policy actors,
   especially public officials, to use scientific evidence on what works to
   improve public policies. Empirical research in Anglo-Saxon countries
   shows that public officials do not use scientific knowledge that widely,
   often preferring other sources of information, such as news media,
   public opinion and peers. What about countries with low influence of
   EBP, what informs policy here? Using data from a large-n survey with
   Brazilian federal bureaucrats we uncover associations between sources of
   information and factors shaping their preferences, such as policy work
   and policy capacities. We find that in a civil law system such as the
   Brazilian administration homemade sources rule: there is a prevalence of
   use of government sources, especially among bureaucrats performing
   analytical and oversight tasks, and those in higher positions. Academic
   sources are associated with higher analytical capacity (of the
   individual and organisation), but not with any particular policy sector.
   By investigating an important yet often neglected issue in EBP - the
   role of different types of information and how they inform policy - this
   article contributes to the literatures on policy work and policy
   capacity, especially given its empirical focus on Brazil.},

Abstract = {That terrorism is a ``weapon of the weak{''} is such deeply held
   conventional wisdom it has become almost a cliche. ``Weak{''} means many
   different things in the literature, however, and little rigorous
   empirical research has tested the contention that weaker groups, however
   conceived, are more likely to employ terrorism. This article explores
   prominent weapon of the weak arguments to develop testable hypotheses
   about group strength and the prevalence of terrorism. Using measures of
   deliberately indiscriminate attacks on civilians by rebel groups in
   civil conflicts, as well as multiple measures of rebel strength, it
   examines systematically whether weaker groups are more likely to employ
   terrorism. I find surprisingly little empirical support for the
   conventional wisdom. There is no clear or consistent evidence that
   deliberately indiscriminate terrorism is a weapon of the weak rather
   than the strong.},

Abstract = {This contribution builds on my current research in exploring alternative
   ways of understanding the phenomenon of violence, traditionally
   conceived of as either a destructive force or a system of injustice. By
   exploring my personal position navigating between the borders of
   different versions of Europe (the Swedish border and the walls of gated
   communities in Brazil) the contribution explains how, in the modern
   colonial world, violence adopts a (re)creative or (re)creational aspect,
   fundamentally tying it to a whole economy of playfulness and pleasure.
   This economy is neither destructive nor necessarily unjust, in the sense
   that it complicates the liberal duality of inclusion/exclusion,
   structuring the pursuance of the easy life (a mode of living that
   maximises convenience) in different levels of (post)colonial racialised
   `enclaves'. The reflection ends with an invitation to take the concept
   of (re)creative violence seriously and to rethink the specific role of
   death and insecurity in the making of the international order.},

Abstract = {There can hardly be a more commonplace way to start talking about
   playing on stage than stating the social and political character that
   theatre has had since its inception. Even when it is not self-defined as
   `political', the aesthetic and the educational value of theatre is
   considered self-evident while its engagement with issues of the day is
   very common. Refugeehood could not escape stage representation, and this
   is what I consider in the following few pages. How should refugehood be
   represented on stage beyond aestheticisation of trauma?},

Abstract = {Domestic politics around the globe have become increasingly polarized
   along secular-religious lines. Recent literature suggests that one way
   to ease secular-religious tension and gridlock is for religious leaders
   to offer progressive reinterpretations of religious texts, that might
   convince religious conservatives to compromise from their
   seemingly-fixed policy positions. But can everyday citizens deploy
   religious reinterpretations themselves? We examine this question through
   a series of citizen debates in Tunisia, in which 602 participants
   attempted to reach a compromise over two `culture wars' issues. Across
   both experiments, we find that having secular liberals engage religious
   conservatives with religious reinterpretations backfired, nearly halving
   the rate of compromise. Religious reinterpretations produced both
   defensive conservatives and emboldened liberals, obstructing compromise
   between them. While scholarship suggests that religious leaders may be
   able to deploy reinterpretations effectively, our results caution that
   everyday citizens may not.},

Abstract = {Following the 2016 coup in Brazil, strategies for avoiding the state's
   constitutional duty to provide free quality public secular education
   intensified. The government's education policy has focused on serving
   the private sector by commodifying education and training a workforce
   adapted to a job market subservient to the powers that control the World
   Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. Education funding has been
   frozen for 20 years, and neoliberal reforms to secondary education have
   been proposed. The crux of this policy is a high school program that
   distinguishes between two types of education, technical-vocational for
   the working classes and scientific-humanistic for the ruling classes.
   The reforms have been met by protests culminating in a national strike
   in May 2019 that brought thousands of students and education workers
   into the streets to demand a place at the table. The society is
   responding to the attempt to transform Brazil into an experiment in
   neoliberal totalitarianism, and the struggle continues. Apos o golpe de
   2016 no Brasil, intensificaram-se as estrategias para evitar o dever
   constitucional do Estado de oferecer educacao publica e laica de
   qualidade e gratuita. A politica educacional do governo tem se
   concentrado no atendimento ao setor privado, mercantilizando a educacao
   e formando uma forca de trabalho adaptada a um mercado de trabalho
   subserviente aos poderes que controlam o Banco Mundial e o Banco
   Interamericano de Desenvolvimento. O financiamento da educacao foi
   congelado por 20 anos, e foram propostas reformas neoliberais para o
   ensino medio. O cerne dessa politica e um programa de ensino medio que
   distingue entre dois tipos de educacao, tecnico-profissional para a
   classe trabalhadora e cientifico-humanistico para as classes dominantes.
   As reformas foram recebidas por protestos que culminaram em uma greve
   nacional em maio de 2019, que levou milhares de estudantes e
   trabalhadores de educacao as ruas para exigir um lugar a mesa. A
   sociedade esta respondendo a tentativa de transformar o Brasil em uma
   experiencia de totalitarismo neoliberal, e a luta continua.},

Abstract = {Technologies based on artificial intelligence (AI) represent a crucial
   governance challenge for policymakers. This study contributes to the
   understanding of how states plan to govern AI with respect to the role
   they assume and to the way they develop AI in a responsible manner. In
   different policy instruments across 22 countries plus the European
   Union, there is considerable variation in how governments approach the
   governance of AI, both regarding the policy measures proposed and their
   focus on public responsibility. Analysing a set of policy instruments we
   find multiple modes of AI governance, with the major difference being
   between self-regulation-promoting and market-based approaches, and a
   combination of entrepreneurial and regulatory governance approaches. Our
   analysis also indicates that the approach to public responsibility is
   largely independent of the chosen policy mix of AI governance.
   Therefore, responsibility seems to be a cross-cutting issue that cannot
   be tied to a specific approach of states towards technology.},

Abstract = {To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, much will depend on how
   governments implement future progression toward more ambitious climate
   policy. While there is research on the acceptance of international
   climate policy or specific national policy instruments, we know
   comparatively little about public support for internationally pledged
   national emissions targets. We are thus interested in the causal effect
   of framing government policies aimed toward emission reductions as
   either national or international obligations. Can policymakers increase
   support by leveraging one or the other? Our results from a survey
   experiment in Switzerland indicate that while international frames
   improve target evaluation, substantive effects are small and we
   effectively report null findings for our main framing treatments.
   Eliciting the international obligation may nevertheless be regarded as
   an advisable strategy for policymakers as it significantly improves
   young peoples' evaluation of emission targets and also makes less
   climate-conscious respondents more supportive of the reduction target.},

Title = {Why Do Trump's Authoritarian Followers Resist COVID-19 Authorities?
   Because They Are Not Really Authoritarian Followers},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {People's responses to the threat posed by COVID-19 varied widely. In
   direct contradiction to the popular theory that Trump supporters prefer
   to submit to powerful people, Trump's most enthusiastic followers
   actually were the most vocal in resisting the urgings of authorities to
   get vaccinated and to wear masks. I explain this anomaly by showing that
   Trump's followers are driven less by a desire for authority and more by
   a desire to be secure from the threats human outsiders pose to society's
   historically dominant racial, language, religious, and cultural group.
   Far from being authoritarians, the followers of leaders such as Donald
   Trump stridently oppose all authority figures who divert attention from
   what they believe are the real threats: immigrants, powerful foreign
   enemies, diversity, terrorists, and criminals. From this perspective, it
   is unsurprising that those with a securitarian orientation would not
   take seriously authorities who are concerned with the threat posed by an
   mRNA virus.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {494-521},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Comprehensive peace agreements (CPAs) are the most impactful negotiated
   settlements ending civil wars, but their implementation varies across
   post-conflict countries and over time. To explain varying
   implementation, this study identifies central challenges in CPA
   implementation and suggests that international third parties are
   uniquely positioned to overcome them. (1) IGOs with high economic
   leverage, and (2) prior foreign aid both set incentives that reduce
   domestic barriers to implementation. Quantitative evidence on the
   implementation of CPAs from 1989-2015 supports this argument. Both
   post-conflict countries' participation in IGOs with high economic
   leverage and higher volumes of prior foreign aid are associated with
   higher rates of CPA implementation. Multiple estimation approaches,
   including instrumental variables, support this finding. Case evidence
   from the 2007 CPA in Ivory Coast tracks the processes by which IGOs and
   donors help overcome stakeholder resistance and facilitate
   implementation. This finding encourages more concerted efforts by
   policymakers to advance CPA implementation.},

Abstract = {Can imperfect information, as revealed in individual misperceptions
   about income distributions, explain the demand for redistribution? I
   conduct a representative survey experiment in Brazil, France, Germany,
   Russia, Spain and the USA, providing a personalized information
   treatment on income distribution to a randomly chosen subsample. Most
   respondents misperceive their own position in the income distribution.
   These biases differ notably by country and the true income position.
   Correcting misperceptions slightly shifts the demand towards less
   redistribution in Germany and Russia. This shift appears to be driven by
   respondents with a negative position bias. The lack of significant
   treatment effects in other countries may result from different
   individual reactions that cancel each other out. Thus, the existence of
   systematic misperceptions underscores their importance for understanding
   preferences for redistribution.},

Title = {The Effect of Government Repression on Civil Society: Evidence from
   Cambodia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are a core component of a robust
   civil society and operate in a wide variety of sectors, ranging from
   service delivery to political advocacy. However, research has yet to
   systematically investigate whether the impact of government repression
   varies across NGO activities. We hypothesize that advocacy NGOs are more
   affected by repression than those in service delivery. Surveying 176
   employees from 106 NGOs in Cambodia, we employ a conjoint experiment to
   examine how the level of repression affects a task crucial to NGOs'
   survival: obtaining funding via grant applications. We find that while
   increases in the severity of repression appear to have a stronger
   deterrent effect for advocacy NGOs, repression has a large deterrent
   effect on service NGOs as well. Interviews and text analysis of
   open-ended questions suggest that local officials target both advocacy
   and service delivery NGOs, but for different reasons. Our findings speak
   to the spread of authoritarianism and the challenges NGOs face in
   countries with closing civic spaces.},

Abstract = {Foreign investment is governed by thousands of international investment
   agreements (IIAs), many of which include investor-state dispute
   settlement (ISDS) provisions. Member states have played a prominent role
   in the evolution and shape of this decentralized global investment
   regime. The EU itself has become an actor in this regime since gaining
   competence in this area in 2009. This article examines the manners by
   which investment policies of the EU and its member states have evolved
   over time and their implications for the EU's actorness. Using, first,
   the concept and metric of state regulatory space, we show that the EU is
   more enthusiastic than its member states about reforms, but that a lack
   of internal cohesiveness and a competitive external environment limit
   its actorness. Second, drawing on recent discussions on ISDS reforms, we
   highlight the increasing ability of the EU to speak up with one voice on
   global investment rules.},

Abstract = {E-administration became on important issues of the development of the
   municipal administrations. In this paper we examined the regulation of
   Poland and Hungary to examine the challenges of these reforms. The
   Polish and Hungarian municipalities have been strongly influenced by the
   digitalisation. In the fields of administrative decisions,
   decision-making and public service provision new tools and methods have
   been introduced. We should emphasise, that the centrally operated
   platforms can be even interpreted as a new, ???soft??? tool of the
   centralisation. However, the Polish and Hungarian systems are similar,
   but there are differences which are related to the different competences
   and spatial structure of the municipal systems of the two countries.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses a recent turn in the ethics of refugee resettlement
   which involves taking the interests of refugees themselves into account
   in the distribution of refugees among potential refugee receiving
   countries. It argues that there is an important category of interest
   that does not align with the two commonly held views on what is owed to
   refugees: `safety' or `conditions of a good life'. This category,
   focussing on the refugees' interests in not being subjected to a variety
   of non-asylum-grounding injustices, should, by default, take precedence
   in the assessment of the refugee-based reasons in refugee resettlement.
   The normative salience of this category - not being subjected to
   injustice - is illustrated with the help of the case of LGBTIQ+
   refugees, and the kinds of injustices they may be subject to in
   countries that provide them with asylum.},

Abstract = {In Germany, the Russian war on Ukraine is widely perceived as a
   ``Zeitenwende,{''} a watershed moment undermining key foreign policy
   beliefs. Despite mounting evidence contradicting them, German elites
   previously failed to adapt core beliefs regarding Russia and the use of
   force because these beliefs were not only deeply embedded in largely
   uncontested identity constructions but also shaped the definition of
   economic interests, which in turn made ideational adaptation more
   costly. Moreover, Germany's extraordinarily beneficial geopolitical
   situation in the post-Cold War era meant that the country could afford
   not to learn. Although the ``Zeitenwende{''} will trigger significant
   change, it is unclear which lessons exactly Germans will now be learning
   and how far that adaptation will go. Given Germany's key position in
   Europe and its previous role in shaping the European and transatlantic
   policy toward Russia, the results of these learning processes will
   significantly shape the emerging European security order.},

Abstract = {The ``labor border{''} is an analytical tool, a legal device for
   controlling incoming migration flows through government initiatives
   related to the employment system. Two programs for temporary
   legalization of migrants implemented by the Mexican government in the
   context of the so-called Central American exodus-the Estas en Tu Casa
   (You Are at Home) plan and the Emision de Tarjetas de Visitante por
   Razones Humanitarias (Issuance of Visitor Cards for Humanitarian
   Reasons) program-are examples of such devices. A review based on recent
   research on their impacts on the mobility of migrants as they cross the
   southern Mexican border on their way to the United States contributes to
   the debate over the outsourcing of border controls in the framework of
   the dependent relationship between Mexican migration policy and U.S.
   security strategy. La ``frontera laboral{''} es una herramienta
   analitica, un dispositivo legal para controlar los flujos migratorios
   entrantes a traves de iniciativas gubernamentales relacionadas con el
   sistema de empleo. Dos programas de legalizacion temporal de migrantes
   implementados por el gobierno mexicano en el contexto del llamado exodo
   centroamericano-el plan Estas en Tu Casa y el programa Emision de
   Tarjetas de Visitante por Razones Humanitarias-son un ejemplo de dichos
   dispositivos. Una revision basada en investigaciones recientes sobre sus
   impactos en la movilidad de los migrantes al cruzar la frontera sur de
   Mexico en su camino hacia los Estados Unidos contribuye al debate sobre
   la externalizacion de los controles fronterizos en el marco de la
   relacion de dependencia entre la politica migratoria mexicana y la
   estrategia de seguridad de los Estados Unidos.},

Title = {New pathways to paradigm change in public policy: combining insights
   from policy design, mix and feedback},
Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},

Abstract = {To tackle the manifold crises of our times, most notably the
   environmental crises we face, ambitious policy change is urgently needed
   to achieve the necessary radical transformation of our industrialised
   societies. Yet, while there is increasing demand for public policy
   scholarship to provide guidance on how policy should be designed to
   achieve such change, existing scholarship struggles to provide
   ???forward-looking??? recommendations. Within this context, our article
   takes a step back to reconsider the underlying logics of policy change.
   We argue that focusing on policy, its effect and the subsequent politics
   it triggers is best achieved by combining insights from the policy
   design, policy mix and policy feedback literatures. This combination
   allows us to re-evaluate which potential pathways towards policy change
   exist. The main contribution of our article is its proposition of two
   distinct pathways towards policy change, building on a systematic
   understanding of policy design elements. These pathways place greater
   emphasis on policy change happening (1) ???bottom-up??? through initial
   low-level design changes rather than ???top-down??? through high-level
   ideational change, as argued in earlier scholarship, (2) through the
   interplay of several policies in a complex mix. In this way, these
   pathways provide a useful framework for systematically analysing how
   policy should be designed to achieve ambitious policy change and thus
   enable transformative societal change.},

Abstract = {With Patrick Crusuis' 2019 attack that killed twenty-two people in El
   Paso, Texas, discussions of ecofascism were thrust into mainstream news
   outlets and magazines. In his manifesto, Crusius described himself as an
   ``ecofascist{''} seeking to challenge the ``environmental warfare{''} of
   immigration. His choice of target, a Walmart frequented by Mexican
   immigrants, reflects this ideological connection between ecological
   priorities and violent white supremacist ideology. In this paper, the
   authors provide a review of existing theoretical literature on
   ecofascism to identify its key characteristics, namely, its Romantic
   sensibilities, anti-humanism, and mysticism. The authors argue that
   these features distinguish ecofascism from what other scholars have
   deemed ``far-right ecologisms.{''} Following this, the authors draw on a
   larger corpus of data gathered from Twitter and Telegram between
   November 2019 and November 2020 to identify common themes in ecofascist
   circles, including the thinkers they frequently cite. The dataset
   examined shows notable differences in the types of content shared in
   ecofascist groups compared to the far-right more broadly.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus pandemic has fundamentally shifted the way human beings
   interact, both as individuals and groups, in the face of such a
   widespread outbreak. This paper seeks to investigate the effects of
   COVID-19 on intergroup emotions and attitudes within an intractable
   intergroup conflict, specifically, through the lens of the Korean
   conflict. Using a two-wave, cross-sectional design, this study was able
   to track the profound psychological changes in intergroup emotions and
   attitudes both prior to the pandemic and during its onslaught. Results
   of these two wave representative samples show that South Korean citizens
   demonstrated higher levels of fear of their neighbors in North Korea
   after the outbreak of COVID-19 than before. In turn, this led to
   increased societal support of hostile government policies towards North
   Koreans. Conversely, the same participants exhibited higher levels of
   empathy towards North Koreans during the pandemic, which led to a higher
   willingness to collaborate with their outgroup. This dual effect on
   intergroup emotions within intractable conflicts brings forth new
   avenues from which societies may be able to restrain the destructive
   influence of the COVID-19 threat on intergroup relations - as well as
   harvesting its constructive potential for reconciling warring intergroup
   relations.},

Abstract = {Increasingly, scholars agree that role of ideology in civil wars goes
   beyond mere window-dressing. With respect to leftist insurgencies, we
   argue that ideology provides insurgent groups an understanding of
   pivotal constituents (urban or rural) and the timing of revolution
   (imminent or distant). These factors shape insurgent groups'
   politico-military strategies, which may be insurrectionary, militarist
   Maoist, or protracted people's war. We develop case studies of the FARC
   and the EPL in Colombia, and the CPI(ML) and Andhra Maoists in India,
   using primary sources including conference proceedings, newsletters,
   pamphlets, and letters of insurgent groups and leaders.},

Abstract = {Negotiation is one of the regulating principles of international
   organizations. Although largely studied in material terms (climate,
   trade, armaments, etc.), it also concerns the conquest of international
   positions, where States sometimes negotiate in favour of certain of
   their partners. Our article deals with the case of the Organisation
   internationale de la Francophonie (oif), and analyses the French option
   of negotiating a consensus in favour of Rwanda for the election to the
   General Secretariat in 2018. After a conceptual clarification on
   `negotiation for others' in International Relations, our article returns
   to the historical variables of the elections to this position, before
   unfolding the strategies operationalised by France in 2018. We learn
   that the steering of francophone multilateralism is based on a hegemonic
   approach by France, which is facilitated by regular divisions between
   Africans, a relative caution of Canada and a quasi-indifference of Asian
   countries members of the Francophonie. All this allows France to
   maintain a flexible articulation between its interests, those of its
   partners, and the principles and values promoted by this organization.},

Title = {Wrestlemania! Summit Diplomacy and Foreign Policy Performance after
   Trump},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {In this article, we propose the category of ``foreign policy
   performance{''} in order to argue that a recognition of foreign policy's
   theatricality can illuminate its contribution to generative processes of
   social construction and world-making. We focus on the practice of summit
   diplomacy, which operates according to a ``theatrical rationality{''}
   that blurs the boundary between substantive and symbolic politics.
   Noting that Donald Trump's presidency called into question many of
   international relations' prevailing assumptions regarding foreign
   policy's formulation and execution, we suggest that a
   performance-oriented analytic can facilitate a critical reckoning both
   with Trump himself and with the ``statesmanlike{''} norms he eschewed.
   We read Trump's performances at international summits with reference to
   professional wrestling, which for all its melodramatic absurdity is a
   venerable and complex theatrical tradition with a highly developed
   critical language. Guided by four pieces of wrestling argot
   ({''}heat,{''} ``heel,{''} ``kayfabe,{''} and ``cutting a promo{''}), we
   use process-tracing techniques to develop a wrestling-oriented reading
   of Trump's 2018 summit with Kim Jong-Un in Singapore. We argue that
   using wrestling in order to read Trump and Kim's deviation from the
   conventional norms and repertoires of foreign policy performance enables
   a critical assessment of the stakes at play in their reconstruction and
   re-establishment.},

Abstract = {The Shatt al-Arab River (SAR) is a transboundary river between Iraq and
   Iran. The bulk of it has traditionally been under Iraqi jurisdiction,
   yet Iran has always held significant influence. This paper applies the
   framework of hydro-hegemony to distinguish between two different
   hegemonic configurations operated over SAR. In the first period, Iran
   exercised coercive tactics, prompting Iraq to sign the Algeria Accord in
   1975. However, after four years, the eight-year war between the two
   states revoked this institutional order, paving the way for a new era.
   During this period, which began dominantly after 2003, Iran exerted soft
   power. The Iranian Islamic regime manipulated ties with Iraqi elites to
   influence the course of Iraqi policy. Nonetheless, by helping Iraqis
   defeat ISIS and curbing the Kurdish issues following their referendum to
   separate from Iraq in 2017, Iran ensured the majority of Iraqis' willing
   acquiescence. Consequently, it contained SAR on its own terms.},

Abstract = {The destruction of heritage in conflict has emerged as a key challenge
   to global security and the prospects of peace. In response to the
   deliberate targeting of heritage sites by the Islamic State (IS) and
   other actors in recent years, the international community has launched a
   number of initiatives designed to protect and reconstruct key heritage
   sites in complex (post-)conflict contexts. However, this article
   demonstrates that such initiatives are often underpinned by the norm
   that the protection of heritage in conflict can serve to enhance the
   prospects of reconciliation, stability and peace. This article
   problematizes this norm by focussing on the case study of Shia responses
   to the targeting of their religious heritage sites by the IS in Iraq
   from mid-2014. It documents the ways that key Shia leaders
   instrumentalized the case of protecting heritage not to advance peace
   and security, but to create entirely new militias, to recruit thousands
   of Shia faithful, to mobilize them to fight against the IS, and to
   engage in violence and human rights abuses. This raises significant
   concerns about whether the promotion of heritage as a pathway to peace
   could inadvertently exacerbate conflict and lead to renewed waves of
   violence and heritage destruction.},

Abstract = {Is making semiconductors in Europe a good idea? With the introduction of
   the European Chips Act in early 2022, this is no longer an academic
   question. In this article we evaluate these plans in light of a
   wider-but remarkably one-sided-debate on industrial policy in advanced
   capitalist economies. Instead of focusing on policymakers, as most
   students of industrial policy have done, we draw attention to two
   first-order conditions that determine the chances of policy success: the
   existence of (proto-)competitive incumbents, and the alignment of the
   policy objectives with the prevailing institutional framework. We rely
   on that framework to evaluate the successes and failures in European
   aerospace, German biotech, and French computers, before using these
   insights to evaluate the European Chips Act. Investing in manufacturing
   of mature chips is, in that light, not a good idea. We suggest, instead,
   that the EU should concentrate on market segments that leverage its
   high-skill workplaces and world-class research system, and in which
   Europe has either already developed a comparative advantage or will not
   find itself at an initial disadvantage.},

Abstract = {This article explores transformational change in public policy through
   community-based governance and the collective design of
   experience-oriented policy and action. Using a critical -interpretive
   theoretical perspective, we derived three key lessons in achieving this
   change from the experience of Parais??polis, a Brazilian favela made
   famous for its COVID-19 successful response plan, despite historical
   state abandonment and overlapping vulnerabilities. The three lessons
   were (i) proximity coordination, (ii) collective learning, and (iii)
   affectionate relationality. All three underpinned the principle of
   ???community activism??? and ???deliberative empowerment???, which in
   turn were both crucial in effecting democratic transformations. Through
   our case study of Parais??polis, we argue that transformational change
   crucially involved civil society engagement alongside inclusive
   deliberative forums. This reinforces the need to pursue a policy
   research agenda attentive to sociocentric experiences, ordinary actors
   and the emotions and values underlying public action.},

Abstract = {An extensive regime for marine biodiversity in `areas beyond national
   jurisdiction' is currently discussed under the United Nations. A key
   aspect of its institutional design concerns the integrative quality of
   the treaty that is to be developed on the conservation and sustainable
   use of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction - called the `BBNJ
   Agreement'. There is a large number of global and regional policy
   instruments regulating activities in the areas beyond national
   jurisdiction. Yet, issues of integrating and coordinating these
   instruments prevail, raising the question how a new treaty could provide
   for environmental policy integration in ocean governance. This paper
   draws on environmental policy integration literature of the past three
   decades to explore, ex ante, to what extent the planned ocean treaty can
   contribute to more institutional harmonization. It examines how the
   treaty addresses four key policy-making dimensions of environmental
   policy integration, and new opportunities and challenges that have
   emerged, based on the attributes of the treaty provisions and its
   institutional architecture. This paper concludes that the BBNJ Agreement
   offers an alternative policy framework which has the potential to
   enhance the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity by
   triggering more international cooperation and collaboration and filling
   gaps in ocean governance.},

Abstract = {Because existing issue classification schemes omit prominent issues
   (e.g., domestic armed conflict) or contain significant within-category
   heterogeneity, theorizing about the role of issues in international
   conflict processes has stagnated. Our project jump-starts it again, by
   independently-and systematically-reconceptualizing and gathering data on
   five issues connected to dyadic militarized interstate disputes (MIDs)
   during the period 1900-2010: land (borders), maritime (borders),
   islands, civil conflict, and coups. After conceptually introducing these
   issues and embedding them within a larger framework, we describe and
   apply our MID-Issue data. These efforts show that (i) the MID dataset's
   issue classification scheme does not systematically capture our issues,
   (ii) events in 37.58\% of dyadic MIDs connect to domestic armed
   conflict-a prevalence not on the field's radar, (iii) some factors
   promote issue-based international conflict, but only via indirect
   channels, and (iv) significant value even derives from a further
   conceptualization of ``territorial issues{''} (broadly defined).},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine personal narratives on premarital sex by two
   generations of Polish men and women-one born in the 1950s and 1960s, and
   their parents' generation, born in the 1920s and 1930s and coming of age
   during or after World War II-and place these in dialogue with discourses
   surrounding young sexuality in state-socialist Poland. Using
   sociological surveys, popular sexological literature, and Catholic
   marriage preparation material, we contextualize accounts of premarital
   heterosexual experiences, provided through oral history interviews and
   contest memoirs-ego documents submitted for autobiographic writing
   competitions in the 1960s and 1970s. We show there was no clear division
   between public secular and Catholic approaches to premarital
   (hetero)sexuality, with both opposing sexual experimentation before and
   beyond marriage throughout the state-socialist period (1945-1989).
   However, across the same period, young people's acceptance of premarital
   sexual experimentation increased and the importance of a woman remaining
   a virgin until marriage declined. Our analysis of discourses and
   experiences reveals the connections and intersections of secular and
   Catholic realms. While secular experts did not conceptualize premarital
   sex as a sin, they often mirrored Catholic views by framing their
   discourse in terms of love, sex, responsibility, and potential risk.
   Young people negotiated various elements of these teachings in their
   premarital sexual practices, which, during the final decades of state
   socialism, were largely normalized, especially when couples were
   planning to marry.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {This article examines the circumstances of 16 Children Born of War
   (CBOW) who participated in a classroom activity designed to understand
   their experiences of integration at a local school in post war northern
   Uganda. The children are part of a generation of returnees who were
   conceived as a result of sexual violence and forced marriages between
   the commanders of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and young girls
   abducted from their communities. The research at the Alur Primary School
   (APS) articulates the children's views, and how this one school managed
   to integrate CBOW and war-affected children, treating each as special,
   to advance their learning and their education. Specifically, each of the
   181 war-affected children involved in the class activity was given a
   chance to recall key moments of their time at APS. Their write-ups were
   analyzed into themes illustrating what happened when CBOW were
   integrated into the school, and how the school responded to their
   educational needs. The activity did not isolate CBOW from their non-CBOW
   peers, hence giving every child the opportunity to freely express their
   views regardless of their background. This article contributes to our
   understanding of how schools, as one of the most influential
   institutions that shape the development of children, can foreground the
   voices of CBOW as beneficiaries of education and actors in their own
   right.},

Abstract = {This editorial argues for understanding socio-economics as an
   interdisciplinary space. While economic sociology and political economy
   are largely grounded in disciplines, the scope of socio-economics
   extends beyond any disciplinary subfields. But rather than a grand
   integration, a realistic aspiration behind this project is establishing
   a space of dialogue and engagement between them. Here scholarly
   innovation can take place in a more phenomenon-driven form and via
   eclectic borrowing and blending of discipline-based theories and
   methods. The next challenge facing socio-economics is to expand this
   interdisciplinary space from encompassing the Global North to engage
   with scholarship on and scholars from the Global South. This long-term
   challenge reflects very deep economic and social inequalities. The
   editorial offers several modest observations regarding the practices of
   writing and publication, while calling for a wider conversation about
   these issues. Specifically, the editorial highlights the potential of
   leveraging cross-context engagement with concepts to further new
   theoretical development.},

Title = {How Brazil embraced informal organizations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 APR 28},
Abstract = {Brazil's foreign policy strategy traditionally focused on formal
   international organizations and ways to strengthen its role in them,
   symbolized by efforts to become a permanent UN Security Council member,
   and by accelerating voting reform in the Bretton Woods institutions.
   These goals were underpinned by a notion that the institutions that are
   at the heart of post-WWI order, while not providing emerging powers with
   the space and responsibilities that they deserved, still represented the
   ideal platforms for Brazil to defend its national interests. Yet despite
   some progress in gaining greater visibility, its overall experience over
   the past two decades has been frustrating, a dynamic that is crucial to
   understand Brazil's turn to informal organizations such as BRICS and the
   G20, which became the pillars of its foreign policy strategy in the
   2000s. Indeed, the country's emphasis on informal structures remained
   even after a center-left government supportive of multilateralism has
   been replaced by a right-wing president who supports
   ``anti-globalism{''} and who frequently criticizes the United Nations.
   This article explores Brazil's transition and the tensions that it has
   created between formal organizations-both globally or regionally-with
   the contagion dynamics of informality. It then discusses implications
   for global governance.},

Abstract = {The rise of nationalist and populist movements throughout the world has
   led to concerns about the future of the liberal international economic
   order. Central to these worries is the belief that nationalist and
   populist publics and their leaders will reject open trade, which has
   been a cornerstone of the global order. Yet despite these fears, very
   little empirical research has been conducted on the links between either
   nationalism or populism and trade policy. In this paper, we argue that
   nationalism and populism are likely to discourage trade liberalization
   in democratic states, but that these forces will have little influence
   on trade policy in non-democracies. To test this argument, we focus on
   state involvement in preferential trade agreements (PTAs). Based on a
   variety of tests, we find considerable support for our argument.
   Democracies with nationalist or populist governments are especially
   reluctant to join PTAs, but neither nationalism nor populism
   systematically influences whether non-democracies enter PTAs.},

Abstract = {This article explores how different anti-establishment parties (AEPs)
   can themselves strategically enact an image of both distinctiveness and
   `normality' behind their political offer. For this purpose, we directly
   measure and map diverse anti-establishment normalisation strategies by
   analysing 142 social media campaigns of radical right, left, and
   `centrist' AEPs and their conventional competitors during 23 elections
   in Europe during 2010-2019. We find that while AEPs presented themselves
   as fundamentally distinct from `politics as usual', they simultaneously
   attempted to normalise their contestation supply across and within two
   dimensions: mainstreaming and streamlining. Using regression analysis,
   we further find that the degree to which AEPs rhetorically normalised
   their supply was positively and significantly associated with their
   broader electoral appeal ceteris paribus, controlling for substantive
   issue positions, parliamentary experience and position in government.
   Concurrently, the effects of particular normalisation strategies and
   their specific calibration varied for the radical right and left. The
   findings deepen our comparative understanding of diverse
   anti-establishment strategies used in party competition.},

Abstract = {We study the conditions under which the European Court of Justice (ECJ)
   expanded the European Union's reach into issues of national judicial
   independence. The ECJ's 2018 ruling in a case known as Portuguese Judges
   contained a far-reaching constitutional interpretation that had a
   transformative impact on the European Union's rule of law crisis. We
   conduct a theoretically guided investigation into both the domestic
   origins and the judicial outcome in the Portuguese Judges case. We show
   how the ECJ, with implicit support from the majority of the Member
   States, strategically exploited suitable characteristics of an
   inconspicuous case to produce a landmark ruling that enabled
   unprecedented enforcement action against democratic backsliding in
   Poland and Hungary.},

Abstract = {This article provides an introduction to a collection of papers that
   engage an institutional analysis approach called the Institutional
   Grammar (IG). Over the last decade, scholars have employed the IG in
   diverse ways and domains to study key concepts and aspects of the
   policymaking process, such as policy design, policy change, and policy
   implementation. Throughout this period, scholars of public policy, and
   various other fields, have showcased how the IG can be used in the
   assessment of such, as well as how the IG can be used in conjunction
   with various methodological approaches to respond to a diverse array of
   research aims. This introduction (i) provides an overview of the IG;
   (ii) identifies cross-cutting themes presented within the collection of
   papers recently published in the Policy Studies Journal that feature
   applications of the IG; (iii) identifies opportunities for future
   research based on this and other recently published work featuring that
   IG.},

Title = {Perceptions and Evaluations of Incivility in Public Online
   Discussions-Insights From Focus Groups With Different Online Actors},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {Incivility in public online discussions has received much scholarly
   attention in recent years. Still, there is controversy regarding what
   exactly constitutes incivility and hardly any study has examined in
   depth what different participants of online discussions perceive as
   uncivil. Building on a new theoretical approach to incivility as a
   violation of communication norms, this study aims to close this research
   gap: In five heterogenous focus groups, different types of actors in
   online discussions, namely community managers, users, and members of
   online activist groups, discussed what they perceive as norm-violating
   and how these violations differ in terms of severity. Results suggest
   that incivility is a multidimensional construct and that the severity of
   different norm violations varies significantly. Although the actors
   share a relatively large common ground as to what they perceive as
   uncivil, several role-specific perceptions and individual evaluation
   criteria become apparent. Based on the results, a differentiated
   typology of perceived incivility in public online discussions is
   developed.},

Abstract = {Political, military and humanitarian crises endanger regional order. But
   even though regional powers are expected to act as stabilizers in these
   cases, their responses to dire demands vary in intensity and loci.
   Reactions go from zealous engagement to prolonged indifference and
   reluctance, often leaning on global multilateral institutions as well as
   regional or ad hoc mechanisms. This study explores the variation in the
   provision of stability by regional powers via a mixed-methods approach.
   By contrasting the intensity of regional crises with issue salience at
   the UN General Assembly, we select crises that drew varying attention
   from regional powers, despite similar severity. Focusing on Brazil and
   South Africa as potential regional stabilizers, we compare responses to
   regional crises that displayed high (Haiti and Somalia) and low
   (Colombia and Congo-Brazzaville) salience. We find that domestic
   support, concerns with status and potential competition with other
   stabilizers tend to play a large part in calibrating regional power
   responses.},

Abstract = {Recently, critical voices have raised concerns that EU member states are
   unwilling to express solidarity and proclaimed that EU solidarity was
   dead. Surprisingly, the Schengen Area, as opposed to asylum policies,
   has been examined only sporadically in this context. Although there is
   overall agreement that solidarity is a necessary precondition for the
   functioning of Schengen cooperation, it has multiple meanings. Hence,
   theoretically drawing on the concept of solidarity and methodologically
   employing the Discourse Historical Approach (DHA), this study attempts
   to find out how solidarity is conceptualised in legislative and
   political discourse on Schengen cooperation. It does so by identifying
   the argumentation strategies of the main actors. The main findings are
   that whereas scholars tend to link solidarity to free movement and
   incoming refugees, legislative and political discourse emphasise
   external border controls. Indeed, this suggests that Schengen will
   remain resilient as long as its security is ensured, no matter the
   reimpositions of internal borders. These are perceived as a remedy to
   Schengen deficiencies rather than a problem per se. Also, in line with
   EU legislation, the interstate dimension of solidarity clearly prevails
   within Schengen.},

Abstract = {Why do some states possess more advanced military technologies than
   others? Our study explores the vertical proliferation of land-attack
   cruise missiles (LACMs), seeking to understand which demand- and
   supply-side factors best explain why some countries acquire more
   sophisticated LACMs. We theorize that states' security environments,
   regime types, possession of related strategic technologies, and
   membership in the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) influence the
   possession of more sophisticated cruise missiles. Our analysis employs a
   unique new global dataset with granular data on every LACM national
   militaries have deployed. We use this dataset to evaluate the
   proliferation of LACMs across the international system from 1991-2015.
   Using a selection model that first controls for the horizontal
   proliferation of LACMs, we find that insecurity, scientific and
   technical expertise from related technologies, the possession of highly
   authoritarian and highly democratic regimes, and MTCR membership all
   have positive effects on the sophistication of LACM-possessors'
   arsenals.},

Abstract = {Although the humanitarian sector has gained prominence in the management
   of contemporary conflicts, data on the diversity of organizations
   involved in humanitarian aid are scarce and do not rely on well-founded
   inclusion criteria. This lack of data limits not only our knowledge of
   humanitarian action but also our understanding of international security
   and of non-state actors' role in foreign aid. The Humanitarian
   Organisations Dataset (HOD) seeks to fill these gaps. Based on clear and
   reproducible criteria, 2,505 organizations active in the humanitarian
   sector have been identified while information on their history, nature,
   activities, and geographical location has been collected. Our analyses
   depart from prevailing Western-centered accounts of humanitarian, show
   regional variations in types of organizations, and identify distinct
   historical patterns by region and by type of organization. They also
   document a large span of humanitarian activities, going beyond the
   current exclusive focus on in-kind assistance. We illustrate how the
   dataset can contribute to further research through its combination with
   other data and explore the relationship between NGOs and governments in
   humanitarian aid funding. Beyond its value for scholars, we anticipate
   that the HOD will also be of interest to policymakers and nonacademic
   users concerned with humanitarian action and crisis-management issues.},

Abstract = {This Debate addresses the `Eastern turn' in policy and direction among
   Africa's fast growing lion economies. It focuses in particular on recent
   recommendations in the African political economy literature for a
   reorientation in investment towards low-wage, labour-intensive
   manufacturing industries. Drawing on relevant empirical studies from
   Asia, it argues that there are significant gendered implications to this
   Eastern turn which, to date, have largely been ignored in the mainstream
   African literature. A widening of discourse and policy in ways that move
   beyond `add women and stir' approaches, to address broader structural
   constraints to women's economic participation, is recommended.},

Title = {Knowledge Transfer in the Global South: Reusing or Creating Knowledge in
   China's Special Economic Zones in Ethiopia and Cambodia?},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {45-57},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Chinese special economic zones (SEZs) have played a key role in
   attracting massive foreign investment and in facilitating knowledge and
   technology transfer to local companies. This explains the mushrooming of
   Chinese-led SEZs and industrial parks in parts of Southeast Asia and
   Africa since the early 2000s, and more recently its prominence in the
   planning of the economic corridors along the Belt and Road Initiative.
   Our interest in SEZs derives from the fact that they provide novel
   grounds to investigate the dynamics of knowledge transfer (KT) in
   South-South exchanges and the extent to which it diverges from more
   traditional exchanges. This study undertakes a comparative analysis of
   KT in the Eastern Industrial Zone (EIZ) in Ethiopia, and the
   Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone (SSEZ) in Cambodia. The case studies
   suggest that, although the provision of training by Chinese investors
   has added value to the labour force, its transformative impact is
   limited owing to the concentration on explicit KT modalities at lower
   skills levels and the top-down approach to KT by Chinese companies.

Abstract = {There is an urgent need to study illiberal political values. However,
   current efforts have focused on democratic values, democratic support,
   populist attitudes, and authoritarian values. Consequently, they have
   missed something older and more fundamental, namely, political
   illiberalism. Hence, I pave the way for future inquiries by proposing
   and validating a composite measure built upon a reverse engineering of
   political illiberalism from existing works on illiberal democracy,
   political intolerance, and the normative philosophy of political
   liberalism. Through quantitative psycho-political analysis (i.e., factor
   analysis, internal reliability tests, and basic descriptive statistics),
   I posit and dissect an index responding to the limits of existing ones.
   Overall, I define illiberal political values as a value system
   constituted by intolerant and leader-centric values tied with
   anti-institutionalist tendencies.},

Title = {Bribing and Social Desirability in Peru: A Mixed Methods Approach},
Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {21-49},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Objective/Context: What could lead some individuals to be more prone to
   lie about engaging in corruption? We contend that a psychological
   approach to the study of corruption can be employed to understand who
   lies about corrupt behavior and why. Since social desirability bias
   (SDB) is related to the appropriateness of behavior, conflicting social
   norms in a context where corruption is widespreadlike in several Latin
   American countries-can result in SDB in the context of surveys that
   directly ask for past corrupt behavior. Moreover, due to conflicting
   norms, some subgroups of the population might be particularly affected
   by SDB. Methodology: Together, focus groups, list experiments, and
   survey data provide evidence that supports our psychological approach.
   Conclusion: Overall, we confirm that SDB is at work even in a context in
   which corruption is widespread like Peru. Statistically speaking, we
   only find evidence in support of the existence of gender socialization
   as an important source of SDB when directly reporting past bribing
   behavior in Peru. However, other substantive-not statistically
   significant-differences related to age merit further discussion and
   research. Originality: This work has two main contributions; first, it
   highlights the importance designing unobtrusive measures when studying
   the prevalence of corrupt practices in Latin America; and second, it
   shows that policy interventions to fight corruption may not be equally
   effective across different groups of the population.},

Title = {Assessments of Digital Client Representations: How Frontline Workers
   Reconstruct Client Narratives from Fragmented Information},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-29},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Street-level bureaucrats assess increasing amounts of digital, often
   text-based, client representations. These representations have been
   criticized for oversimplification. However, frontline workers have also
   been known to develop simplified perceptions, or ``shortcuts,{''} in
   their work. This study explores frontline workers' assessments of
   digital client representations using observations of 15 needs
   assessments and 7 follow-up interviews from the Norwegian Labor and
   Welfare Administration (NAV). Based on simple information garnered from
   an online registration, workers decide how much assistance clients need
   from NAV to find work. Findings show that the online registration
   deconstructs client narratives into separate pieces of information,
   which the workers attempt to reconstruct back into coherent narratives.
   Using a street-level perspective, this article argues that the
   reconstructions are coping responses to fragmented information. Unlike
   traditional simplification responses, the workers complicate their
   perceptions of clients in the assessments. That is, street-level
   bureaucrats take ``detours{''} to provide responsive services and manage
   the limitations of electronic government. Thus, this article provides an
   empirical contribution that also forms the basis for abductive
   theorization and suggests that the conceptual boundaries of coping
   strategies should be expanded to include ``complication responses.{''}
   In contrast to the emphasis on face-to-face meetings in street-level
   literature, this article highlights the importance of texts.},

Title = {COVID-19 Induced Misinformation on YouTube: An Analysis of User
   Commentary},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Several scholars have demonstrated a positive link between political
   polarization and the resistance to COVID-19 prevention measures. At the
   same time, political polarization has also been associated with the
   spread of misinformation. This study investigates the theoretical
   linkages between polarization and misinformation and measures the flow
   of misinformation about COVID-19 in the comment sections of four popular
   YouTube channels for over 16 months using big data sources and methods.
   For the analysis, we downloaded about 3.5M English language YouTube
   comments posted in response to videos about the pandemic. We then
   classified the comments into one of the two following categories by
   applying a supervised Natural Language Processing classifier: (1) fake:
   comments that contain claims and speculation which are verifiably not
   true; and (2) legitimate: comments that do not fall into the fake
   category. The results show that the level of misinformation in YouTube
   comment sections has increased during the pandemic, that fake comments
   attract statistically more likes, and that the ratio of fake comments
   increased by 0.4\% per month. These findings suggest that once
   introduced into an online discussion, misinformation potentially leads
   to an escalating spiral of misinformation comments, which undermines
   public policy. Overall, the results signal alarming pandemic-related
   misinformation and, potentially, rising levels of affective
   polarization. We place these results in context and point out the

Abstract = {Governing by indicators has emerged as the predominant mode of global
   public policy. Consequently, global governance has become a field in
   which different indicators compete for policymakers' and public
   attention. This begs a question-what makes some indicators successful
   when others become irrelevant? This paper explores this problem through
   the inquiry into the measurement of multidimensional poverty in
   Sustainable Development Goal 1 ({''}End poverty in all its forms
   everywhere{''}). In the field historically dominated by the World Bank's
   dollar-per-day metric (currently 1.9\$), multidimensional poverty
   measurement gained prominence, becoming one of the key measures of
   global poverty. By tracking the pathways to success of multidimensional
   poverty measurement-through qualitative interviews with actors in
   International Organisations this paper argues that the key quality of
   successful indicators is their ability to become parts of the broader
   epistemic infrastructure, linking political institutions, actors
   (including experts and policymakers), and data and statistics. The paper
   brings the focus on a specific set of actors-statistical
   entrepreneurs-who advocate for innovations in measurement and work
   toward creating such infrastructures, thus indirectly promoting new
   policy ideas reflected in the metrics.},

Abstract = {Research on UN peacekeeping operations has established that operations'
   size and composition affect peacekeeping success. However, we lack
   systematic data for evaluating whether variation in tasks assigned to UN
   peacekeeping mandates matters and what explains different configurations
   of mandated tasks in the first place. Drawing on UN Security Council
   resolutions that establish, extend, or revise mandates of 27 UN
   peacekeeping operations in Africa in the 1991-2017 period, the
   Peacekeeping Mandates (PEMA) dataset fills this gap. It records 41
   distinct tasks, ranging from disarmament to reconciliation and electoral
   support. For each task, the PEMA dataset also distinguishes between
   three modalities of engagement (monitoring, assisting, and securing) and
   whether the task is requested or merely encouraged. To illustrate the
   usefulness of our data, we re-examine Hultman, Kathman, and Shannon's
   (2013) analysis of operations' ability to protect civilians. Our results
   show that host governments and rebel groups respond differently to
   civilian protection mandates.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) Emissions Trading System (ETS) has been
   established for more than 15 years, but limited attention has been given
   to how the changing political environment may affect the policy. We
   address this gap by investigating how the EU enlargement after 2004
   affected the ETS and how the effects have been buffered. We develop a
   framework of institutional resilience to investigate how the established
   norms and institutional constellation of the EU legislative triumvirate
   have been instrumental for buffering the effects of the enlargement on
   ETS policymaking. We find that the existing power structure and
   functional complementarity of the EU legislative settings have fostered
   a consensus-building atmosphere in the ETS decision-making to
   accommodate preference heterogeneity and to absorb the compositional
   impact after the enlargement. The findings highlight the importance of
   contextual factors and institutional settings in ETS analysis and
   suggest a new perspective for assessing dynamic ETS performance.},

Abstract = {Based on a case study and media content analysis, we rely on insights
   from the advocacy coalition framework and from the narrative policy
   framework to conduct a congruence analysis of the French politics of
   hydraulic fracturing (2010-2017). Despite the lobbying of a resourceful
   coalition of pro-fracturing policy actors and their strategy of active
   participation in various professional forums, hydraulic fracturing was
   partially banned in 2011 and completely prohibited in 2017. Our results
   relate this ban to the stronger repetition of a simpler framing of the
   policy problem by the members of the anti-fracturing coalition. In other
   words, coalition members willing to transform their policy beliefs into
   concrete decisions should frame them into loud and simple policy
   narratives. These findings call for further articulation between the
   narrative policy framework and the advocacy coalition framework to
   account for narratives as the essence of strategies that advocacy
   coalitions develop for influencing policy processes.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do battlefield coalitions fight as greater or less
   than the sum of their parts? Introducing the Belligerents in Battle
   dataset, which contains information on actors fighting in 492 battles
   during interstate wars waged between 1900 and 2003, we present, for the
   first time, a portrait of the universe of battlefield coalitions.
   Battlefield coalitions win more often and suffer fewer casualties than
   belligerents fighting alone. Battlefield coalitions including forces
   fielded by the United States, states with pre-existing treaty
   agreements, and democracies are particularly powerful. By contrast,
   battlefield coalitions that include non-state actors lose the majority
   of their fights.},

Abstract = {This article explores the global campaign against slavery carried out by
   the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (the BFASS) during the
   nineteenth century. The BFASS strove to frame British anti-slavery as
   exportable to settings abroad, including the USA, Brazil, Spain, and the
   Netherlands. Drawing on a range of primary sources-including
   newsletters, meeting minutes, and memos-this article unpacks how the
   BFASS repurposed the British anti-slavery movement into the global
   anti-slavery movement. In pursuit of this aim, the BFASS was a flawed
   organization that adopted positions toward Britain's naval effort to
   suppress the trade of enslaved persons in the Atlantic and the North's
   campaign within the American Civil War incongruous with its commitment
   to abolitionism. Accordingly, the article explores why the organization
   adopted policy positions that contradicted its professed mission.},

Abstract = {Since China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the WTO
   dispute settlement system (DSS) has resolved an impressive number of
   US-China trade disputes. Over the past few years, however, as tensions
   between the two have escalated over several trade issues, the WTO has
   been pushed toward irrelevance since the Trump administration. Alleging
   that the WTO is ``a disaster{''} and its adjudication is very unfair to
   the US, former President Trump made no effort to hide his criticism of
   the WTO and its DSS in particular. Is Trump right about the WTO DSS?
   Based on an examination of US-China WTO disputes and the WTO
   adjudicators' highly contentious interpretations of the concept of
   ``public body{''} under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing
   Measures (the SCM Agreement) as an example, this article shows that the
   WTO DSS is not particularly unfair to the US. While the WTO adjudicators
   sometimes did not fully follow the positions advocated by the US, they
   have adhered to generally accepted rules of treaty interpretation and
   exercised great caution to remain balanced and flexible in reaching
   their conclusions, especially on ambiguous issues. Though not perfect,
   the WTO DSS works as it is intended to. Engaging in the reform of the
   WTO and its DSS, instead of abandoning or marginalizing the WTO, should
   be a wiser and more practical choice for the Biden administration.},

Title = {How does network position influence project performance in Chinese
   megaprojects? An inter-organizational conflict-based perspective},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {448-474},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to explore the relationship between network
   position, various types of inter-organizational conflicts and project
   performance in the context of megaprojects. Design/methodology/approach
   Centrality and structural holes were used to represent network position.
   A theoretical model was developed, and a structured questionnaire survey
   was conducted with construction professionals involved in megaprojects.
   A total of 291 valid responses were obtained, which were analyzed via
   structural equation modeling. Findings The results showed that
   centrality negatively impacts project performance, while structural
   holes do not significantly impact project performance. Centrality
   negatively affects task conflicts, but positively affects process
   conflicts and relationship conflicts. Structural holes positively impact
   task conflicts, but negatively impact both process conflicts and
   relationship conflicts. Task conflict and relationship conflict exert
   constructive and destructive effects on project performance,
   respectively, while process conflict does not significantly impact
   project performance. Task conflict and relationship conflict play
   mediating roles. Task conflict weakens while relationship conflict
   strengthens the relationship between centrality and project performance.
   Task conflict strengthens while relationship conflict weakens the
   relationship between structure hole and project performance. Research
   limitations/implications This study provides a reference for the
   implementation of network governance, inter-organizational conflict
   management and project performance management in megaprojects. However,
   the impact of dynamic changes of inter-organizational conflicts and
   network position on project performance has not been discussed in the
   context of megaprojects. Future research may explore the impact of
   dynamic changes of conflicts and network position on project
   implementation. Originality/value This study increases the current
   understanding of the impact of network position on project performance.
   Moreover, a new direction for network governance in the context of
   megaprojects is provided. This study also verified both the constructive
   and destructive effects of conflicts and the mediating role they play,
   thus supplementing the literature on inter-organizational conflict
   management in the construction field.},

Abstract = {Under what circumstances do first-time radical-right party (RRP) voters
   become more identified with the right-wing label? Also, when do they
   perceive the center-right party as more left wing and evaluate it more
   negatively? To answer these two intertwined questions, this article
   leverages the dynamic political context of Germany during the 2013-17
   election cycle. In this election cycle, the political arena became
   abruptly polarized, as the refugee crisis took place and the Alternative
   for Germany (AfD) broke into 13 subnational parliaments. Using a unique
   longitudinal dataset, I find that first-time AfD voters experienced a
   persuasion effect in such a polarized environment, as they became
   slightly more right wing. In addition, I find a contrast effect among
   these voters, as they came to perceive the Christian Democratic Union as
   more left wing and judged it more negatively. These findings have
   important implications for understanding the psychological processes of
   first-time RRP voters in a multiparty system, as they show how a
   polarized environment can shape RRP voters' ideological identity and
   motivate them to see the mainstream center-right party as an outgroup.},

Abstract = {What explains the great variation in the adoption, timing, and duration
   of government policies made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic? In
   this article, we explore whether government incentives to repress
   domestic dissidents influence their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   We argue that COVID-19 containment policies are observationally
   equivalent to those that abusive governments use to limit domestic
   dissent - that is, policies that restrict citizens' freedom of movement.
   This creates an opportunity for abusive governments to engage in
   repressive behavior without countervailing pressure from citizens and
   the international community. Following this logic, we expect abusive
   governments to be more likely to adopt restrictive policies, adopt them
   earlier in the course of the pandemic, and take longer to relax
   restrictions. Empirically, we find that governments that have recently
   engaged in state violence against civilians or abused citizens' human
   rights were about 10\% more likely to enact lockdown and curfew
   policies. Compared to less repressive countries, these policies were
   implemented approximately 48 days earlier in the pandemic and kept in
   place for approximately 23 days longer. Overall, our results advance our
   understanding of how the repressiveness of state institutions can shape
   policy responses to a global health crisis.},

   the State from the Late Ottoman Period to the Early Modern Republic},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Abstract = {The political and social interaction between the Ottoman Empire and
   Kurdish tribes, which can be traced back to the first quarter of the
   16th century, continued until the modern republic with various
   continuities and ruptures. This multi-dimensional and complex
   relationship was neither in the form of absolute loyalty to the sultan,
   and thus to the Islamic caliph on a religious basis, nor a constant
   revolt against the authority of the empire in order to preserve their
   autonomy. Until the beginning of the 20th century, tribes were not only
   structures used by the Ottoman, Safavid, and Russian empires for their
   own interests. They were also organizations capable of dominat-ing a
   certain geographical area and had a vital potential to constantly
   generate violence and extend it to the em-pires and even between one
   another. Contrary to the state, which systematically and regularly
   perpetrated this violence and institutionalized and justified itself
   through the monopoly of violence, their inability to do so did not
   necessarily mean that they were not genuine political organizations and
   did not have their own agenda. This study, conducted largely in light of
   archival documents and Ottoman primary sources, aims to examine the
   boundaries of loyalty and rebellion in the oscillating relationship
   between Kurdish tribes and the Turkish state.},

Abstract = {Although cybersecurity is an important and complex issue that should be
   addressed by all government levels, so far little research has been
   devoted to cybersecurity at the local level. Existing literature lacks
   information on whether municipalities have implemented cybersecurity
   policies, if such policies are applied in practice and what they
   encompass. A CAWI method was used to collect the required data. The
   results indicate that while most municipalities have a document defining
   their security policy, they do not always apply it in practice. There is
   still little awareness regarding countering cyberattacks. Therefore,
   more emphasis should be placed on such issues as: integrating
   cybersecurity policies into local government management, the rising
   threat of cyber-attacks, consultations with security auditors, and
   cybersecurity management training. Based on all Polish municipalities,
   the research described in this paper partly fills the identified gap.},

Abstract = {Foundational theories of trade politics emphasize a conflict between
   consumer welfare and protectionist lobbies. But these theories ignore
   other powerful lobbies that also shape trade policy. We propose a theory
   of trade distortion arising from conflict between consumer welfare and
   importer lobbies. We estimate the key parameter of the model-the
   government's weight on welfare-using original data from Venezuela, where
   Hugo Chavez used an exchange-rate subsidy to underwrite hundreds of
   billions of dollars of imports. Whereas estimates from traditional
   models would make Chavez look like a welfare maximizer, our results
   indicate that he implemented distortionary commercial policy to the
   benefit of special interests. Our analysis underscores the importance of
   tailoring workhorse models to account for differences in interest group
   configuration. The politics of trade policy is not reducible to the
   politics of protectionism.},

Abstract = {The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals has revived some
   classical issues in development policy: Who should pay for global
   collective goods? Can foreign aid be used for this purpose, or should
   such financing be reserved for efforts in specific poor countries? In
   this article we investigate how the members of the Development
   Assistance Committee of the OECD, collectively as well as individually,
   approach these questions. We find that they struggle to be consistent.
   In our opinion, the Norwegian government could gain from developing a
   better conceptualisation of global collective goods. This will first of
   all make it easier to have a consistent policy with respect to financing
   them. Secondly, such a conceptualisation will allow for a more strategic
   approach to new initiatives. Going forward, aid budgets are unlikely to
   grow much. Moreover, theory demonstrates that it is in general optimal
   to tailor the provision of different collective goods to the
   peculiarities of each case. This implies that expertise is essential. We
   need a better understanding of the functioning of existing multilateral
   organisations and mechanisms that manage both aid and global collective
   goods. In addition, more knowledge about the workings of the current
   multilateral system in different fields is required. Such knowledge is a
   global collective good and Norway could and should contribute to its
   provision.},

Year = {2022},
Pages = {99-127},
Abstract = {This chapter is the empirical examination of the second cluster of the
   alignment framework developed in Chapter 2 - the incentives for
   alignment formation as expressed by the balances of power, threat, and
   interests. It explores the changes within each ``balance{''} as well as
   in the relationship between them to explain China-Russia alignment. The
   chapter examines the relative power dynamics within the contemporary
   international system and the perceptions of external threats and
   interests in China and Russia. It shows convergences between China and
   Russia in terms of how they view the evolving international order and
   demonstrates the gradually growing interconnectedness between the three
   balances in the context of China-Russia relations since the end of the
   Cold War. There are reasons to expect a further strengthening of the
   bilateral alignment.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to: (i) investigate whether Republican legislatures were
   more inclined than Democratic ones to uphold laws of national
   sovereignty and whether Democratic legislatures were more likely than
   Republican ones to prioritise bills linked to the post-national
   perspective; (ii) assess the US migration laws by considering how
   state-level legal systems affect migrants' lives. Using data from the
   National Conference of State Legislatures and Legiscan and techniques
   like clustering, statistical, and geospatial analysis, we found that
   bills sponsored by the Democratic Party are indeed more likely to belong
   to the post-national category than bills by the Republican Party.},

   A Multilevel Analysis in 28 European Countries},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Abstract = {Individuals who are strongly oriented towards market-based values are
   more likely to devalue groups identified as ``unprofitable{''} from an
   economic point of view. Drawing on insights from Institutional Anomie
   Theory (IAT), this study explores economically legitimized prejudice in
   light of a far-reaching economization of the institutional and cultural
   structure. Multilevel models using data from the European Social Survey
   (2018) show that hostility towards immigrants is expressed more among
   individuals who strongly embrace market-based values and in countries
   where the institutional structure is dominated by the economy and
   non-economic social institutions are enfeebled (institutional
   imbalance). Aggregated market-based values (a ``marketized anomic
   culture{''}) mediate the effect of a) individual market-based values and
   b) institutional imbalance on anti-immigrant attitudes. This study
   contributes to a better understanding of group prejudice under
   conditions of economization. It shows that applying IAT within a
   multilevel framework offers a fruitful explanation not only for crime
   but for other sociological phenomena.},

Abstract = {This chapter offers a short history of French colonial Pondicherry and

   caste, creed, race, and social class, as well as the influence of
   external colonial competition between France and Britain. The chapter
   then discusses within this historical account the ways in which the
   expansion of voting rights to Indian males - accompanied by unintended
   consequences - differed from attempts to extend voting rights elsewhere

Title = {Gender differences in attitudes toward assisted reproduction in the
   Spanish population: The weight of religiosity and conservatism},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {DEC 14},
Abstract = {IntroductionThe continuous increase in assisted reproductive treatments
   (ARTs) has generated different ethical dilemmas in the scientific and
   academic debate. However, there are a few occasions when Spanish
   citizenship pronounces itself on this issue. It seems that the
   population has assumed ARTs without questioning despite being a subject
   crossed by gender mandates that make women the center of ART
   application. This study delves into the attitudes of the Spanish
   population toward assisted reproduction and the persistence of gender
   mandates in the choice of ARTs, beyond the apparent (almost fixed image
   of the) total acceptance of ARTs. MethodsA questionnaire was applied to
   a sample of 1,030 randomly selected people. Variables included attitudes
   toward the different possibilities of assisted reproduction, different
   approaches depending on whether infertility or sterility fell on the
   woman or the man and other scenarios related to genetic dilemmas.
   ResultsThe mean difference test confirmed the high acceptance of ARTs by
   the Spanish population and revealed significant gender differences.
   Women accepted ARTs for infertility and genetic disorders, while men
   accepted ARTs for choosing a baby's sex. However, gender was not the
   only relevant variable in the conducted linear regression model;

Abstract = {In response to the limitations of elite-driven democratic innovations,
   social movements have proposed democratic innovations that are
   democracy-driven. They claim that democracy-driven governance generates
   legitimacy by better responding to citizens' demands. However, whether
   participating citizens support this claim remains unclear. Under what
   conditions do participants accept the legitimacy of a mini-public that
   has been set up by a social movement party? We examine this question by
   conducting an in-depth case study of the Brussels Citizens' Assembly
   organized by the Agora movement party throughout its entire process.
   Adopting mixed-methods, we find that participants' perceived legitimacy
   is shaped by a process-long, dynamic interaction between organizers and
   participants. Legitimacy is enhanced when organizers grant participants
   authorship over the BCA's procedural design and breaks down when they
   fail to do so.},

Abstract = {Analysis of Brazil's Bolsonaro administration, its most active social
   support base, and the political crisis that gave rise to it shows that,
   operating with a concept of fascism embedded in the Marxist tradition,
   it can be characterized as (neo)fascist. The political crisis of
   2015-2018 that led to it involved a crisis of hegemony of the bloc in
   power, the crisis of party representation of the dominant classes,
   political activism by the state bureaucracy, the political defensiveness
   of the workers' and lower-class movement, and the formation of a
   reactionary middle-class movement. The option for fascism was not
   without risks, as is reflected today by the demonstrations of
   dissatisfaction with its administration. Uma analise do governo
   Bolsonaro no Brasil, a sua base social a mais ativa e a crise politica
   que lhe deve origem, mostra que, baseado num conceito de fascismo
   enquadrado na tradicao marxista, este governo pode ser denominado como
   (neo)fascista. O governo (neo)fascista de Bolsonaro era decorrente de
   uma crise politica nos anos 2015-2018 que implicou uma crise de
   hegemonia no bloco de poder, uma crise de representacao partidaria das
   classes dominantes, um ativismo politico na burocracia estatal, uma
   atitude defensiva politica do movimento dos trabalhadores e classes
   pobres e a formacao de um movimento reacionario da classe media. A opcao
   fascista nao e isento de riscos vis-a-vis a burguesia como se reflete
   hoje nas manifestacoes de insatisfacao com a administracao burguesa.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the gender differences in the tasks performed
   at the workplace using individual-level data representative of the
   French working population. In particular, we are interested in exploring
   gender gaps in power and control. Our findings reveal that, within the
   same job, women tend on average to be subjected to more forms of control
   than men even controlling for a wide set of supply-side characteristics,
   such as education, age and seniority. Moreover, these gender differences
   often exacerbate within male-dominated jobs, although they do not
   necessarily disappear as the share of women increases. We conclude that,
   within the same job, in the French labour market women tend to be in a
   more subordinated position compared with men.},

Abstract = {This discourse analysis of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and
   his party, Servant of the People, over the period 2019-2021, provides a
   case study that adds to the emergent literature on technocratic
   populism, confirming some of its hypotheses. Technocratic populism
   utilises ``outsider experts{''} and seeks ``normalisation{''} via
   depoliticisation and demobilisation of the population. The political
   context of Ukraine was favourable to technocratic and inclusionary
   populism in the 2019-2021 period because the degree of trust in
   political parties was low and there was an association of the ``old
   elites{''} with highly polarised politics structured along regional and
   identitarian lines.},

   Insights from the AU and ECOWAS commissions},

Abstract = {The growing importance of executive authority at the international level
   has fuelled scholarly debate about the level of autonomy enjoyed by
   international public administration (IPA), that is, the executive arms
   of international organisations. Insights from IPAs in the West or Global
   North, such as the European Union, have largely shaped these debates,
   whereas data from IPAs in the Global South are largely missing in the
   discussion. This article seeks to remedy this imbalance and contribute
   to an organisational-theory-inspired conceptualisation of IPA autonomy:
   We draw insights from survey data from the commissions of the African
   Union (AU) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
   We demonstrate that, although both commissions are embedded in
   inter-governmental organisations, they demonstrate remarkably strong
   features of actor-level autonomy. Thus, this study suggests that even
   IPAs constrained by an inter-governmental environment may still wield
   some degree of autonomy. Finally, the article draws practical
   implications for reforming IPAs.},

Abstract = {Barring a Turkish veto, Finland and Sweden will join NATO as full
   members prior to the Alliance's Vilnius Summit in June 2023. Both
   confront several political, military and defence-industrial choices
   regarding their membership, with different benefits and opportunity
   costs for each country and the Alliance depending on whether they select
   a low, medium or high level of ambition. Both are likely to adopt a
   medium level of ambition, opening up a range of new areas for
   cooperation with other allies and strengthening the Alliance as a whole.
   A high level of ambition is not likely in the short term, given the
   substantial political, financial and personnel costs it would entail.
   Nevertheless, it could eventually materialise.},

Title = {Why Territorial Disputes Escalate: The Causes of Conquest Attempts since
   1945},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT 31},
Abstract = {Although attempts to conquer entire states became rare after 1945,
   attempts to conquer small pieces of territory persisted. Why do states
   so often seize-and even fight wars over-remarkably small areas? We argue
   that traditional explanations predicated on the material or ethnic value
   of disputed territories largely cannot explain the escalation of
   territorial disputes since 1945. Instead, actors more often seize
   territory to be seen seizing it. We theorize that the roots of these
   conquest attempts often lie in careerist incentives within militaries.
   Military officers seize small pieces of disputed territory in pursuit of
   promotions or political office, especially in states where the military
   wields greater political power. We test this theory with a statistical
   analysis of conquest attempts in territorial disputes (1965-2000) using
   new geospatial and conquest data along with a medium-n process analysis
   of all conquest attempts since 1945. Our results suggest that careerist
   self-aggrandizement plays an important role in contemporary territorial
   conflict.},

Abstract = {Compliance with World Trade Organization dispute rulings declined in
   recent years. Governments frequently accuse the Appellate Body (AB) of
   exceeding its mandate by relying on precedent despite having no such
   authority. Is this criticism fair? We use new data on over 5,000
   applications of legal precedent in AB rulings to test competing
   hypotheses. The ``legal coherence hypothesis{''} says that legal systems
   adhere to precedent because they have strong incentives to appear
   consistent in their rulings over time. Alternatively, the ``adaptation
   hypothesis{''} says that legal systems respond to political resistance,
   such as noncompliance, by subtly modifying precedent. The results lend
   greater support to the ``adaptation hypothesis.{''} The AB is much more
   likely to drift from previous rulings when those decisions failed to
   induce compliance. The results speak to common criticisms about the
   intransigence of international legal systems and the ways in which
   international case law evolves.},

Title = {Rethinking China's `economic coercion': The case of the UK leaders'

Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In 2012, David Cameron met the Dalai Lama. In retaliation for the
   meeting, China froze bilateral relations for 18 months. Subsequently,
   Cameron pledged to have no more meetings with the Dalai Lama and
   reiterated British recognition of Chinese sovereignty over Tibet. For
   some, China used economic punishment to extract the UK's concession. For
   others, China used only diplomatic punishment. This article argues that
   both sides have underestimated the complexity of the case and need to
   integrate their insights for a better explanation. While China did not
   impose or threaten economic sanctions on the UK, its diplomatic
   sanctions put both political and economic pressure on the UK to concede.
   This article contributes to the studies of China-UK relations and
   China's `economic coercion'.},

Abstract = {Focusing on coexistence in towns and villages of the former Saris
   Zemplin County during World War II, our article exposes the shifting
   meanings assigned to belonging in what was a multiethnic borderland
   region and an economic periphery. Informed by works on community
   construction and meaning, we understand ``locals{''} as being formed by
   diverse and at times conflicting social experiences that are
   nevertheless rooted in the same physical environment. We draw on late
   witness testimonies by Jewish survivors and Gentile neighbors to
   investigate the roles of public and private spaces in how a sense of
   community was revoked. Since the redrawing of boundaries was made into a
   public concern in the 1930s, the redefining of ``locals{''} along
   ethnoreligious lines had a deep situational dimension, with local norms
   and experiences shaping the ousting of the Jews from what was
   historically a shared space. We conclude by discussing the theoretical
   and methodological implications of our research for writing integrated
   histories of the Holocaust, mindful of relationships between people,
   objects, but also places.},

Abstract = {The protection of civilians from human rights violations has
   increasingly become a global priority. The wars in Bosnia and Rwanda in
   the 1990s, and the development of the Women, Peace and Security
   framework have placed conflict-related sexual violence on the global
   protection agenda. Prior research has found that international attention
   to, and intervention in, conflicts is in fact more likely when there are
   reports of widespread sexual violence, regardless of overall conflict
   intensity. This article theorizes and empirically examines the
   micro-level underpinnings of these patterns. We hypothesize that
   individuals are more likely to support military intervention in
   conflicts with prevalent sexual violence as opposed to other types of
   conflict violence. The reason lies in gendered protection norms, based
   in benevolent sexism, that continue to have traction also in Western
   societies. In equivalent survey experiments carried out in the United
   States, the United Kingdom and Sweden, we find that support for
   international intervention is highest in sexual violence conflicts. In
   the United States and the United Kingdom, the responsibility to protect
   and gendered perceptions of victimhood mediate this effect. A follow-up
   experiment in the United States provides further evidence of a gendered
   protection norm as a core mechanism driving our results.},

Abstract = {Free-trade policies have opened the Guatemalan economy to international
   forces and sparked massive internal and international migration,
   creating new forms of social struggle produced by and engaging with
   these processes. A review of the 2008 advent of a grassroots
   organization in Western Highland Guatemala involved in binational United
   States-Guatemalan fair trade and migrant and solidarity organizing uses
   the concept of the platform instead of the network to highlight
   continuities and ruptures between past and present struggles. This
   perspective disrupts the vertical/horizontal dichotomy in social
   movement studies and sheds light on the effects of technological change
   on grassroots resistance to neoliberalism. Las politicas de libre
   comercio han abierto la economia guatemalteca a las pujanzas
   internacionales y provocado una migracion masiva tanto interna como
   internacional, creando nuevas formas de lucha social producidas por y
   comprometidas con estos procesos. Este repaso del advenimiento, en 2008,
   de una organizacion de base en las Tierras Altas Occidentales de
   Guatemala involucrada en promover el comercio justo binacional entre
   Estados Unidos y Guatemala, asi como la organizacion migrante y los
   nexos de solidaridad, utiliza el concepto de la plataforma en lugar de
   la red para resaltar las continuidades y rupturas entre luchas pasadas y
   presentes. Esta perspectiva irrumpe en la dicotomia vertical/horizontal
   subyacente a los estudios de movimientos sociales y nos brinda una
   perspectiva sobre los efectos del cambio tecnologico en las resistencias
   de base al neoliberalismo.},

Abstract = {What effect does extreme weather have on climate policy? Existing
   studies show that weather shocks have negative economic impacts and
   increase public awareness of climate change. These findings help
   identify the impacts of climate change on economic and social systems,
   and provide reasons for governments to adopt climate policy reforms.
   However, questions remain about the overall link between local extreme
   weather shocks and government climate policy. I investigate the effect
   of temperature shocks and natural disasters on a range of national,
   international, and subnational climate policies in samples spanning
   1990-2018. I find that neither temperature shocks nor natural disasters
   generate climate mitigation reforms. Given that climate policy is
   currently insufficient to manage climate change and climate impacts are
   expected to increase this century, these findings suggest that future
   climate shocks are unlikely to catalyze meaningful climate action.},

Abstract = {Within European Cohesion Policy, some regions manifest chronic problems
   with absorbing structural funds, probably due to inadequate
   administrative capacity. Despite the continuous assistance to improve
   capacity and the accumulation of learning and experience, poor
   performances still persist in some territories, rendering the initial
   explanation partial. By collecting (reports' analysis and field
   research), consolidating (grounded theory), and mapping (system
   dynamics) two Italian regions with contrasting absorption performance,
   this study investigates how regional authorities may be trapped in
   systemic decision-making structures that prioritize short-term outcomes
   perpetuating low absorption rates. Within a multilevel-governance
   context, we suggest that these decision-making traps stem from the
   discrepancy between European and local policy-makers' mental models;
   although European policies aim to promote timely absorption, sometimes
   they fail to acknowledge local authorities' actual agenda and may
   unintentionally prompt regions to overemphasize short term funds'
   expenditure instead of improving administrative capacity in the long
   term.},

Title = {Mapping institutional change: Analysing strategies for institutional
   design in collective infrastructure renewal},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLICY ANALYSIS},

Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {416-438},

Abstract = {Actors' toolset to affect institutional change by doing institutional
   design is limited because criteria for effective institutional design
   are often too general and abstract. This paper aims to identify
   institutional design strategies and explore how they influence
   institutional change. The theoretical framework builds on Ostrom's
   Institutional Analysis and Development framework to map institutional
   change, and it identifies six institutional design strategies: framing,
   puzzling, powering, network composition, network outcomes, and network
   interaction. A comparative case study on Dutch infrastructure renewal
   opportunities - one case's institutional design interventions attained
   collective renewal, the other did not - maps institutional change in
   decision-making rounds through institutional directions. Key findings
   include that institutional change of position, boundary, choice, and
   information rules first is conducive to collective action. Moreover,
   mimicry of especially choice rules is pivotal. Furthermore,
   institutional design strategies have a configurational nature:
   microlevel strategies have mesolevel consequences, and some
   configurations instigate change, whereas others cause dynamic inertia.},

Abstract = {How do international organizations (IOs) affect access to social
   services for refugees and host country nationals during humanitarian
   crises? We explore the quality of care received by Syrian refugees and
   Lebanese nationals in Lebanese health facilities using data from
   original surveys in a nationally representative sample of health
   centers. Given its importance as a site of interactions with host
   country nationals, health is a key arena for studying local behavior
   toward refugees. Much research on refugees and intergroup relations
   suggests that Syrians would receive inferior services, yet other
   approaches would predict equitable treatment, whether due to intrinsic
   or extrinsic motivations. We find no difference in the quality of care
   for Syrians and Lebanese and argue that the comparatively equitable
   treatment of refugees stems from incentives from IOs at both the
   organizational and individual levels-a phenomenon we call the ``IO
   effect.{''} The study advances research on IOs and humanitarian crises
   by focusing on behavior and not only attitudes toward refugees and by
   highlighting the role of IOs in shaping the experience of everyday life
   for refugees.},

Abstract = {The one-state reality has dramatically changed the discursive landscape
   of the movement of Israeli settlers and their supporters who have waged
   a half century campaign to prevent territorial compromise as a basis for
   Israeli-Palestinian peace. Analysis of the discourse of the Sovereignty
   movement, as reflected in the pages of its journal, Ribonut, traces
   these changes and highlights the new challenges posed to the
   annexationist project by the prospect of the attainability of its goals
   and the necessity to confront the ``Arab problem.{''}},

Title = {How negative out-party affect influenced public attitudes about the
   coronavirus crisis in Norway},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Research on affective polarization and negative partisanship toward
   disliked out-parties has increased significantly in recent years.
   However, there are surprisingly few studies that actually examine its
   political consequences, especially outside of the US. This study relies
   on two survey experiments to examine how dislike toward out-parties
   affected how Norwegian citizens evaluated the country's response to the
   coronavirus crisis. The first experiment follows the example of previous
   research on the US case and tests how out-party dislike measured before
   the coronavirus outbreak affected subsequent attitudes about how Norway
   and the conservative government had managed the crisis. The second
   experiment then randomly assigns party cues to a policy proposal
   included in the country's economic rescue package and tests whether
   like-dislike party evaluations moderate the effect of receiving the
   party cues. Overall, the results show that out-party dislike predicted
   attitudes to the government's response, but, contrary to studies
   focusing on the US case, this effect was either nonexistent or weaker
   for those who rated the country's response. Additionally, while
   out-party cues polarized opinions to the proposal, the moderating effect
   of out-party dislike was only more consistently found for those who
   received party cues from the populist-right party.},

Abstract = {Performance information use is an essential component of performance
   management, which is an important tool to manage purpose-oriented
   networks (PONs). Conceptualizing performance information use in PONs as
   network members' presentation, discussion, and interpretation of
   performance information during their interactions and communication,
   this study explores its drivers. Extant studies on performance
   information use in PONs point out an association between its use and the
   relationships among network members, but they lack specificity regarding
   the association. This study focuses on and theorizes that association,
   relying on network theory (especially the embeddedness approach) and
   resource dependence theory. Network analysis techniques (Multiple
   Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure and Exponential Random Graph
   Modeling) are applied to investigate the theory empirically, using a
   pair (dyad) of network members as the unit of analysis. The data were
   collected from 21 members in a health and human services network serving
   children and youth with serious emotional disturbance in a US county.
   Two types of performance information were used in the PON: internally
   and externally produced information. Despite differences in the breadth
   and decision-making relevance of using information from these two
   sources, network analyses identify three relational characteristics
   consistently associated with the dyads' use of internal and external
   performance information: (1) frequency of communication; (2) centrality
   of position; and (3) extent of mutual dependency. These findings suggest
   that network members are likely to use performance information in
   relationships where the benefits of developing a shared understanding of
   network performance outweigh the costs of using it.},

Abstract = {The Mexican states of Chiapas and Tabasco have for decades been linked
   to Central American migrations, largely through cross-border labor
   mobility. Today, however, the diversification of receiving areas in
   Mexico requires focusing attention on how the dynamics of mobility,
   settlement, and/or transit impact new contexts. The state of Veracruz,
   part of the so-called Gulf of Mexico corridor that connects the
   country's southern and northern borders on the east, has emerged as an
   unplanned destination-a place of temporary or permanent residence-for
   Central American migrants, especially Hondurans. Examination of the
   types of violence experienced by in-transit undocumented migrants and
   temporary or permanent residents in the area shows how the coercive
   migration policies of the Mexican government contribute to maintaining a
   continuum of violence that affects people ``trapped in mobility.{''} Los
   estados mexicanos de Chiapas y Tabasco han estado vinculados durante
   decadas a las migraciones centroamericanas, en gran parte a traves de la
   movilidad laboral transfronteriza. Hoy, sin embargo, la diversificacion
   de las areas receptoras en Mexico requiere que enfoquemos la atencion en
   como la dinamica de movilidad, asentamiento y/o transito impacta en
   nuevos contextos. El estado de Veracruz, parte del llamado corredor del
   Golfo de Mexico que conecta las fronteras sur y norte del pais en el
   lado este, se ha convertido en un destino no planificado, un lugar de
   residencia temporal o permanente, para los migrantes centroamericanos,
   especialmente los hondurenos. Un analisis de los tipos de violencia que
   experimentan los migrantes indocumentados en transito y los residentes
   temporales o permanentes en la zona muestra como las politicas
   migratorias coercitivas del gobierno mexicano contribuyen a mantener un
   ciclo de violencia que afecta a aquellos ``atrapados en la
   movilidad{''}.},

   Repression: A Movement-Level Analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Is government repression of self-determination (SD) movements affected
   by the internal structure of the movements? This article investigates
   the relation between internal fragmentation of SD movements and state
   repression. While internal fragmentation of domestic challengers is
   well-documented in conflict studies, its effect on state repression is
   largely overlooked by the extant literature. Here, I argue that
   inter-faction competition and disagreements within an internally divided
   movement constrain the government's ability to negotiate concessions in
   a way that can satisfy all the actors involved, engendering incentives
   to repress the movement. I expect that the degree to which this
   mechanism operates depends on the extent to which the movement is
   internally fragmented. The findings show that higher degrees of
   within-movement fragmentation are positively associated with higher
   levels of repression, and this effect is greater in the presence of
   active violent militants but smaller in the presence of one or a few
   dominant faction(s). This study sheds light on the mechanisms that drive
   repression over SD disputes, which often lead to escalation of violence
   and civil conflict onset. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms can
   help with the development of early warning systems and conflict
   prevention in the political practice of national and international
   organizations.},

Abstract = {Most scholarship on major oil-producing countries (OPCs) focuses on
   their illiberal characteristics, but scant research explores how these
   regimes react to periodic oil price collapses, particularly
   neo-patrimonial OPCs with relatively low state capacity, herein termed
   gatekeeper OPCs. These OPCs should be extremely vulnerable to regime
   change during economic crises. However, since the most recent collapse
   in international oil markets in 2014, almost all neo-patrimonial OPCs
   have managed to weather the ensuing fallout, thereby begging the
   question of how these seemingly vulnerable regimes manage to survive
   extended periods of economic crises. We hypothesise that the likelihood
   of regime survival in neo-patrimonial OPCs depends on a strategic
   calibration of domestic neo-patrimonial policies, such as clientelism
   and executive aggrandisement, and the skilled navigation of global
   geopolitics. We find evidence that incumbent governments leverage
   international geopolitical tensions during economic crises to secure
   valuable foreign aid from key allies, which allows them to maintain the
   domestic neo-patrimonial strategies required to safeguard their power.
   We reached the above finding through a nested mixed-methods research
   design combining quantitative analysis of 35 major OPCs from 2011 to
   2018 using Cox proportional hazards models with the qualitative
   comparison of two gatekeeper OPCs-Chad and Venezuela.},

Abstract = {What drives participation in collaborative planning? How does this vary
   across different institutional contexts? Public managers must navigate
   emerging challenges in public service provision; perceived risk and
   capacity to act can play a pivotal role, shaping managerial behavior. In
   water management, for example, issues stemming from climate change and
   water-intensive growth create new concerns about continued water supply.
   Strategic decisions may improve local public service provision, but can
   also have cascading effects on other systems, as water is a mobile-and
   subtractable-resource. Many public water systems have participated in
   collaborative planning to overcome collective challenges for this
   reason, but participation is not feasible for all prospective
   participants. Using data from administrative records and surveys, we fit
   a binomial logistic model to examine the roles of capacity and perceived
   risk among water service providers as drivers of participation in
   collaborative planning forums. By evaluating this relationship in
   California and North Carolina, we find similar results across unique
   institutional contexts: participation in regional water planning is
   associated with perceived risk to water supply from changing climatic
   conditions, but not from perceived risk of changing patterns of demand.
   Also, system capacity-as measured by the size of the population
   served-corresponds to increased likelihood of participation.},

Abstract = {The share of basic services that NGOs deliver has grown dramatically in
   developing countries due to increased receipt of aid and philanthropy in
   these countries. Many scholars and practitioners worry that NGOs reduce
   reliance on government services and, in turn, lower demand for
   government provision and undermine political engagement. Others argue
   that NGOs prop-up poorly performing governments that receive undeserved
   credit for the production, allocation, or welfare effects of NGO
   services. Using original surveys and a randomized health intervention,
   implemented in parallel to a similar universal government program, this
   article investigates the long-term effect of NGO provision on political
   attitudes and behavior. Access to NGO services increased preferences for
   NGO, relative to government, provision. However, political engagement
   and perceptions of government legitimacy were unaffected. Instead, the
   intervention generated political credit for the incumbent president.
   This study finds that citizens see NGOs as a resource that powerful
   government actors control, and they reward actors who they see as
   responsible for allocation of those resources.},

Abstract = {Commitment problems make civil wars difficult to end. Research on
   overcoming commitment problems focuses on warring parties, however
   civilians' perceptions are central to successful transitions from war to
   peace. While civilians residing in areas previously controlled by armed
   groups may be highly distrustful that governments will implement peace
   agreements, I argue that some armed groups are both motivated and
   capable of improving trust in the state. Using survey data from
   civilians in the Bangsamoro, Philippines, I show that civilians that
   experienced rebel security provision or rebel justice provision from the
   MILF are more likely to trust that the Government of the Philippines
   will fully implement the peace agreement than civilians that did not
   experience rebel governance provision.},

   Personhood},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},

Volume = {76},

Pages = {799-829},
Abstract = {International relations theory has had a trust revival, with scholars
   focusing on how trust can enhance interpersonal cooperation attempts
   between leaders. We propose there is another type of trust at play in
   world politics. International system trust is a feeling of confidence in
   the international social order, which is indexed especially by trust in
   its central unit, state persons. System trust anchors ontological
   security, and its presence is an unstated assumption of the
   international relations trust scholarship. In this paper we
   conceptualize system trust. We illuminate its presence by flagging the
   production of state personhood in a familiar case in international
   relations trust scholarship, the 1985 Geneva Summit between Reagan and
   Gorbachev. Interpersonal and system trust perspectives highlight
   different aspects of the same summit. The juxtaposition suggests new
   lines of research into the production of state persons in diplomacy, the
   relationship between interpersonal and system trust, and the impact of
   the rise of personalistic/patrimonial leadership on diplomacy and
   international order.},

Title = {Who perceives women's rights as threatening to men and boys? Explaining
   modern sexism among young men in Europe},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {While Western democracies have become increasingly gender-equal over the
   past decades, recent research documents a backlash against gender
   equality in the form of rising modern sexism. Previous research shows
   that modern sexism predicts political attitudes and voting behavior that
   are detrimental to women's empowerment and liberalism. Yet, we know
   little about which factors explain modern sexist attitudes and how they
   operate across multiple country contexts. Building on modern
   conceptualizations of sexism, we theorize that (perceived) increases in
   competition between men and women provoke modern sexism among young men
   in particular. Using an original measure that approximates dimensions of
   modern sexism embedded in the 2021 EQI survey, capturing 32,469
   individuals nested in 208 NUTS 2 regions in 27 European Union countries,
   we demonstrate that young men are most likely to perceive advances in
   women's rights as a threat to men's opportunities. This is particularly
   true for young men who (a) consider public institutions in their region
   as unfair, and (b) reside in regions with recent increases in
   unemployment resulting in increased competition for jobs. Our findings
   highlight the role of perceived competition between men and women in
   modern sexism and contradict the argument that older generations are
   most likely to backlash against progressive values, potentially adding
   to research explaining the recent backlash against gender equality.},

Abstract = {What started as opportunistic operations has gradually given rise to
   Israel's prevailing military doctrine of Inter-War Campaigns (IWC). This
   article provides a comprehensive analysis of a phenomenon that has
   shaped conflicts in the Middle East, one that has been overlooked in the
   literature. The IWC utilises advantageous conditions to formulate
   continuous military campaigns below the threshold of severe conflict.
   This article argues that the IWC creates and manages limited competitive
   conflicts intended to mitigate adversaries' force buildup in preparation
   for war. It provides the first account of the doctrine's development,
   analyses its enabling factors, and discusses its degree of success.},

Abstract = {Extant studies on policy feedback effects have examined how a welfare
   increase, rather than a decrease, might shape policy attitudes or
   political engagement. Nevertheless, exploring the effects of welfare
   decrease on the mass public is significant because of its increasingly
   crucial relevance to public policy practices worldwide. Using a unique
   longitudinal national panel survey dataset (2015-2017) related to
   China's Minimum Living Standard Guarantee Program, this study examines
   how welfare program benefits influence the policy perceptions and
   political participation of more than 10,000 economically disadvantaged
   respondents. A series of analyses showed that all else being equal,
   starting to receive program benefits in a year does not necessarily
   produce a positive effect on policy perceptions or on political
   participation. However, being deprived of program benefits in a year has
   a significantly negative effect on policy perceptions and political
   participation. These findings concur with the negativity bias proposed
   in the psychology literature and contribute to the understanding of the
   micro-level foundations of welfare policy feedback effects on the mass
   public.},

Abstract = {Why do some near crises tip over into full-blown crisis and others do
   not? This paper considers existing scholarship and identifies four key
   barriers to using quantitative analysis for tipping-point analyses:
   strategic indeterminacy; the incentives for conflict parties to avoid
   inefficiencies; the paucity of cases; and the availability of quality
   data. Due to these challenges, many do not perform well as immediate
   causes for crisis escalation. We also argue and demonstrate through two
   quantitative models of crisis escalation that some variables,
   particularly related to domestic politics, can do well in explaining why
   some disputes tip into crisis and others do not. As we illustrate with
   reference to the 1995-1996 Third Taiwan Straits Crisis, qualitative
   approaches that analyze the processes by which leaders and foreign
   policy institutions make decisions add needed explanatory power to
   purely quantitative models of the potential for near crises to tip into
   crisis.},

Title = {Not between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea: Singapore's Hedging},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 18},
Abstract = {Hedging is typically understood as a middle path straddling
   balancing/bandwagoning, the military/economic, and United States/China.
   This conventional understanding of hedging confuses risk and threat. It
   also makes the hedging concept non-falsifiable and thus analytically
   dubious, while further reinforcing a false dialectic of other states in
   the Asia-Pacific as caught between the United States and China. This
   article proposes to restore the centrality of risk and autonomy back to
   the concept of hedging. It contends that hedging is a risk management
   strategy that emphasizes autonomy-to retain control, reduce uncertainty,
   and remain secure-preventing the costs of alignment by signaling
   ambiguity in the military, political, and economic sectors. This hedging
   concept is subsequently applied to a case study of Singapore,
   demonstrating that the island state is the quintessential hedger. In so
   doing, this article develops a falsifiable concept of hedging that
   enables such a strategy to be explicitly identified, and importantly,
   returns agency back to the other states amid intensifying Sino-US
   competition.},

Abstract = {As countries integrate ever further into globalized production
   processes, scholars have found significant country-level variation in
   the extent to which women are able to increase their participation in
   the formal economy. In this paper, I improve on existing work by
   disaggregating globalization into its different processes, each of which
   has different expected effects on female labor force participation
   (FLFP). I examine how trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), and
   natural resource exports affect FLFP in a cross-national time-series
   analysis of 129 low- to middle-income economy countries over a
   twenty-eight-year period. A major contribution of this paper is to show
   an interaction effect between trade and FDI: I find that generally trade
   and inward FDI have a negative effect on FLFP that diminishes as they
   increase together, suggesting that export-oriented FDI creates more
   opportunities for women than domestic-oriented FDI and trade openness
   unaccompanied by significant foreign investment. I also find that the
   more positive effect of export-oriented FDI depends on the extent to
   which a country has experienced industrial upgrading, suggesting that
   gender segregation by industry also affects the extent to which global
   economic integration creates employment opportunities for women in
   developing countries.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on what I refer to as Climate Populism and how this
   structures not only many radical climate movements but also the liberal
   climate consensus. I argue that the architecture of most mainstream as
   well as more radical climate discourses, practices, and policies is
   strictly parallel to that of populist discourses and should be
   understood as an integral part of a pervasive and deepening process of
   post-politicization. Mobilising a process that psychoanalysts call
   `fetishistic disavowal', the climate discourse produces a particular
   form of populism that obscures the power relations responsible for the
   growth of greenhouse gas emissions. I shall mobilise a broadly
   Lacanian-Marxist theoretical perspective that permits accounting for
   this apparently paradoxical condition of both acknowledging and denying
   the truth of the climate situation, and the discourses/practices that
   sustain this.},

Abstract = {Designating statistical capacity development as a target for measurement
   in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) created a dilemma for
   statistical decision-makers in the United Nations system, as some saw
   the inclusion of statistical capacity in SDG17 as a ``conflict of
   interest,{''} making their work both a goal of the SDGs and a means to
   achieve them. In 2022, there are five indicators for measuring both the
   statistical capacity of individual countries and the support provided to
   strengthen it, including one indicator for measuring a country's ability
   to monitor the SDGs themselves. In this article, I argue that the
   epistemic infrastructuring of statistical capacity into the SDG
   framework is a privileged case. By parsing the interconnections between
   the data, actors, networks, and processes that constitute statistical
   capacity on national and global levels, we can understand how central
   these materialities and processes are in constituting the larger policy
   agenda of the SDGs as well as debates over the problems that statistical
   capacity is meant to solve. Like all indicators in the SDG framework,
   statistical capacity indicators are performative - defined and
   delineated by the global statistics community that also helps define and
   delineate the SDG framework's development problems. Unlike other
   indicators, however, statistical capacity indicators have the added
   weight of also producing the conditions of possibility for the ``SDG
   framework itself.{''} In this way, debates over what constitutes
   statistical capacity and its strengthening are also debates about
   ownership of policy agendas and where tensions between the local and
   global erupt.},

Abstract = {From 1962 to 1971 the Associacao Universitaria Interamericana
   (Inter-American University Association-AUI) conducted a program of
   internships at Harvard University for Brazilian students. The goal of
   these internships was for Brazilian students to gain an understanding of
   the American way of life. The students were mostly recruited among
   leftists. It was their hearts and minds that the university wanted to
   win over to the side of the ``free world{''} during the Cold War. These
   students took advantage of the situation and used the internships for
   their own purposes. This had implications not only for their personal
   careers but also for the construction of institutional and political
   ideas. This process took place within a complex game that involved the
   interests of the United States and the entrepreneurs who helped finance
   the AUI. Created during the Kennedy administration, the AUI ended its
   activities as a result of a conservative offensive launched by the Nixon
   administration in the United States and the Medici dictatorship in
   Brazil. Desde 1962 a 1971 a Associacao Universitaria Interamericana
   (Interamerican University Association-AUI) promoveu o intercambio
   universitario de estudantes brasileiros selecionados para fazer um
   estagio em Harvard e conhecer o modo de vida americano. Os
   universitarios eram recrutados em sua maioria entre simpatizantes de
   ideias de esquerda, cujos coracoes e mentes se buscava conquistar para o
   lado do ``mundo livre{''} na Guerra Fria. Eles aproveitaram as
   circunstancias conforme suas proprias conveniencias, nao apenas de
   carreira pessoal, mas tambem na construcao institucional e politica, num
   jogo de mao dupla com os interesses dos Estados Unidos e dos empresarios
   que, juntos, financiaram a entidade. Criada durante o governo Kennedy, a
   AUI encerrou as atividades de intercambio diante da ofensiva
   conservadora do governo Nixon nos Estados Unidos e da ditadura no Brasil

Abstract = {Most empirical studies on states' personnel contributions to UN
   peacekeeping operations (PKOs) use a state's annual contributions as the
   unit of analysis. A critical problem of the state-level analysis is that
   it ignores the fact that states have to decide how to distribute these
   peacekeepers among more than a dozen peacekeeping missions. Ignoring the
   mission-level decision misses a significant part of states' UN PKO
   contributions and could bias our empirical analysis. We propose a
   two-level model that sees a state's UN PKO contributions as the
   interactions between the state-level and mission-level factors. This
   model is employed to revisit the heatedly debated ``reimbursement
   hypothesis{''}. Our analysis of the empirical data between 1990 and 2018
   shows a mixed relationship between states' economic development and
   their UN PKO contributions. We also find that middle-income rather than
   low-income countries are the most critical providers of UN PKOs since
   the end of the cold war.},

Abstract = {Many governments find it challenging to set up a regulatory regime to
   govern rapidly developing Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) technologies
   empowered by Artificial Intelligence. This paper analyzes flexible
   regulation as a tool for assessing regulatory reforms that govern
   disruptive innovations such as AVs. After defining flexible regulation
   as regulation that gives regulated entities choices for how to comply
   with the regulatory objectives, this paper develops Regulatory
   Flexibility Indicators (RFI) for rule structure, enforcement structure,
   and regulatory feedback. We study AVs regulatory reforms that took place
   recently in the United Kingdom and South Korea, focusing on how such
   reforms have enhanced regulation flexibility. This paper finds that
   regulatory governance in the United Kingdom is more flexible than in
   South Korea, indicating aspects of further reforms for improving
   regulatory flexibility.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to critically analyze the challenges and
   possibilities underlying the application of participatory processes
   based on artificial intelligence algorithms in politics. It will focus
   on the proposal of augmented democracy which is being designed and
   developed from different technological and academic fields based on
   digital twins and design principles. Currently, the disaffection of
   citizens in the different political processes, such as the drafting of
   laws and the implementation of strategies and public policies, and the
   inability of political representatives to fully absorb the voice of the
   citizens, has become a burden for the development of modern societies.
   In response to such social and political challenges, the academic and
   technological world has come up with participatory proposals such as
   augmented democracy that raise the possibility of adapting and applying
   technology from the productive industry: digital twins.},

Abstract = {Whereas much research with adolescents in Africa engages them mainly
   with respect to issues limited and explicitly related to youth, this
   research note makes epistemic and methodological arguments for engaging
   adolescents more broadly in our research about Africa. I present a
   practical application of research design and methods based on these
   arguments through a study with adolescents in a secondary school in
   Ghana in which I engendered their enthusiastic participation in the
   research process. Through this, I demonstrate how taking a critical
   approach to epistemologies and methodologies in research with young
   participants can expand and enrich our knowledge of and about the
   continent.},

Title = {Economic Lawfare: The Logic and Dynamics of Using Law to Exercise
   Economic Power},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Unprecedented economic interdependence and the extensive legalization of
   international commerce have created unique opportunities for states to
   exercise power in world politics. Yet, while international relations
   (IR) scholars have revealed much about how interdependence conditions
   the ability of states to leverage economic relationships to influence
   other actors, the equivalent role of law has received less systematic
   attention. This article explains the logic and dynamics that inform how,
   why, and under what conditions states may use law as a sword or shield
   in the realm of international commerce. Drawing upon the IR literature
   on economic statecraft and the international law literature on lawfare,
   the article conceptualizes ``economic lawfare{''} and uses it to
   elucidate how law may shape the use of economic power. It outlines a
   typology of pathways through which economic lawfare can be employed and
   their associated opportunities and constraints, before presenting a
   simple model of key dynamics that shape their use. That model's
   plausibility is probed and the pathways are empirically illustrated in
   two case studies of recent episodes in which the Chinese government has
   sought to manipulate international commerce for strategic purposes. The
   article clarifies the distinction between legal and nonlegal instruments
   of economic statecraft, offers a theoretically explicit account of key
   mechanisms through which law may condition the use of economic power,
   and provides new conceptual foundations for emerging research on how
   institutions shape the ability of states to intervene in markets to
   achieve strategic objectives.},

   Depending on Political Ideology: A Comparison Between the USA and New

Abstract = {Reducing the spread of infectious viruses (e.g., COVID-19) can depend on
   societal compliance with effective mitigations. Identifying factors that
   influence adherence can inform public policy. In many cases, public
   health messaging has become highly moralized, focusing on the need to
   act for the greater good. In such contexts, a person's moral identity
   may influence behavior and serve to increase compliance through
   different mechanisms: if a person sees compliance as the right thing to
   do (internalization) and/or if a person perceives compliance as
   something others will notice as the right thing to do (symbolization).
   We argue that in societies that are more politically polarized, people's
   political ideology may interact with their moral identity to predict
   compliance. We hypothesized that where polarization is high (e.g., USA),
   moral identity should positively predict compliance for liberals to a
   greater extent than for conservatives. However, this effect would not
   occur where polarization is low (e.g., New Zealand). Moral identity,
   political ideology, and support for three different COVID-19 mitigation
   measures were assessed in both nations (N = 1,980). Results show that
   while moral identity can influence compliance, the political context of
   the nation must also be taken into account.},

Abstract = {In contemporary international society, Afghanistan may be cited as a
   dysfunctional entity with a litany of internal conflicts. One of these
   bedeviling anomalies relates to the prevalence of a culture of sexual
   violation of preadolescent boys by powerful male patrons. This
   widespread practice, colloquially known as bacha bazi, exists in an
   informal institutionalized form. While bacha bazi predates the current
   round of internal strife and war, the prevailing political chaos and
   conflict dynamics in the country have contributed to its persistent
   growth.},

Abstract = {This article constructs a measure of geopolitical and economic tensions
   in US-China relations based on the sentiment expressed in major US news
   media and utilizes it to analyze the impact of bilateral tensions on US
   imports from China between 2002 and 2019. Our results suggest that
   bilateral tensions have had a negative effect on US imports. Additional
   analyses of the impact of bilateral tensions for industries with varying
   levels of supply chain linkages to China suggest that, contrary to
   expectations, they have more disproportionately affected industries
   highly integrated with the Chinese market. This pattern continues to
   hold during the trade war period. Not only were bilateral tensions
   associated with higher tariffs for industries with high levels of global
   value chain linkages to China, but the tariff hikes have also had a more
   sustained impact on such industries. Overall, our findings indicate that
   potential ``sunk costs{''} considerations may not have been strong
   enough to forestall the downward trend in bilateral trade relations
   under both routine diplomacy and trade war conditions.},

Abstract = {The consequences of `Brexit' are many, and one that is little discussed
   is the reigniting of the debate as to whether Britain's Overseas
   Territories (BOTs) should have direct representation within the United
   Kingdom Houses of Parliament; presently they do not. Proponents suggest
   that this would strengthen the territories' voice in, and links with,
   Britain. The article considers this debate by drawing on some of the
   extant literature on what constitutes a demos, as well as descriptive
   representation, and the experiences of the Faroe Islands, Greenland,
   Aland, and Puerto Rico, which do have direct representation in their
   respective metropolitan parliaments. The article suggests that although
   there are strong normative arguments for such representation, the mixed
   record of the territories featured does not offer compelling evidence
   that a change for the BOTs would bring about significant improvements in
   how their interests are represented and defended.},

Abstract = {Political opposition to fiscal adjustments has varied significantly
   across countries. Our analysis links this variation to differences in
   the congruence of voter attitudes towards fiscal trade-offs across
   political blocs in different countries. These differences in attitudes,
   in turn, coincide with the implications of the distinct macroeconomic
   growth strategies that these countries pursue. Based on original survey
   data, we show that in Germany, supporters of different parties not only
   share similar views on the appropriate size of fiscal adjustment, but
   also on how to distribute these cuts across various spending items. In
   Spain, there is fundamental disagreement on the amount of austerity, but
   voters largely agree on the composition of fiscal adjustments. In the
   UK, there is disagreement between voters of diverging political blocs on
   both accounts. Variation in public attitudes, therefore, gives rise to
   very diverse political dynamics surrounding fiscal adjustments in
   different countries.},

Title = {Assessing the network power capacity of Informal International
   Governmental Organizations (IIGO): comparing BRICS and MIKTA},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 30},
Abstract = {This paper examines the conditions under which informal groupings such
   as BRICS and MIKTA create and sustain networks that are able to
   effectively influence global governance architecture, and compares the
   level of that network power from a state-centric perspective and
   covering the period until February 2022. In doing so, it uses a network
   power capacity (hereafter NPC) framework derived from Hafner-Burton et
   al. (Int Organ 63(3):559-592, 2009) work on Networks Analysis in
   International Relations, which is based on five main variables: (1) the
   existence of strong states within informal groupings, (2) the existence
   of strong intra-economic and institutional ties, (3) common norms,
   values, and culture among members of IIGOs, (4) the level of power
   symmetry among the members of the informal grouping and (5) the
   engagement of IIGO members in the networks of existing, established
   powers through the signature of agreements. In the final analysis, it
   concludes that BRICS has a stronger NPC than MIKTA, since it has (1) a
   higher number of powerful members, (2) stronger intra-institutional and
   economic ties, (3) greater congruence of shared norms and values by its
   members and (4) more members engaged with the existing established
   powers (namely the USA and the EU) through the signing of bilateral and
   multilateral agreements.},

Abstract = {Federalism allows state politicians opportunities to undermine or
   support for federal policies. As a result, voters often have varied
   impressions of the same federal programmes. To test how this dynamic
   affects voting behaviour, I gather data on the severity of the opioid
   epidemic from 2006-2016.1 exploit discontinuities between states that
   expanded Medicaid and those that did not to gain causal leverage over
   whether expansion affected the severity of the epidemic and whether
   these policy effects affected policy feedback. I show that the decision
   to expand Medicaid reduced the severity of the opioid epidemic. I also
   show that expanding Medicaid and subsequent reductions in the severity
   of the opioid epidemic increased support for the Democratic Party. The
   results imply that the Republican Party performed better in places where
   voters did not have access to Medicaid expansion and where the epidemic
   worsened, demonstrating an unintended consequence of federalism on
   policy feedback.},

   become one of the main NSAGs outside the Regime control areas, by
   applying qualitative methodology using two data sources: primarily,
   semi-structured field interviews, secondarily, related sources of
   newspapers/research centers' publications. Findings show that the
   decisive military factor and ability to build an interest-based
   relationship with local elites, impose order and security, and provide

Abstract = {To what extent are legislators, responsible for the implementation of
   many peace agreements, responsive to citizens' preferences? Examining
   the 2016 Colombian peace agreement, we embed an experiment in the 2019
   wave of a survey of all the members of Congress. We inform legislators
   about the attitudes of the general population and residents of
   conflict-affected regions on a provision included in the peace
   agreement: the creation of 16 special seats in the House of
   Representatives reserved for conflict areas. We find that legislators
   underestimate citizen support for this policy, and the magnitude of
   their misconception is correlated with the positions of their parties on
   the issue. Moreover, we find that providing information about citizens'
   support for the policy does not affect legislator support for the
   provision.},

Abstract = {Do existing theories regarding the impact of foreign migration explain
   preferences in non-oecd countries? The author adapts and applies
   explanations for opposition to migration in the Arabian Gulf, a
   significant region in global migration today, using a survey experiment
   implemented in Qatar. The results offer a rare validation of predictions
   from the labor market competition model, demonstrating that individual
   employment circumstances are important preference determinants.
   Additionally, while OECD citizens prefer high-skilled migrants, Qataris
   are indifferent about blue- versus white-collar workers. Mediation
   analysis suggests that this null effect is the result of competing
   cultural and economic concerns over the effect of differing classes of
   migrants on economic and social welfare. The novel context provides a
   critical test case of the labor market hypothesis and offers insight
   into how migration preferences in the Global South differ from the
   Western experience.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that peace studies and the Welsh school of critical
   security studies both define themselves in opposition to the traditional
   view of security, with the only difference that the former goes through
   the concept of peace in voicing its critique of security. Pointing to
   some striking similarities in the epistemology, methodology and ontology
   of Johan Galtung and Ken Booth, it shows that the two studies have been
   driving on parallel roads and that they would profit greatly from
   joining forces. Being the kind of applied and anti-hegemonic science
   that scholars at Aberystwyth strive for, peace studies could provide the
   Welsh school with greater practical applicability and access to everyday
   life. The Welsh school, in turn, could endow peace studies with academic
   reputation and a solid critical foundation. This would not only put
   peace back on the agenda of IR, but also contribute towards the
   decolonization of the discipline.},

Abstract = {The responsibility to protect (R2P) is often referred to as a new
   concept on the basis that it provides both states and the international
   community responsibilities, rather than merely rights, to protect
   populations from mass atrocities. As this article argues, this claim of
   novelty is overstated. And yet, R2P has comprised an important
   development in human protection over the past two decades: it has helped
   to generate a degree of consensus on how to prevent and address atrocity
   situations. If R2P is not as novel as is often suggested, why has it had
   such an impact on international discourse? After demonstrating R2P's
   overstated novelty, this article advances four key factors that help
   explain its meaningful international impact: the importance of previous
   and contiguous normative developments, the role played by norm
   entrepreneurs, the emphasis placed on prevention over intervention, and
   the concept's constructive mix of clarity and ambiguity. By doing so, it
   provides a stronger understanding of the norm.},

Title = {The Death of the Democratic Advantage?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {International relations scholarship has posited multiple pathways
   through which democracies accrue advantages in world politics. These
   range from enhanced warfighting capabilities to sovereign borrowing
   capacity to more constructive cooperation with like-minded regimes. A
   series of crises over the past generation, however, have called these
   advantages into question. This paper re-examines the key conceptual
   pillars underlying the democratic advantage in world politics. Scholars
   have posited that democracies possess inherent advantages in credible
   commitment mechanisms and public goods provision. The rise of populism
   has eroded these underlying advantages. Furthermore, the rise of China
   threatens to hamper the network effects that enhance democratic
   flourishing at the global level. Whether the democratic advantage is
   real and sustainable should be one of the defining political science
   research programs of this century.},

   Beliefs and a Distrust of Science},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic there have been marked changes in
   individuals' belief systems (e.g., support for lockdowns) as a result of
   the threat of COVID-19. In the current study, we investigated whether
   these belief systems change as a function of changes in the threat of
   COVID-19. Specifically, we conducted a longitudinal study, with
   authoritarianism measured at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in New
   Zealand and when the threat of COVID-19 was low (i.e., no known COVID-19
   cases in the community). A total of 888 participants responded at both
   timepoints, completing measures of political orientation and distrust of
   science, in addition to the measure of authoritarianism. We had two
   hypotheses. First, that liberals would display a more marked reduction
   in authoritarian submission between Alert Level 4 and Alert Level 1
   relative to conservatives. Second, that changes would be mediated by
   trust in science. Both hypotheses were supported, demonstrating that
   authoritarianism is sensitive to threat, even for those on the political
   left, and that trust in science helps to explain these changes. We
   suggest that fluctuations in authoritarianism may be different across
   the political spectrum due to underlying belief systems such as a
   distrust of science.},

Abstract = {The evolution of environmental policy is increasingly driven by the
   emergence and interaction of policy concepts and the frameworks,
   knowledge, and ideas they employ. We argue that policy actors' creative
   use of policy concepts often leads to their combinatorial development.
   In this policy process, the concepts interact and shape each other's
   policy relevance and future development under the influence of ideas,
   knowledge, and political factors. We formulate this new research
   approach using ideational and policy process theories. In particular, we
   explicate internal and contextual combinatory elements that enable
   policy change resulting from mutual development of policy concepts. For
   an empirical demonstration, we analyze the conceptual innovation, rise,
   and ramifications of nutrient recycling as a new segment of Finnish
   environmental policy.},

Abstract = {Many people remain invisible in all stages of policymaking processes and
   are re/harmed by policy decisions made in their absence, even where
   public engagement has occurred. This lack of meaningful engagement
   affects those experiencing homelessness, migrant workers, northern and
   Indigenous women, and others with whom we have collaborated. This
   article demonstrates the transformative potential of recognising these
   ???invisible??? actors as legitimate and effective actors in the policy
   process. In this article, we present a series of Canadian research
   vignettes, emerging from our empirical research programmes, that
   illuminate the possibilities for the principles of engaged scholarship
   to advance transformative, community-driven policymaking. Along with
   other critical policy scholars, we are concerned about how power
   circulates and is distributed unequally through public policy. Our focus
   in on how commitments manifested through engaged scholarship can disrupt
   these power distributions. Through our vignettes, we demonstrate how
   principles of engaged scholarship can shape public engagement, the
   understanding of policy problems, the creation of evidence, and the
   development of meaningful policy solutions. This article makes an
   important contribution on how to improve the processes of public
   engagement in policy development.},

Abstract = {Public administration is a discipline with considerable history, and is
   also a diverse, interdisciplinary field in social science. To analyze
   its evolution, discover the present research foci, and predict future
   development trends, this study applied scientometrics visualization
   technology to evaluate over 72,000 scientific articles from the 1920s to
   2020s. This research referred to the SSCI and JCR databases to gather
   scientific data of the discipline and the journals' impact factor.
   Consequently, paper citations, cited journals, journal co-citations,
   author co-citations, authoritative papers, top countries, productive
   institutes, average references, and research collaboration trends were
   analyzed on the bases of the published literature. This study found top
   productive journals in the discipline, discovered productive countries
   and institutes, present the research foci, and predicted future
   development trends. Through this study, scientific production,
   international cooperation, and knowledge evolution mode of public
   administration research offers a clear knowledge map of the public
   administration discipline.},

Abstract = {Counterinsurgents frequently rely on mass arrests to impede rebel
   operations, but in so doing, risk detaining innocent civilians. Wrongful
   detention can backfire, fueling insurgent violence by alienating
   detainees and their kin. Can counterinsurgents mitigate wrongful
   detention through targeted compensation? I study this question using
   project-level data on US payments to individuals deemed innocent and
   released from Coalition custody in Iraq between 2004 and 2008.
   Leveraging plausibly exogenous variation in the allocation of detainee
   release payments, I document a robust, negative association between
   counterinsurgent compensation for wrongful detention and insurgent
   violence. The violence-reducing effects of detainee release payments
   were greatest in Sunni and mixed sectarian areas; for the types of
   insurgent attacks, most prone to civilian informing; and when detainee
   release was complemented by other population-centric reforms. These
   results suggest that post-harm mitigation helps shift civilian
   perceptions, inducing civilians to share more information with
   counterinsurgent forces.},

Abstract = {In the past the, ICRC was not careful about establishing full
   independence from the Swiss government in Bern. This was especially true
   in the 1930s and 1940s, when ICRC policy closely mirrored Bern's
   preferences on key issues arising in relations with Italy and Germany.
   More recently, the ICRC drew the lesson that it should have had a more
   independent and dynamic discreet diplomacy, not that it should have
   necessarily engaged in public denunciations. This historical lesson
   about independent and dynamic quiet representations concerning specific
   problems guides ICRC diplomacy today. However, some recent developments
   raise anew the issue of full independence from Bern.},

   Speech in Televised Election Debates (1985-2019)},

Abstract = {In televised election debates, politicians confront each other
   side-by-side to publicly debate their political viewpoints. As a result,
   these debates have the potential to promote reflective reasoning in
   citizens. However, concerns are voiced regularly about politicians'
   increasing use of one-liners, slogans, and empty phrases, and decreasing
   use of elaborate and thoughtful argumentation, which may lower the
   debates' reflection-promoting potential. Despite concerns, systematic
   empirical evidence testing whether reflection-promoting speech is
   declining is extremely scarce. This study contributes to filling this
   gap by (1) identifying four reflection-promoting speech components, that
   is, provision of justifications, substantive information, accessible
   communication, and engagement with others' perspectives and (2)
   conducting a longitudinal quantitative content analysis (1985-2019) of
   Belgian election debates through the lens of their reflection-promoting
   potential. The results of all studied speech components point in the
   same direction: reflection-promoting speech in election debates has not
   declined, showing that allegations surrounding debates should be
   considered with caution.},

Abstract = {How do frontline workers implement policy when it is politically
   contested and they face strong pressure from politicians and the media?
   Based on original data and a multi-method analysis of juvenile justice
   policy and child protection policy in Switzerland, we show that
   political conflict can change policy implementation when frontline
   workers adapt their implementation practices in response to political
   and media pressure. We demonstrate that frontline workers seek to limit
   the influence of political pressure on policy implementation to
   safeguard their professional autonomy and reputation. However, we
   observe that they may also occasionally engage in what we call
   ``blame-avoiding policy implementation.{''} While formally complying
   with the policy mandate, frontline workers exploit their street-level
   discretion to make policy implementation less scandal-prone and
   blameworthy, thereby lowering the likelihood of blame attacks. The
   findings have important implications for our understanding of policy
   implementation and the functioning of bureaucracy in more conflictual
   times.},

Abstract = {For public health interventions to be effective, they need to be
   supported or at least accepted by those affected, and social policy
   should therefore be understood as political and strategic. This raises
   questions about the relationship between the analytical, the political
   and the personal in policy processes. This article offers an in-depth
   analysis of such issues, as they were enacted during interviews with
   Swedish alcohol policy stakeholders. It focuses on the assumptions and a
   priori `truths' articulated in interviews about Responsible Beverage
   Services (RBS) at Swedish football stadiums or `Football Without
   Bingeing'. We argue that the participants combined different narrative
   forms, such as seemingly objective chronological accounts and personal
   ethical judgments, in talking about the policy initiative. Through such
   narrative intersections, three key `truths' were produced that
   reinforced the link between alcohol and violence, necessitated blanket
   population-level measures to reduce alcohol use and made gendered
   behavior an irrelevant policy target.},

Abstract = {A core function of contemporary states is to ensure the security of
   their citizens. Yet in many post-conflict settings, non-state actors
   provide security alongside the state, typically prioritizing their own
   ascriptive groups and potentially undercutting a sense of national
   political community. When do citizens prefer group-specific versus
   national security? While most studies focus on individual psychological
   factors, we argue that group-level characteristics also shape political
   preferences. Based on a conjoint experiment in Lebanon, we explore the
   relative appeal of group-specific versus national pledges to assure
   protection. We find that respondents view national security provision
   quite positively, while members of communities with stronger
   group-specific security simultaneously favor private provision.
   Individuals with closer ties to credible group security providers are
   also more likely to prefer those services. Citizens therefore do not see
   a clear trade-off between private and public protection, while
   group-specific legacies mediate heterogeneity in support for pluralist
   security provision.},

Abstract = {This paper examines whether and how the imperatives of measuring
   Official Development Assistance (ODA; or development aid) are being
   translated to the policy world of South-South cooperation (SSC). Through
   a historical and political ethnographic account of a decade of global
   policy debates on Southern-led development cooperation between 2009 and
   2019, the paper argues that growing conversations on `SSC
   effectiveness', and how to measure it, reflect both prevalent
   `measurementalities' in the field as well as `traditional/Northern donor
   countries' continuous will to socialise and integrate `(re)-emerging
   Southern providers' into existing aid norms and practices. The paper
   also demonstrates Southern powerhouses'-such as Brazil, China, and
   India-agency in these accountability-related debates and their will to
   integrate differently into the `aid system' by proposing alternative
   tools to measure SSC flows and initiatives in their own terms. Finally,
   the paper argues that unfolding negotiations over quantifying,
   reporting, and evaluating Southern-led development cooperation reflect
   the politicised consolidation of SSC in the second decade of the 21st
   century. Current impasses at the multilateral level, moreover, reveal
   unsolved North-South disputes over power, status, and responsibility in
   international development and international affairs, more broadly.},

Abstract = {As the range of actors, issues and levels of negotiation at the COP26
   meeting in Glasgow demonstrates, the defining feature of global
   governance today is pluralism. Geopolitics, including swings in US
   global leadership and surging US-China competition, are part of the
   picture, but do not adequately explain the complexity of contemporary
   multilateralism. Deeper, systemic forces are at work - the birth pains
   of a more plural global system. This article identifies and examines
   four dimensions of pluralism: multipolarity, multiple issues,
   multi-level governance, and multiple stakeholders. The effect is that
   all states - including middle and small states - must be more active,
   more agile, more self-reliant, more willing to lead, and more oriented
   towards issues than ideology. The article illustrates the four
   dimensions through reviews of multilateral responses to COVID-19, cyber
   attacks, and mass migration, before asking how states and non-state
   actors can effectively manage a more plural system of governance. Three
   capacities for success are discussed: to act early and decisively by
   finding partners and fora for success; to embrace adhocracy internally
   and externally; and to rebalance effectiveness and trust through greater
   technocratic expertise, transboundary scientific cooperation, and a more
   inclusive diplomacy.},

Abstract = {Australian states exclude unvaccinated children from early education and
   care via `No Jab No Play' policies, but some offer exemptions for the
   socially disadvantaged. Such mandatory vaccination policies provoke
   heated arguments about morality and potential downstream impacts, and
   the politics of which kinds of people get exempted from mandates are
   often fraught. Synthesising existing frameworks for considering the role
   of moral principles and rational-technical justifications in
   policymaking, we show how the same values can be the focus of both
   `rational-instrumental' and `morality' frames, while `pragmatic'
   approaches are crowded out by high epistemic or moral certainty.},

Abstract = {Austerity policies tend to be generally unpopular and national
   governments have been found to lose support when they implement such
   policies. However, during the sovereign debt crisis, governments of
   `bailout countries' were pressured by European Union (EU) institutions
   to implement austerity measures. Did austerity measures affect trust in
   the EU? We investigate the impact of fiscal austerity on EU trust and
   how perceptions of responsibility and political ideology moderate this
   relationship. We apply multilevel models to Eurobarometer surveys and
   data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to analyze changes in
   trust in the EU in 27 EU-countries (2013-2015). Our results indicate
   that austerity has a negative effect on trust in the EU, but only among
   those who hold the EU responsible for austerity policies. We find no
   significant moderating effect of ideology.},

Abstract = {This paper puts forth a theory explaining domestic backlash against
   international investment law by connecting media coverage-specifically
   the bias in the news media's selection of international disputes-to
   public opinion formation towards international agreements. To test our
   theory, we examine both the content and effects of the media's reporting
   on international disputes, focusing on the increasingly controversial
   form known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). We find that
   newspaper outlets in both the United States and Canada have a bias in
   favor of covering disputes filed against their home country as opposed
   to those filed by home country firms. Using two national survey
   experiments fielded in the United States and Canada, we further find
   that the bias in news story selection has a strong negative effect on
   attitudes towards ISDS and related agreements, especially among highly
   nationalistic individuals.},

Abstract = {Ever since climate change became a political issue in the late 1980s, a
   number of industry coalitions have formed to oppose mandatory carbon
   emissions reductions. One key coalition was the Global Climate Coalition
   (GCC). This paper conducts a historical and empirical review of the
   activities of this coalition. This review shows that the GCC engaged in
   four distinct activities to obstruct climate action: 1) monitoring and
   contesting climate science, 2) commissioning and utilizing economic
   studies to amplify and legitimate their arguments, 3) shifting the
   cultural understanding of climate change through public relations
   campaigns and 4) conducting aggressive lobbying of political elites.
   Through these activities, the GCC played an important role in
   obstructing climate action, both in the U.S. and internationally.
   Further analysis of similar coalitions can aid in our understanding of
   the organized opposition to climate action.},

Abstract = {By focusing on the two Assads' periods (1971-2011), this study traces
   the evolution of the nature of the relationship between the state and
   its citizen(s) in Syria to explain the sources and complex dynamics of
   the protracted conflict. It aims to promote new approaches to peace and
   reconstruction in Syria through thinking about the origins of the
   conflict by analyzing the fragile foundations of citizenship as
   practice. In doing so, it unveils the relationship among citizenship
   practice, ethnoreligious identity, political economy, and allegiance to
   the regime in the country from the 1970s onwards. The study identifies
   `concentric' citizenship' in Syria, an approach to citizenship that has
   been toxic to social cohesion \& democracy and calls for attention in
   the Middle East to focus on citizenship debates to complement,
   challenge, and advance democratization studies.},

Abstract = {Much ado has been made about the specter of unconventional weapons in
   the hands of militant groups. Despite the alarmism of the policy
   community, the pursuit of chemical, biological, radiological, and
   nuclear capabilities by non-state actors is rare. What explains why some
   violent non-state organizations pursue chemical, biological,
   radiological, and nuclear weapons while most do not? Using new data on
   organizational behaviors and attributes from the Big Allied and
   Dangerous 2 Insurgency project, we analyze 140 insurgent actors, from
   1998 to 2012. We expand previous work by Asal, Ackerman \& Rethemeyer by
   studying the phenomenon longitudinally and attending to organizational
   behavior rather than only to structural and environmental factors. We
   find that organizations that attack cultural sites are more likely to
   pursue and use chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons.
   We interpret the latter as a willingness to transgress upon accepted
   mores, for the sake of sensationalism and shock value, which coheres
   with a willingness to pursue unconventional weapons. Our results reflect
   that chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear pursuit and use is
   part of a larger strategy for some violent non-state organizations, one
   predicated on generating mass fear and exacting a psychological toll.},

Abstract = {This special issue on `The Dynamics of Governance and Sustainable
   Development Goals in the Global South', with a focus on the `Asian
   Models of Governance', aims to fill the gap by contributing to expanding
   and advancing the transnational knowledge transfer literature by
   bringing new cases from the Global South. It also hopes to further
   advance the discussions translating some aspects of Asian experiences of
   governance in developing an outcome-driven knowledge and policy transfer
   model for SDGs. The articles in this issue of Global Policy were
   selected from papers first presented at the London School of Economics -
   IDEAS and Nanyang Technological University - Nanyang Centre for Public
   Administration (LSE-IDEAS and NTU-NCPA) Joint Workshop on the Dynamics
   of Knowledge Transfer and Governance in the Global South, held at the
   London School of Economics in November 2019.},

Abstract = {The Bosnian `safe areas' established in the 1990s failed abysmally at
   civilian protection; indeed, by generating moral hazard, they may have
   worsened the humanitarian situation. Drawing on declassified documents
   as well as other primary sources, this article makes the case that US,
   British, and French support for the safe areas can be understood as an
   instance of mutual alliance entanglement. The United States and its
   principal European allies had serious doubts that the safe areas could
   effectively protect civilians. Nevertheless, the Western powers agreed
   to support the safe areas diplomatically and by means of a limited NATO
   airpower commitment. The expectation was that this would allow them to
   signal alliance unity after a period of transatlantic discord and
   showcase their ability for joint action. The article sheds new light on
   the origins of the Bosnian safe areas and illuminates how alliance
   pressures might pull NATO members toward ill-conceived military
   interventions.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {613-636},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Purpose The present study aims to investigate the direct and indirect
   relationship between abusive supervision (AS) and employees' intention
   to quit (ITQ) and employee misconduct (EM). Though the direct
   relationship was investigated in past studies; however, the indirect
   effect of the said relationships via workplace ostracism (WO) and the
   interaction effect of resilience on the direct relationship based on the
   conservation of resource theory and social exchange theory were hardly
   explored. Design/methodology/approach The data was collected through a
   cross-sectional survey using standardized measures. In the current
   study, the responses from 575 respondents were analysed using partial
   least squares structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses.
   Findings The study's findings stressed that AS positively affects an
   employee's ITQ and EM. WO was found to be a significant mediator and
   resilience as a significant moderator for AS, ITQ and EM relationships.
   Originality/value The study is one of the few studies in the Indian
   context linking AS to ITQ and EM in the presence of WO as a mediator and
   resilience as a moderator.},

Abstract = {There has been little research on the significance of religion in
   migration studies. The objective of this article is twofold: first, to
   explain religion as a complexly intertwined concept within migration
   discourses; second, to examine the implications of various terminologies
   such as Islamism, political Islam, and the politicization of Islam in
   the modern world within a broad migration framework. We have chosen 11
   respondents from different countries by snow-ball technique to
   interview. The paper argues that religion becomes crucial to people's
   migratory experiences, aiming to construct a theoretically informed link
   between religion and migration. The study emphasizes the significance of
   international standards in ensuring migrants' `religious rights' in host
   countries. The interesting thing is that migrants bring their religious
   beliefs, practices, and way of life with them, enriching destination
   countries by exposing them to new cultures and fostering social
   cohesiveness via peaceful coexistence.},

   Biopolitics},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Rebel groups govern significant parts of territory worldwide. They often
   deliver crucial public goods and services to populations under their
   control. Scholarship on rebel governance commonly explains this with the
   need for armed groups to generate local and international legitimacy. We
   argue that this understanding of rebel governance as an instrumental
   means to power is insufficient. Instead, we propose a novel
   conceptualization of rebel governance as competing biopolitics. Tracing
   biopolitical technologies of rebel rule reveals the productive functions
   of war-time social orders for molding populations into imagined
   communities in direct opposition to the existing nation state. We
   develop this perspective by mobilizing Foucault's work in conjunction
   with Chatterjee's postcolonial understanding of governmentality in
   contexts of postcolonial state- and nation-formation, and empirical
   research on the Pat Jasan in northern Myanmar. Linked to the Kachin
   rebellion, this movement has fought against a devastating narcotics
   crisis with biopolitical interventions that form the Kachin nation body
   amidst protracted ethnonational conflict. Beyond shedding light on one
   of the world's longest running but least-researched civil wars, this
   offers three distinct contributions to international studies: exploring
   non-state armed groups as actors of public health, theorizing the
   sociological underpinnings of rebel governance, and developing the
   concept of biopolitics beyond the nation state.},

Abstract = {Public goods are ``non-excludable{''} and ``non-rivalrous{''} resources,
   including roads, water management systems, and plazas, as well as
   ``symbolic public goods,{''} such as religious architecture and social
   identity. Public goods occur in greater abundance in cities with more
   cooperative and inclusive forms of organization, which seems to
   undermine arguments that elites constructed them to augment their power.
   Such goods are major ``pull{''} factors drawing migration to modern
   cities, but ancient cities also had public goods that likely attracted
   immigrants, increasing their population and diversity. We examine these
   ideas at Middle Preclassic-period (cal 800-300 BC) Nixtun-Ch'ich', in
   Peten, Guatemala. This city and other Preclassic metropoles in the Maya
   lowlands seem to have been on the more-cooperative end of a
   cooperative-competitive spectrum, compared to most cities of the Classic
   period (AD 200-900). We also speculate about how symbolic public goods
   were coopted to create a more exclusive social system in the Late
   Preclassic period (300 BC-AD 200).},

Title = {The Intricacies of Firms' Support for Labor Provisions in US Trade
   Agreements},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {483-494},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Do pro-trade firms want trade agreements to include stronger provisions
   protecting workers? The position of those firms in the US in recent
   years is often counterintuitive vis-a-vis the expectations of the
   literature. To solve that puzzle, I argue that it is necessary to
   account for the intricacies of the position of firms/associations on US
   trade-labor linkage according to their GVC integration. I argue that
   highly GVC-integrated firms/associations fear the uncertainties of
   strong labor provisions in PTAs and prefer to oppose commitments that
   could potentially lead to sanctions. However, it can be risky to oppose
   the inclusion of strong labor provisions in US PTAs. Instead, I argue
   that highly integrated firms/associations nowadays support trade-labor
   linkage but attach intricate conditions to that support based on lessons
   from previous experiences. To probe that argument, I perform a
   qualitative text analysis of the public submissions of firms/industry
   associations positioning themselves on the link between trade and labor
   in US PTAs between 2008 and 2020. The empirical analysis underscores the
   plausibility of my hypothesis. The results point to subtle ways in which
   pro-trade firms may lobby trade-labor linkage. The paper has
   implications to the design of sustainable development provisions in US
   PTAs and beyond.},

   Restrictions, Collective Narcissism, and Justification of Ethnic

Abstract = {Surveys conducted across multiple countries show that most people view
   seeking lower immigration to help maintain the majority group's
   population share as a sign of racial self-interest-as opposed to racism.
   We investigated whether the belief that it is not racist to want
   immigration restrictions for cultural reasons is associated with ingroup
   identification (a positive attachment to and solidarity with one's
   group) or collective narcissism (a conviction that the ingroup is
   exceptional and deserves special treatment). We argue that if this
   belief reflects concern for the ingroup, it should be linked to ingroup
   identification. However, if it is a defensive justification of the
   ingroup's privileged position, it should be linked to collective
   narcissism. Across four studies, national (Study 1: United Kingdom, N =
   467; Study 2: Poland, N = 1,285) and ethnic (Study 3a: United States, N
   = 2,000; Study 3b: United States, N = 2,938) narcissism emerged as
   predictors of the belief that ethnoculturally motivated immigration
   restrictions are racial self-interest (vs. racism). This belief was also
   associated with justifying collective violence against migrants (Study
   2) and supporting the alt-right (Studies 3a-3b). We found less
   consistent evidence for an association between ingroup identification
   and immigration-restriction beliefs. We discuss implications for
   intergroup relations and political extremism.},

Abstract = {Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's cordial relations with the
   Biden administration and relatively muted posture during nuclear
   negotiations in Vienna raise questions about whether his government is
   pursuing a different strategy towards Iran than did his predecessor,
   Benjamin Netanyahu. This article argues that it is not. Despite
   reinvigorated Israeli debates critical of Netanyahu's policies and
   improved atmospherics with the American government, official Israeli
   policy remains essentially unchanged. The Israeli government is still
   wary of nuclear diplomacy, offers few alternatives to continued
   diplomatic and economic pressure, and views military options as viable
   even if they can only set back Iran's nuclear programme temporarily.
   While Bennett wants to avoid open confrontation with Washington, Israel
   will not relax tensions with Iran, particularly in non-nuclear arenas
   like Syria. In the past, Israeli sabotage against Iran's nuclear assets
   subsided in the run-up to and after the nuclear agreement; this time
   around, Israel may not feel so constrained.},

Abstract = {The article examines the Soviet nationality policy in Belarus in
   1944-1947 during the population exchange between the Soviet Union and
   Poland. Unlike in Lithuania and Ukraine, the authorities in Belarus
   prioritized keeping the labor force over national homogenization,
   determined nationality by territory of birth, and attempted to keep the
   people by designating them as Belarusians irrespective of their
   self-identification. The article argues that in Belarus, the population
   transfer was a combination of an exodus of refugees with the expulsion
   of Poles by the state. Although the declarations about the voluntary
   character of the resettlement were false, the direction of the
   compulsion varied, and this ambivalence opened up a space of limited
   autonomy in which the people could exercise agency. The Soviet ethnic
   cleansing remained incomplete in Soviet Belarus because of the competing
   urge to keep the labor force. Paradoxically, much of the demographic
   de-Polonization of new western territories of Soviet Belarus was
   achieved without the state's commitment to ethnic cleansing and without
   the involvement of Belarusian nationalism.},

Abstract = {This article provides a qualitative examination of two cases of
   Participatory Budgeting (PB) in Shanghai - a long-running PB initiative
   in Minhang District, organised in cooperation with the District People's
   Congress, and a one-off project in Yangjing Sub-district, Pudong, in
   2017, jointly organised by a community foundation and residents'
   committee. The article seeks to interrogate the relationship between the
   Party, state and society at the sub-municipal level through one
   `state-facing' PB initiative and one `society-facing' PB initiative. We
   reveal how PB is deeply embedded in Party structures and networks,
   formally in the case of Minhang and informally in the case of Yangjing.
   Our research contributes to three debates on participatory governance in
   urban China. Firstly, contrary to the existing literature, PB neither
   primarily `emancipates' citizens nor off-loads budgetary decisions onto
   them; instead, PB contributes towards party-building and citizens'
   orderly participation, thereby strengthening overall Party leadership.
   Secondly, we challenge the widely-used term `party-state', instead
   separating out these three entities and showing how they serve distinct
   roles in grassroots governance innovations such as PB. Thirdly, we show
   how participatory mechanisms developed in one political and cultural
   context can have vastly differing effects when employed in another.},

Abstract = {In 2019, China's Central Military Commission adopted a new strategy for
   the People's Liberation Army, titled the `military strategic guidelines
   for the new era.' This was consistent with the past but framed by Xi's
   political consolidation, growing threats from the United States and
   Taiwan, and a new military structure. This article documents the
   strategy and asks what would drive a more fundamental adjustment. It
   concludes that the strategy reflected a determination to focus the PLA
   on the necessary and the achievable, but a new direction could be
   influenced by changes in the strategic landscape, rapid modernization,
   or new operational concepts.},

Abstract = {European regulatory networks are increasingly becoming crucial venues
   for European governance. They typically emerged as relatively loose
   groups of national authorities in charge of meta-regulating sectoral
   policies. However, in the medium term, they experienced dissimilar
   developmental patterns. On the one hand, some networks (such as the
   Committee of European Securities Regulators - CESR) have been
   progressively institutionalized, transformed into European agencies, and
   acquired considerable regulatory powers, including enforcement. On the
   other hand, other networks (such as the European Competition Network -
   ECN) remained more flexible networked organizations embodying a soft
   coordination approach. This article aims at mapping these divergent
   patterns and explore their determinants. To do so, we investigate the
   cases of CESR and ECN with a documentary and interview-based comparative
   inquiry. Results indicate that agencification has also been a strategy
   enacted by European institutions, using the financial crisis as a window
   of opportunity, to regain control over a powerful network - CESR - that
   came to constitute an increasingly autonomous layer of governance.
   Contrariwise, as ECN did not spin out of control, its trajectory
   exhibits a remarkable stability.},

Title = {Against Putin and Corruption, for Navalny and the ``Revolution{''}?
   The Dynamics of Framing and Mobilization in the Russian Political

Abstract = {This article seeks to provide a better understanding of the dynamics of
   the nationwide protests that appeared in Russia as a result of the
   large-scale political campaigns of 2017-18. On the basis of an original
   database devoted to six protests, organized in this period by different
   anti-systemic opposition leaders and organizations, the study explores
   the turnout and geographic scope of these events and the repertoire of
   frames that were used to mobilize the protesters. The analysis contrasts
   three types of frames (an anti-corruption protest frame, election
   campaign event frame, and anti-systemic protest frame) and demonstrates
   that appropriate framing was a necessary condition of successful protest
   mobilization. In combination with other factors, such as the quality of
   protest organization and the impact of repressive actions of the
   authorities, the changes of protest frames contributed to the protests'
   turnout dynamics. Alexei Navalny, the most popular anti-systemic leader,
   succeeded in organizing the initial mobilization by framing it as an
   anti-corruption protest, but then, under increasing repression, the
   opposition failed to convert this dissent into a longer-term campaign
   with broader electoral or anti-systemic frames.},

Abstract = {Why do business leaders support or oppose interstate wars? This article
   clarifies and empirically illustrates two competing perspectives on the
   sources of business war preferences: the opinions businesses have about
   interstate conflict. Namely, while an ``economic consequences{''}
   perspective argues that business war preferences stem primarily from the
   economic effects of interstate conflicts, a ``leader ideology{''}
   perspective predicts that business leaders' domestic policy preferences
   and political ideology will determine their war preferences. I reexamine
   historical survey data on American business leaders' opinions about the
   Vietnam War using item response theory scaling and regression analysis
   and find support for both perspectives. These results point toward the
   importance of further theoretical and empirical research on the sources
   of business war preferences, so I propose a structured, forward-looking
   research agenda on business war preferences based on different
   conceptualizations of businesses, their motivations, and the
   consequences of interstate conflicts.},

Abstract = {When things go wrong, and the government may be to blame, the public
   support enjoyed by elected executives is vulnerable. Because attribution
   of responsibility is often not straightforward, elected executives can
   influence citizens' evaluations of their performance through
   presentational strategies, or explanatory frames which describe their
   roles in the management of the crisis. We examine the effectiveness of
   two ubiquitous presentational strategies: blame claiming, where the
   executive accepts responsibility, and blame deflecting, where the
   executive shifts blame to others. Using survey experiments incorporating
   stylised and real-world stimuli, we find that blame claiming is more
   effective than blame deflecting at managing public support in the
   aftermath of crises. In investigating the underlying mechanism, we find
   that blame claiming creates more favourable views of an executive's
   leadership valence. While elected executives are better off avoiding
   crises, we find that when they occur, ``stopping the buck{''} is a
   superior strategy to deflecting blame.},

Abstract = {Contrary to the common promise of the UN Charter, mass atrocities
   continue to be committed as the wars in Yemen and South Sudan or the
   fate of the Rohingya in Myanmar demonstrate. Using Germany as an
   example, this article examines the thesis that mass atrocity situations
   are silenced which inhibits their politicisation. Drawing on
   interdisciplinary literature on silencing and theoretical approaches
   (agenda-setting, desecuritisation, discourse-bound identity theory) a
   working definition of silencing in foreign policy is proposed. Silencing
   appears to be a structural feature of `identity mismatch' characterised
   by three modes: non-mentioning, trivialisation and framing. A
   rhetoric-analysis of speech acts by the German chancellor, foreign
   ministers and leaders of the parliamentary groups on the aforementioned
   cases shows in which way the German political elite in fact silences
   mass atrocities.},

Abstract = {The United Kingdom (UK) has traditionally exerted significant influence
   on the global human rights agenda through its diplomacy in multilateral
   human rights forums. This influence, stemming from the UK's geopolitical
   standing, its membership of the European Union (EU) and the perception
   that the UK is a strong supporter and advocate of human rights, has been
   utilised to advance its own human rights priorities and influence the
   activities of other states. By examining recent developments, including
   the UK's departure from the EU, the rise of populist sentiments
   internationally and a growing scrutiny of the UK's domestic human rights
   record, this article explores both the opportunities and challenges
   posed by these emerging challenges. In so doing, the analysis casts
   doubt on the unfettered optimism of `Global Britain', the idea that the
   UK can emerge from its ties with the EU as an influential actor in the
   field of human rights.},

Abstract = {This study explores the structure of advocacy coalitions and frames over
   time in South Korea's adversarial nuclear energy policy subsystem. It
   relies on the Advocacy Coalition Frameworks and Discourse Network
   Analysis to guide data collection from 1149 policy statements in 502
   newspaper articles of South Korea spanning four years. Using E-I Index,
   modularity index, and coalition polarization for data analysis, it finds
   an alignment of advocacy coalitions with increasing polarization through
   external events and the ongoing adaptation of frames to these events.
   The findings contribute insights into the characteristics of distinct,
   stable, and polarized coalitions and their frames in the high-conflicted
   policy areas in tumultuous times in the context of non-Western
   countries.},

Title = {Cultivating health policy capacity through network governance in New
   Zealand: learning from divergent stories of policy implementation},

Abstract = {Wu, Howlett, and Ramesh's understanding of policy capacity has been used
   to identify generalizable strengths and weaknesses of specific
   jurisdictions and policy sectors such as health. In an extension of this
   work, Howlett and Ramesh have argued that the mode of governance of a
   policy sector accentuates the importance of specific elements of policy
   capacity. In this paper we focus on the implementation of the System
   Level Measures Framework (SLMF) in New Zealand that has been
   specifically focused on health systems improvement and which aimed to do
   so by fostering network governance at the local level. However, this
   policy is introduced in a context in which there has been significant
   contestation regarding which mode of governance-network or hierarchy-is
   dominant in New Zealand health policy. By exploring three divergent
   local cases of implementation of the SLMF we develop three arguments
   that contribute to the literature on policy capacity and health.
   Firstly, local histories of interorganizational play a crucial role in
   shaping health policy capacity. Secondly, it is crucially important to
   understand the dynamics and feedback loops between operational,
   political, and analytical policy capacity. Network and hierarchical
   governance are characterized by distinct and contrasting understandings
   of the content of policy capacity elements and of the way in which they
   are dynamically related. Thirdly, the key challenge in developing policy
   capacity compatible with network governance is how to facilitate this
   capacity when connections between operational, political, and analytical
   policy capacity fail to fire.},

Abstract = {This research note reports social capital trends in Germany during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. It is based on a comparison of survey data from
   2017/18 and 2020/21, i.e., trends reported here inform about changes of
   social capital levels during the ``second lockdown{''} of the pandemic,
   when containment policies were in effect throughout the country.
   Findings point to stable levels of in-group trust, out-group trust and
   prosocial attitudes. At the same time, sociability orientations are
   lower and society is generally perceived as less solidary. Members in
   voluntary organizations have more social capital compared to
   non-members-this difference is found before as well as during the
   pandemic. Regarding that changes are generally small, it can be
   concluded that the pandemic did neither strengthen social capital
   considerably, nor did it lead to a massive overall decline of social
   capital.},

Abstract = {Only a few studies on biological terrorism have ever been conducted
   empirically. Many of these focus on CBRN terrorism as a whole, rather
   than biological terrorism, specifically. Other accounts utilize a case-
   or historical analysis instead. This study serves as the most
   comprehensive empirical assessment of bioterrorism to date by drawing on
   the Profiles of Incidents involving CBRN and Non-State Actors (POICN)
   Database at START as well as additional databases. The databases were
   merged to create a database whereby both CBRN and non-CBRN cases were
   included for both individuals and groups. Several binary logistic
   regression models (1990-2016) were then executed on biological weapons
   pursuit. The type of actor and ideology seem to be the most important
   factors for predicting biological weapons pursuit, although ethnic
   fractionalization was also negatively correlated with biological weapons
   pursuit. Governance measures had variable, but negative relationships
   with pursuit as well. Implications and recommendations are discussed.},

   address why, we provide a model and empirical test of how citizens'
   anti-crime policy preferences respond to information. Our model shows
   that preferences for anti-crime policy hinge on expectations about the
   crime rate: punitive policies are preferred in high crime contexts,
   whereas social policies are preferred in low crime contexts. We evaluate
   these expectations through an information experiment embedded in the
   2017 Latin American Public Opinion Project survey conducted in Panama.
   As expected by our theory, a high crime message induced stronger
   preferences in favour of punitive policies. Unanticipated by our theory,
   but in line with cursory evidence and survey results, we find that a low
   crime message did not induce stronger preferences in favour of social
   policies. These findings are consistent with policy ratcheting: punitive
   policies increase during periods of high crime and remain in place
   during periods of low crime.},

Abstract = {Battlefield coalitions are distinct warfighting collectives. They are
   the groups of forces created by states that are formal allies, states
   that have no written agreement to cooperate militarily, non-state
   actors, or some combination thereof to engage in combat at the
   operational and tactical levels of war. They are also increasingly
   common belligerents in war, but there is little scholarship on their
   creation, composition, operation, and achievements. This special issue
   begins the necessary work of improving our understanding of battlefield
   coalitions, providing new insight into their nature and capabilities, as
   well as the military and political consequences of their combat
   operations.},

Abstract = {Civic activism is increasingly popular for authoritarian regimes to
   ensure local compliance and improve local governance, but it also places
   pressure on local officials. How do local officials respond to such
   pressures? With a unique dataset of city-level environmental
   investigations and public interest litigation in China, we conduct a
   generalized difference-in-difference analysis and find that public
   interest litigation, a new legal channel for social actors to monitor
   environmental governance, can significantly reduce information
   disclosure related to investigations. Furthermore, it changes the focus
   of investigations: the number of low-profile investigations is
   increased, while the number of high-profile cases is decreased. This
   finding reveals how local officials avoid public monitoring by reducing
   information disclosure but maintaining a certain level of enforcement,
   which implies that the effect of civic engagement on the accountability
   of local governments in authoritarian regimes is dynamic with the
   coevolution of strategies of local officials and civil societies.},

Abstract = {This article develops a micro-level theoretical perspective of business
   influence in international negotiations. By drawing on organizational
   institutional theory, the article proposes that site-specific
   institutionalized norms can structure the nature and extent of business
   power. The article illustrates the value of this perspective through an
   illustrative case study of the International Maritime Organization (IMO)
   through interviews and participant observation of on-site dynamics
   during negotiations on environmental shipping regulation. The article
   shows how, in the case of the IMO, specific institutionalized norms and
   beliefs structure private actors' possible influence and their claims to
   authority. In particular, strongly held beliefs about the nature of
   political deliberation in the IMO both constrain and enable business
   interests, sometimes overriding the general structural power of the
   shipping industry. This research implies that future scholarship of
   business power and lobbying should be attentive to specific
   institutionalized ideas structuring business actors' range of legitimate
   activities, in particular in international institutions where individual
   negotiation sites can develop idiosyncratic norms and beliefs about the
   legitimacy of private actor participation.},

Abstract = {In the US system of decentralized federalism, competitive dynamics among
   local governments are not incompatible with successful interlocal
   collaboration. Municipalities often collaborate with competing
   jurisdictions in the same region to provide services and solve problems.
   Yet, competitive relations among municipalities are expected to
   complicate collaboration, escalating transaction costs due to divergent
   goals and lack of trust. This article uses the Institutional Collective
   Action framework to examine the conditions under which local governments
   are best able to surmount competition-related hurdles and successfully
   partner with their chief municipal competitors. An original survey of
   mayors and councilors is used to test potential predictors of
   collaboration among top competitors. Results show that municipalities
   often collaborate with their chief competitors but are less likely to do
   so when they are situated in municipally-fragmented regions, when they
   are located in a different county from their top competitors, and when
   they are fiscally strong.},

Title = {The Road to Sevres: Kurdish Elites and Question of Self- Determination
   After the First World War},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on Kurdish elites and their quest for a Kurdish state
   during the Peace Conference that took place in Paris after the First
   World War. Cross-examining the British, French, Kurdish, and Ottoman
   sources, this paper shows that despite the failure to establish a
   Kurdish state in the aftermath of the disintegration of the Ot-toman
   Empire the Kurdish elites, with their diplomatic and political
   experience and networking had equal, sometimes better, capacity to the
   leaders of other delegations in the Peace Conference. To demonstrate
   this, I fo-cus on Kurdish elites, who were experienced in the imperial
   statecraft, especially Serif Pasha, Sheikh Abdulkadir, Emin Ali
   Bedirhan, and Sureyya Bedirhan, lay out the complex relations amongst
   them and describe their efforts to represent the Kurds from the
   beginning of the Peace Conference until ratification of Treaty of Sevres
   on 10 August 1920. In spite of what the available literature suggests,
   Kurdish elites, using all the available tools at their disposal,
   negotiated effectively for a Kurdish state. The contribution shows that
   the Kurdish elites not only presented a series of arguments during the
   Peace Conference but also laid down the basis for the Kurdish
   na-tionalism of the decades to come, with a historical narrative and a
   cartographic imaginary.},

Abstract = {The worst contemporary refugee crisis that occurred during the summer of
   2015 challenged the basic values of the European Union. There had never
   been a time when the need for a consistent approach, both from the
   individual Member States and the EU as a whole, was more urgent. The
   Union's response during 2015's refugee crisis was unreliable,
   fragmented, and it largely affected the Western Balkan countries that
   are now aspiring to become EU Member States. This paper analyses how the
   EU's response to the refugee crisis has affected and still affects the
   countries in the Western Balkans, which are all in different stages of
   their European integration. The refugee crisis created many challenges
   for the Western Balkan countries which are all weak democracies and
   which have unstable institutions. This paper also analyses the numerous
   domestic costs connected to these countries when faced with the refugee
   crisis. Finally, the paper argues that, although largely harmonised with
   the EU acquis, the legislative and institutional frameworks for
   migration management in Western Balkan countries need further
   adjustment.},

Abstract = {How do disasters affect intergroup peace and conflict? Existing research
   shows that disasters can have opposing effects on how we perceive
   others: they can exacerbate existing tension in some cases or serve as
   catalysts for peace and cooperation in others. Yet we know little about
   the conditions under which we should expect one or the other. In this
   study, we estimate the impact of disasters on perceptions of out-groups.
   We combine a dataset of mass disasters with tens of thousands of
   individual-level survey responses recorded in Round 6 of the
   Afrobarometer data between 2014 and 2015. Using a
   difference-in-differences approach exploiting spatial and temporal
   proximity to disaster occurrences, we estimate the degree to which
   disasters affect public opinion toward out-groups. As disaster
   occurrence is plausibly exogenous to interview dates or respondent
   locations, our approach allows for an improved test of how the shock
   from disaster can impact public perceptions. Moreover, we show such
   impact varies by considering the differences in political salience of
   out-group identities and short- versus long-term differences in the
   impact on group dynamics. The implications of our findings for
   understanding the aftermath of past disasters and effects of future
   disasters on intergroup peace and conflict are discussed.},

Abstract = {Professors may start teaching either out of love or out of convenience,
   with limited resources. This article provides a brief manual for
   planning, designing and implementing PS\&IR courses. We discuss syllabi,
   from the basics to the inclusion of transversal topics, then present
   eight active learning strategies plus traditional lectures, and debate
   assessments. Although we consider the context of new teachers within
   Brazilian universities, we believe this is useful for professors from
   all countries and levels of experience. Thereby, we provide practical
   advice for teachers to live happily ever after in their pedagogical love
   story (even if it did not start that way).},

Title = {The Theory of Global Governance as an Analytical Approach and Its
   Conceptual Bridges with the Latin American Debate},
Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {171-195},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Objective/Context: The article aims to discuss the concept of global
   governance as an analytical approach to international relations, by
   analyzing the components, scope and criticism Michael Zurn ` s book A
   Theory of Global Governance: Authority, Legitimacy and Contestation,
   published in 2018. It proposes to discern the theoretical and conceptual
   innovations introduced in the book, and then to consider its criticism.
   On the one hand, the article analyzes the responses that the book
   received in the March 2021 issue of International Theory; on the other
   hand, it explores the conceptual bridges between this work and the
   debate on global governance in Latin America, finding correlations
   between them. Methodology: This study is based on a discussion of
   secondary sources, resulting from a review of academic bibliography.
   Conclusions: The work suggests that the approach developed by Zurn
   expands the possibilities of theorizing about the transformation
   processes that take place on the international scene, revaluing the
   global governance approach as an analytical tool. It introduces in the
   analysis aspects that remain unexplained by traditional approaches. At
   the same time, it does not ignore the role of power, politicization and
   ambiguities in the international order. It manages to identify
   conceptual bridges with the Latin-American theoretical discussions.
   Originality: The article synthesizes the discussions around a recent
   work that introduces innovations regarding the use of global governance
   as an analytical approach, and links them to the debates in Latin
   American academia on this concept, deriving into a renewed approach to
   both its criticism and its explanatory capabilities.},

Title = {Exposure to Violence as Explanatory Variable: Meaning, Measurement, and
   Theoretical Implications of Different Indicators},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},

Month = {DEC 29},
Abstract = {The study of intra-state violence has been a main focus of scholars
   since the end of the Cold War, and in recent years particular attention
   has been paid to the consequences of civil wars on future political,
   social, and economic development. Yet, understanding the consequences of
   political violence requires a clear working definition of what we mean
   when we say that someone was ``exposed to{''} or was ``a victim of{''}
   violence. Researchers use disparate measures ranging from living in a
   country that is categorized as a civil war case, despite living hundreds
   of miles away from areas of conflict, to being displaced and losing most
   of one's family members in attacks. In this essay, we offer conceptual
   clarification for various forms of victimization and indirect forms of
   exposure, present examples of works using these different measurement
   strategies, and examine how different measures affect findings using a
   sample of articles. We conclude with recommendations about indicators
   researchers can choose from and suggest that future research should
   probe further into the use of subjective measures of exposure.},

Abstract = {This article explores constructions of consensus and unity and their
   potential implications on partisan politics and democratic decision
   making in parliamentary discourse on the management of the COVID-19
   pandemic in Greece. The analytic corpus consists of transcripts of three
   debates on COVID-19 management in the Greek parliament, conducted in the
   period from April 2020 to October 2021. Analysis using tools and
   concepts of rhetorical and discursive psychology indicated that
   consensus was constructed as agreement on hard data, as compliance with
   health experts, and as national unity, and it was counterposed to
   partisan politics. Nevertheless, at the same time, appeals to consensus
   constituted a resource mobilized in the service of partisan politics, as
   both government and opposition parties appealed to the need of agreement
   in order to warrant their position and to ward off the position of

Abstract = {Do foreign firms engage in domestic politics, and if so, why? I argue
   that foreign firms, impacted by US policies, employ subsidiaries in the
   US to represent their political interests in federal elections. Using
   original data collected for the population of corporate givers during
   the 2014 and 2016 election cycles, I find US subsidiaries of foreign
   firms to be significantly more politically active than similarly sized
   American firms located in the same industry. These subsidiaries are much
   more likely to sponsor a Political Action Committee and donate in
   greater amounts. I explore a variety of explanations for this
   disproportionate political activity, and demonstrate that it is driven
   in part by the foreign parent firms' desire to gain a political foothold
   in the United States. Foreign direct investment therefore serves as an
   investment in political influence.},

Title = {Combined differentiation in European defense: tailoring Permanent
   Structured Cooperation (PESCO) to strategic and political complexity},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Sustaining meaningful defense cooperation in Europe is made difficult by
   defense-industrial fragmentation, a multiplicity of institutional
   frameworks, divergent strategic cultures and domestic opposition to
   integration. The European Union's recent foray into defense integration
   incorporates multiple forms of differentiation to overcome these
   barriers, with Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) characterized by
   selective membership, external participation, and project-based
   clustering. Such ``combined differentiation{''} offers an instructive
   example of how EU practices and principles can contribute to meaningful
   defense collaboration, even though Brussels is often thought a weak
   actor externally. It also illustrates how distinct forms of
   differentiation can be embodied within a single structure to accommodate
   complexity in strategic preferences. Using the example of PESCO, this
   article shows how ``combined differentiation{''} has emerged as a
   response to the nature of the European defense landscape and how debates
   between member states about how to respond to specific challenges have
   brought about further differentiation over time.},

Abstract = {Within a formal model of international agreements in the shadow of
   renegotiations and domestic competition, we highlight three important
   ways elections shape international agreements. Elections determine who
   will be in control of policy in the future, which affects how leaders
   bargain today. Elections also determine the deals policymakers will
   agree to. Finally, proposers have the opportunity to shape the contours
   of domestic political competition with what is offered in pre-electoral
   bargaining. We identify that several canonical results in the literature
   - like the Schelling conjecture or the idea that hawkish leaders have an
   innate bargaining advantage over dovish leaders - only hold under
   certain restrictions on how voters evaluate their leaders. In contrast,
   we show paradoxically that when voters are prospective, electoral
   incentives shade the ability for domestic leaders to negotiate better
   deals for their publics. Counterintuitively, this leads to hawks
   agreeing to more conciliatory agreements than doves.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the European Union's (EU) effort to establish
   an interoperable biometric border regime. Drawing on interview material
   and ethnographic observation, I explore how the technical concept of
   interoperability is performed and translated into a powerful policy for
   infrastructuring borders in Europe. This article suggests that
   policymaking has been dominated by enacting solutionist ways of seeing
   and speaking about borders and migration. The complex concept of
   interoperability is thereby proposed as a convenient set of solutions to
   renewed problem-constructions, including the EU's lack of authority in
   border policymaking, the complexity of the database landscape, and the
   uncertainty around capturing and fixing mobile identities.
   Interoperability has thus emerged as a necessary fiction in the border
   regime, directing visions, political discourse, and epistemic
   orientations toward a collectively imagined future of biometric border
   (in)security.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the Arab upheavals, Turkey pursued an overambitious
   regional leadership agenda that appeared incompatible with its
   underlying capabilities. In retrospect, there was sufficient evidence in
   the wake of the Arab upheavals that Turkey's power capacity did not
   match the assertive rhetoric used by Turkish ruling elites that the
   region should be remade in their image. However, Turkish foreign policy
   was not fine-tuned to the situation. On the contrary, Turkey increased
   the assertiveness of its tone. In the face of ample empirical evidence
   pointing to the unsustainability of Turkish leadership's ambitions in
   the region, why did an overhaul not take place in its Middle East
   policies? Drawing from multiple qualitative data sources, this study
   argues that at least two factors explain this paradox: (i)
   overconfidence that led to glaze-over effects and (ii) the
   civilisational perspective of the ruling elite, which underestimated
   conventional international relations parameters.},

Abstract = {The United States intends to manage China's rise by forging a new
   balancing coalition of `like-minded' partners and by developing deeper
   ties with other nations in the Indo-Pacific that view themselves as
   broadly non-aligned. Washington hopes that closer ties to the US and its
   partners will stop such countries from drifting towards China. But to
   create these deeper relationships, the non-aligned group also needs
   reassurance that attempts by the like-minded partners to integrate
   capabilities and fashion a new regional balance of power will not tip
   the Indo-Pacific towards conflict. Like-minded nations will need to
   appreciate the risks that security initiatives like the Quad and AUKUS
   are perceived to create, realise that Hanoi or Jakarta is unlikely to
   embrace Canberra's or Tokyo's vision of the region's future warmly, and
   be willing to make substantial material investments. Tension between
   integration and reassurance will inevitably endure.},

Title = {Ten Dimensions to Measure Municipal Management by Organization and
   Guaranteed Services: the Certification of Excellence of Concepcion,
   Chile},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2022},
Number = {84},
Pages = {177-212},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The research explains the process developed during 2020, between the
   University of Concepcion (Chile) and the local municipality, which
   culminated with a scrutiny of the management in ten key dimensions of
   the internal municipal organization -structure inform, tax collection,
   electronic government, maintenance policy, transparency, among others-.
   It also analyzes the specific impacts on the services provided by the
   municipality -such as social policy, green infrastructure, urban
   management, participation and cooperation- and on its partnerships with
   society and public and private entities. The piloting of the Municipal
   Certification of Excellence (MCE) required an interaction with data,
   national sources, but also the adjustment of the ten indicators per
   dimension in an autopoietic dialectic, where the interpretive scheme was
   corrected in interaction with the same organization, through the
   Municipal Administration team, comparing the reality of Concepcion with
   other regional capitals of Chile. It also considered tests, being its
   sources of intervention the tradition of management evaluation systems
   and agreements of compliance with standards of the OECD countries, the
   proposal of guaranteed municipal services to break the banal autonomism
   without responsibility carried out by the State Commission for
   Decentralization (2014) and the emblematic case of ``Bogota Como
   Vamos{''}. The process culminated with the requirement of an improvement
   plan for each indicator, generating an x-ray of the management with six
   dimensions rated as ``excellent{''} and four rated as ``good, with
   structural challenges{''}. In this way, a process with open data on the
   qualification of municipal management was achieved in Chile, breaking a
   key resistance of the associations of municipalities for systems of
   greater monitoring of local management in Chile, accustomed to being
   accountable for projects in a generic way without dialogue with their
   planning instruments in real impacts. Such learning allows enriching the
   dominant approaches of quality management, focused on organizational
   processes and macro evaluations that look at territorial indicators that
   depend on socio-economic contexts and national policies, placing the
   emphasis on institutional dimensions that improve management with
   measurable results of local services that should be guaranteed to
   citizens.},

Abstract = {This paper expands the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) by employing an
   exploratory case study approach to examine the construction of
   narratives temporally. A large-N Twitter dataset concerning the Bears
   Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante monuments controversy is utilized to
   examine the question: how does the use of narrative strategies change
   over time? Through the application of change-point analysis, we
   determine time points of significant shifts towards use of the
   devil-angel shift, scope of the conflict, and causal mechanism
   strategies. Overall, we find that organizations do not vary their use of
   narrative strategies over the course of a policy conflict but instead
   demonstrate discrete changes in response to certain policy events. Based
   on our findings, we conclude with suggestions for refining and expanding
   NPF hypotheses. Specifically, we recommend a more contextual analysis of
   shifts in narrative strategy use in response to specific events over
   time.},

Abstract = {This article aims to assess how national and subnational parliaments
   have engaged with recent trade negotiations, by examining how they have
   been responding to the conclusion of the Association Agreement with the
   Southern Common Market (Mercosur), agreed in principle in June 2019. It
   argues that - even though the executives from both sides have reached an
   initial agreement - national and some subnational parliamentary actors
   have been playing a key role in the revision and implementation of this
   comprehensive inter-regional agreement, succeeding in stalling the
   accord even before its signature and the beginning of the ratification
   process. Besides, the article unveils major differences between the
   involvement of EU and Mercosur's national and subnational parliaments
   concerning the agreement: while a high level of parliamentary
   mobilisation was observed in the EU, so far parliamentary involvement
   has been quite low in the Mercosur side.},

Abstract = {The impact of Europeanisation on domestic policies is often associated
   with the alignment of European policies and discourses with national
   ones. The Habitats Directive mandating wolf protection entailed heated
   debates across the EU, suggesting diverging values and interests at
   various levels of policy-making. I present an analysis of wolf policy
   and politics in Germany, where wolves have returned after a long period
   of extinction. Tracing the dynamics of institutions involved in wolf
   management in 2000-2021, I identify key groups involved, their
   activities and positions as well as the impact of European rules and
   discourses. Unlike in some other Central in Eastern European countries,
   German wolf policy was strongly influenced by Europeanisation that
   helped to sustain the institutional path of wolf conservation, despite
   criticism from dominant land-use actors who politicised the issue to
   relax conservation rules. I suggest adding safeguarding of latent
   policies to the catalogue of outcomes of Europeanisation.},

Abstract = {Islamist and extreme right-wing (XRW) terrorism represent about equal
   levels of risk in terms of casualties in the U.S. over the past decade,
   yet Islamist terrorists receive far more news coverage, have more
   serious charges filed against them, are considered more deserving of
   torture and detainment, and receive harsher prison sentences than XRW
   terrorists. That Islamist and XRW terrorism elicit such different
   responses raises the question: Do Americans perceive the risk of
   Islamist and XRW terrorism differently? To investigate, we measured risk
   perceptions for Islamist and XRW terrorism in a nationally
   representative sample of 405 U.S. residents. How Americans perceived the
   risk of terrorism was strongly associated with their political
   preferences, such that conservatives perceived Islamist terrorism as the
   greater risk and liberals perceived XRW terrorism as the greater risk.
   The political orientation of the news media participants consumed was
   also significantly related to which type of terrorism they perceived to
   be a greater risk, in the same pattern. Our results indicate that
   perceived risk for these types of terrorism tends to be polarized along
   political fault lines, with implications for risk communication
   regarding terrorism.},

Abstract = {Housing wealth is the single largest portion of household wealth in most
   Western societies today, yet little research has examined how
   individuals make decisions regarding the use of the housing wealth that
   they possess. In this article, we leverage insights from relational
   economic sociology to understand how individuals' subjective valuations
   and other economic judgments are influenced when space in a home is
   relationally earmarked. Using a series of original vignette experiments
   and survey tasks in conjunction with qualitative responses, we find that
   earmarking a room for a close social tie does indeed matter for
   valuation. Furthermore, we reveal that individual economic judgments are
   strongly influenced by different relational content associated with
   relational earmarks compared to a control. Put differently, we
   systematically show how modifying the constitution of an earmark
   strengthens or lessens the appropriateness of its match and prompts
   distinct patterns of economic decision-making. Our analyses extend
   relational economic sociology to studies of housing while also building
   intellectual bridges with research on judgment and decision-making
   (JDM).},

   ethnic outgroup members. As a result, increasing ethnic diversity is
   often found to impede solidarity. Although this perspective is well
   established, I present an alternative argument: Under circumstances that
   foster intergroup contact, increasing diversity promotes, rather than
   impedes, intergroup solidarity. To test this argument, I combine a
   survey experiment fielded among Danish students with quasi-random
   observational data on students' classroom ethnic composition. I find
   that ethnic-majority adolescents are on average more willing to support
   ethnic-majority recipients than immigrant and ethnic-minority
   recipients. Yet, although increasing diversity does not moderate the
   majority-minority solidarity gap, increasing diversity diminishes and
   erases the majority-immigrant solidarity gap. As further shown, one
   explanation is that immigrants in particular face strong stereotypes of
   being lazy and that ethnic diversity reduces this specific stereotype.
   These findings suggest that immigration and solidarity need not be
   incompatible. Under certain circumstances, ethnic diversity at worst
   leaves intergroup solidarity unaltered and at best improves such
   solidarity.},

Abstract = {Although international organisations (IOs) are created by governments,
   their international public administrations (IPAs) have succeeded in
   ring-fencing their resources, and policymaking from direct intervention
   by member states. Research shows that international civil servants are
   best able to protect their autonomy when embedded in large and
   well-resourced IPAs. Staff in large IOs use their huge size,
   bureaucratic complexities, and different behavioural logics to protect
   their autonomy and thereby leave a `bureaucratic footprint' in
   international affairs. Whereas the behavioural logics of large IPAs,
   mostly headquartered in the Global North, are reasonably
   well-documented, not much has been written on behavioural logics of
   international civil servants embedded in small secretariats. We seek to
   address the gap using the African Union Commission (AUC) staff. Drawing
   insights from organisational theory and mixed research methods,
   including the first ever comprehensive survey of AUC staff, the study
   finds that the AUC staff primarily evoke a departmental behavioural
   logic. In the absence of departmental logics, the preference of AUC
   staff is to take on supranational, transnational, and lastly
   intergovernmental persona. The reluctance of AUC staff to evoke
   intergovernmental logic is surprising given that the AUC is embedded in
   an intergovernmental governance architecture.},

Abstract = {This article draws on Heidegger's notion of Stimmung (mood, attunement,
   atmosphere) to further develop the study of public moods in IR. To that
   end, it synthesises two recent developments in ontological security
   studies (OSS), the decentred Deleuzian approach that emphasises the role
   of affective environments in subjects' sense of and search for
   ontological security and Heideggerian readings of anxiety as (public)
   mood. The developed framework maintains OSS' conceptual focus on anxiety
   whilst centring the locus of analysis around dynamic affective
   environments rather than individual subjects. This framework allows for
   exploring the relationship between anxiety and the radical agency,
   emerging political subjectivities, and intense (positive) moods it can
   facilitate. The empirical added value of this framework is illustrated
   through an analysis of the public mood of anxiety that preceded and
   enabled the ``border opening{''} in Germany during the so-called
   migration crisis and the subsequent euphoria it engendered.},

Abstract = {The possibility that economic competition puts working and employment
   conditions under pressure is a frequently voiced concern in debates on
   international trade. We provide an empirical assessment of the argument
   that competition for world markets has generated a race to the bottom in
   labor standards. Spatial econometrics is used to identify
   interdependence in labor practices among trade competitors. We present a
   strategy for measuring export competition between countries that
   fulfills several criteria: It reflects actual competition between firms
   offering similar products, rather than export similarity in relation to
   a few very broad product categories; it captures not only what
   competitor countries export but also how much; it takes into account
   that states are exposed to export competition to different degrees; and
   it focuses on the downward pressure stemming from a deterioration of
   labor rights protections among close competitors. To address
   endogeneity, we implement a two-stage least-squares (2SLS) instrumental
   variable approach and a difference two-stage generalized method of
   moments (GMM) approach. We find no evidence that export competition has
   triggered a race to the bottom in two samples covering most states in
   the world over nearly three decades. The finding is robust to a variety
   of alternative specifications.},

Abstract = {Academics, decision-makers and policy makers have suggested that COVID
   and the war in Ukraine represent an `inflection point'. The consequence
   will be `the end of globalisation', `a bipolar Cold War 2.0' and a
   return to Containment. In reality, the emerging world order is much
   messier. The logics of geoeconomics and geopolitics, largely aligned
   during the Cold War, are now in tension, ruptured by decades of
   globalisation, America's decline, and China's ascent. Consequently, US
   security allies now often wrestle with the fact that their economic ties
   link them to US rivals, notably China, or adversaries, like Russia. The
   pandemic and war have wrought geopolitical and economic adjustments, but
   any resemblance to Cold War blocs is superficial. What is consolidating
   is an era best described as fuzzy bifurcation. Unlike the Cold War,
   alliances will be tenuous across policy domains. With this greater
   latitude, even small and medium-sized states may band-wagon on security
   but will balance, hedge and even pursue strategic autonomy in others.
   Terms like `allies', `competitors', `rivals', and even `adversaries'
   become contingent on the policy issue. It is a world that American and
   Chinese policy makers will find challenging, indeed frustrating, because
   of the inconstancy of allied behaviour.},

Title = {The COVID-crisis as an opportunity for welfare recalibration? Panel-data

Abstract = {The reform capacity of welfare states to adapt to the needs of
   post-industrial labour markets has been a key question of the welfare
   literature for the last two decades. In a context of austerity, such
   adaptations (retrenchment or recalibration) are notoriously difficult
   because of extremely high levels of support for existing policies,
   particularly old age pensions. We investigate how the recent economic
   shock caused by the COVID-pandemic has changed social policy preferences
   in three West European countries (Germany, Sweden, Spain). Relying on
   original panel data observing the relative support for social policies
   before and during the crisis, we show that support for old age pensions
   has dropped substantially relative to other social policies. This drop
   can be observed in all three countries and among all ideological and age
   groups. The drop is strongest among current and soon-to-be pensioners
   who in turn increased support for benefits to the working-age
   population. At the expense of pensions, the economic shock has
   especially boosted support for active labour market policies and (in
   Germany) childcare services. This shift of support from pensions to
   social investment policies might have opened up a window of opportunity
   for recalibrating welfare reforms.},

Abstract = {This essay is an exploration of how playing with identity through
   cosplay opens the door to new understandings of ourselves. It is written
   and painted to feel a little like cosplay's twisting corridors of self
   and other, and closely follows my own experiences. Through glimpses of
   putting on the masks of different characters in different situations, it
   shows how the release of cosplay renews one's own reality. This
   intervention shows that while cosplay can be understood as a form of
   playful resistance to normative subjection, it is also itself an
   activity subject to the exclusionary politics of those who write the
   characters, and who are thus able to affect the stakes of the game.},

   (non-)displacement of civilians in the former FATA, Pakistan},

Abstract = {It is common during a civil war that a government's counterinsurgency
   operations result in internally displaced persons seeking refuge from
   the violence by leaving their communities. However, many civilians
   alternatively choose to stay in their homes and seek accommodation from
   the rebels. It is, therefore, puzzling that in a civil war situation
   when rebel cadres often cannot protect civilians, civilians would remain
   in their communities. This article argues that the wartime provision of
   public services motivates civilians to stay with the rebel group because
   it demonstrates the group's capability for and commitment to developing
   civilians' welfare and livelihoods. This argument offers insight into an
   unanswered question in the literature regarding internal displacement in
   a civil war: Why do some civilians, when facing protection issues in
   rebel-held areas, choose to stay, while others opt to leave? Using novel
   survey data collected over two phases from the former Federally
   Administered Tribal Area (FATA) in Pakistan, a two-step Bayesian
   propensity score analysis reveals that the civilians who received rebel
   services are less likely to leave their places of residence. Civilians
   would pursue long-term goals during the crossfire between the government
   and rebel forces; wartime provisions of public services allow civilians
   to seriously consider the possibility of improving their lives.},

Abstract = {Human rights in global value chains have become a key field of study in
   international law and corporate governance. The analysis often starts
   with a gap - a `governance gap' in human rights protection. This
   pragmatic starting point calls for pragmatic solutions: better corporate
   compliance and more accountability. While this goes a long way in
   addressing corporate misconduct, the global corporate form, its power
   and legitimation in transnationally generating and appropriating value
   tend to become naturalized phenomena. Moreover, the effects of
   accountability agendas on corporate power and legitimation are hardly
   considered. Instead, I propose to address the `human rights problem' by
   understanding the corporation and its networks as consequences of
   international politics - conceptualized as inter-societal multiplicity.
   The multiplicity lens offers a possibility to replace the governance gap
   with a productive conception of inter-societal conditions and can
   complement the focus on accountability and compliance. I conclude the
   article by tentatively sketching three important consequences of such a
   starting point for defining the problem of human rights in global value
   chains: the international dimensions of the division of labour under
   competitive conditions, the legitimation of corporate practices and the
   production of knowledge for their regulation.},

Abstract = {Theorizing on cyber conflict has moved from warfare to conflict short of
   war, but strategic thought has not kept pace. This article argues cyber
   conflict is subversive, builds on intelligence scholarship to identify
   strategies of subversion, and examines their applicability in cyber
   conflict. It distinguishes three subversive strategies: manipulation,
   erosion and overthrow. The analysis shows cyber operations can only
   implement one of these strategies (erosion), indicating they offer less
   strategic value than traditional counterparts. Accordingly, although
   cyber operations offer superior scale, I argue their scope of influence
   is more limited. Finally, the article discusses strategic implications
   and identifies possible counterstrategies.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the impact of new media on local politics and
   politicians in a highly digitalised and advanced democracy. Through case
   studies and interviews of elite representatives in three Norwegian
   municipalities, the paper's ambition is to gain further understanding of
   the use of new media at the local political level and how new media
   influence and shape the role of local political representatives. To this
   aim we engage with established literature on new media use in campaigns
   and as self-promotion, as well as literature on new media and democracy.
   The main findings are that the use of new media, particularly Facebook,
   is widespread, hardening the political debate, and especially straining
   for younger women. Moreover, new media contribute to the
   ``professionalizing{''} of political communication as they require more
   strategic thinking around messaging and engagement. While they have in
   some ways contributed to bringing local representatives closer to the
   citizens and provided valuable information, they have also produced
   ``echo-chamber{''} effects. In sum, new media provide challenges and
   opportunities that may impact one's willingness to stand as a
   representative and contribute to creating new ``types{''} of local
   politicians.},

Abstract = {Climate litigation has become a strategic tool to push for climate
   justice, including compensation for losses caused by climate change.
   Many cases rely on the establishment of a causal relationship between
   the defendants' emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) and the plaintiffs'
   losses. All decided cases seeking compensation for a concrete climate
   related impact have been unsuccessful (thus far). Legal scholars as well
   as social and natural scientists have looked at individual cases and
   evidence of these unsuccessful claims, aiming to identify legal and
   scientific hurdles. Based on previous research where we analysed
   specific cases, we step back from a case-specific analysis in this
   article and identify the social context in which law and science operate
   and intersect. We assert that without a general understanding of the
   urgency of climate change and the scientifically proven fact that
   climate change impacts the present, and that it is possible to attribute
   individual losses to human-caused climate change, the fate and future of
   climate litigation focusing on losses and damages will continue to
   encounter major obstacles in courts. This is despite the increasingly
   sophisticated strategies of litigants; the positive outcome of some
   strategic litigation and improvements in the field of climate science,
   all of which would be expected to sway for a successful future of the
   fight against climate change.},

Abstract = {Despite a pivot toward great power rivalry as a dominant security focus,
   violent extremists of varying ideological types continue to present a
   dynamic threat landscape. This study aims to further understandings of
   psychological processes and language indicating support for extremism
   across ideologies. Theories emanating from social psychology, and the
   notion of ``threat-framing{''} as a means of necessitating violence by
   representing out-groups as existential threats were applied to a
   linguistic analysis of twelve texts authored by extremists of differing
   ideologies. Threat-framing was detected in all texts. Moreover,
   threat-framed out-groups were targets of violence, particularly when
   identified specifically. Practical implications are outlined.},

Title = {Cultural Expertise versus Strategic Ignorance: Confronting Cultural
   Diversity In and Out of Court in Poland},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {413-434},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Based on a systematic analysis of three databases of court decisions and
   a comprehensive overview of out-of-court use of cultural expertise in
   dispute resolution across various institutional contexts, this article
   investigates how Polish authorities tackle emerging issues of cultural
   diversity. Although Poland remains one of the European Union's (EU) most
   ethnically and culturally homogeneous countries, increased immigration
   and internal pluralism bring new challenges for the courts and other
   public institutions involved in dispute resolution. Increasingly,
   generic references and commonsense understandings are replaced by more
   precise indications of sources, uses of academic sources or reports by
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and appointment of relevant
   experts. On the other hand, judges still tend to attempt their own
   interpretations and usually reject motions to instruct social scientists
   as expert witnesses, choosing the approach once aptly described as
   ``strategic ignorance.{''}(2) Thus, in this article, I look at how
   Polish courts justify instruction (or rejection of motions to instruct)
   social scientists as expert witnesses and where they draw the line
   between common sense and expert interpretations of culture. I also
   survey the rising demand for cultural expertise in dispute settlement in
   immigration services, detention centers, the military, and education.},

Abstract = {Communication professionals are increasingly found within government
   ministries. Based on classic work on bureaucracy and recent literature
   on mediatization and personalization, this article develops two ideal
   types: the government information provider and government spin doctor.
   These ideals are constituted by six dimensions: recruitment criteria,
   values, loyalties, reputational concerns, interactions, and tasks. A
   study of nonpartisan communication professionals in Norwegian ministries
   is used to illustrate the empirical relevance of the ideal types. The
   analysis shows that for loyalties and reputational concerns, Norwegian
   communication professionals resemble the government information
   provider. Regarding interactions and tasks, they resemble the government
   spin doctor. For recruitment criteria and values, the picture is mixed.
   The empirical application thereby illustrates a fruitful aspect of the
   framework as certain configurations will bring forth inbuilt tension in
   communication professionals' role. The framework allows a fine-grained
   approach to extend ongoing debates of appropriate and inappropriate
   practices of communication professionals in ministries.},

Abstract = {Some Marxist political economists use accumulation by dispossession to
   explain processes in which natural resources are enclosed and their
   users dispossessed through extra-economic means. However, accumulation
   by dispossession takes an overly omnibus and materialistic approach in
   trying to cover a wide range of global processes. This article therefore
   distils accumulation by dispossession's three central features of
   coercion, non-voluntary consent and corruption to enhance its local
   explanatory power of material and incorporeal dispossession in
   post-apartheid South Africa. This approach magnifies how a triumvirate
   of traditional leaders, state officials and Ivanplats platinum mine
   dispossessed people living on customary land in Limpopo, with
   detrimental effects.},

Abstract = {This article reports on trends in organized violence, building on new
   data by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP). The falling trend in
   fatalities stemming from organized violence in the world, observed
   between 2014 and 2019, was decisively reversed in 2021 as fatalities
   increased significantly. UCDP registered more than 119,100 deaths in
   organized violence in 2021, a 46\% increase from the previous year. The
   increase was largely driven by escalating conflicts in Afghanistan,
   Ethiopia, and Yemen. Fatalities increased in all three categories of
   organized violence, despite a decrease in the number of active
   state-based conflicts, as well as the number of actors carrying out
   one-sided violence against civilians. UCDP recorded 54 state-based
   conflicts in 2021, a decrease by two compared to the previous year. Five
   of the conflicts were active at the intensity of war, the lowest number
   of wars since 2010. Violence in 2021 was thus concentrated to fewer but
   bloodier conflicts. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as
   drones, have become increasingly important features of modern conflicts,
   and the trend in their usage is discussed in the special feature
   section. UAV usage has since 2019 dispersed among a significant larger
   number of actors, even as the downscaling in the involvement of the
   United States in the war on terror has led to a decrease in
   drone-related fatalities.},

Abstract = {Jose Carlos Mariategui's ``heroic creation{''} of Indo-American
   socialism had both political and epistemic dimensions and involved a
   rethinking of the revolutionary subject-the proletariat-in Latin
   America. This proletariat was, from Mariategui's perspective, an
   articulated subject centered on the indigenous. Consideration of
   Mariategui's work from a perspective that subverts the view of the
   historical/structural heterogeneity of Latin America and seeks a bridge
   among the region's revolutionary currents in popular praxis may
   contribute to deepening the study of its potential for enriching the
   political and epistemological alternatives to the neoliberal project. La
   ``creacion heroica{''} del socialismo indoamericano de Jose Carlos
   Mariategui tuvo dimensiones tanto politicas como epistemicas e implico
   un replanteamiento del sujeto revolucionario-el proletariado-en America
   Latina. Este proletariado era, desde la perspectiva de Mariategui, un
   sujeto articulado centrado en lo indigena. La consideracion de la obra
   de Mariategui desde una perspectiva que subvierta la vision de la
   heterogeneidad historico-estructural de America Latina y busque un
   puente entre las corrientes revolucionarias de la region en la praxis
   popular puede contribuir a profundizar el estudio de su potencial de
   enriquecer las alternativas politicas y epistemologicas al proyecto

Title = {More Left or Left No More? An In-depth Analysis of Western European
   Social Democratic Parties' Emphasis on Traditional Economic Left Goals
   (1944-2021)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {The ideological evolution of Western European social democratic parties
   has received considerable scholarly attention over the decades. The most
   widespread view concerns the alleged programmatic moderation and
   convergence with the mainstream right of this party family. However,
   recent empirical investigations based on electoral manifestos come to
   different conclusions, highlighting an increase over time in Western
   European social democratic parties' emphasis on traditional economic
   left goals, especially in recent years. Hence, this article analyses the
   evolution of the social democratic programmatic outlook with regard to
   traditional economic left issues. It does so by relying on Manifesto
   Project (MARPOR) data about such formations in 369 general elections
   across 20 Western European countries between 1944 and 2021, employing
   different indicators of economic left emphasis and time to ensure the
   robustness of the findings. The analysis shows how, at the aggregate
   level, social democracy increases its emphasis on traditional economic
   left issues over time, with the effect driven entirely by the recent
   post-Great Recession years. However, once disaggregating the results, a
   more differentiated picture emerges, pointing towards potential causes
   of concern in terms of measurement validity within the MARPOR data. The
   article discusses the substantive and, especially, methodological
   implications of its findings in detail.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of human rights discourse in reframing
   the changing diplomatic relationship of the United Kingdom and Uganda
   during Idi Amin's dictatorship of 1971-1979. The emergence of a violent
   military dictatorship in Uganda in the early 1970s posed difficult
   questions for Britain, which had played a central role in the creation
   of the Ugandan nation-state in the colonial era and maintained many
   connections to it. In the first years of Amin's rule the UK had adopted
   a pragmatic stance, in which human rights concerns were not considered,
   and geopolitical and economic concerns came first. However, in the mid
   1970s the emergence of an energetic transnational `community of
   conscience' contributed to a reframing of the UK's stance on Uganda in
   explicit human rights terminology. This was a limited and sometimes
   contradictory shift that also served to obscure embarrassing aspects of
   the UK-Uganda relationship.},

Abstract = {In this article, we develop a theoretical framework for investigating
   how organizational culture relates to the roles of elected
   representatives. Based on Douglas's grid and group logic, our framework
   evaluates two cultural dimensions, negotiability and conflictuality,
   upon which these roles depend. The negotiability dimension describes
   elected representatives' roles from a strictly hierarchical and bounded
   notion of how politics should be handled to a horizontal and inclusive
   notion. The conflictuality dimension considers politics as confrontation
   versus a deliberative consensus-oriented way of handling political
   issues. By investigating a participatory governance measure called
   ``task committees{''}, we examine how the framework functions
   empirically. Our analysis shows how different aspects of organizational
   culture are reflected in councilors' interpretations of and practices
   related to this interactive participatory governance scheme and
   illuminates the implications of organizational culture for the use of
   such schemes.},

Abstract = {Proponents of an associative account of political obligation maintain
   that individuals bear certain moral duties simply in virtue of their
   membership in a particular political community. I defend this thesis by
   interpreting it as a metaethical claim that expresses or implicitly
   relies on a pragmatist account of the nature of normativity,
   justification, and knowledge. Such a defense has a number of virtues.
   First, it offers a compelling rationale for the strategy commonly
   employed to defend the associative thesis. Second, a pragmatist reading
   provides the resources necessary to rebut a number of objections
   advanced against the associative thesis, such as the criticism that
   associative theorists cannot distinguish actually having political
   obligations from merely believing or feeling that one has political
   obligations. Third, a pragmatist metaethics entails a particular model
   of practical reasoning, namely constructive interpretation, that
   helpfully illuminates our actual practice of attributing or contesting
   political obligations.},

Abstract = {How do drones affect escalation dynamics? The emerging consensus from
   scholarship on drones highlights increased conflict initiation when
   drones allow decisionmakers to avoid the risks of deploying inhabited
   platforms, but far less attention has been paid to understanding how
   drones affect conflict escalation. Limited theorization and empirical
   testing have left debates unresolved. I unpack the underlying mechanisms
   influencing escalation decisions involving drones by proposing a logic
   of remote-controlled restraint: drones limit escalation in ways not
   possible when inhabited assets are used. To test this logic and explore
   its instrumental and emotional microfoundations, I field ``comparative
   wargames.{''} I immerse national security professionals in crisis
   scenarios that vary whether a drone or inhabited aircraft is shot down.
   I validate wargame findings using a survey experiment. The wargames shed
   light on the microfoundations of escalation, highlight limits of
   existing theories, and demonstrate the utility of comparative wargaming
   as an IR research tool.},

Abstract = {City branding as produced by local governments has been widely
   recognized as a modern version of government communication. Local
   governments convey attractive features of their identity to current and
   potential stakeholders in their cities. In this contribution, we examine
   how municipal governments have used urban design as a form of city
   branding reflecting the identity of the historical (sub)region in which
   they are located. We do this in a French border region where features of
   medieval, Burgundian and Spanish Netherlandish traditions can still
   clearly be distinguished in public buildings: Nord-Pas-de-Calais, and
   more specifically its five subregions Maritime Flanders, Roman Flanders,
   Hainaut, Artesia and Cambrai. We systematically map historical and
   cultural symbols found on leading public urban architecture and indicate
   to which era of origin and identity feature they refer. We do this for a
   selection of 17 municipalities of over 20,000 inhabitants. We find that
   symbols to pre-French traditions are still very conspicuous (Flemish
   architecture, typical beer bars, selective use of ancient Dutch
   language), but also that as new political powers establish themselves in
   a region these symbols are redefined such that such regional identities
   are in line with new `national requirements' and become `innocuous'.
   Classicist building styles, French military works and war memorials and
   modernist architecture embed and blend with these ancient traditions and
   make regional identities multi-layered. Either way, `thin' instrumental
   and identities pushed by governments grow `thick' and deeply felt over
   the centuries.},

Abstract = {A conceptual study of Hitler's development of the National Socialist
   democracy concept between 1919 and 1933 is presented. Despite the
   voluminous literature on Hitler and Nazism, our knowledge of the NS
   democracy concept is seriously incomplete. This article makes a
   substantial historiographical contribution by providing a more profound
   understanding of Hitler's NS democracy concept and his position in the
   broader Weimar debate on democracy. I argue that Hitler prioritized
   democracy as a core concept in NS ideology. Between 1920 and 1925,
   Hitler employed a Germanic democracy concept centred on a popularly
   elected Fuhrer modelled in the reversed mirror image of his Jewish
   democracy concept. The allegedly Jewish interpretation of democracy was,
   according to Hitler's conspiracy theory, a precursor for the Jews to
   achieve a global dictatorship. Between 1925 and 1933 Hitler resettled
   for an anti-plebiscitary Volksherrschaft concept, abandoning his
   Germanic democracy, the election of the Fuhrer, and elections per se.
   This new concept rested on a notion of a Volkswille, which purportedly
   accommodated a genuine will of the people that could not be expressed in
   plebiscites and was identical with Hitler's worldview. I contend that
   Hitler's changeover from Germanic democracy to Volksherrschaft
   contributed to a totalitarian turn in NS ideology.},

Abstract = {Increasing levels of extreme weather patterns and environmental
   deterioration pose pertinent threats to the availability of essential
   resources, such as food and water. Past research has found a positive
   association between climate change and the likelihood of internal
   conflicts, especially in developing countries. We argue that
   intensifying climate events can lead to an increase in the spread and
   intensity of both left and right-wing ideologically motivated violence
   in developed countries as well, specifically the United States. We also
   focus on how regional environmental characteristics might be correlated
   to the geographical distribution of domestic political violence. Our
   findings suggest that while both far-right and environmental violence
   are more prevalent during warmer seasons and extreme warming weather
   events, such as heat waves, political and demographic factors also need
   to be considered. We also found a strong linkage between man-made
   ecological damage, as opposed to natural disasters, and the prevalence
   of eco-violence incidents, especially in states that have a

Abstract = {The intensity and nature of ties between the Church and political
   parties was covered by a rich literature. However, we know relatively
   little about why the Church would support a newly emerged political
   party formed in a competitive space, in which other parties had in the
   past enjoyed the Church's support. This article aims to explain why many
   members of the Romanian Orthodox Church campaigned for the Alliance for
   the Union of Romanians (AUR) in the 2020 legislative elections. Our
   analysis relies on 18 semi-structured interviews conducted with Orthodox
   priests from different parts of the country. The findings illustrate
   that the traditionalist priests supported the party. These priests felt
   cornered by the existing anti-clerical attitudes in Romanian society,
   declared themselves disappointed by the mainstream parties for
   abandoning the Church, and perceived the EU as a threat to the
   traditional Romanian values and way of life.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on South Korea as a case, analyzes a collection of
   87,487 tweets referencing both COVID-19 and South Korea during the
   period of the pandemic, and examines global users' understandings and/or
   assessments of South Korean responses to the health crisis. This article
   uses Pseudo-document-based Topic Model (PTM) as an advanced machine
   learning technique for classifying short texts into viable topics or
   themes. In the PTM results, human rights-related topics received much
   less attention than other topics on government responses, health
   measures, vaccines, and economic issues. Furthermore, discussions on
   surveillance, restrictions on assembly, and stigmatization of religious
   groups tended to emerge rather briefly and soon subsided. Rights
   protection in the South Korean context appeared at odds with the larger
   target of protecting public health and the safety of society. The
   analyses demonstrate a tradeoff between implementing public health
   imperatives and respecting human rights in South Korea.},

Abstract = {This article highlights the multiple risks of political violence facing
   South Asia amid the backdrop of climate change. Specifically, it draws
   attention to Bangladesh and its shared border with Northeast India, a
   region with a long history of terrorism and insurgency. As the impact
   from climate change intensifies, there are several specific
   vulnerabilities in the region. First, internal migration within
   Bangladesh threatens to stress already weak infrastructures, especially
   in urban centers like Dhaka, which already hosts thousands of climate
   migrants. Internal rural-to-rural migration may further instigate
   clashes among farmers as they compete for diminishing agricultural
   resources. Second, cross-border migration from Bangladesh into India
   threatens to escalate existing tensions between Indians and Bangladeshi
   migrants, particularly in Northeast India. Violent identity movements
   within Northeast India are already common and a key grievance has been
   Bangladeshi presence in the region. These grievances have historically
   escalated into multiple separatist and terrorist organizations and
   threaten to escalate again. Hindu nationalist groups threaten to further
   exploit these existing tensions for political gain. Third, Rohingya
   refugee camps in Bangladesh are situated in a location that is at very
   high-risk for climate disasters. Cyclones and flooding threaten to
   create a new humanitarian crisis in the region. Finally, both Hindu and
   Islamic extremist groups may exploit grievances and utilize it for
   recruitment efforts. Together, these factors make South Asia
   particularly vulnerable to climate impacts. Using GIS, we map the
   climate vulnerable areas of Bangladesh alongside locations that have
   experienced fatal political violence from 2015-2020. We find that each
   administrative division faces its own unique challenges, but urban
   centers, areas near water, and border regions are the most vulnerable to
   climate conflict.},

Abstract = {Floods, earthquakes, droughts, and other recurrent disasters around the
   globe have sparked renewed interest in whether and how disasters can be
   leveraged as turning points for transformation toward more sustainable
   and resilient societies. As the transformative potential of disasters
   increasingly gains prominence in different research fields, it is
   important to describe how different scientific approaches view the
   relationship. This article synthesises key insights from the policy
   sciences and public administration scholarship regarding the link
   between disruptive disaster events and policy activity aiming towards
   societal transformation. Key explanatory perspectives are discussed,
   including dynamics associated with institutional crisis, policy
   subsystems, agenda-setting and issue salience, governance capacity,
   policy-oriented learning and concentration of power, and situated in
   relation to four scenarios of potential disaster impacts on policymaking
   aiming at transformation. The results of this synthesis seek to enhance
   our understanding of when disasters may spark transformative change.
   Based on these findings, the article identifies priorities for future
   research into policymaking in the wake of disaster.},

Abstract = {Examinations of substate security and everyday peace in hybrid political
   orders are mostly limited to single-case studies or statistical
   analyses. Seldom are qualitative methods applied with a comparative aim
   that can unveil patterns of security production. I attempt such an
   approach by studying 12 cases across the Central African Republic,
   Haiti, Somaliland, and South Sudan. I investigate (1) where hybrid
   interactions take place, (2) how they happen and (3) what this means for
   people's security. I argue, first, that hybrid ordering shapes
   socio-geography by separating a rigorously controlled inner from a
   securitised outer circle. Second, I find that actors clash over the use
   of contrasting ordering principles on a spectrum from stable to fluid.
   Third, measured security indices, paradoxically, often diverge from how
   safe people feel depending on public support for the socio-geographical
   shape and ordering principles applied. These cross-case patterns of
   hybrid political orders underscore the importance of comparing political
   ordering processes.},

Title = {The EU's performance in rural Georgia: the common agricultural policy's
   relevance, effectiveness, and impact},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 10},
Abstract = {How the EU interacts with its Eastern neighbours has been researched
   extensively. How it has performed in this region however has been
   systemically researched on far fewer occasions. This gap is even more
   glaring when straying away from policy areas such as trade, rule of law,
   or democratisation. More than 10 years after the Eastern Partnership's
   inauguration, this paper therefore investigates the performance of the
   EU's Common Agricultural Policy, with a specific focus on its endogenous
   rural development programme LEADER in Georgia. It finds a mixed picture
   for the performance attributes relevance, effectiveness, and impact,
   with differences in performance found between policy instruments and

Abstract = {Digital media give the public a voice to discuss or share their thoughts
   about political and social events. However, these discussions can often
   include language that contributes to creating toxic or uncivil online
   environments. Using data from Reddit, we examine the language
   surrounding three major events in the United States that occurred in
   2020 and early 2021 from the comments and posts of 65 communities
   identified for their focus on extreme content. Our results suggest that
   social and political events in the U.S. triggered increased hostility in
   discussions as well as the formation of a set of shared language for
   describing and articulating information about these major
   political/social moments. Findings further reveal shifts in language
   toward more negativity, incivility, and specific language surrounding
   non-White outgroups. Finally, these shifts in language online were found
   to be durable and last after the events occurred. Our project identifies
   that negative language is frequently present on social media and is not
   necessarily exclusive to one group, topic, or real-world event. We
   discuss the implications of language as a powerful tool to engage,
   recruit, and radicalize those within communities online.},

   I argue that banking crises have facilitated the rise of progressive tax
   instruments by causing revenue needs and demands for fiscal fairness. I
   test this argument by means of event history analyses and new worldwide
   data on the introduction of the two main pillars of the modern tax
   state: the personal income tax (PIT) and the general sales tax (GST).
   Furthermore, I examine the adoption of PIT in the USA and Argentina. The
   findings stress the importance of financial and economic crises for
   fiscal institutions and call for a closer investigation of how
   non-bellicist shocks have shaped the modern state.},

Abstract = {This article examines how features of international development
   cooperation are reproduced within international networks of stakeholders
   in transitional justice (TJ) processes aimed at seeking redress for
   victims of mass atrocities. To answer this question, the authors analyze
   interactions between survivors of the Peruvian internal armed conflict
   and (inter)national development and human rights NGOs involved in the TJ
   process. The article identifies four features of international
   development cooperation and scrutinizes the respective ways in which
   they challenge the reciprocal linkages between NGOs and victim-groups in
   post-conflict settings: asymmetrical relationships, ephemeral
   agenda-setting processes, paternalism, and socio-geographical
   concentration of development interventions. We show how these four
   features influence representations of victimhood as well as the extent
   to which survivors can formulate their demands and priorities.},

Abstract = {The political psychologists Hatemi, Crabtree and Smith accuse orthodox
   moral foundations theory of predicting what is already intrinsic to the
   theory, namely that moral beliefs influence political decision-making.
   The authors argue that, first, political psychology must start from a
   position which treats political and moral beliefs as equals so as to
   avoid self-justificatory theorising, and second, that such an analysis
   provides stronger evidence for political attitudes predicting moral
   attitudes than vice versa. I take this empirical result as a starting
   point to intervene in a debate in contemporary normative political
   theory which has, to my mind, become largely unwieldy: the political
   realism controversy. I advise the realists to `downplay' the (thus far)
   inconclusive debate over realism's metanormative standing in favour of a
   non-metanormative inquiry. Hatemi, Crabtree and Smith's study makes for
   an excellent backdrop. It affirms the realist hypothesis that politics
   is in some relevant sense - a causal, psychological sense - prior to
   morality.},

Abstract = {We highlight practical lessons from policy theories on how to promote
   equity through transformational changes in policymaking. Health,
   education and gender are at the heart of such equity policy agendas.
   Their advocates seek transformational changes to: policy, to reject a
   ???neoliberal??? paradigm and address the social and economic causes of
   unfair inequalities, and policymaking, to foster collaboration and
   holistic government. However, they also report a wide gap between
   aspirations and outcomes, and many seek insights from policy studies on
   how to close it. Our aim is to use their common engagement with policy
   theories to connect their agendas, foster intersectoral dialogue, and
   ensure that their contributions are greater than the sum of their parts.
   A common take-home message is to be cautious about any attempt to turn a
   provocative transformational political project into a technical process
   containing a ???toolbox??? or ???playbook???.},

Title = {Unpacking value destruction at the intersection between public and
   private value},

Abstract = {Public services do not always create value. Rather, when poorly
   organized and/or delivered, they can destroy value and make service
   users' lives worse. However, such ``value destruction{''} is presently
   weakly conceptualized in public management theory. Consequently, this
   paper is devoted to the empirical examination of value destruction and
   hence its conceptualization. At the heart of the paper, we recognize the
   multiplicity of public value and private value objectives in complex
   public service environments and the dyadic tension between these two
   value constellations. Drawing upon qualitative data derived from public
   carbon reduction projects, we establish a conceptual framework. This
   framework accounts both for the types of value destruction and for the
   tension between public and private value. Subsequently, the framework
   disentangles the value destruction concept into four categories: value
   ignorance, value disproportion, value backlash, and value exploitation.
   Finally, the implications of this new conceptual framework for public
   management theory and practice are explored.},

Abstract = {This paper uses a modified battle of the systems approach and to explain
   the extent and location of financial services migration from London to
   the EU. It shows that the European Central Bank and European Commission
   pressured UK-based financial services to migrate to the EU by 2022, that
   companies migrated to EU cities most suited to their business models,
   with the critical exception of clearing services. Frankfurt's strategy
   of building a single prime financial centre has been limited to banking,
   but Paris' has won the day with a network of financial services spread
   across European cities that are coordinated in France and upheld with
   information and communication technology.},

Abstract = {The movement of personnel between roles in regulation, politics, and
   regulated industries is thought to affect the risks of politicization
   and industry capture of independent regulatory agencies. To test whether
   such movements are better explained by formal rules or by
   sector-specific patterns, we employ an original dataset of the 152
   appointees to 11 IRAs in Portugal over the last 3 decades. We find that
   variations in the formal independence of agencies have been of little
   consequence. Instead, revolving doors abound in the financial sector,
   with a disproportionate share of regulators of that sector coming from,
   and moving back, to the industry. In turn, appointment of regulators
   with political links to Portuguese IRAs seems related with legacies of
   sectoral public control.},

Abstract = {How are political elites embedded in both civil and political domains? I
   studied 246 Chinese political elites who also served on nonprofit
   foundations' boards from 2011 to 2015 and conceptualized a framework to
   understand the state-nonprofit relationship before 2015. The political
   elites can build horizontal connections with foundations, helping the
   party-state reach nonprofit actors. They can also build vertical
   connections with political groups, helping foundations access political
   resources. The dual-role elites' connectedness with foundations and in
   the polity varies by their primary positions in the political system.
   Effective communication between the state and nonprofit actors requires
   elites to have strong connections in both the civil and political
   domains, but the situation in China is far from ideal-those embedded in
   foundations are disconnected from the polity, and those connected in the
   polity are marginalized in foundations.},

Title = {Beyond Duterte: Conceptualizing a Research Agenda of Populism Research
   in the Philippines},

Abstract = {This article is an attempt to carve out a research agenda for an
   enriched populism research in the Philippines. Specifically, it analyzes
   journal articles drawn from academic database collections, examines its
   domains of publication, and core analytical approaches. Then, it
   situated these studies within the broader landscape of the Philippine
   political scholarship. The results suggest a thriving and flourishing
   populism research in the Philippines. Yet, it also suffers from the same
   theoretical and empirical obscurities that typifies global research on
   populism. The article contends that future Philippine populism studies
   must (a) adhere to a minimalist theoretical anchor, (b) be
   methodologically pluralistic and innovative, and (c) be thematically
   grounded on a host of other significant domains of Philippine politics
   that go beyond Duterte. Ultimately, the article urges prospective
   scholars to strongly engage with these arguments and suggested line of
   political inquiries in order to refine the scholarly enterprise of
   populism in the country.},

Abstract = {From the start, Britain's feelings towards European integration were
   complex; and when Britain finally joined the `common market' in 1973,
   its reasons were predominantly of an economic nature. Its profound
   doubts of any `federal' or `political' union would become a recurring
   theme throughout its membership; and, in later years, Britain's critical
   attitude towards transfers of legislative powers to the European Union
   found numerous expressions in a wide range of `opt-outs'. They gave the
   United Kingdom, in the words of the British government, a unique place
   within the Union. However, even this halfway house `inside' and
   `outside' the European Union could not prevent a British referendum in
   which the majority of British citizens decided to opt out of Union
   membership altogether. This article offers a very short historical
   overview of British membership in the Union. Six key moments in the
   story of British membership will illustrate the complex relationship
   between Britain and the European Union.},

Abstract = {The use of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure
   development can alleviate the high levels of government debt associated
   with these projects while encouraging new investment as well. We
   developed a theoretical analysis of infrastructure projects and the
   applicability of PPPs. Next, we provided an empirical analysis based on
   statistics from the PPP database of the Ministry of Finance from 2013 to
   2017. Based on our results, this paper offers reasonable and effective
   guidance for restructuring China's PPP governance to improve the
   participation of government departments, the private sector, and the
   public in PPPs for infrastructure development.},

Abstract = {In a context of crisis in global order today, this article proposes
   revisiting the World Order Models Project (WOMP), towards an evaluation
   of its relevance and potential contributions to contemporary debates and
   challenges. From this revisiting, this article argues that WOMP suffered
   from problematic methodological limitations and does not constitute a
   substitute for conventional contemporary approaches to global order
   today, but some of its proposals nevertheless retain relevance, and as a
   mode of global order research it still offers the potential for
   providing an important supplement to contemporary approaches, if
   sufficiently modified to address its methodological limitations. The
   knowledge this kind of project produces is argued to offer integrative
   alternative non-great power-centric global order policy options that are
   increasingly in demand, especially from the Global South, as well as
   from Europe. This article proceeds to revisit WOMP's research design and
   outputs, evaluates the arguments of its critics, and outlines the
   modifying methodological options for a World Order Models Project 2.0.},

Abstract = {This article examines the diffusion of meritocratic practices as a
   potential instance of policy transfer by scrutinizing the introduction
   of open and competitive examinations during the mid-nineteenth century
   in the British Civil Service. Scholars have argued that British
   reformers were inspired by meritocratic practices in British-ruled
   India. In order to assess this claim, we combine qualitative analysis of
   archival material documenting the interdepartmental debates on
   meritocratic reforms in the British Home Civil Service as well as in the
   Indian Civil Service with quantitative analyses of unique data on the
   implementation of examinations with open competition in British public
   offices and the India experience of Heads of Departments. Our
   qualitative and quantitative analyses largely reject the idea that the
   Indian Civil Service was a key source of inspiration for British merit
   reforms. While our quantitative analyses show some, albeit weak,
   evidence, no such evidence was found in the qualitative analysis.},

Abstract = {Understanding where and how to bolster human rights is arguably the
   underlying motivation of most research in human rights and the greater
   field of political science. Increasingly, an emphasis on gender has been
   shown to prevent conflict and reinforce peace, thus demonstrating how a
   reinforcement of women's rights benefits the sustainment of peace.
   Despite increasing evidence for this phenomenon, scholars have not fully
   explored the mechanisms through which a focus on women fosters and
   preserves peace. Using extant literature on women and peace, I identify
   two sets of policy instruments that may be more effectual than others in
   establishing gendered peace and preventing states from relapsing into
   conflict. I further categorize the policies into high-level and targeted
   policies and hypothesize that, contrary to intuition, high-level
   policies could be more effective at generating gendered peace. I test
   the models for each instrument using an updated version of the
   PAX-Gender database and find that more high-level gender policies are
   linked to longer-lasting peace treaties.},

Abstract = {This is an introductory article for a special issue on affective
   polarisation in Spain. After discussing the concept and its
   operationalisation in multi-party settings, we offer data on affective
   polarisation in Spain and Southern Europe from a comparative perspective
   using the Comparative National Election Project (CNEP) and Comparative
   Study of Electoral Systems (CSES). In the second part, we pay special
   attention to the Spanish case, analysing different dimensions of
   affective polarisation and its evolution overtime, by taking advantage
   of an extensive number of indicators from the E-DEM panel survey.
   Finally, we describe its relationship with ideological polarisation and
   analyse its possible multidimensional nature. We conclude by introducing
   the rest of contributions of this special issue.},

Abstract = {In 2019, for the first time in Portugal, a populist radical right party
   (PRR) made it to parliament. Since then voting intentions for Chega
   (Enough) have grown with the party leader finishing third in the 2021
   presidential race. This article provides an empirical-based account of
   the party's agenda and ideological profile. It asks to what extent Chega
   shares the core ideological characteristics of the PRR family, i.e.
   nativism, populism and authoritarianism. Relying on a battery of primary
   data (party documents, legislative proposals, official party posts on
   Facebook), the article combines qualitative and quantitative text
   analysis. It shows that Chega's agenda falls well into the radical right
   profile, not only in positional terms but also in terms of issue
   salience.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Volume = {59},
Number = {5},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Mistrust is a common cause of conflict between individuals belonging to
   different identity groups. When can such mistrust be overcome? We
   present a theoretical model of trust-building across social identity
   groups to address this question. Trust between groups increases when
   individuals in one group are willing to take a chance on engaging with
   members of the other group, their engagement is positively reciprocated,
   and they are able to credibly communicate the experience to their fellow
   group members, thereby increasing their belief that members of the other
   group are trustworthy. This process is made easier if the individuals
   are not too hostile to the out-group, are flexible enough to change
   their beliefs in response to new information, and are sufficiently
   attached to their own group to be honest about their experiences with
   out-group members.},

Abstract = {Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine was a grand
   strategic error. He underestimated Ukraine's cohesion and will to
   resist, the West's unity and resolve, the vehemence of Russia's domestic
   opposition and the wariness of Russian elites. While Putin's resort to
   war reflected Russia's limited options for trying to halt Ukraine's
   drift away from its remaining pull, the war itself has shattered myths
   about Russia's own strength. It has exposed economic vulnerability,
   serious failures of military planning and battlefield execution, and
   deficits in information and cyber warfare. Mooted compromises involving
   Ukraine's partition or neutrality do not yet feel like stable solutions
   whose terms all sides will accept. Parallel escalation by Russia and the
   West appears to be the prevailing dynamic. But even if Russia
   out-escalates the West, the costs of victory will be very large, not
   least on the home front.},

Title = {Winning? The Politics of Victory in an Era of Endless War},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Two decades after the ``war on terror{''} was first waged, there is
   little conceptual clarity about what it means to win a war. Indeed,
   despite the burgeoning literature on endless war and victory, there is
   no substantive engagement with how these themes intersect when thinking
   ethically about the question of war and what passes for peace. This
   forum seeks to spark a conversation to address this gap. Bringing
   together theorists and ethicists working on the themes of war and peace,
   we ask: What might we render visible and redress by thinking critically
   of the politics of victory in an era of endless war? Further, to the
   extent that just-war theory has long offered a grammar for the ethics of
   war, how does it help or hinder this quest?},

   studies consider different types of audiences, we focus on public
   opinion, which provides moral support for securitising moves, to
   investigate what individual and country level conditions facilitate
   individuals to identify climate change as a threat to humanity or a risk
   to themselves. We do so by analysing public attitudes towards climate
   security in 24 nations covered by the 2015 Pew Global Attitudes Survey.
   We differentiate between the logics of securitisation and riskification,
   and different referent objects such as humanity and self. We then
   identify the patterns of threat and risk perception towards different
   referent objects in climate security. We find that individuals' personal
   insecurities translate into perceived personal risk from climate change
   while perceived threats to humanity from climate change are related to
   cognitive resources and sophistication.},

Abstract = {Based on two case studies from Syria, this article argues that
   unilateral external intervention in protracted conflicts is not only
   about military and financial support to one or other warring party.
   Unilateral external actors often get involved in the negotiation of
   local agreements, creating a hybrid form of intervention that combines
   the roles of warfighting, mediation, and policing. In this context,
   external actors are able to transform their military, financial and
   logistical support to states and non-state armed groups into leverage
   and negotiating power that determines the outcome of local negotiations,
   thereby gearing the dynamics of the conflict towards their own interests
   and away from the local agenda. This hybrid external intervention may,
   in some circumstances, contribute to an unjust and uncertain
   stabilisation process, while in other circumstances, it can undermine
   local peace efforts. The clear implication is the need for a greater
   role and mandate for multilateral actors.},

Abstract = {With the aim to successfully implement infrastructure, implementation
   arrangements increasingly assign responsibilities for network management
   to private actors. In the literature, two types of network management
   strategies are distinguished: process design and institutional design.
   To date, research has focused on either of these strategies. Moreover,
   while private actors aim to use the institutional capital built in the
   network before the private actor was introduced, the role of
   institutional capital in network management is often overlooked. Taking
   these research gaps together, we aim to explore the relationship between
   the two network management strategies and the intermediating role of
   institutional capital. We compare three cases of infrastructure
   implementation from the Netherlands. We find that institutional design
   strategies, through setting the network rules in the implementation
   arrangement, can ignite a virtuous or a vicious circle, respectively,
   hindering or enhancing opportunities for network management through
   process design.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long examined the relationship between natural resources
   and conflict at the country level. More recently, researchers have
   turned to subnational analyses, using either individual countries or
   subnational data for a small number of resources in sub-Saharan Africa.
   We introduce a new sub-national dataset of 197 resources that adds many
   resource types, locations, and countries from Africa, the Middle East,
   Asia, Latin America, and Europe. To demonstrate the value of the new
   dataset, we examine how conflict incidence varies with the value of the
   collective set of resources in a given location using world prices. We
   then introduce new country-specific price data, which are more relevant
   for conflict dynamics. Since country-specific prices can be endogenous
   to conflict, we instrument country-specific prices using U.S. and world
   prices. We find that sub-national resource wealth is associated with
   higher levels of conflict using some specifications, though the results
   vary widely by data source and world region. Using an instrumental
   variables strategy lends the strongest support to this positive
   relationship, but only for African countries. Notably, across all of our
   models, we find that resources are negatively associated with conflict
   in Latin America, suggesting heterogeneity of effects worth future
   exploration.},

Abstract = {Policy processes are ongoing phenomena without beginning or end.
   Accordingly, a major focus of research has been on questions of
   stability and change. This paper continues in this tradition by
   examining advocacy coalition stability, belief change, and learning.
   This paper draws on three waves of policy actor surveys that compare
   panel and non-panel samples. The data were collected in 2013, 2015, and
   2017 in the context of oil and gas development in Colorado, USA. The
   findings mostly confirm that coalitions and beliefs tend to be stable
   and that learning leans toward reinforcement rather than change in
   beliefs. However, although rare, some instances of belief change, change
   in coalition membership, and changing policy positions occur. This paper
   makes theoretical and empirical contributions to the study of stability,
   change, and reinforcement of advocacy coalitions and their beliefs and
   charges policy scholars to look more at the exceptions to the evidence
   rather than the confirmations.},

Abstract = {This article looks at how well different age groups are represented in
   the parliaments of Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece. We focus on three
   periods - before, during and after the `Great Recession' - assuming the
   economic turmoil has generated new demands channelled by new parties
   that have recently entered parliament or have had a surge during the
   crisis. Data comes from mass surveys carried out in each country and
   from MP biographies. The findings reveal relevant changes in Spain and
   Italy, with more young people in the parties that appeared or had a
   surge during the crisis, whereas in Greece and Portugal no relevant
   changes are observed.},

Title = {EU Actorness in the Conflict in Ukraine: Between `Comprehensive'
   Ambitions and the Contradictory Realities of an Enlarged `Technical'
   Role},

Abstract = {The EU as an actor in international affairs does so far have only
   limited experience in conflict management. Nevertheless, it has
   formulated the goal of playing the role of a `comprehensive' conflict
   manager already in 2013. In the post-Soviet region, the Union until
   recently hardly lived up to that ambition and has mostly restricted
   itself to a technical profile. This article asks for the EU' s
   contribution to conflict management in Ukraine since 2014 and for its
   respective development as a foreign policy actor. It finds that the
   Union in Ukraine largely remains wedded to the `partial-indirect' type
   of conflict manager but that it has also demonstrated some progress
   towards a more political and less technocratic profile. In the Ukraine
   conflict, the EU has shown remarkable pragmatism, a willingness to
   invest resources on an unprecedented level, and the ability to
   securitize its policies in substance. It can be argued that the EU,
   based on its comprehensive support to state building projects in
   Ukraine, is on the way towards the establishment of a `state
   building-security nexus' in the ENP framework. Yet, there exists a
   dangerous gap between the level of investment on the one hand and the
   low political profile of the institutions and the lack of strategy on
   the other hand.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to explore the nature of policy change in the
   domain of public finance (fiscal policy) in the wake of the coronavirus
   disease (Covid-19) pandemic as well as for a post-Covid era. It draws
   upon the literatures of path dependency and ideational change in public
   policy to consider three broad questions: (1) whether the pandemic
   really is a critical juncture for policy change; (2) whether the extant
   neoliberal austerity paradigm has faced lasting ideational displacement
   by Keynesianism; and (3) whether Covid-19 has really punctuated the
   existing fiscal policy equilibrium or rather served as a path-clearing
   accelerator of public finance trends that were already underway. The
   article then suggests three potential future trajectories: Keynesian,
   neoliberal, and mixed/other to consider how the path of policy change
   might materialize in the fiscal realm in the post-Covid era.},

Abstract = {Political leaders in China regularly launch anti-corruption campaigns to
   win public support. But how are anti-corruption signals perceived? We
   use event study to examine the case of Xi Jinping's anti-corruption
   campaign - an unprecedented effort in China to fight corruption.
   Contrary to expectations, we find that for the firms with connected
   officials later investigated, the initial anti-corruption signals -
   speeches from the top leadership and earlier crackdowns on other senior
   officials - did not decrease their stock prices. We argue that the
   perceived high costs of following through and repeated campaigns in the
   past paradoxically nurtured cynicism. We exploit the case of Zhou
   Yongkang and Ling Jihua - the two officials who were alleged to be
   involved in the power struggle and whose downfall had circulated widely
   since 2012. We find that when the targets of earlier crackdowns were
   connected to Zhou or Ling, the stock prices of the firms went down only
   if their connected and later investigated officials were in the same
   faction; the stock prices of the other firms, however, went up. We
   interpret the results as investors' misperceptions of the campaign in
   the beginning. Our findings suggest that even real efforts in
   campaign-style enforcement can be dismissed.},

Abstract = {This Policy Insight suggests the UN must account for a diverse range of
   conflict drivers, including health insecurity, and that UN peace
   operations can play a role in countries of deployment to counter health
   crises. Insecurity is experienced in a variety of different ways in a
   complex world where threats are multifaceted. COVID-19 is merely the
   latest health crisis which has impacted populations around the globe in
   both developed and developing countries. However, UN peace operations
   have not typically played a major role in addressing health insecurity
   nor have they undergone any major shifts in their focus to provide
   direct health-related assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. With
   health insecurity likely to persist, there should not need to be a
   global pandemic for the UN Security Council to use peace operations to
   undertake further preventative work in this area.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the Republican Party in the United States has taken on
   the characteristics of right-wing populism, especially under President
   Donald Trump. Like most right-wing populist parties, the party under
   Trump is hostile to climate mitigation. This is reflected in skepticism
   or rejection of climate science, opposition to multilateral institutions
   and agreements, aggressive domestic exploitation of fossil fuels, and
   depiction of climate advocates and experts as `elites' set on
   undermining the will of `the people'. Among the causes of this populism
   are sharply growing political polarization, especially on climate and
   the environment, and a sorting of long-standing worldviews along party
   lines, leading to the election of a president with a nationalist,
   backward-looking agenda. This leads to drastic policy swings across
   administrations, among the states, and to gridlock at a national level.
   This stalemate will continue until one of the two competing coalitions
   can establish dominance nationally.},

Abstract = {This Special Issue makes a statement about the study of policy and
   politics, where it has been, how it is done, what it is, and where it is
   going. When addressing the question `who gets to speak for our
   discipline?' we respond emphatically - many people, from many places,
   working in many ways. It comprises scholarship that has rarely been
   combined to explore some cardinal challenges about our scholarship: (1)
   How do we conceive of policy and political studies? (2) To what extent
   should our science be `normative' or `objective' or `positive'? (3) Who
   are our audiences, and how do we engage them? (4) Whose knowledge
   matters, and how does it accumulate? (5) How should we advance the study
   of policy and politics? We conclude charging the field to consider
   different ways of thinking about what we can discover and construct in
   the world and how we can conduct our science.},

Abstract = {In countries with long-standing agency traditions, the creation of new
   agencies rarely comes as a large-scale reform but rather as one
   structural choice of many possible, most notably a ministerial division.
   In order to make sense of these choices, the article discusses the role
   of political design-focusing on the role of political motivations, such
   as ideological turnover, replacement risks and ideological stands toward
   administrative efficiency-and organizational dynamics-focusing on the
   role of administrative legacies and existing organizational palettes.
   The article utilizes data on organizational creations in the Norwegian
   central state between 1947 and 2019, in order to explore how political
   design and organizational dynamics help us understand the creation of
   agencies relative to ministry divisions over time. We find that
   political motives matter a great deal for the structural choices made by
   consecutive Norwegian governments, but that structural path dependencies
   may also be at play.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of supranational investment policies on
   the resilience of the common market project and its impact on
   core-periphery dynamics. Reconstructing the hybrid governance processes
   around the Investment Plan for Europe (2015-2020) and its geographical
   distribution, it finds that these policies were effective in channelling
   funds to the Southern periphery after the Eurozone crisis, but
   aggravated the core-periphery dynamic for Eastern Europe. This fact
   stems from the differential presence of national public financing
   institutions as well as unevenly developed capital markets, two factors
   that are linked to the multi-level and public-private governance mix in
   the EU's investment policies. These results hold implications for how to
   assess follow-up programs such as InvestEU and the Sustainable
   Investment Plan in the European Green Deal.},

Abstract = {A review of the multiple approaches to dependency theory alongside some
   of the thoughts on dependency of Jose Carlos Mariategui highlights the
   contributions that Mariategui could make to the deepening of that theory
   and even the opening of new paths and the theoretical affinity to the
   work of later scholars. Reconstruction of Mariategui's and other
   critical approaches to capitalism, including the postdevelopmentalist,
   is an urgent task. Una resena del pensamiento dependentista desde sus
   multiples aproximaciones, complementada con una revision de varias
   intuiciones sobre la dependencia dejadas por Jose Carlos Mariategui,
   hace resaltar los aportes que Mariategui podria brindar para profundizar
   e incluso abrir nuevos senderos a las teorias de la dependencia. Una
   reconstruccion de las teorias tanto de Mariategui como de otros
   referentes del pensamiento critico al capitalismo, incluso en clave
   posdesarrollista, es una tarea urgente.},

Title = {Norway?s Oil Dilemma After Glasgow: An Immoral Argument for a Rapid
   Green Transition},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},

Volume = {80},
Number = {1},
Pages = {210-220},
Abstract = {Rapid After winning the ???2021 climate election???, Norway???s new
   government faces the task of ensuring Norway???s green transition. In
   the public debate, global solidarity and environmental considerations
   are often at the forefront of arguments for the necessity of a rapid
   green transition, while opponents of a rapid transition tend to focus on
   the negative financial consequences they believe such a change will have
   for Norway. This article seeks to nuance this debate, and argues for a
   broader cost-benefit perspective that also takes into account diplomatic
   costs of continuing with oil exploration, as well as the economic
   consequences of a slow transition. We argue that, even if not
   considering other consequences of climate change, the uncertainty
   surrounding future oil prices and the reputational risk Norway runs by
   continuing basing the economy on non-renewable energy sources should be
   good enough arguments to reconsider Norway???s oil policy.},

Abstract = {This article analyses to what extent the Republic of Croatia has so far
   been able to use its favourable geographical position and other
   geographical features of its territory to improve its own geopolitical
   position. The article uses the method of neoclassical geopolitics. The
   conducted analysis shows that the geopolitical agents are aware of the
   potential of the Croatian territory and that some geopolitical goals are
   defined in the National Security Strategy. Consequently, Croatian
   transport infrastructure is constantly being built, modernized, and
   partly connects to the network of pan-European corridors. Croatia has
   been able to use its favourable geographical position in defining and
   implementing its foreign policy goals.},

Abstract = {This article employs the perspective of science and technology studies
   to follow the course of the international race for cown-19 vaccines,
   examining the epistemological, organizational, regulatory and financial
   aspects that enabled their development. The production and flow of
   knowledge was key in the response to cove-19. The impact of the pandemic
   enabled the conditions for rapid advances in research and mobilized the
   global ecosystem of biomedical innovation. International competition for
   control of the vaccines shaped project development, while domestic
   differences in the autonomy of the regulatory bodies and the actions of
   the scientific community determined the public scrutiny and
   authorization processes. It is argued that the interaction between the
   public sphere and technical and scientific development configured the
   available options for international immunization and the controversies
   around security, effectiveness and justice that have framed vaccine
   distribution and access.},
