Abstract = {Qualitative studies featuring in-depth research have recently pushed
   back against characterizations of citizens in post-conflict
   Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) as passive. After mobilizations in 2014, how do
   citizens in BiH engage in public action, and what factors explain their
   public participation? This article uses data from an original,
   nationally representative survey to depict civic engagement and
   investigate the proposition that citizens engage in civic action when
   these efforts address their primary concerns-everyday social problems,
   rather than abstract political ideals. In addition, this article draws
   on interviews to probe whether civic activists incorporate citizens'
   priority concerns in developing strategies for increasing public
   participation in their work. It finds that most citizens cite their
   motivation for civic action as tackling concrete everyday problems and
   helping those in need. Statistical analysis indicates that while the
   segment of the population that supports civic engagement on conservative
   values is small, this portion is more likely than the larger portion
   supporting civic engagement on intractable socio-economic problems to
   take action. Interviews with civic activists point not only to their
   efforts to engage citizens by acknowledging their concerns but also to
   challenges in connecting with citizens. This systematic investigation
   depicts the nuances of and contradictions in citizen participation in
   BiH. Citizens engage at modest levels and are often motivated by the
   norm of helping those vulnerable and addressing everyday problems.
   However, the small segment of the population concerned about
   conservative values is more effectively mobilized than a large segment
   prioritizing socio-economic concerns.},

Abstract = {In many circumstances where multiple, autonomous actors exist,
   cooperation is only a viable strategy if other actors also pursue a
   strategy of cooperation. Such situations can be characterised in terms
   of the Stag Hunt, based on a parable told by Rousseau. Although
   traditionally interpreted as a device for understanding how mutually
   beneficial cooperation can emerge, Harrison Wagner points out that
   would-be exploiters must overcome similar problems to succeed at
   subjugating others. Successful cooperation may have the ironic
   consequence of enabling deeper conflict within and between a
   multiplicity of societies. Despite its canonical status, the importance
   of the Stag Hunt for understanding the interaction between multiple
   societies may have been underestimated. Nonetheless, rational choice
   theory alone cannot explain how cooperation-for-predation became
   established, while historical sociology's conventional `materialist
   metanarrative' of the origin of war and the state may have unduly
   neglected the role of gender relations. The phenomenon of men's secret
   societies, found in many stateless societies, indicates that fraternal
   solidarity within coalitions of men competing to control women's labour
   and bodies may provide a path to the nucleation of warlike states. If
   this is correct, it becomes clear that in many societies, men and women
   experience multiplicity in qualitatively different ways.},

Abstract = {The USSR placed great emphasis on fighting national resistance
   movements, due both to the Soviet leadership's intention to ensure
   security to the rear of the invading Red Army and to the threat these
   movements posed to the prospect of Sovietization of the seized areas.
   Documents revealed in recent years in Russia indicate that in summer
   1945, despite the end of World War II in Europe, Poland and Lithuania
   saw a series of dragnet operations targeting guerrilla fighters.
   According to the authors, these operations were connected with the fact
   that the Soviet leadership had seriously considered the hypothetical
   failure of the Potsdam Conference and the outbreak of World War III. The
   roundup carried out by the Soviet 50th Army in the Augustow Forest was
   the bloodiest of these dragnet operations. During the roundup, more than
   seven thousand individuals were detained, including at least around six
   hundred who were subsequently shot dead by SMERSH, which viewed them as
   hostile elements. Death sentences were pronounced without trial, on the
   basis of an administrative decision issued by Soviet bodies. In the
   authors' view, this was the last mass execution of World War II. Despite
   censorship having been imposed, the memory of this crime remained vivid
   among the residents of this region throughout the entire period of the
   communist rule in Poland.},

Title = {``They Now Know That They Are Children of War{''}: Forcibly Abducted
   Mothers and Fathers Balancing Disclosure and Silencing to Their Children
   Born of War in Northern Uganda},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {In recent years, scholars have emphasized the need for a relational
   understanding of the impact of collective violence pointing to the
   myriad interconnections between individual and communal experiences and
   consequences. These interconnections are particularly strong in the
   (re)integration of formerly abducted children and youth, and their
   children born of war, since various social, relational and cultural
   processes play a key role in their wellbeing and healing. One example is
   the way in which trauma communication is shaped by culture and context,
   and intersects at the level of the individual and the collective. In
   this paper, we will explore how forcibly abducted mothers and fathers in
   post-conflict Northern Uganda perceive the trauma communication about
   the context in which their children born in forced captivity were
   conceived. Case study research was used to understand the dynamic
   trajectories of this trauma communication, placing parents' experiences
   within broader life histories, and the social and relational context.
   Repeated interviews were performed with six mothers and four fathers who
   became parents in forced captivity with the Lord's Resistance Army
   (LRA). Central in the participants' stories is their agency in the
   careful, individual choice ``to be silent{''} or ``not to be silent{''}
   toward their children, family and community members. However, these
   choices are shaped-and often restricted-by the relational and cultural
   context. A dynamic interplay of several factors, such as the age of the
   child, the emotional impact of disclosure, a lack of resources and
   support in the upbringing of children, identity and belonging, and
   perceived or potential future stigmatization are explored in this paper.
   Trauma communication can be seen as a socially negotiated choice,
   interacting in a complex dialectic relationship between silencing,
   disclosing, forgetting and remembering. As such, the study revealed
   important insights into post-conflict healing and reintegration in the
   day-to-day lives of formerly abducted children and youth, and their
   children born of war, on an individual and collective level.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 crisis demanded rapid, widespread policy action. In
   response, nations turned to different forms of social distancing
   policies to reduce the spread of the virus. These policies were
   implemented globally, proving as contagious as the virus they are meant
   to prevent. Yet, variation in their implementation invites questions as
   to how and why countries adopt social distancing policies, and whether
   the causal mechanisms driving these policy adoptions are based on
   internal resources and problem conditions or other external factors such
   as conditions in other countries. We leverage daily changes in
   international social distancing policies to understand the impacts of
   problem characteristics, institutional and economic context, and peer
   effects on social distancing policy adoption. Using fixed-effects models
   on an international panel of daily data from 2020, we find that peer
   effects, particularly mimicry of geographic neighbors, political peers,
   and language agnates drive policy diffusion and shape countries' policy
   choices.},

Abstract = {This article examines the consequences of the opium concession system in
   the Dutch East Indies-a nineteenth-century institution through which the
   Dutch would auction the monopolistic right to sell opium in a given
   locality. The winners of these auctions were invariably ethnic Chinese.
   The poverty of Java's indigenous population combined with opium's
   addictive properties meant that many individuals fell into destitution.
   The author argues that this institution put in motion a self-reinforcing
   arrangement that enriched one group and embittered the other with
   consequences that persist to the present day. Consistent with this
   theory, the author finds that individuals living today in villages where
   the opium concession system once operated report higher levels of
   out-group intolerance compared to individuals in nearby unexposed
   counterfactual villages. These findings improve the understanding of the
   historical conditions that structure antagonisms between competing
   groups.},

Title = {Military Abolitionism: A Critical Typology},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},

Abstract = {Pacifism in its purest form condemns all war without exception. Military
   abolitionism, by contrast, is the view that it is morally impermissible
   for states to create and maintain war-making institutions. One might
   assume that any moral objection to the existence of war-making
   institutions must, in the final analysis, be based on some moral
   objection to war itself. Against this, I show that that there are in
   fact several distinct types of military abolitionism. One of them-which
   I label pacifistic abolitionism-does indeed derive the wrongness of war
   preparation from a logically prior generalization that states are
   morally prohibited from everwaging war. All of the other types, however,
   are either silent on whether war can ever be justified, or they concede
   that it can be. I separate out five distinct types of non-pacifistic
   military abolitionism-procedural, prudential, liberal, progressive, and
   economic-before considering objections and devising replies. El
   pacifismo en su forma mas pura condena todas las guerras, sin excepcion.
   El abolicionismo militar, por el contrario, es la vision de que es
   moralmente inadmisible que los Estados creen y mantengan instituciones
   belicas. Se podria suponer que cualquier objecion moral a la existencia
   de instituciones belicas debe, en ultima instancia, basarse en alguna
   objecion moral a la propia guerra. En contra de esto, muestro que de
   hecho hay varios tipos distintos de abolicionismo militar. Uno de ellos,
   que denomino abolicionismo pacifista, se basa, en efecto, en el caracter
   erroneo de la preparacion para la guerra de una generalizacion
   logicamente previa de que los Estados tienen moralmente prohibido hacer
   la guerra. Sin embargo, todos los demas tipos no dicen nada sobre si la
   guerra puede estar justificada, o admiten que puede estarlo. Separo
   cinco tipos distintos de abolicionismo militar no pacifista
   (procedimental, prudencial, liberal, progresista y economico) antes de
   considerar las objeciones e idear las respuestas. Le pacifisme dans sa
   forme la plus pure condamne toutes les guerres sans exception.
   L'abolitionnisme militaire, en revanche, est l'opinion selon laquelle il
   est moralement inadmissible pour les etats de creer et de maintenir des
   institutions de guerre. Nous pourrions supposer que toute objection
   morale a l'existence d'institutions de guerre devrait, au bout du
   compte, etre imperativement fondee sur une objection morale a la guerre
   elle-meme. Je montre au contraire qu'il existe en realite plusieurs
   types distincts d'abolitionnisme militaire. L'un d'entre eux-que je
   qualifie d'abolitionnisme pacifiste-deduit effectivement l'immoralite de
   la preparation a la guerre d'une generalisation logique prealable selon
   laquelle il est en toute circonstance moralement interdit aux etats de
   faire la guerre. Tous les autres types sont cependant silencieux sur la
   question de savoir si la guerre peut jamais etre justifiee, soit ils
   concedent qu'elle peut l'etre. Je distingue cinq types d'abolitionnisme
   militaire non pacifiste-procedural, prudent, liberal, progressiste et
   economique-avant d'examiner les objections et d'envisager des reponses.},

Abstract = {This study carries two distinct contributions to extant literature.
   Theoretically, it introduces an organizational approach to the study of
   public governance. Empirically, it demonstrates how the organizational
   architecture of government represents a stable and systemic capacity for
   public governance across time. The study establishes how stability
   serves as an enduring feature of public governance and how this is
   anchored in the organizational architecture of government systems.
   Moreover, structured flexibility is illustrated by how the civil service
   adapts to both international organizations and societal stakeholders.
   Theorizing the organizational dimension of public governance, this study
   also introduces a design tool that may be useful for deliberately
   (re)structuring public governance. Empirically, these arguments are
   probed by a sizable dataset with 13,173 observations across 40 years,
   consisting of nine surveys of civil servants at ministry and agency
   levels. The data enables a long-term perspective on government civil
   servants over nearly half a century, thus allowing for a comprehensive
   study of the organizational basis for public governance.},

Abstract = {The outcomes of centralized or decentralized decision making in public
   organizations have been a subject of intense debate in the literature
   for more than a century now. This study revisits this debate by
   examining whether the degree of centralization influences the
   implementation of four types of organizational changes: reorganization,
   service contracting, technology adoption, and performance information
   use. We conceive of organizational decision making as a ladder-at one
   end is a very centralized approach where the chief executive primarily
   makes all major decisions, and at the opposite end is a highly
   decentralized approach where lower-level employees participate in
   shaping strategic decisions. Using the results from a national survey of
   midsized and large city governments, the ordered probit regressions, and
   additional robustness tests, show that moderation matters more than the
   polar ends. Moreover, moderate centralization and decentralization have
   distinct influences on the implementation of different types of
   organizational change. The findings challenge the conventional thinking
   that the choice between centralization or decentralization is binary,
   where one structure is always better than the other. Consistent with
   contingency theory, public organizations demonstrate strategic behavior
   in the choice of decision-making structure to adapt to environmental and
   organizational contingencies.},

Abstract = {The nuclear competition school, an emerging theoretical perspective on
   the political effect of nuclear weapons, argues that a favorable nuclear
   balance can significantly reduce one's expected costs of nuclear war and
   therefore affect the interaction between nuclear-armed states, such as
   deterrence and crisis outcomes. This new perspective also presents a
   wide array of empirical evidence demonstrating the significant effect of
   the nuclear balance of power on political outcomes, thereby challenging
   the theory of the nuclear revolution, which argues that the nuclear
   balance of power produces no meaningful effects on political outcomes
   because no state can escape costly nuclear destruction. Little
   attention, however, has been paid to systematically exploring the effect
   of the nuclear balance on the initiation of nuclear crises. This is
   surprising, given that observable factors, such as the nuclear balance,
   should have a powerful effect at the crisis initiation stage because
   countries can observe military balance and assess the costs and benefits
   of entering a crisis. This article tests a core argument of the nuclear
   competition school regarding the effect of the nuclear balance on the
   initiation of nuclear crises. With original data on strategic nuclear
   balance, my statistical analysis shows that having a superior nuclear
   arsenal than another nuclear-armed opponent does not lead to a reduced
   likelihood of nuclear crisis initiated by the opponent. These core
   findings hold after conducting a series of robustness tests with various
   measures of the balance of nuclear forces. They encourage us to
   reconsider the persuasiveness of the nuclear competition school and
   offer implications for US nuclear policy and force size.},

Abstract = {For 70 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been the
   backbone of American and European security and a major force for global
   stability. The unifying threat is now Russia, a quasi-imperial power
   whose leader, President Vladimir Putin, is intent on reasserting the
   country's control over its `near abroad' and re-establishing its status
   as a great power. Russia's aggression in Ukraine has produced cohesive
   Western and in particular NATO resistance, while its military
   performance there has been stunningly poor. After it rebuilds its
   economy and military, however, more Russian aggression is possible and
   perhaps likely. Given Russia's reckless aggression in Ukraine, NATO
   members' readiness and implementation, especially in the front-line
   Baltic states, now merit more robust discussions. NATO must also revise
   its Strategic Concept to reflect the primacy of the Russian threat.
   Above all, the Alliance must have the will to compete, and the US must
   lead and encourage it.},

Volume = {121},
Number = {483},

Abstract = {Social media misinformation is widely recognized as a significant and
   growing global problem. Yet, little is known about how misinformation
   spreads across broader media ecosystems, particularly in areas with
   varying internet access and connectivity. Drawing on research in
   northern Ghana, we seek to address this gap. We argue that `pavement
   media'-the everyday communication of current affairs through discussions
   in marketplaces, places of worship, bars, and the like and through a
   range of non-conversational and visual practices such as songs, sermons,
   and graffiti-is a key link in a broader media ecosystem. Vibrant
   pavement and traditional media allow for information from social media
   to quickly cross into offline spaces, creating a distinction not of the
   connected and disconnected but of first-hand and indirect social media
   users. This paper sets out how social, traditional, and pavement media
   form a complex and deeply gendered and socio-economically stratified
   media ecosystem and investigates its implications for how citizens
   differentially encounter, process, and respond to misinformation. Based
   on the findings, we argue that efforts intended to combat the spread of
   misinformation need to move beyond the Western-centred conception of
   what constitutes media and take different local modalities of media
   access and fact-checking into account.},

Title = {Which Nationalism for the Anthropocene? A Comparative Study of Exemplary
   Green Nation-States},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {This article poses, and attempts to answer, two correlated questions:
   (1) Is nationalism, the dominant ideology in our world of nation-states,
   compatible with the struggle to halt or minimize climate change and
   related environmental catastrophes? and (2) Which form(s) of government,
   whether or not informed by nationalist ideology, could better address
   the most serious threat to human life that currently appears on the
   horizon? This article puts forward the claim that while the former
   question has only recently begun to be explored in a few essays and
   articles devoted to analyzing the linkages between nationalism and
   climate change, the latter remains unexplored. Attempting to fill this
   gap, we investigate case studies of exemplary nation-states that
   periodically scored the highest in the Environmental Performance Index
   (EPI) and the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI): Scandinavian
   countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark), Switzerland, and Germany. Their

Abstract = {Ukrainian activity in the realm of image and perceptions during the 2022
   Russian invasion provides a unique opportunity to examine deep
   understanding and creative usage of this important fighting arena in the
   current political reality. The current paper analyzes the actions of the
   Ukrainian leadership, which invested a lot of time and effort into
   garnering support from the international community and mobilizing
   various leaders to assist the Ukrainians in their fight, while using
   different strategies and tools. Based on the unprecedent amount of
   support they received, it appears the Ukrainians were successful in
   applying Imagefare as their strategy.},

Title = {Resisting or Facilitating Change? How Street-Level Managers'
   Situational Work Contributes to the Implementation of Public
   Reforms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},

Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Managers of street-level organizations play an important role in the
   successful implementation of public reforms. A prevailing view within
   the public administration literature is that this work involves the
   adaptation between reforms and local contexts, where divergence is
   viewed as a form of resistance to change. The article challenges this
   prevalent reform-centric view by introducing a situation-centric
   perspective and coining the concept of situational work as a significant
   form of managerial work during implementation. Situational work
   encompasses managerial actions that ensure functional and well-ordered
   service delivery in local street-level organizations by accomodating
   everyday situational contingencies, including reform objectives, but
   also the interests and expectations of workers, clients, and local
   service partners. The concept of situational work, then, broadens the
   recognized scope of managerial activities that contribute to successful
   reform implementation, reconceptualizing divergence from reform design
   as constructive rather than as resistance to change. The article draws
   on an extensive multi-wave study of a major organizational reform in
   Norway, based on observations of meetings as well as qualitative
   interviews of managers, union representatives, frontline workers, and
   collaborating partners in six welfare service offices at three points in
   time (altogether 23 observation sessions and 173 interviews).},

Abstract = {What role does sector play in citizens' perceptions of products or
   services in mixed-market settings? Where governments compete with
   for-profit and nonprofit vendors, or when governments partner or
   contract with private-sector providers, do the public and nonprofit
   sectors have an advantage over for-profit providers? Do the public and
   nonprofit sectors have an advantage over for-profit providers? Using
   choice-based conjoint analysis with a nationally representative paid
   consumer panel, we examine the relevance of sector to consumers and
   compare it other signals of quality; namely, price, third-party
   certifications, and consumer ratings. Of these, subjects are most
   sensitive to information from consumer ratings. Regarding sector, we
   find that subjects generally prefer nonprofit to government providers
   and government to for-profit providers. Sector is most relevant to
   consumers in low-information environments when the quality of a product
   or service is otherwise unclear. We extend theory by proposing four
   possible mechanisms for the differential value of sector to consumers
   (process quality, product quality, expertise quality, and moral
   quality).},

   Intentions During COVID-19},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {In case of a global crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, inclusive
   identities are essential for coordinated action and for pro-social
   behavior on behalf of vulnerable groups. We tested how identification
   with all humanity vs. the national ingroup play a role in supporting
   vulnerable groups by prosocial action on one hand, and on the other
   hand, how these factors mobilize people to be willing to put pressure on
   authorities for the interest of their communities. We hypothesized that
   identification with all humanity (compared to national identity) leads
   to empathy for vulnerable groups and prosocial action intention on
   behalf of them to a higher degree, and unlike national identity, it also
   predicts political action intention. Data was collected with an online
   survey at four timepoints in Hungary. Our path analyses showed that both
   human and national identity predicted empathy and prosocial action
   intentions toward groups in need. Human identification was a positive,
   and national identification a negative predictor of political action
   intention. While both identification with all humanity and national
   identity united people in caring for others in a crisis, the two forms
   of identification divided them in questioning governmental measures.
   Identification with all humanity made people not only sensitive to
   vulnerable groups, but critical to the government and made them more
   willing to challenge political decisions. Identification with all
   humanity became a predictor of political action intention, showing that
   solidarity could manifest both in prosocial and political action
   tendency in the context of COVID-19.},

Abstract = {This article interrogates the practice of humanitarian diplomacy by
   focusing on the history of the Red Cross Movement. It approaches
   humanitarian diplomacy beyond its technical understanding as a neutral
   tool for advocating and negotiating on behalf of vulnerable people. It
   suggests that by flagging high moral purpose, diplomacy can employ the
   humanitarian logic to also pursue parallel objectives and ethically
   ambiguous goals. Specifically, the article examines the parallel
   diplomatic initiatives and business-colonial projects of the founding
   father of the Red Cross, Henry Dunant. It then assesses the Swiss legacy
   of neutrality and discreet diplomacy of the International Committee of
   the Red Cross (ICRC) vis-a-vis the advocacy of more vocal humanitarian
   organisations. It looks at the decolonisation of the Movement and
   pursuit of national objectives and assesses the shift from humanitarian
   to human rights diplomacy, and the moral tensions of pursuing one or the
   other, or approaching them as a continuum.},

Abstract = {This article adopts a Gramscian approach to exploring the political
   economy behind the rise and fall of the National Islamic Front (NIF) in
   Sudan. It traces the NIF's rise from the 1960s, with particular
   attention to the class character of its hegemonic project and shifting
   ideology. Reading its reign through the lens of minimal hegemony, it
   critically explores how neoliberal restructuring produced a narrow but
   powerful ruling bloc at the expense and marginalisation of different
   social groups, and how shifts in international relations intertwined
   with social transformations across Sudan to reproduce new forms of
   dependency. Paying attention to the uneven nature of capitalist
   development and resulting antagonisms during this period, it explores
   why the NIF was unable to forge an integral hegemony, ending with the
   crisis of authority that overthrew Bashir and the emergence of social
   forces that continue to contest its cultural, political and economic
   project.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 epidemic and the measures employed to tackle it have
   affected (inter alia) intrapersonal relationships and family life. This
   paper explores how those changed circumstances correlate with the
   patterns of intimate partner homicide (IPH) in Slovenia. For that
   purpose, we examine the recent IPH trends and compare them to trends in
   homicide in general. In the second part of the paper, we look
   qualitatively into all the cases of IPH that have allegedly occurred
   during the Covid-19 epidemic in Slovenia and that have been reported in
   online newspapers. The preliminary investigation into homicides
   committed during the Covid-19 epidemic reveals that intimate partner
   killings are likely to have occurred with more frequency, while their
   patterns have not been substantially changed.},

Abstract = {This article explores whether and how the United Kingdom was destined to
   Brexit before it even joined the European Communities in 1973. Drawing
   on archival sources, media reports and literature about Britain's
   arduous relationship with `Europe', it argues that four features made
   the Brexit outcome more likely. They were the accession to the EC as a
   measure of last resort which prevented the construction of a new
   sustainable narrative about a brighter future in `Europe'; the political
   elites' use of the issue of EC membership or further integration for
   short term party gains; highly exaggerated hopes that membership in and
   by itself would cure Britain's economic ills or give it a new global
   leadership role; and a colonial style diplomacy that severely
   underestimated Britain's growing dependency on its continental European
   neighbours. In conclusion, the article argues that it nevertheless
   required the formation of a parochial political elite of little
   Englanders to achieve the extreme outcome of Brexit.},

Abstract = {Income inequality is a significant social problem that differentiates
   society according to the amount of income into structured groups, which
   do not always objectively correspond to the generally required national
   economic or political idea of income equality in society. The high level
   of income inequality, including its inappropriate structure, is a source
   of intergroup tension, hinders balanced economic development and limits
   the development of society as a whole with reference to social
   disadvantage and income stratification of society. The contribution aims
   to present social income as an indicator for moderating the income
   inequality in the society through which the subjects of social policy
   may influence the distribution of money income among the individual
   social groups within the society and thus improve the living standard of
   the population in the given country. The level of influence of income
   inequality through social income will be expressed by the so-called
   income inequality gap and will be assessed by means of changes in the
   index of income inequalities on the case of the Czech Republic.},

Abstract = {Using the 2019 China Invested Firms and Employees Survey (CIFES), this
   study explores the convergence of Chinese enterprise and employee (E\&E)
   evaluation in Southeast Asian countries. The results show that
   convergence varies greatly across the nine Southeast Asian countries.
   Union organisations and economic factors play a key role in convergence.
   Firms with labour unions report a more effective corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) performance than others, while employees in the
   construction sector report their firms' CSR and those in the
   manufacturing and service sectors. Interestingly, the number of years
   worked by an employee correlates positively with their perception of
   firms' CSR performance.},

Abstract = {This study investigates support for changes to the U.S. Supreme Court
   using prospect theory. Risk domain is alternatively conceptualized as
   the perception of retrospective benefits and future risks posed by
   Supreme Court decision-making. Two experiments explore how citizens
   think about gains and losses from Court outputs. Findings indicate that
   retrospective bent juts are influenced by the relevant time frame
   respondents are asked to consider, political partisanship, and the
   interaction between them; prospective risks are affected by question
   wording, partisanship, and an interaction between
   respondents'partisanship and the relevant time frame. Using
   retrospective benefits as a proxy for determining if someone is in the
   domain of gains or losses does not yield consistent results regarding
   support for change to the Supreme Court. Conceptualizing risk domain in
   terms of the expectation of future gains and losses, however, does yield
   significant effects consistent with prospect theory.},

Abstract = {The present article examines how voters' support for populist parties
   and the degree of political power wielded by populist parties influence
   political trust in Central Europe. In countries where a populist party
   has undivided power, populist supporters are, when compared to
   supporters of other parties, more likely to trust political
   institutions. These differences result from ideological congruence as
   well as favourable assessments of how democratically a country is
   governed. Where populists do not control the government, only populist
   parties' supporters who have very favourable assessments of democratic
   governance in their own country are more likely to trust political
   institutions compared with supporters of other parties.},

Abstract = {The effect of globalization on national economies remain a subject of
   empirical interest. Owing to the spillovers via globalization effects, a
   number of economies in the South Asian region have recorded phenomenal
   economic growth. However, the extent to which economic growth can
   influence development outcomes remains the issue of interest. Therefore,
   this study adds to the literature by examining the time and modulative
   effects of economic globalization on some direct regressors of economic
   growth. The study focused on eight South Asian countries from 1996 to
   2019 for which data on globalization were sourced from
   Konjunkturforschungsstelle Globalization index, World Governance
   Indicators and International country risk database. A pooled
   autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) approach was utilized in
   addressing the objective of this study. Consequently, the findings
   suggest that while globalization influences economic growth positively,
   rising interest rates and inflationary pressures can unsustain this
   influence. Likewise, the modulated estimates show that economic
   globalization can be utilized as a tool to stimulate investment as well
   as to check corruption and subsequently sustain economic growth in South
   Asian economies.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies demonstrate the impact of personality traits on
   political attitudes and behaviours, but these theories have not been
   tested in African contexts. Using a survey conducted in three indigenous
   languages of 1,516 respondents from northern Ghana, we demonstrate the
   salience of personality variables in predicting political attitudes and
   behaviours. These results are striking given the region's strong social
   hierarchies, low levels of education, and collectivist orientation. Our
   more stable personality measurements of Extraversion, Agreeableness,
   Emotional Stability, and Conscientiousness are strong predictors of
   various political attitudes and behaviour in the expected directions.
   These relationships remain robust in the presence of demographic and
   linguistic controls. This paper points to a rich and underexplored
   avenue of political analysis across collectivist societies and provides
   tools to aid researchers in employing measures of abstract personality
   traits in contexts characterised by collectivism that speak non-European
   languages.},

Abstract = {Eastern African small island states played a role in advancing the `Blue
   Economy' concept prior to the Rio+20 summit in 2012, when it emerged on
   a global stage. As their main concern they cited threats caused by
   climate change to marine life, on which they are highly dependent. This
   briefing explores the uneven development of the various national
   policies geared towards the concept. It notes an emphasis on economic
   policies neglecting climate change and dispute settlement policies, and
   identifies a need for the development of an all-encompassing regional
   approach to maximise Blue Economy benefits in Eastern Africa.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, governments and companies store data to identify persons
   for services provision and interactions. The rise of self-sovereign
   identities (SSIs) based on blockchain technologies provides individuals
   with ownership and control over their personal data and allows them to
   share their data with others using a sort of ``digital safe.{''}
   Fundamentally, people have the sole ownership of their identity data and
   control when and how it is shared, protecting their privacy. As these
   data need to be validated to be trusted, they may become a more
   important data source for digital information sharing and transactions
   than the formal source of identity controlled by governments.
   Furthermore, SSIs can be used for interacting digitally with any
   organization. These developments change the relationship between
   government, companies, and individuals. We explore information sharing
   and governance in the digital society using blockchain-based SSIs. In
   addition, the impact of SSIs on data storage in the digital world is
   assessed. Technology enactment might result in no greater control or
   privacy and might only reinforce current practices. Finally, we argue
   that regulation and a combination of centralized and decentralized
   governance are still required to avoid misuse and ensure that envisaged
   benefits are realized.},

Abstract = {Although the hotspot approach has been one of the key EU responses to
   the 2015 migration crisis, it has not received much systematic attention
   from EU scholars. Addressing this research gap, this article examines
   the establishment and implementation of the EU hotspot approach in Italy
   and its operational reliance on EU agencies. Building on and extending
   the conceptual framework of the European Administrative Space (EAS), we
   show how Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) have
   strengthened both their independent administrative capacity and
   integration within the EAS. To gain a more comprehensive understanding
   of the role of EU agencies within the Italian hotspots, we also discuss
   two important yet widely neglected features of administrative
   governance, namely the level of precision of the agencies' mandate and
   interagency cooperation. Our analysis draws on a broad range of primary
   sources as well as nineteen semi-structured expert interviews.},

Abstract = {Parents employ a wide range of anticipatory strategies to prepare their
   children for, and protect them against, risks of racism. This article
   argues that, while black children need to be equipped with the skills
   and understanding to navigate racist societies, these practices are also
   the site of a significant injustice for minority families. Specifically,
   the imperative to take strategic steps to protect children against
   threats of racism creates unfair barriers to the enjoyment of some
   valuable relationship-based goods. In advancing this argument, the
   article brings recent philosophical work on the family into dialogue
   with a rapidly developing body of empirical research on racial and
   ethnic socialization. I show that Brighouse and Swift's `familial
   relationship goods' framework generates a valuable new perspective on
   some contested empirical terrain. But I also highlight, and seek to
   begin to redress, a problematic silence on race within contemporary
   philosophy of the family.},

Abstract = {Illiberalism is an emerging concept in social sciences that remains to
   be tested by different disciplines and approaches. Here, I advance a
   fine-grained frame that should help to ``stabilize{''} the concept by
   stating that we should 1/ look at illiberalism as an ideology and
   dissociate it from the literature on regime types, 2/ consider
   illiberalism to be in permanent situational relation to liberalism. To
   make that demonstration, I advance a pilot definition of illiberalism as
   a new ideological universe that, even if doctrinally fluid and
   context-based, is to some degree coherent.},

Abstract = {A major shift occurred in the European Union (EU) approach to tackle the
   apparently unstoppable rise of populist parties across European
   countries and to preserve the integrity of the EU polity. EU economic
   governance seems to have shifted from a logic of conditionality to a
   logic of solidarity underpinned by a pan-European strategic view
   allowing EU governance to support and enable public sector reforms at
   the national level. By investigating the case of Italy as an EU member
   state, we find that the European governance shift occurring in the wake
   of the COVID-19 pandemic was largely mediated by the mutating character
   of Italian populism. A logic of conditionality which was largely
   centered around EU governance was largely shifted to a logic of
   solidarity taking into account political conditions in the member
   countries.},

Abstract = {Stochastic uncertainty can cause coordination problems that may hinder
   mutually beneficial cooperation. We propose a mechanism of ex-post
   voluntary transfers designed to circumvent these coordination problems
   and ask whether it can increase efficiency. To test this transfer
   mechanism, we implement a controlled laboratory experiment based on a
   repeated Ultimatum Game with a stochastic endowment. Contrary to our
   hypothesis, we find that allowing voluntary transfers does not lead to
   an efficiency increase. We suggest and analyze two major reasons for
   this failure: first, stochastic uncertainty forces proposers intending
   to cooperate to accept high strategic uncertainty, which many proposers
   avoid; second, many responders behave only incompletely conditionally
   cooperatively, which hinders cooperation in future periods.

Abstract = {How would Islamists succeed to sustain their rule in spite of their lack
   of an Islamic blueprint for governance? I draw on an original fieldwork
   study conducted in Turkey and Egypt from 2010 to 2013 to advance a
   theory linking Islamists' rule sustainability and political leverage
   vis-a-vis the state establishment. In contrast with post-Islamism, the
   results contended that Islamists sustain their rule if they have a high
   political leverage based on the adoption of a three-fold strategy
   comprising identification, differentiation, and alliance mobilisation.
   Based on 45 open-ended and semi-structured interviews conducted with
   members of Turkey's Justice and Development Party and Egypt's Freedom
   and Justice Party, findings significantly hold in authoritarian and
   hybrid regimes in the Middle East.},

Abstract = {Calculating the consequences of global public bads such as climate
   change or pandemics helps uncover the scale, distribution and structure
   of their economic burdens. As violent conflict affects billions of
   people worldwide, whether directly or indirectly, this article sets out
   to estimate its global macro-economic repercussions. Using a novel
   methodology that accounts for multiple dimensions of war, the article
   finds that, in the absence of violent conflict since 1970, the level of
   global GDP in 2014 would have been, on average, 12\% higher. When
   disaggregating these results by conflict type, civil conflicts are
   estimated to have been the costliest by far. Income growth is found to
   be altered up to four years following the end of a conflict, although
   the direction of this relationship depends on the intensity and type of
   conflict. Countries also suffer significantly from fighting in
   neighbouring countries, thereby showing the importance of mitigating
   spillovers rapidly. The largest absolute losses associated with violence
   emanate from Asia, while many high-income economies are found to benefit
   economically from participating in conflicts on foreign soil. This
   analysis thus shows that, despite some evidence of a faster
   post-conflict growth and possible benefits for external participants,
   violent conflict leads to net global losses that linger long after peace
   is achieved, reducing the peace dividend. The article concludes by
   discussing public policy options to strengthen the benefits of peace as
   a global public good.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has created tremendous
   hazards to people worldwide. Incidence, hospitalization, and mortality
   rates have varied by individual and regional socioeconomic indicators.
   However, little is known about the indirect social and economic losses
   following the COVID-19 pandemic and to what extent they have
   disproportionately affected different groups of people. Building on the
   traditional conceptualizations of ``old{''} and ``new social risks,{''}
   this article tracks and analyzes the emerging ``COVID social risks{''}
   in five critical areas: physical health, employment and income, skills
   and knowledge, care, and social relationships. The article empirically
   examines to what extent the manifestations of ``COVID social risks{''}
   describe the makings of a new class divide in South Korea, Hong Kong,
   and Taiwan. Finally, this article discusses whether ``COVID social
   risks{''} present a temporary or lasting phenomenon and to what extent
   interactions with processes of digitization and de-globalization are
   likely to produce similar problem pressures for East Asian governments
   amid future crises. East Asian governments should facilitate
   individuals' ability to absorb ``COVID social risks{''} and
   institutionalize a new welfare policy settlement that emphasizes
   complementarities between the social protection, social investment, and
   social innovation policy paradigms.},

Abstract = {An empirical puzzle exists regarding the failure of state parties to
   comply with international agreements. Offering new empirical insights,
   this article aims to enhance understanding of non (or weak) compliance
   with international human rights agreements by state parties. Documentary
   analysis supplemented with semi-structured interviews is used to explore
   UK compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
   Child. Through the empirical case study, the results provide valuable
   insights into the domestic compliance system and compliance barriers
   within the under researched human rights sector. The results show that
   multiple barriers impact compliance within the UK and its four nations,
   to varying degrees. Differences also exist regarding the extent to which
   specific barriers emerge within the state and domestic compliance
   systems. Lastly, the findings provide evidence to support a cyclical
   model of the domestic compliance system, thereby advancing the current,
   linear understanding.},

Abstract = {The nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), its evolution over the past

   it, can be analyzed by focusing on different understandings of power.
   Within the various concepts of power are claims which distinguish
   between what is known broadly as ``power-over{''} and a more subtle form
   of influence, ``power-to.{''} This article explores the history of the
   NPT, showing how the nuclear weapon states have shaped and limited this
   institution by practices which fall within the relational emphasis of
   ``power-over.{''} Recently, however, non-nuclear states have adopted a
   ``power-to{''} approach. Frustrated by their inability to bring about
   substantive change within the limits of the NPT, these states have
   realized and applied their agency and collective ``power-to{''} in order
   to create an alternative approach to the problem of nuclear weapons in
   the context of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW).},

Abstract = {When are episodes of resistance likely to lead to democratization? We
   argue that the participation of durable organizations rooted in
   quotidian relationships that are not themselves designed to compete for
   political power (what we call ``quotidian civil society
   organizations,{''} QCSOs) drives successful democratic transitions.
   QCSOs are more likely to have stable preferences for democracy and
   durable mobilization structures that create greater accountability for
   new elites during political transitions and thus make shifts to
   democracy more likely compared to movements dominated by other
   organization types, such as political parties. Quantitative tests using
   novel data on the composition of resistance movements in Africa from
   1990 to 2015 support these arguments. Older QCSOs and those independent
   from opposition political parties and the state also appear to be the
   most likely to engender democratization.},

Abstract = {Firms with well-formulated competitive market strategies could still
   fail due to their lack of effective nonmarket strategy. Climate change
   poses significant threats to firms and presents firms' need to develop
   nonmarket strategy integrated with market strategy. Relying on the
   unique dataset of US S\&P 500 firms' responses to climate change, this
   study seeks to ask why some firms attempt to engage in climate policy
   making, while others do not do so. The results found that firms with
   organizational resources and capabilities underlying their carbon market
   strategy are more likely to support mandatory climate policy. It sheds
   light on the significance of integrated market and nonmarket strategies,
   particularly when business opportunities are controlled more by
   governments than by markets.},

Abstract = {The study of international norms from a social constructivist
   perspective has been one of the major conceptual innovations to the
   discipline of international relations (IR) over the past forty years.
   However, despite the concept's ubiquity, there is only a limited
   understanding of the large-scale trends in research associated with its
   rise. This analytic essay interrogates conventional wisdom, using a
   dataset of 7,795 mainstream, English-language journal articles from the
   Teaching, Research and International Policy Journal Article Database,
   supplemented with data from Web of Science. How have international norms
   been studied substantively and methodologically, what are major
   contributions and blind spots, and which opportunities for future
   innovation might exist? Although norms research has historically helped
   expand the scope of issues covered in IR (e.g., gender issues and public
   health), others have evidence gaps relative to the broader discipline of
   IR (e.g., terrorism and public opinion). Over the years, the proportion
   of empirical studies has increased, while purely theoretical,
   epistemological, and methodological work and innovation have decreased.
   Despite calls for methodological pluralism, norms research is
   significantly more qualitative and conceptual than mainstream IR in
   general and far less multi-method. While more international and less
   US-based than IR in general, norms research in mainstream journals seems
   to be no closer to a ``Global IR,{''} measured by regional focus and
   author affiliation. This suggests three promising avenues for future
   innovation: greater attention to specific substantive blind spots, more
   multi-method research, and increased attention to the agenda of Global
   IR. Beyond these individual insights, this review illustrates the
   general utility of complementing narrative literature reviews with ones
   based on quantitative data. It also provides a case study on conceptual
   proliferation and innovation in IR.},

Abstract = {The study of policy design has been of long-standing interest to policy
   scholars. Recent surveys of policy design scholarship acknowledge two
   main pathways along which it has developed; one in which the process of
   policy designing is emphasised and one in which the output of this
   policy designing process - for example, policy content - is emphasised.
   As part of a survey of extant research, this article discusses how
   scholars guided by different orientations to studying policy design are
   addressing and measuring common policy design concepts and themes, and
   offers future research opportunities. The article also provides a
   platform for considering how insights stemming from different
   orientations of policy design research can be integrated and mapped
   within the broader public policy process. Finally, the article raises
   the question of whether a framework that links different
   conceptualisations of policy design within the policy process might help
   to advance the field.},

   Strategy? Applying the Multidimensional Capability Approach},

Abstract = {This article examines how poverty identification is operationalized in
   the Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) strategy in rural China. Using
   the 2016 ``Thousand-Person Hundred-Village{''} national survey data and
   multilevel regression analyses, we found that the TPA strategy used a
   multidimensional approach to identify poor households and register them
   into the national poverty database. In addition to experiencing income
   poverty, rural households that suffered deprivations in education,
   health, employment, living conditions had greater odds of being
   registered as poor. Households from non-eastern regions as well as those
   from less urbanized counties were also more likely to be identified as
   poor. This article uses the Alkire and Foster method to construct a
   multidimensional poverty measure. We found that using the
   multidimensional poverty measure achieved better targeting performance
   of poverty identification than using the income poverty measure only.
   Households that were registered into the national poverty
   database-regardless of whether they were income poor, multidimensionally
   poor, or non-poor-received more public assistance from the government
   than those who were non-registered poor. These findings provide new
   insights into rural China's multidimensional poverty identification
   practice and suggest implications for China's future poverty monitoring
   and alleviation efforts.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the potentially wrongful discriminatory nature of
   certain of our dating preferences. It argues that the wrongfulness of
   such preferences lies primarily in the simple lookism they involve.
   While it is ultimately permissible for us to date people partly because
   of how they look, I argue that we have a duty to `look behind' people's
   appearance, which I take to mean that we ought not, on the basis of
   their appearance, to regard them as absolutely out of the question for
   us to engage with in a romantic setting. Further, constraints similar to
   those suggested by a duty to look behind people's appearance gain
   support from another duty we have, namely, a duty to counteract, also in
   our daily lives, the fact that people are undeservedly disadvantaged in
   various ways.},

Abstract = {This article provides the first analysis of gendered promotion issues
   for cabinet ministers using most-similar systems design for three
   ``Westminster-style{''} governments: Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.
   Using individual-level data and controlling for biographical,
   institutional, and country effects we find, in common with earlier
   literature, that women are more likely to be given less prestigious
   cabinet posts and be assigned to ``feminine{''} portfolio. Using both
   sequence and event history analysis, we see the careers of men and women
   starkly diverge. We find that women are less likely to be promoted than
   men but find no relationship between prestigious portfolio and
   promotion. However, feminine portfolio assignments decrease the
   promotion prospects for women yet increase them for men.},

Journal = {STUDIA EUROPEJSKIE-STUDIES IN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {177-198},
Abstract = {This article explores the reasons behind the high economic and social
   rankings for Finland. It also reflects on why Finland is considered the
   `` happiest{''} country in the world (according to a World Happiness
   Report). Using empirical data from two studies - an article comparing
   high-andlow-tax countries, and the aforementioned recent World Happiness
   Report - it compares Finland with its Nordic neighbours and other
   Western, especially Anglo-American, countries. The essay outlines a so-
   called ``Finnish model' and looks for the roots of this model. Comparing
   measures in several dimensions - effort, culture, institutions, and
   economic and social outcomes - the essay tries to find characteristics
   that are particular for Finland. Education, innovation, and economic
   security, as well as trust, gender equality, resilient conflict
   solutions, and geo-historical luck, are crucial to Finland's success.
   Three notable Germans - Luther, Hegel, and Marx - have influenced
   Finnish culture and society in different ways. Is Finland the country
   that comes closest to the ideal - ``From each according to his ability,
   to each according to his needs{''} (Marx, 1875).},

Number = {1},
Abstract = {Health diplomacy has played a vital role worldwide during the
   coronavirus outbreak. One crucial mechanism in this regard has been
   ``vaccine diplomacy,{''} which describes country efforts to share
   COVID-19 vaccines. China and India are ahead of other countries in
   bilateral vaccine donations due to their South-South Cooperation
   policies. Looking forward, how and why are these two countries employing
   their vaccine diplomacy strategies? We compare the engagement of both in
   this field using a Comparative Foreign Policy Analysis framework. Our
   results suggest that neither is acting only for altruistic reasons,
   because economic and political interests are the main drivers behind
   their strategies.},

   operations from Israel, USA, France, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Iraq/Syria
   that have exploited one or more of these dimensions with a principal
   goal of demonstrating the general utility but also empirical
   shortcomings of using the four-dimensional understanding of hybrid

   Value Orientation in Group-Focused Enmity in Korea},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Abstract = {Previous research (Zick et al. 2008) suggested that animosity toward
   social minorities in Europe is intertwined, forming a syndrome of
   Group-Focused Enmity (GFE). In the current research, we extended the
   notion of GFE by identifying the GFE structure in a non-European context
   (South Korea). We also tested a novel hypothesis that stipulates an
   interplay between individuals' self-concept and their value orientation
   in predicting the overall level of GFE. Two nation-wide surveys in South
   Korea showed that antagonism toward social minorities that have
   typically been marginalized and devalued in that country forms GFE while
   reflecting the unique intergroup context of Korean society. Further, we
   found as expected that independence in self-concept and a collectivistic
   value orientation jointly predict lower levels of GFE (Study 1). When
   political orientation and national identification were taken into
   account, the predicted interaction was observed only on antagonism
   toward ingroup minorities but not toward outgroup minorities by race or
   ethnicity (Study 2). Implications of these findings and directions for
   research on GFE are discussed.},

Abstract = {Since the Third Wave of democratization, political science has
   extensively debated the performance of the presidential model in Latin
   America and its effects on democratic stability. However, that debate
   has ignored a key figure: the vice presidency. The objective of this
   article is to reflect on this position, which exists practically
   throughout the Americas, as a challenge to the representative character
   of democracy, in connection with the existing debate on presidentialism
   and the political stability of American democracies. Based on three
   cases-Brazil, Argentina and the United States-this article considers the
   fixed character of the role (not removable by the president) and the
   mechanisms provided for his election as factors that diminish the
   representative character of the vice presidency and lead to instability
   and a lack of legitimacy of the Executive. Drawing on these factors,
   this article concludes there is a need to introduce reforms to the vice
   presidency, or consider its replacement by another mode of succession.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The effect of natural disasters on the end of civil wars has received
   little attention from scholars. We argue that the effect of disasters on
   conflict negotiation is dependent on which combatant is victimized by
   disaster. Drawing on a bargaining model, we argue that disasters create
   costs that alter the capabilities of the rebels and government. In order
   for these changes to lead to negotiations, the effects of a disaster
   have to lead to the mutual expectation that military victory is unlikely
   in the short term. When both sides are hit by a natural disaster, this
   mutual expectation is likely to form because both sides face significant
   costs to engaging in conflict in the short term. When one side is
   impacted, the non-affected side is likely to see an opportunity to gain
   against its rival while the side facing the devastation of a natural
   disaster may see only a temporary setback that it can recover from. This
   may lead both sides to not update their beliefs about the costs of war,
   or their chances of victory. We evaluate these hypotheses by examining
   all territorial civil wars from 1980 to 2005 using a more precise
   measure of disaster location. We find that when both sides are hit by a
   disaster, the likelihood of negotiation consistently increases. When
   only one side is impacted, the effect on negotiations is not consistent
   across model specifications.},

Abstract = {The United States had no doctrine for Counterinsurgency Operations
   (COIN) when the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq started in 2001 and 2003,
   respectively. In 2001 the US armed forces were designed for Great Power
   competition and conflict. During the course of the wars, substantial
   changes were made in the organization and equipment of the forces, and a
   COIN doctrine was introduced in 2007. In turn, large scale modernization
   of, and investments in, equipment suited for Great Power conflict were
   reduced in scale or cancelled. The cost of the wars and the changes in
   operational focus have blunted the US's ability to compete militarily
   with China and Russia.},

Abstract = {Sea-level rise is a ``nascent subsystem{''} with policy actors actively
   developing initial policy preferences through participation across
   multiple policy forums in a polycentric system. This paper uses
   item-response models to empirically analyze how actors, perceived
   problems, and preferred policy solutions are related in a latent
   ``policy space{''}. We focus on California's San Francisco Bay region,
   where in the last decade, sea-level rise emerged to become one of the
   most salient climate adaptation issues. We find that actors and policy
   preferences are arranged in a two-dimensional space, with highly engaged
   actors more likely to consider environmental justice and ecological
   aspects of sea level rise. Our findings have implications for theories
   of nascent subsystems within the Advocacy Coalition Framework, and for
   understanding how a local policy subsystem develops to address and
   prioritize the multi-faceted impacts of climate change.},

Abstract = {How does transitional justice affect trust in government? Political
   trust is central to peaceful conflict resolution, but less is known
   about the ability of different transitional justice efforts to build
   confidence in government after war. Using survey-experimental evidence
   from post-conflict Guatemala, I compare how three commonly deployed
   justice policies (trials, truth commissions, and reparations) and
   political rhetoric accompanying them affect citizen attitudes toward
   government. Exposure to information about a trial or reparations
   program, which convey costly signals, led to significantly higher levels
   of political trust and perceived political legitimacy, when compared to
   the truth commission treatment. Further, a moral rhetoric emphasizing
   the normative claims of war victims was significantly more effective
   than either an instrumental rhetoric emphasizing institutional benefits
   or the absence of justification, regardless of policy content. The
   micro-level evidence reveals how the trust-building functions of
   transitional justice are far from uniform, speaking to the pivotal role
   of political communication.},

Abstract = {This study seeks to examine how the Palestinian national ethos was
   formed based on both primordialism and territorial perceptions. It is
   based on primary sources-memoirs, public statements, and Palestinian
   media releases-dating back to the British Mandate for Palestine and
   examines the use of the basic elements of the ethos: victimhood, victory
   at all costs, and universal justice. The paper discerns two stages in
   the process of ethos formation: the first started in the 1910s and ended
   when the British Mandate was over. The second began after the civil war
   of 1947-1949 in Palestine. The loss of the Arab-Palestinian side and the
   consequences of the Nakba has not terminated yet. While the first stage
   focuses on injustice, the second phase includes all three features of
   the national ethos.},

Abstract = {Expressions of `eco-fascism' are said to entail ethnonationalist actors
   advocating extreme population control measures, and accelerationists
   hastening the collapse of societies worldwide. These expressions emerge
   from political-ideological environments in which Global North actors
   have erroneously assigned blame for climate change with the Global
   South, through rhetoric about migration, population control and fossil
   fuel usage. To assess the influence of these themes in the development
   of eco-fascist ideologies online, this paper presents insights from a
   mixed-methods analysis of climate change discussions on Stormfront; the
   first dedicated online white nationalist media platform still drawing
   cross-national participation and viewership from generalized public
   audiences.},

Abstract = {Evidence suggests that public sector decision makers are cognitively
   biased. Such biases can lead to poor public policy. This article
   explores the extent to which the traditional formal characteristics of
   the Rule of Law can debias decision makers. In particular, I claim that
   general abstract rules erode many biases. Construal level theory is used
   to support this claim.},

Abstract = {Firms that offshore final production should oppose trade barriers
   ``protecting `` their own industry. This pits them against onshore
   firms, especially when comparative disadvantage is most pronounced, and
   so fundamentally alters trade policy coalitions. The US-China trade
   war's exclusion process, where US firms could request that tariffs not
   be applied to a product, provides a golden opportunity to test this
   contention. We show that coverage by a tariff in the trade war and firm
   characteristics associated with offshoring-size, multinationality, and
   heavy imports from China-interacted to generate firm requests for
   exclusion from the trade war's tariffs. This finding is robust to
   input-sourcing and fears of export retaliation as alternative
   explanations, and across multiple measures of firm size, tariff
   coverage, and exclusion requests. We therefore test a key piece of the
   firm-centered model of trade politics and show its value in interpreting
   the US-China trade war.},

Abstract = {The article analyses discourses of Islamic actors in Indonesia about the
   state ideology Pancasila (lit. Five Pillars). It discerns three
   discursive positions that exist in Indonesia since its independence,
   namely full acceptance of Pancasila as the state ideology, complementing
   Pancasila with Islamic law, and outright rejection of Pancasila and its
   replacement by (political interpretations of) Islam. Having a particular
   focus on the post-Suharto era (since 1998), the article compares more
   recent discourses with the ones from earlier phases in Indonesia's
   post-colonial history indicating discursive (dis)continuities. It is
   particularly concerned with reinterpretations of the first pillar of the
   Pancasila, that is the belief in the One and Only God, that is today
   used by conservative and Islamist figures to call for the implementation
   of Islamic law. The article argues that this indicates a major shift in
   discursive positions, as the rejection of Pancasila and its
   complementation with Islamic law have become increasingly illegitimate
   views. Under present political conditions in Indonesia, the article
   concludes, the only position that is left for the Islamist camp is to
   accept Pancasila as it is and to combine it with a reinterpretation of
   the first pillar as guarantor for the implementation of Islamic law.},

Abstract = {Why do some rebel groups perpetrate sexual violence in armed conflict
   while others do not? A growing literature explores factors impacting the
   occurrence of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV). We contribute to
   this literature, arguing that the composition of rebel groups can
   provide insight into patterns of sexual violence. We contend rebel
   groups that use child soldiers, and especially those that rely heavily
   on coercive child recruitment practices, are more prone to engage in
   wartime sexual violence than groups who do not recruit minors. While
   children are rarely the ideal soldier, they have become a crucial
   resource for many rebel groups. Yet, their recruitment can impact
   internal group dynamics. Sexual violence can serve as a tool for
   conditioning children to violence, intragroup cohesion-building, and an
   instrument for combatting defection. We test this argument with data on
   245 rebel groups active in armed conflicts between 1989 and 2011. We
   supplement the quantitative analyses with an illustrative case study on
   the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone. Our results suggest
   groups that recruit child soldiers are more likely to inflict CRSV. This
   effect is magnified when children are recruited forcibly.},

   in Nigeria to prohibit and punish all forms of human trafficking), and
   its subsequent amendment in 2015, the number of women and children being

   although civil society organizations continue to sprout across the

   the situation on the ground remains grimly unchanged. More women wind up

Abstract = {Throughout the 20(th) century, women were leading intellectuals on
   International Relations (IR). They thought, wrote, and taught on this
   subject in numerous political, professional, intimate, and intellectual
   contexts. They wrote some of the earliest and most powerful theoretical
   statements of what would later become core approaches to contemporary
   international theory. Yet, historical women, those working before the
   late 20(th) century, are almost completely missing in IR's intellectual
   and disciplinary histories, including histories of its main theoretical
   traditions. In this forum, leading historians and theorists of IR
   respond to the recent findings of the Leverhulme project on Women and
   the History of International Thought (WHIT), particularly its first two
   book-length publications on the centrality of women to early IR
   discourses and subsequent erasure from its history and
   conceptualization. The forum is introduced by members of the WHIT
   project. Collectively, the essays suggest the implications of the
   erasure and recovery of women's international thought are significant
   and wide-ranging.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},

Volume = {14},

Pages = {95-106},

Abstract = {Donald Trump was expected to dismantle the internationalist approach
   that has dominated US foreign policy since the end of the Second World
   War. However, his impact is narrower than is commonly supposed. In some
   areas, he was able to generate some significant change, while in many
   others he failed to pursue his revisionist agenda. This article explores
   the reasons for this surprising result by investigating the relationship
   between Trump's leadership style and his advisory system. Building on
   the model of Preston and t'Hart it elaborates a new framework for
   presidents with leadership traits similar to Trump's, namely, a high
   need for power, low conceptual complexity, and low experience. The model
   presents two opposite ideal-types of interaction between the President
   and their advisory system - `presidential predominance' vs.
   `presidential permissiveness' - that help us better understand how Trump
   failed in certain issue areas and succeeded in others. The model is then
   tested on two case studies, one in which the president failed and the
   other in which he achieved his goals. These are respectively the cases
   of NATO and the World Health Organization (WHO).},

Abstract = {Issue competition theories posit that political parties have little
   incentive to emphasize the same issues, because they mostly benefit from
   emphasizing issues where they are viewed as more competent. In contrast,
   a number of empirical studies find considerable overlap in parties'
   issues emphasis. Aiming to bridge this peculiar gap, this paper suggests
   that the development of exogenous problems is one factor that constrains
   parties' incentives to talk past each other. Using comprehensive data on
   party attention to ten issues across six West European countries from
   approximately 1980 and onwards, the analysis shows that problems
   moderate the relationship between parties' issue reputations and their
   issue emphases. When problems are moderate, parties selectively focus on
   different issues, but when problems become severe, parties across the
   board attend to an issue. That even includes parties that do not own the
   issue. These results have reassuring implications for parties'

Abstract = {Ongoing nuclear modernization programs in Russia, China, and the USA
   have reopened longstanding debates among scholars concerning whether
   tailored nuclear weapons are likely to have destabilizing consequences
   for international security. Without data to adjudicate this debate,
   however, these discussions have remained entirely theoretical. In this
   article, we introduce an experimental wargaming platform, SIGNAL, to
   quantify the effect of tailored nuclear capabilities on the nuclear
   threshold in a simulated environment. We then compare these results with
   a survey experiment using scenarios related to military basing, cyber
   operations, and nuclear threats from the wargame environment. While the
   survey experiments suggest that the presence of tailored nuclear
   capabilities increases the likelihood of conflict escalation, this trend
   diminishes in the wargaming context. Across both data-generating
   processes, we find support for the proposition that lower-yield nuclear
   weapons are used as a substitute for their higher-yield counterparts.
   These results have consequences for recent and ongoing policy debates
   concerning strategic posture and the future of arms control. This work
   also makes methodological contributions to the design and application of
   experimental wargaming for social science research, particularly for
   scenarios where data are limited or non-existent.},

Abstract = {The rise of China has returned attention to the links between power
   transitions and war. In this literature, three different causal
   mechanisms can be confused. This essay disentangles them. Power
   transitions can lead to three kinds of war: preventive, accidental, and
   revisionist. Formal models tend to study the first, in which a declining
   state tries to delay or prevent a rival's ascent. However, major wars
   during great power transitions are usually initiated by the rising
   state, not the declining one. To describe these historical cases, less
   formal theories, especially neorealism and neoclassical realism, focus
   on accidental and revisionist wars, but these theories tend to fall back
   on nonrational mechanisms to connect changing power to the risk of
   conflict. This leaves a theoretical gap: Why would a rising, rational
   actor deliberately choose conflict, i.e., start a revisionist war? To
   suggest an answer, this essay demonstrates how a simple change in
   standard bargaining models-incorporating a nonzero probability of
   indecisive war-can ground realist intuitions on rationalist foundations.
   It further shows how this change leads immediately to an intuitive,
   formal definition of stability that aligns naturally with existing
   informal work. Then, contrary to existing realist theory, it shows why
   the rigorous analysis of realist assumptions leads to a nonmonotonic
   relationship between the offense/defense balance and war. It thus uses
   realism to inform and potentially redirect formal scholarship; it also
   uses formal scholarship to sharpen the logical foundations of realism
   and, in so doing, derive novel empirical predictions. The essay
   concludes by applying this synthesis to the rise of China today and
   indicating directions for deepening the formal/realist synthesis.},

Abstract = {This research attempts to unearth the political nature of Korean liberal
   theology, yet an adjudicative tradition has not been previously studied.
   Amidst the turmoil of the constitutional battles of the 1970s, a group
   of liberal theologians appeared. Cutting through the well-worn claim
   that the nation was the best conceptual vehicle to deliver the Korean
   people's will, they propounded the idea of popular sovereignty.
   Inaugurating a new public theatre of vigorous polyphonic controversy
   about the Korean polity, their novel treatment of the true nature of
   political authority recast the people as a whole as God's agency through
   which He fulfilled his unfolding earthly purposes. In the canon of this
   workmanship model, their juridical recasting of the relation between God
   and his people gave it a contractarian nature. The renewed legal and
   normative substances endowed upon the singular sphere of the individual
   in God's world set out a theoretical proposition for the nascent Korean
   notion of democratic representation ultimately. This marked the birth of
   the Korean political theology. The principle objective of this survey is
   to enter this now-lost intellectual world and glean how it shaped modern
   Korean political thought.},

Abstract = {Public service innovation and New public Management' are two domains of
   research that have been developed independently. However, they share a
   common concept that is `Public service'. To improve the efficiency of
   public services, understanding the public value delivered to citizens is
   essential. Business model innovation allows evaluating the value created
   for consumers and pinpoint exactly citizen's needs and expectations.
   This paper presents a new approach to innovate public services and
   identify opportunities to enhance public service delivery. The 5W1H
   business model allows to analyze public services, how are they created,
   who are their consumers, when and where are they provided and what
   public value are delivered. We support our argument with findings from a
   study conducted by the Moroccan Ministry of Administration and Public
   Service Reform. The results indicate that the classification of public
   services according to the public value is a baseline for improving the
   process of their delivery and the need for serious reflection to
   strengthen the digital transformation of administrative procedures.},

Abstract = {The objective of the paper is to analyse the distribution of funds from
   the Central Government Fund for Local Investments (CGFLI) granted in the
   years 2020-2021 to the communes and districts of the Opolskie province
   in which the German minority (GM) rules in local governments. A
   hypothesis has been formulated that communes and districts governed by
   the GM are not treated as neutral communes in the same sense as
   non-partisan communes governed by local government officials who do not
   represent national political parties, and such communes and districts
   may thus face discrimination in the distribution of funds, similar to
   what has been established in the case of the opposition ``Senate
   Bloc{''}. The hypothesis has proven to be accurate. Compared to
   non-partisan local governments, GM local governments are less likely to
   be supported and receive less in relative terms under the two CGFLI
   competition tranches. GM local governments are also in a worse position
   than Senate bloc local governments.},

Abstract = {The default position in economic psychology is that consumers evaluate
   the fairness of firms' pricing strategies based on a widely shared
   schema of market morality, operationalized by analysing the average
   response within a respondent pool to a given price-change scenario.
   Conversely, drawing on economic and cultural sociology, we argue that
   there are multiple, distinctive schemas that pattern consumers' moral
   evaluation of market pricing practices. We identify distinctive moral
   schemas by replicating and reanalysing scenarios from the foundational
   study of the fairness in pricing field () with a new online survey of
   American adults. Using correlational class analysis, we find respondents
   orient to one of four different configurations of moral judgement about
   price-change fairness: dual-entitlement principles, free-market
   proponents (and opponents), retail-labour domain specificity and
   procedural (un)fairness. This research gives analysts new tools for more
   precisely specifying variation in consumer moral sentiment and raises
   new questions about the causes, consequences and contours of multiple
   market moralities.},

Abstract = {What characterizes the relations amongst actors engaged in
   decarbonization? I posit that no single characteristic can
   satisfactorily explain the heterogeneous politics of reducing emissions
   and propose the concept of styles as the patterned ways in which actors
   relate to each other to decarbonize. Based on qualitative fieldwork, I
   compare two projects for a national policy mandating the use of
   low-carbon technologies - India's Smart Cities Mission - and find
   variation in their styles. In Rajkot, local state, business, and policy
   elites with a variety of interests converged to impose decarbonization
   on a site used by herders as pasture. In Davanagere, local industry,
   workers, state bureaucrats, and experts independently bargained over a
   plan that accommodated livelihoods in a puffed rice manufacturing
   district. I theorize styles as a systematic heuristic to capture
   variation in the politics of reducing emissions and identify surprising
   coalitions for decarbonization.},

Abstract = {Research has shown that policymaking in numerous domestic policies,
   across a multitude of polities, systematically produces a pattern of
   change that matches Punctuated Equilibrium Theory (PET), characterized
   by many incremental and occasional dramatic changes. The field of
   International Relations (IR), however, has paid surprisingly little
   attention to PET, even though the same pattern of change is also found
   in international politics. This study attempts to fill this gap and
   explains stability and change in international politics based on PET.
   Specifically, we detail the dynamics behind this pattern of behavior,
   both at the domestic and the international level, as well as their
   interplay. The empirical section shows that different indicators of
   international politics, including troop deployments, foreign aid and
   international trade, follow a leptokurtic pattern of change, which
   characterizes Punctuated Equilibrium, and whereby changes in countries'
   behavior are generally incremental, representing periods of relative
   stability, and punctuated by large changes that dramatically overthrow
   existing policies. Moreover, our results indicate that policy outputs
   where greater friction is at play are more punctuated than those
   policies that cannot as easily or directly be managed. This study urges
   future research to further explore the dynamics of stability and change
   at the aggregate, international level.},

Abstract = {With emergency powers, President Rodrigo Duterte mobilized and deployed
   military and police to enforce lockdown measures in Metro Manila and
   Cebu City. For several months in 2020, the deployed forces ran
   quarantine control points in borders and city wards, and enforced curfew
   and liquor bans. This article examines how said deployment affected
   civilian control by the President and local civil-military dynamics. The
   heightened visibility of uniformed personnel in these urban spaces, and
   subsequent arrests and detention of quarantine violators came under
   heavy criticism. Against the backdrop of ex-military dominated national
   Inter Agency Task Force for Infectious Diseases (IATF), the militarized
   lockdown failed to stem the virus' spread and expanded the military's
   reach into civilian domain. Its involvement in law enforcement
   operations alongside the police poses dangers to local civil-military
   balance and to democracy. President Duterte's reliance on the state's
   coercive apparatus to carry out the pandemic response enabled him to
   assert control over local governments and to repress dissent.},

Title = {Why are political discussions with fascists impossible? Reflections on
   the far-right politics of silence},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {This paper argues that twentieth-century fascist political theory is
   characterised by the systematic attempt to abolish communication from
   the public realm. By offering a novel reading of one the most systematic
   fascist thinkers, Carl Schmitt, who is compared with Soren Kierkegaard,
   Aristotle, Hannah Arendt, and Walter Benjamin as well as with the
   Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, it is argued that Schmitt's Weimar
   era thought offers a many-sided challenge to the Western tradition of
   political thought. Against the Aristotelian notion of politics as
   rhetorical persuasion and speech, Schmitt mobilises the
   anti-Aristotelian political theorist, Thomas Hobbes, and an array of
   other thinkers for his own purposes in order to redefine ``the
   political{''} as a realm of silence. For Schmitt, and for fascists more
   generally, the realm of the political appears as an arena in which
   absolute and non-negotiable existential truths collide-truths, which
   every political community must necessarily embody in both its
   constitution and spirit. Reinterpreting Schmitt's central works by
   relying on a broad array of rare materials, I maintain that Schmitt's
   famous criterion of the ``the political{''} discloses the crucial moment
   in which communicative speech becomes impossible. It is argued that
   understanding the internal mechanics of twentieth century fascist
   political thought can be highly useful for grasping the momentum that
   especially far-right movements are experiencing today.},

Abstract = {Scholars have found that nonviolent resistance is more effective than
   violence at promoting post-campaign democratization. We explore whether
   this relationship extends to judicial systems, specifically. Courts have
   been shown to be important for promoting and protecting economic
   development and political rights, yet they have been largely ignored in
   quantitative studies of post-conflict democratization. We posit that
   leaders who hold power after domestic unrest will be more inclined to
   use independent courts as a mechanism to prevent future campaigns-but
   they do so primarily when fearing a significant mobilization threat and
   when expecting legal action to be an acceptable channel for dispute
   resolution by dissidents. As such, we anticipate that levels of judicial
   independence are higher following nonviolent campaigns as compared to
   violent conflicts. Using quantitative data from violent and nonviolent
   campaigns globally, we find that judicial independence is indeed higher
   in the aftermath of nonviolent, as compared to violent, resistance
   campaigns. Furthermore, a campaign's outcome does not matter;
   post-conflict judicial independence appears to be associated with
   tactics, not dissident success.},

Abstract = {Education reform has emerged as the main policy priority during the
   global pandemic. Given the effect of education on individual well-being
   and macrolevel socioeconomic growth, countries have undertaken a variety
   of policy measures to offset the negative ramifications of the health
   outbreak on learning processes. This article examines policy conditions
   that shape disparities in education policy and learning outcomes across
   eurozone countries. It argues that sustaining robust education systems
   in the postpandemic era calls for policy initiatives that strengthen
   digital literacy and ensure equitable learning opportunities for all
   student demographics. Examining pre-existing education policy and
   digital literacy, I argue that strengthening partnerships among
   education stakeholders and making efficient use of resources effectively
   sets eurozone countries on a path to education recovery. Policy measures
   that advance the digitalization of learning infrastructures have the
   capacity to increase human capital and narrow postpandemic socioeconomic
   disparities among eurozone countries.},

Abstract = {The rise of `new populism' is commonly explained by two opposing
   approaches known as cultural backlash and economic deprivation. Their
   antagonism perpetuates a dichotomous understanding of economy versus
   identity. This article contributes to scholarly attempts to overcome
   this dichotomy by introducing the concept of economic identity. It
   suggests to bring `the economic' back into culturalist explanations as a
   discursive motif that can be charged with identity and tradition. I
   argue that shared assumptions about what economic practices,
   institutions and conventions appear appropriate for the nation can serve
   the purpose of national identification. A qualitative discourse analysis
   of almost 400 Brexit campaign documents shows that those in favour of
   withdrawal and often considered `populist' did not neglect economic
   arguments. But instead of relying on brute economic calculus, they
   referred to Britain's economic traditions and images of a glorious
   economic past. By linking economic critique of the EU to issues of
   British heritage, Leave made Brexit a question of national economic
   identity-a discursive strategy particularly resonating with those
   economically deprived.},

Abstract = {Deutsche Bank was once an acclaimed US-style investment bank but is now
   struggling. The rise of US finance is often explained as an outcome of
   financial liberalization that motivated other banks to abandon their
   traditional industrial support to chase profit opportunities within
   global securities markets. This story, however, underestimates how the
   transition to US-led financialization was deeply entangled with
   managerial struggles and the contradictions of adopting US financial
   innovations from a peripheral position. By contrast, I use the concept
   of extroverted financialization to portray Deutsche Bank's
   transformation as an outcome of its attempts to integrate new funding
   practices connected to US money markets, called liability management. I
   argue that this process generated a difficult-to-manage business model
   and, ultimately, Deutsche's decline. Because of these extroverted
   strategies, the bank is now caught between opposing logics of banking,
   within neither of which it can regain its previous powerful position.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {AUG 5},
Abstract = {From the US to Italy, from Brazil to Japan, cities from all over the
   world are increasingly vocal on migration issues. Advocating for
   alternative approach to immigrants' welcome, their stand and policies
   may at times be in blunt contradiction with national approaches. This
   paper gives an overview of this new form of urban militancy, its recent
   evolution, its forms, its networks. Drawing on case studies in France,
   Spain and Italy, it seeks to explain why the Mediterranean has been an
   important setting for the politicization of municipal involvement and
   the rise of multi-actor power assemblage of municipalities and voluntary
   organizations.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to assess the involvement of Azerbaijan in the Eastern
   Partnership initiative since 2009. Despite the official ambitions, there
   has been only limited policy performance since. Using the framework of
   the special issue, this paper will try to understand to what extent
   regime type has affected the Eastern Partnership's performance. The
   conceptual focus will be on three dimensions of performance measurement,
   namely relevance, cohesion, and effectiveness, since these are the areas
   where the potential agency of the Azerbaijani government can be most
   visible. The analysis will focus on the policy objectives that were set
   for Azerbaijan, including political association and economic
   integration; enhanced mobility in a secure environment; and sectoral
   cooperation. Concretely, the paper finds that the Eastern Partnership's
   limited performance in relations with Azerbaijan can be seen as
   inevitable from the start, due to the differing policy expectations and
   commitment of authoritarian regimes.},

Abstract = {This study analyses the impact of the relative use of distortionary and
   non-distortionary taxes on economic growth using a panel of Organisation
   for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and a sample
   period of 1980-2015. In particular, we examine whether the impact of
   non-distortionary taxes on economic growth increases with ageing, which
   has increased in western countries over the past 30 years. We do so by
   extending the dataset to include the dramatic change in the demographic
   structure seen in OECD countries since 1990. Using this lengthened data
   range allows us to find a negative effect of distortionary taxation as
   expected. However, our results also show that an increase in
   non-distortionary taxation is negatively associated with growth. This
   study thus argues that recent distortions from non-distortionary
   taxation can be accounted for by the rapid ageing of the population.
   Ideal tax systems are often formulated by economists, but politicians
   cannot always adopt such an ideal tax design because of the risk of
   losing popularity with the electorate. Our analysis could be applied to
   design tax systems that can be implemented in the real world.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyze science diplomacy, for the first time, as a
   new type of political tool that can influence and nurture the
   functioning of presidential diplomacy. We conduct this analysis in the
   context of the global crisis produced by COVID-19, considering the
   struggle to obtain both vaccines and the technology to develop them. We
   discuss the Russian-Argentine relationship during the pandemic emergency
   in the Southern Cone. This case provides a valuable framework to make
   valid recommendations to incorporate and coordinate science diplomacy
   actions concerning presidential diplomacy.},

Title = {Labor Market Policy as Immigration Control: The Case of Temporary
   Protected Status},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {Controlling immigration has become a central political goal in advanced
   democracies. Politicians across the world have experimented with a range
   of policies such as foreign aid in the hopes that aid will spur
   development in migrant origin countries and decrease the demand for
   emigration. We argue that internal policy tools are more effective, in
   particular, the use of policies that allow temporary migrants short-term
   access to host country labor markets. These policies provide migrants an
   opportunity to obtain higher wages, which, in turn, increases
   remittances back to home countries. This increase in financial flows to
   households decreases subsequent demand for migration into destination
   countries. We test this argument using data on migration to the United
   States and find that an increase in remittances from the United States
   decreases subsequent demand for entry in that country. Controlar la
   inmigracion se ha vuelto un objetivo politico central de las democracias
   avanzadas. Los politicos de todo el mundo han experimentado con un
   abanico de politicas, como la asistencia en el extranjero, con miras a
   que la ayuda fomente el desarrollo en los paises de origen de los
   migrantes y reduzca la demanda de emigracion. Sostenemos que las
   herramientas de politica interna son mas efectivas: en particular, el
   uso de politicas que permiten a los migrantes temporales el acceso a
   corto plazo a los mercados laborales del pais de destino. Estas
   politicas brindan a los migrantes la oportunidad de obtener salarios mas
   altos, lo que, a su vez, aumenta las remesas a los paises de origen.
   Este aumento del flujo economico hacia los hogares reduce la subsecuente
   demanda de migracion hacia los paises de destino. Evaluamos este
   argumento con informacion de migraciones a EE. UU. y observamos que el
   aumento de las remesas desde EE. UU. disminuye la demanda de ingreso al
   pais. Le controle de l'immigration est devenu un objectif politique
   central dans les democraties avancees. Des politiciens du monde entier
   ont experimente toute une serie de politiques telles que l'aide
   etrangere dans l'espoir que cette aide stimule le developpement des pays
   d'origine des migrants et reduise la demande d'emigration. Nous
   soutenons que les outils de politique interieure sont plus efficaces, en
   particulier, le recours a des politiques qui dotent les migrants
   temporaires d'd'un acces a court terme aux marches du travail du pays
   d'accueil. Ces politiques donnent l'opportunite aux migrants d'obtenir
   des salaires plus eleves, ce qui, a son tour, augmente les fonds qu'ils
   transferent vers leurs pays d'origine. Cette augmentation des flux
   financiers vers leurs foyers dans leurs pays d'origine diminue la
   demande ulterieure de migration dans les pays de destination. Nous avons
   mis cet argument a l'epreuve a l'aide de donnees sur la migration vers
   les etats-Unis et nous avons constate qu'une augmentation des transferts
   de fonds en provenance des etats-Unis diminuait la demande ulterieure
   d'entree dans ce pays.},

Title = {One without the Other? Prediction and Policy in International Studies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 18},
Abstract = {Salient events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukrainian crisis
   and Russian invasion lead to interest and debate on how research can
   inform policy responses. Research can provide important evidence on the
   potential consequences of different actions with regard to specific
   objectives. However, research conclusions also remain uncertain and
   typically depend on many assumptions. I argue that since policy
   prescriptions entail claims about future consequences, they must be seen
   as predictions. Although prediction is difficult, especially about the
   future, we can have better and more informed discussions about policy
   consequences if we pay attention to what we have learned about
   predictions and predicting better. Moreover, beyond whether predictions
   are ultimately correct or not, it is useful to consider what we can
   learn from them. In some cases, it is more helpful to understand how
   specific inputs influence predictions than to focus only on approaches
   that maximize overall fit. Predictions may not be intended to influence
   policy, but research is more likely to be useful to non-academics if
   presented in a clear and accessible manner. Finally, since the outcomes
   we try to predict depend on policy choices, we can potentially improve
   predictions by thinking about how decisions are made. Acontecimientos
   destacados, como la pandemia de la COVID 19, asi como la crisis en
   Ucrania y la invasion rusa, suscitan el interes y el debate sobre el
   modo en que la investigacion puede suministrar informacion para las
   respuestas en materia de politicas. La investigacion puede proporcionar
   pruebas importantes sobre las posibles consecuencias de diferentes
   acciones con respecto a objetivos especificos, pero, sin embargo, las
   conclusiones de la investigacion siguen siendo inciertas y suelen
   depender de muchos supuestos. Sostenemos que, dado que las
   recomendaciones en materia de politica implican aseveraciones sobre las
   consecuencias futuras, deben considerarse como predicciones. Aunque
   hacer predicciones sea dificil, especialmente sobre el futuro, podemos
   llevar a cabo debates, mejores y mas informados, sobre las consecuencias
   en materia de politicas si prestamos atencion a lo que hemos aprendido
   sobre las predicciones y a hacer mejores predicciones. Ademas, mas alla
   de si las predicciones resultan ser correctas o no, es util considerar
   lo que podemos aprender de ellas. En algunos casos es mas util entender
   como contribuciones concretas influyen en las predicciones que centrarse
   solo en enfoques que maximicen el grado de adecuacion general. Puede que
   las predicciones no se destinen a influir en las politicas, pero es mas
   probable que la investigacion sea mas util para no academicos si se
   presenta de una manera clara y accesible. Por ultimo, puesto que los
   resultados que intentamos predecir dependen de las decisiones en materia
   de politicas, tenemos el potencial para mejorar las predicciones si
   pensamos en como se toman las decisiones. Les evenements d'importance
   majeure tels que la pandemie de COVID-19 ou l'invasion de l'Ukraine par
   la Russie incitent a se pencher sur la maniere dont la recherche peut
   informer les reactions politiques. En effet, la recherche peut fournir
   des preuves cruciales sur les consequences potentielles de diverses
   actions, au regard d'objectifs specifiques. Toutefois, ses conclusions
   demeurent egalement incertaines, et s'appuient generalement sur de
   nombreuses hypotheses.
   J'avance que, dans la mesure ou les mesures politiques impliquent des
   affirmations relatives aux consequences futures, elles doivent etre
   considerees comme des predictions. Or, bien qu'il soit difficile de
   prevoir l'avenir, il devient possible d'avoir des discussions plus
   efficaces et mieux informees en matiere de consequences politiques des
   lors que nous pretons attention a ce que nous savons des predictions, et
   des moyens de les ameliorer. Par ailleurs, au-dela du caractere avere ou
   non des predictions, il est important de reflechir a ce que nous pouvons
   apprendre d'elles. Dans certains cas, il est plus utile de comprendre
   comment des donnees specifiques influencent des predictions plutot que
   de se focaliser sur des approches consistant a optimiser ces dernieres.
   Si les predictions ne doivent pas etre destinees a influencer la
   politique, la recherche a davantage de chances d'etre utile a un public
   non universitaire si elle est presentee d'une maniere a la fois claire
   et accessible. Enfin, dans la mesure ou les consequences que nous
   essayons de prevoir dependent de choix politiques, nous pouvons
   potentiellement ameliorer les predictions en reflechissant a la maniere
   dont les decisions sont prises.},

Abstract = {Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the EU has taken dozens of
   decisions, on which agreement had hitherto been unthinkable due to
   differences between member states. A norms-based approach is used to
   better understand the EU's unexpected agreement on two key measures: the
   sanctions packages against Russia and the decision to allow Ukrainian
   nationals the right to live and work in the EU. Congruence among member
   states over the responsibility to protect Ukrainian civilians from
   atrocity crimes and war crimes played an important role, including the
   obligations to react (sanctions) and to prevent (refugee protection). EU
   actions arising from moral obligations based on rights-based norms have
   been linked closely to values-based norms pertaining to EU solidarity,
   identity, and ethical obligations vis-a-vis fellow Europeans. These
   preliminary findings matter as they suggest an inextricable linkage
   between rights-based norms and values-based norms to trigger effects on
   EU foreign policy.},

Abstract = {This article explores the everyday political economy of the Catholic
   World Youth Day in Panama, which was organized in January 2019. The aim
   is to shed more light on the relationship between the market and the
   religious sphere and, in particular, on the everyday experience of the
   WYD participants, and their encounters with the market and market
   practices. In doing so, the article challenges several commonly held
   assumptions, such as the priority of religious doctrine over everyday
   practices and the belief that the religious sphere is one-sidedly
   colonized by the market. Instead, the article shows that in this case,
   the interactions between the church and the market played out
   differently in three different areas - the discursive critique of the
   market by the Church leaders, the Church's incorporation of market
   practices in its activities and the alliance between the local Catholic
   organizers and businesses. In the end, the complex interactions between
   the participants, businesses, discourses, spaces and technologies gave
   rise to a unique sacred-market network which blurred and at times
   entirely erased the difference between the religious sphere and the
   market.},

Title = {Protecting the Ingroup? Authoritarianism, Immigration Attitudes, and
   Affective Polarization},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {What makes people affectively polarized? Affective polarization is based
   on the idea that partisanship can be a social identity leading to
   polarization in the form of intergroup distancing between the own party
   and the other parties. In this study, we argue that perceived threats
   from an outgroup can spur affective polarization. To investigate this,
   we use the issue of immigration, often framed as a threat by right-wing
   groups, to examine whether individual-level differences influence how
   sensititivity to the perception of immigration as a threat. One such
   factor is the trait right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), which is
   characterized by emphasis on submission to authority and upholding norms
   of social order. The emphasis among individuals with this trait on
   protecting the ingroup from threats means that negativity toward
   immigration is likely to extend toward political opponents, resulting in
   an increase in affective polarization. Thus, we hypothesize that the
   affective polarization is likely to increase when individuals interpret
   immigration as threatening, particularly for the individuals who are
   high in RWA aggression. We evaluate and find support for this claim
   using a large-scale survey performed in Sweden (N = 898). The results,
   showing a conditional effect of immigration attitudes on affective
   polarization, are consistent across three commonly used measures of
   affective polarization as follows: trait ratings, a social distance
   measure, and feeling thermometers. Overall, our results show that it is
   important to consider intergroup threats and intergroup differences in
   the context of sensitivity to such threats when explaining affective
   polarization.},

Abstract = {Research has documented gender inequalities in parental financial gifts,
   but it is unclear under which conditions these inequalities are socially
   accepted. We combine distributive justice theory with sociological and
   economic perspectives on intergenerational transfers to examine
   perceptions of fair allocations of parental gifts. By manipulating
   children's characteristics in a multifactorial vignette experiment, we
   conducted in Germany in 2020 (N = 4284 observations of 714 respondents),
   we test the prevalence and gendered application of four justice
   principles (equality, need, entitlement and equity). While the equality
   principle was widespread, unequal gifts were legitimized both by
   children's financial needs (unemployment) and exchange services (helping
   in parents' household). These results indicate that the family is
   perceived as an agency for economic redistribution, potentially
   affecting society's socio-economic structure. Moreover, exchange
   services weighed more for sons while needs weighed more for daughters,
   suggesting that gendered fairness perceptions are one possible mechanism
   explaining gender inequalities in financial gifts.},

Abstract = {Exhumations were considered part of the Peruvian State's reparation
   policies to victims of the internal armed conflict. On the basis of an
   in-depth ethnography conducted in Andean peasant communities, this
   article analyses the forced nature of certain exhumations done in
   post-TRC Peru and the doubts cast on the testimonies of the surviving
   victims. This essay posits that the exhumed body has become a site for
   the production of ``truth{''} in a context in which the recipients of
   economic reparations have the veracity of their testimonies questioned,
   and at times are deemed fraudulent. Through the analyse of the
   bureaucratic implementation of exhumations and of their effects on an
   intimate level, its demonstrates how State-controlled exhumation
   policies continue its historic requirement of Andean peasantry
   submission when any socio-economic aid is provided. This article
   highlights the paradoxes of reparation policies that produce a
   institutional violence forms of discrimination against the Andean
   peasantry.},

Abstract = {Recently, an unexpected public actor has joined climate activists'
   forces: central banks increasingly care about and act on climate change.
   Their (potential) contribution to the climate-neutral economy is
   immense, as they possess vast institutional resources to influence
   investment in the economy. Central banks' advocacy is puzzling, as they
   put their legitimacy at risk by stepping outside their mandates and area
   of expertise. To explore this puzzle, I study why and how climate change
   came on the agenda of the Dutch central bank, one of the first movers
   among central banks. By opening the black box of organizational politics
   within central banks and building on unique interview data, I show how
   the policy shift of the Dutch central bank can be traced back to a small
   group of policy-seeking staff. This process-tracing case study
   contributes to our understanding of transformative change in climate
   policy in particular and public policy more generally.},

Abstract = {This article reviews literature on six actor groups engaged in domestic
   mitigation governance. It evaluates the usefulness of three climate
   governance models: market failure, socio-technological transition and
   public support. For each group, three modes of action are considered:
   influencing, decision-making and implementing. The public support model
   is found to best capture the wide range of actors and real-world,
   complex participation patterns of domestic climate governance. The
   socio-technological transitions and market failure models in their
   narrow focus on political and business actors ignore the influencing
   roles of other groups, such as climate advocacy organizations,
   anti-climate action groups, Indigenous people's organizations and labor
   unions. However, they offer more insight on actor engagement in
   decision-making and implementation, roles mostly ignored by the public
   support model. Overall, more systematic comparative research is needed
   on a wider range of actors, on domestic climate governance in the global
   South, on differences across countries, sectors and policy domains and
   on interactions between actors.},

Abstract = {The growth of the American financial services remains a bit of a puzzle.
   The standard approach, the deregulation hypothesis, posits that the
   industry expanded in response to national deregulation. Yet, when viewed
   in a comparative context, US finance was deregulated significantly less
   than other national financial systems and yet grew significantly more
   than most. We propose the global deregulation hypothesis as a solution
   to this puzzle. The hypothesis posits that American finance grew in
   response to deregulation in Europe and the emerging market economies.
   The article develops two theoretical mechanisms that link global
   deregulation to US financialization. It reports statistical tests that
   support two central implications of the global deregulation hypothesis.
   First, global deregulation is positively associated with the growth of
   US financial services, while US deregulation is not. Second, global
   deregulation is not systematically related to the growth of financial
   services in other industrial democracies.},

Abstract = {Turbulence appears to be a ``new normal{''} in current societies, and
   public organizations need to learn how to react and adapt to it.
   Scholars agree on the need for robust actions to respond to turbulence.
   Through a qualitative comparative analysis performed on the vaccination
   campaigns of all 20 Italian regions, our paper explores whether
   different and alternative models of robustness may exist to cope with
   turbulence. Results shed light on three alternative models featuring
   static, hybrid, and dynamic robustness. They also highlight that robust
   governance appears to involve a capacity to learn, and to employ this
   learning as circumstances demand.},

Abstract = {The imagination is at the heart of what it means to be human. For this
   reason, it has been the subject of close examination across time and
   locale. Yet, while international relations (IR) researchers often
   mobilize the term rhetorically, its character and operations remain
   underconceptualized in the discipline and disconnected from the rich
   literatures that explore this vital faculty. This article identifies a
   commonsense account of the imagination in IR's most pervasive discourse
   on order and anarchy. Taking its cues from the Hobbesian tradition, here
   a distinctly monological imagination is fearful and pessimistic, rooted
   in the overriding dread of a sudden and violent death. We draw out its
   underlying assumptions by foregrounding the deliberate, systematic, and
   sustained construction of the imagination in Hobbes' Leviathan, where it
   acts as a crucial and animating impetus for the Hobbesian subject,
   including in the oft-analogized ``state of nature{''} scenario. We argue
   that this Hobbesian imagination has been superseded by a
   multidisciplinary contemporary scholarship that presents a markedly
   different view. Anyone thinking seriously about the imagination today
   should disagree with the Hobbesian account, reconsider theories of
   international relations predicated on it, and explore the political
   possibilities entailed in other approaches.},

Title = {Theorizing Public Performances for International Negotiations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {This article theorizes how public performances matter in international
   negotiations. Studies of international negotiations are predominantly
   focused on power-political instruments in use around the negotiating
   table. I argue that public communication cannot be dismissed as cheap
   talk but that it plays a constitutive role in and on international
   negotiations. Contributing to the international relations (IR)
   literature on negotiations, the article suggests an orientation toward
   an increasingly important aspect of international negotiations in a
   hypermediated world political context, namely public performances that
   challenge the distinction between domestic signaling and claim-making
   toward negotiating parties. Hypermediated negotiations mean that much of
   what goes on in IR is spread to large audiences in new and emerging
   digital sites in near real time. Actors use public performances to
   define and legitimize their desired visions for negotiating outcomes. As
   public performances, these are power-political instruments in and of
   themselves, part of the array of tactics that states turn to when
   competing for influence in international negotiations. The theorization
   is illustrated with an example from the UK-EU Brexit negotiations. The
   illustration is a qualitative Twitter analysis that shows the
   performative toolbox in use, as well as the importance of public
   performances themselves in the endgame of the Brexit negotiations.},

Abstract = {Sex segregation is a socio-cultural norm associated with symbolic,
   rhetorical, and institutional power in Saudi Arabia. It was established
   by the extremist discourses prevalent in the Kingdom from the 1970s to
   2010s. This study argues that the public pedagogy of patriarchal
   sex-segregated society transforms into a biased form of identity,
   referred to as `sexagogy' in this study. While individuals in a
   sex-segregated society are born, raised, and publicly `pedagogized' to
   fear the opposite sex, some individuals have been exposed to educational
   and technological opportunities, whereby they can interact freely with
   each other and cross boundaries intended to segregate the sexes. This
   study investigates how members of Saudi academia relate to gender
   segregation and how the Sahwa-an extreme religious discourse preventing
   Saudi women from any natural interaction and socialization-has faded
   amidst the recent changes in the Saudi Kingdom's vision. The researcher
   used qualitative methodology and snowball sampling, interviewing 72
   Saudi academics who have lived through the Sahwa period and witnessed
   the recent changes in the Kingdom. The interviews revealed that the
   power of the Sahwa discourse has been fading and that the younger

Abstract = {The central part of the scientific article is the analysis of the
   problem of the admissibility of modifications of public procurement
   contracts and concession contracts. After the awarding of a concession
   or a public procurement contract, these may not be substantially changed
   by an agreement between the contracting authority and the successful
   tenderer. The research is initially focused to an analysis of the
   development of the legal institute in the case law of the Court of
   Justice and its transposition into secondary legislation of the European
   Union. This is followed by a comparison of the regulation in the acquis
   communautaire with the regulation in Slovenian positive law. The
   problems of the admissibility of modifications to public procurement
   contracts/concessions (this is the central part of the article) should
   be supplemented by formulating a thesis on the possible extension of
   comparable standards of interpretation of admissibility from the
   contractual (implementation) to the tendering stage of public
   procurement/concession. In this scientific paper, I therefore point out
   (which was the purpose of the scientific paper) the hypothesis that all
   modifications in public procurement procedures and concession award
   procedures must be treated equally, regardless of the stage a
   relationship creation or implementation process. A different position
   would be administrative and contrary to the necessary functional
   interpretation of EU law. The modification cannot becomes admissible at
   the time of the conclusion of the contract, while prior to that, this
   modification (which would already form part of the contractual
   relationship) is not admissible.},

Abstract = {The last decades have seen an increse in the number of studies that
   investigate the factors that make cities attractive. This was also the
   initial aim of the present study. However, the initial results were
   striking. Cities that do not possess the characteristics that are
   usually attributed to attractive cities were ranked among the most
   attractive ones in Romania. Thus, it became evident that the first step
   should be to determine which is the most appropriate measure of
   attractiveness in the Romanian context. The results show that in Romania
   the historical and legal context, as well as the current way in which
   official data are provided affect the reliability of well-known measures
   of city attractiveness. More specifically, international migrants who
   regain their citizenship artificially inflate the data regarding
   population growth and migration for cities in the Easter part of the
   country. The study provides recommendations for improving the capacity
   of municipalities to take evidence-based decisions.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the vast number of people who make global
   governance happen. It probes the role of the unknown people in the
   ``middle{''} who are largely absent from scholarly gaze: professionals,
   service teams, and others who act behind the scenes. They are not at the
   top of public and private organizations ({''}global governors{''} in the
   literature), but they keep the lights on. They accomplish the policy,
   operational, and support work to move the needle of global governance
   institutions of all varieties from the local to global. These largely
   invisible and unheard populations - at least in the scholarly and policy
   literatures - make global governance work. The ``missing middle{''} is
   not confined to the everyday contributions of professionals in
   intergovernmental secretariats because contemporary global governance is
   not synonymous with international organization, but concerns networked
   forms of public authority that may or may not include secretariats or
   states.},

Abstract = {This article will consider the ways states have exercised imperialism
   over Antarctica, focusing on two methods: the use of administrative acts
   and control over scientific research and resources. The article will
   then compare the Outer Space Treaty and the Antarctic Treaty System
   around these two methods, as well as the use of military capabilities as
   an important aspect of imperial control, to question whether space law
   prohibits imperialism. The Outer Space Treaty seeks to prevent the
   militarisation of space, the unequal use of resources and claims of
   sovereignty. However, given the methods of imperialism on Antarctica and
   the underdevelopment of space law, this kind of imperialism may also be
   exercised in outer space. It will argue that while formal sovereignty
   claims are prevented, de facto exclusive claims are not. The
   establishment of permanent bases under the jurisdiction of the sender
   state, and the commercial opportunities presented by scientific research
   and the exploitation of resources create incentives for the use of the
   military which is also not satisfactorily regulated by international
   space law.},

Abstract = {Cooperation between two terrorist groups benefits both, but there are
   also risks. This paper focuses on these risks, especially how the demise
   of one group affects the longevity of the remaining groups. Using a
   generalized equation estimations (GEE) model with data from the Global
   Terrorism Database (GTD) from 2001 to 2016, this paper analyses how the
   disbanding of one partner terrorist group with the same ideology and
   regime type affects the longevity of the remaining groups in a
   cooperative relationship. The results indicate that when a partnering
   terrorist group with religious ideology ceases to exist, remaining
   groups have a better chance of survival as compared to those with other
   ideologies. In addition, when two groups are based in democratic nations
   and one partner disbands, the remaining group is more likely to disband.
   Moreover, if collaborating groups operate under different regime types
   and one group disbands, the remaining terrorist groups are less likely
   to disband as compared to those groups operating under regimes of the
   same type.},

Abstract = {Purpose Using the job-demands resources model as a guide, this study
   aims to expand the understanding of the boundary conditions of the
   relation between experienced incivility and instigated incivility. The
   authors do so by focusing on the unique forms of instigated incivility:
   hostility, gossip, exclusionary behavior and privacy invasion. Drawing
   from past research, the authors focus on the personal resources of
   agreeableness and conscientiousness as individual difference boundary
   conditions, and the job demands and resources of workload and perceived
   emotional social support, respectively, as job-related boundary
   conditions. Design/methodology/approach The authors test their
   hypotheses using two-wave survey data collected from 192 customer
   service workers and hierarchical moderated multiple regression. Findings
   Analyses reveal that the relation between experienced incivility and
   gossip, a distinct type of instigated incivility, is stronger for those
   who are higher in agreeableness and perceived emotional social support,
   and weaker for those who report experiencing higher levels of workload.
   Originality/value This research advances knowledge on incivility by
   focusing on unique forms of instigated incivility, as opposed to
   instigated incivility broadly, as outcomes of experienced incivility. In
   doing so, this research adds nuance to recent findings surrounding the
   moderating role of personality in the experienced incivility and
   instigated incivility relation. The authors also report novel findings
   surrounding the influence of key job demands and resources.},

Abstract = {This article advances an interdisciplinary and multifactorial
   socio-cultural approach to the fascistization of the Ustasa in interwar
   Yugoslavia, leading to terrorism and racial cleansing. It concentrates
   on the life-trajectories of Mijo Babic and Zvonimir Pospisil, two
   nationalist activists notoriously known as the first Ustasa terrorists.
   Drawing on the previously unknown political memoirs of Pospisil and
   Babic, the article argues that the two activists bridged several phases
   of cumulative radicalization in the Ustasa organization, from the
   adoption of political violence at the grass-root level in the 1920s to
   international terrorism in the 1930s and then state-sponsored genocide
   in the first half of the 1940s. The article points out that Ustasa
   underwent most forms of political radicalization to terrorism identified
   by McCauley and Moskalenko (2008), but it also adds to their typology a
   case of radicalization to mass violence in the regime phase. Ustasa's
   trajectory thus illustrates a rare process of transition from the
   radicalization of an oppositional, non-state group to mass
   radicalization leading to racial genocidal policies under a
   fascist-totalitarian regime. It is hoped that the biographical approach
   to radicalization advanced by the article contributes to a better
   understanding of politically motivated terrorism and mass violence in
   post-1918 Europe.},

Abstract = {This article aims to illuminate the links between culture and class in
   the post-socialist years in the Czech Republic. To this end, it
   considers the reception of two music acts-the country folk duo Bratri
   Nedvedi in the 1990s and the ``nationalist rock{''} band Ortel in the
   2010s-and discusses the labeling of their fans based on their social
   class profiles. My analysis draws on mainstream Czech media coverage of
   these acts, materials reflecting fans' perspectives, and broader
   scholarly debates about the links between music consumption and social
   class. One similarity between these bands lay in their decision to
   forsake their original subcultural fans for a more mainstream audience.
   A second commonality relates to the dismissal of their mainstream fans
   by cultural elites, who saw them as backward and out of step with the
   norms of liberal democracy and Western capitalism. These critics often
   described these types of Czech music as lowbrow and regressive.
   Meanwhile, the two bands continued to insist that they were making songs
   for ``ordinary people{''} rather than elites: their fan bases, while not
   homogenous, remained largely working class. This study considers key
   intersections between class, age, ethnicity, and gender in Czech
   post-socialist society. I argue that certain kinds of local musical
   taste reflect class differences, which are further shaped by age,
   gender, and political orientation.},

Abstract = {In this article, we nuance the relationships between political agency,
   victimhood, and gender during armed conflicts. Dominant narratives often
   spotlight individuals as either passive victims or active agents. These
   representations are especially pronounced for sexual violence against
   women in conflict, where gendered conceptions of victimhood and agency
   remain particularly salient. Recent scholarship challenges this
   dichotomized way of thinking, showing how victimhood and agency sit
   alongside each other. We extend this growing body of scholarship by
   proposing a relational conception of agency that helps us better
   understand exactly how victimhood and agency intersect and can even be
   co-constitutive. Specifically, we propose that conceptualizing agency as
   relational-to others, to contextual structures, to own vulnerabilities
   and prior victimization-is particularly well suited to overcome
   inadequate dichotomizations, and to illuminate the spectrum of political
   agency, ranging from formalized politicized spaces to more mundane forms
   of agency within the quotidian. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork in
   Colombia and Uganda, we empirically tease out these complex
   intersections in a context of (gendered) vulnerability.},

Title = {Right-Wing Authoritarianism and Antipathy Toward Immigrants and Sexual
   Minorities in the Early Days of the Coronavirus Pandemic in Italy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Theory and research in social, evolutionary, and political psychology
   indicates that subjective feelings of threat and exposure to objectively
   threatening circumstances-including pandemic diseases-may contribute to
   increased affinities for political conservatism, right-wing
   authoritarianism, and prejudice against out-group members. We
   investigated these possibilities in the context of Italy, which was the
   first Western country to be severely affected by the spread of COVID-19.
   Early on in the pandemic, from March 3-8, 2020, we surveyed 757 Italian
   adults ranging in age from 18 to 78 years. Results revealed that
   antipathy toward immigrants and sexual minorities was predicted by
   (male) sex, COVID-19 anxiety, RWA, and political distrust. Furthermore,
   COVID-19 anxiety magnified the effect of RWA on disliking of immigrants
   and sexual minorities (but not obese or disabled people). Contrary to
   prediction, political trust failed to attenuate the effects of COVID-19
   anxiety or RWA on out-group antipathy. Implications for the theories of
   right-wing authoritarianism and political ideology as motivated social
   cognition, as well as the state of contemporary Italian politics are
   discussed.},

Title = {Sustaining Capitalism and Democracy: Lessons from Global Competition
   Policy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Competition policy has been a central forum for contesting the uneasy
   relationship between capitalism and democracy since the late nineteenth
   century. From the earliest policy debates, concerns that robust
   competition policies aimed at limiting economic concentration would
   disadvantage domestic producers featured prominently. This dynamic
   creates an international cooperation problem over competition policy
   that has intensified with the dramatic increases in globalization over
   the last several decades. Understanding the causes and consequences of
   this cooperation problem is central to understanding global governance
   of the world economy, including the ability of democratic states to
   manage global capitalism in a manner that sustains democracy. This essay
   frames the challenge that global competition policy has posed over the
   last hundred years and argues that democratic major powers have played a
   critical role in shaping the limited cooperation that has been achieved.
   A research agenda that develops integrated theories of domestic and
   international competition policymaking as well as a multi-method
   empirical agenda for describing and explaining policy outcomes and their
   consequences for economic inequality, growth, and democracy is an
   essential task for international relations scholars.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to explore the factors whereby some
   international organizations (IOs) are more effective than others in
   international mediation and proposes three types of hypotheses through
   combining quantitative and qualitative analysis. First, IOs with greater
   institutional capabilities for gathering, exchanging and disseminating
   conflict-related information are more likely to mediate effectively. IO
   bias is another factor of influence in this regard. Second, IOs with
   greater institutional capabilities for deploying field missions and
   guaranteeing agreement are more likely to mediate effectively and
   maintain durable peace. Third, IOs with higher amounts of leverage are
   more likely to mediate effectively. Design/methodology/approach The
   study establishes two data sets: one on interstate conflict; the other
   on intrastate conflict, thus to cover as many research samples as
   possible and avoid sampling bias. Findings Results of the statistical
   analysis indicate that no matter interstate or intrastate conflict, IOs
   with higher institutional capabilities for diplomatic interventions are
   more likely to bring conflict parties to an agreement and thereafter
   maintain short-term peace. IOs with higher institutional capabilities
   for economic sanctions are similarly effective. Furthermore, IOs with
   greater institutional capabilities for field mission deployment mediate
   more effectively, whether in facilitating peace agreements or
   maintaining short-term and long-term peace after the agreement. IO bias
   and preference, however, have no significant impact on mediation
   effectiveness. Research limitations/implications This study has made no
   in-depth explorations of such existing and important research areas as
   different third-party comparisons of the mediation effect. Practical
   implications This paper attempts to make some contributions to the topic
   of mediation effectiveness through applying a bargaining model to the
   research and performing a statistical analysis based on both an
   interstate conflict data set and an intrastate conflict data set.
   Originality/value This paper provides an in-depth causal analysis and
   thoroughgoing comparison of the effectiveness of IOs in both interstate
   conflicts and intrastate conflicts.},

Abstract = {Emerging technologies permeate and potentially disrupt a wide spectrum
   of our social, economic, and political relations. Various state
   institutions, including education, law enforcement, and healthcare,
   increasingly rely on technical components, such as automated
   decision-making systems, e-government systems, and other digital tools
   to provide cheap, efficient public services, and supposedly fair,
   transparent, disinterested, and accountable public administration. The
   increased interest in various blockchain-based solutions from central
   bank digital currencies, via tokenized educational credentials, and
   distributed ledger-based land registries to self-sovereign identities is
   the latest, still mostly unwritten chapter in a long history of
   standardized, objectified, automated, technocratic, and technologized
   public administration. The rapid, (often) unplanned, and uncontrolled
   technologization of public services (as happened in the hasty adoption
   of distance-learning and teleconferencing systems during Corona Virus
   Disease (COVID) lockdowns) raises complex questions about the use of
   novel technological components, which may or may not be ultimately
   adequate for the task for which they are used. The question whether we
   can trust the technical infrastructures the public sector uses when
   providing public services is a central concern in an age where trust in
   government is declining: If the government's artificial intelligence
   system that detects welfare fraud fails, the public's confidence in the
   government is ultimately hit. In this paper, we provide a critical
   assessment of how the use of potentially untrustworthy (private)
   technological systems including blockchain-based systems in the public
   sector may affect trust in government. We then propose several policy
   options to protect the trust in government even if some of their
   technological components prove fundamentally untrustworthy.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there have been multiple calls for public
   administration scholars to adopt an intersectional approach to the study
   of diversity within public organizations. This paper empirically
   examines the simultaneous influence of multiple dimensions of individual
   identity on employee burnout. We advance a better understanding of
   disparities in individual well-being outcomes for public servants. Using
   conservation of resource (COR) theory and applied intersectionality, we
   systematically measure and model differential vulnerabilities to
   emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and loss of personal
   accomplishment for individuals at the intersection of gender, racial,
   and generational identities. Using survey data on local government
   employees across two neighboring large cities in California, we use
   ordinary least squares and ordered logit models to estimate the impact
   of intersectional identities on different dimensions of burnout. Our
   results show that younger generations of women of color are particularly
   vulnerable to burnout, but the experience of burnout is not uniform
   across groups, with each dimension of burnout revealing different
   vulnerable groups. These findings highlight the importance of
   deconstructing burnout into its discrete dimensions to better understand
   the experience of different socio-demographic groups of employees and
   develop culturally competent strategies to better support an
   increasingly diverse public workforce.},

Abstract = {Do more protesters on the streets make governments likely to grant their
   demands? Several studies link protest size and government concessions.
   Yet existing research has limitations: many studies suffer from
   potential endogeneity due to potential protesters joining protests when
   they anticipate that concessions are likely, causal mechanisms are often
   unclear, and many of the most rigorous event-level studies are limited
   to Western democracies. We reexamine this relationship in a non-Western
   sample using a novel instrumental variable approach, using Fridays as an
   instrument for exogenous variation in protest size in predominately
   Muslim countries. We perform two analyses: one using the NAVCO 3.0
   dataset, and the second using the Mass Mobilization in Autocracies
   Dataset (MMAD). In both analyses exogenous variation in protest size
   negatively affects the likelihood of concessions. Larger protests are
   less likely to receive government concessions. We suggest these
   surprising results point to the importance of unanticipated protests
   that produce new information about regime stability to motivate
   government concessions.},

Title = {Belgium's `Truth Commission' on its overseas colonial legacy: An
   expressivist analysis of transitional justice in consolidated
   democracies},

Abstract = {In the summer of 2020, the Belgian Parliament established a Special
   Parliamentary Commission tasked with launching an enquiry into Belgium's
   overseas colonial legacy and reflecting on appropriate reparations. It
   was the first consolidated democracy to establish a truth commission to
   investigate the historical and ongoing injustices related to overseas
   colonialism. In this article, I argue in favor of treating this
   commission as a truth commission and focus on the extra-legal and
   expressivist functions of truth commissions to understand potential
   long-term and indirect effects of this initiative. The central premise
   is that justice processes can shape and create meaning systems that gain
   the status of ``truth{''} and can come to dominate how we understand and
   organize ourselves and our social world. In the descriptive section, I
   use primary sources to examine the genesis, mandate, composition, first
   steps, and reception of the commission's work, foregrounding critical
   voices. In the analytical section, I examine whether the commission is
   indeed furthering a thick kind of accountability or whether, instead, it
   risks cementing and contributing to epistemic injustices. As such, the
   article provides a detailed overview of a commission that has been
   scantly covered in academic literature, as well as contributing to the
   debate about potentially unforeseen effects of using transitional
   justice processes such as truth commissions in consolidated democracies.},

Abstract = {Neoliberal economics has reshaped societies. How did this doctrine
   ascend? While existing explanations emphasize a variety of factors, one
   neglected aspect is intellectual rivalry within the US economics
   profession. Neoliberalism had to attain prestige against the grain of
   the intelligentsia prior to becoming a force to organize political
   power. Using qualitative and quantitative evidence, we examine key
   rivals in US economics from 1960 to 1985: the Chicago School of
   Economics, neoliberal pioneers and the `Charles River Group' (Harvard
   University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), the
   mainstream Keynesian stronghold. We identify socialization mechanisms
   from historical accounts, which suggest forms of social cohesion between
   elite professors and their students. We measure social cohesion and
   network structure from salient relations within and between generations,
   using a new a dataset focused on elite economics professors and their
   graduate students. What differentiated the Chicago School from Charles
   River was its fostering of social cohesion and its effective
   transmission of value orientations across generations.},

Abstract = {Decades of research has explored the political consequences of religious
   identities, practices, and beliefs. This article describes new research
   that has reversed the causal arrow to look at the religious consequences
   of partisanship and political outlooks. The first part of the article
   describes the current religious-political landscape, in which religious
   Americans are more likely to be Republicans and less religious Americans
   are more likely to be Democrats. The article then goes on to introduce
   key theories and findings explaining how politics helped produce this
   religiosity gap. After discussing avenues for future research in this
   area, the article switches gears to describe other ways politics can
   shape religious choices, including pushing evangelical Republicans out
   of churches and encouraging short-term fluctuations in religious
   engagement. The article concludes with a brief discussion of how the
   study of religion and politics is fundamentally different on account of
   politics' ability to both shape and be shaped by religion.},

   Unrest},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented social and
   political challenges. Mitigation strategies often disrupt the daily
   lives of citizens and constrain rights and privileges. Policies intended
   to contain disease spread have provoked resentment, resistance, and
   backlash. We examine the extent to which specific COVID-19 policy
   responses influence the frequency of civil unrest. Combining insights
   from both grievance and opportunity models of dissent, we contend that
   pandemic-response policies are most likely to lead to unrest when the
   grievances and opportunities created by disease-mitigation strategies
   reinforce each other. We test our arguments with nuanced information on
   specific pandemic-mitigation policies, combined with geolocated events
   data on COVID-19-related social unrest activities. We find that policies
   such as workplace and school closures, which induce intense grievances
   and reduce the opportunity cost of engaging in collective mobilization,
   are associated with increases in dissent activities. Policies that
   restrict opportunities for mobilization, such as restrictions on public
   transportation, reduce the number of dissent activities. Notably,
   economic support policies attenuate the effects of workplace closures on
   dissent. Our results illustrate the varying effects of
   pandemic-mitigation policies on unrest depending on how the grievances
   they inspire relate to the opportunity they create.},

Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {461-482},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {For decades, independent regulatory agencies were considered
   undemocratic because of their independence from political control.
   However, regulatory agencies are increasingly developing practices and
   organisational designs that reflect the sharing of power with external
   actors, thereby enhancing their democratic qualities. While scholars
   have studied these qualities, namely transparency, participation,
   representation and accountability, a comprehensive measure by which
   these qualities can be measured and compared has not yet been developed.
   This article fills that gap by developing indicators to measure
   mandatory and voluntary democratic qualities following a qualitative
   analysis of six regulatory agencies. It contributes to the study of
   regulation and public administration more broadly by advancing a
   research agenda that illuminates the role of bureaucracies in promoting
   pluralistic or majoritarian democratic values.},

Abstract = {This comparative study analyzes the impact of the Great Recession on
   household non-employment across Europe since 2008. We use the EU-SILC
   (2007-2014) for a shift-share analysis that decomposes annual variations
   in household non-employment in 30 European countries. Investigating
   whether job loss is absorbed by or accumulated in households, we break
   down non-employment variations into changes in individual
   non-employment, household compositions and polarization. We find that
   household joblessness increased since 2008, especially in crisis-ridden
   countries. There is no evidence for the widespread absorption of
   individual non-employment in families or multi-person households.
   Instead, household dynamics and unequal distribution of non-employment
   lead to further risk accumulation within households during the crisis.
   Surprisingly, this pattern occurs in those crisis-ridden countries known
   for their traditional household structures and less accommodating
   welfare systems, which have relied thus far on families to absorb
   employment risks. The Great Recession has aggravated household
   disparities in joblessness in Europe.},

Abstract = {Purpose A dynamic and changing international business environment and
   higher needs for innovation have increased the importance of creativity
   in organizations. Organizations need creative employees to develop new
   methods and procedures that stimulate innovation. However, prior
   research indicates that employees are sometimes passive and avoid
   engaging in creative behavior. To promote individual creative behavior,
   this study aims to better understand the role of task conflict and
   conflict management. More specifically, the authors draw on Deutsch's
   conflict theory of cooperation and competition to test whether an
   employee's conflict management moderates the indirect relationship
   between task conflict and creativity through cooperation.
   Design/methodology/approach To test the hypotheses, the authors
   conducted a three-phase survey study with 428 employees from different
   German organizations. Findings The results suggest that task conflict
   has only a positive indirect relationship with creativity through
   cooperation with teammates when employees avoid a competitive conflict
   management style. Originality/value The authors draw on Deutsch's
   conflict theory of cooperation and competition to integrate research on
   task conflict and conflict management, allowing them to explain why and
   when task conflict with teammates influences an employee's creativity.
   The findings show that task conflict is particularly beneficial for
   cooperation and creativity if employees avoid closed-minded discussions
   and competitive interactions with coworkers.},

Abstract = {Critical security studies examine how everyday life is affected or
   transformed by practices that militarise civil society. This article
   addresses one such area: qualitative changes in the openness and
   transparency of public administration, instating a mode of suspicion and
   secrecy. The article is based on interviews and observations in the area
   of the total defence in Sweden, where we during three years encountered
   challenges in gaining access to authorities that initially welcomed
   participation of researchers, but progressively became inaccessible. We
   use these experiences to reflect on both methodological issues and wider
   implications for the securitisation of civil society. The article
   concludes that difficulties in gaining access to the field may itself
   serve as valuable data in understanding the changing condition of public
   administration in a time of militarisation.},

Title = {Is the Public Backlash against Globalization a Backlash against
   Legalization and Judicialization?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Many of the most visible examples of the backlash against
   multilateralism, globalization, and democracy do not target free trade,
   investment, or elections directly, but the judicial institutions that
   were created to protect the rights of traders, investors, and citizens.
   Is the backlash against globalization and democracy really a backlash
   against the growing ideological convergence on rule of law principles as
   appropriate standards for both international and domestic governance?
   This essay suggests that this might be so by highlighting that the rule
   of law does not just constrain the powerful, but also majoritarian
   politics. A new domestic ideological cleavage permeates many liberal
   democracies that is in part about liberal conceptions of justice. An
   illustrative empirical analysis shows that illiberal views about justice
   are negatively and significantly correlated with trust in European
   institutions.},

Abstract = {Climate change politics is a key area where the EU demonstrates an
   ambition for global leadership. Yet, analysts and practitioners point to
   significant disconnections between the EU's discourse and practice in
   this area. In what particular ways do these disconnections occur? This
   article uses the concepts of `organised hypocrisy' and `organisational
   facades' to address this question. Offering a framework to analyse the
   EU's talk, decisions, and actions in climate diplomacy, these two
   concepts provide a nuanced understanding of the way in which the Union
   handles conflicting demands from strategic actors in global climate
   politics. This article argues that engaging in hypocrisy by portraying
   different facets of the Union has been a primary way in which the EU has
   managed to adapt its negotiation positions in climate diplomacy by
   addressing conflicting external conditions.},

Title = {PARLIAMENTARY PRIMARIES AFTER DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS: EXPLAINING REFORMS
   TO CANDIDATE SELECTION IN GHANA},

Abstract = {Candidate selection procedures play a crucial role in shaping
   parliaments and influencing the quality of democracy. Yet, our
   understanding of what motivates parties to reform candidate selection
   mechanisms at specific points in time is limited. To address this gap,
   we examine the experience of Ghana's National Democratic Congress (NDC),
   which reformed its selection procedures in 2015 allowing all party
   members to vote in primary elections for parliamentary candidates. We
   ask what triggered these reforms and identify four motivations-the
   confluence of which explains why the reforms were adopted in 2015. These
   motivations were: making the party more democratic by expanding
   participation, reducing the cost of the primary process, building the
   party's organizational capacity, and keeping up with the party's main
   competitor. Together, these led NDC leaders to believe that reforms
   would benefit the party. However, a divergence between actual and
   intended effects meant some of these benefits were not realized, so the
   NDC reversed its reforms. This case suggests that the current shift
   towards more inclusive candidate selection mechanisms across parts of
   Africa will not be linear: party leaders will adopt such reforms when
   they believe it is in their party's interest.},

Abstract = {The migration crisis of 2015/2016 deepened a major fault line inside the
   EU, the one between its Western part and its new members from Central
   and Eastern Europe. Analysing the case of Czechia this article points to
   the role of politicisation and technocracy in this split. It is argued
   here that technocratic ideas and practices are deeply rooted in the
   Czech public life and that a technocratic symbiosis existed between the
   EU and Czechia. However, this symbiosis was disturbed by the way the
   European Commission was politicised before and during the crisis while
   it clashed with Czech technocratic positions.},

Abstract = {This article explores the barriers faced by ex-combatants in Northern
   Ireland and Colombia as they reintegrate into civil society. It focuses
   on analysing three key aspects for a successful reintegration process:
   access to education opportunities after demobilisation, inclusion and
   participation into the civilian economy, and the exercise of equal
   citizenship in order to guarantee social and civic reintegration. The
   article presents the results of fifty-four interviews with former
   combatants from both countries. It is argued that for the purpose of
   developing effective and inclusive reintegration processes for
   excombatants, it is crucial to address claims for recognition as a
   central dimension of reintegration. The paper concludes that the
   recognition of ex-combatants' social expectations during the
   demobilisation stage, and the acknowledgement of their experiences of
   marginalisation in the course of the reintegration process, is vital to
   enable former combatants to achieve the self-realisation of their
   civilian identity.},

Abstract = {Thus far, attempts to link the emissions trading schemes (ETS) of
   countries with heterogenous climate policies have failed. Despite the
   adoption in Glasgow of a long-awaited rulebook for Article 6 of the
   Paris Agreement, heterogeneous linking remains politically challenging
   to achieve - but why is this? We explore this question, with a focus on
   Northeast Asia. We surveyed Chinese, Japanese and Korean experts
   involved in negotiating the Paris Agreement Article 6 Rulebook, to test
   how feasibility, confidence and willingness affect the specifics of
   linking in the region. Our results reveal differences in perceptions
   among countries and subcategories of agents involved in the policy
   process. We identify three different political barriers to linking in
   Northeast Asia: an institutional resistance barrier, predicated on
   administrative challenges; a governance-sharing barrier, which reflects
   the difficulties of resolving complex sovereignty questions; and an
   environmental integrity barrier, based on a lack of confidence between
   partners in the region.},

Abstract = {While studies assert the strong restrictions on independent candidates
   due to their electoral success, this paper argues that the least
   restrictive requirements and political experience favor independent
   candidacies. To show this, the 31 states of Mexico are classified by
   restriction levels, and the proportion of independent candidates by
   level, and the political experience of the 97 candidates for governor in
   Mexico between 2015 and 2018 are examined. The principal findings are:
   1) the predominance of states with a low restriction level that present
   the highest proportion of candidates and successful candidacies, and 2)
   the predominance of candidates with political experience.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses urbanization in the context of China's efforts to
   meet its commitments regarding the United Nations' Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs). This paper focuses specifically on
   governmental policies to promote polycentricity, with multiple urban
   centers of a similar scale within metropolitan areas, rather than a
   traditional single, dominant central business district. Polycentric
   urban forms have the potential to reduce average commuting times,
   thereby impacting greenhouse gas emissions. Polycentricity may also
   enhance access to employment and other opportunities for marginalized
   households. To this end, we examine the nexus between emerging
   polycentric urbanization patterns in Chinese cities and modes of
   governance at the national and local levels. Changsha, in Hunan
   province, is selected as a case study to illuminate the issues. Our
   analysis shows that fiscal considerations and other national and local
   governance imperatives can play a crucial role in determining how
   urbanization evolves. While China is unique in many ways, there are also
   important commonalities with other countries in the global South that
   are experiencing rapid urbanization, so the insights generated here may
   be more broadly applicable.},

Abstract = {Objective/Context: Citizen support for democracy is in question. In the
   Latin American case, after having increased at the beginning of the 21st
   century, indicators of support for democracy showed marked decline
   throughout the last decade. This is particularly evident in the Andean
   countries, where recent setbacks in the legitimacy of democratic
   institutions have been accompanied by problematic electoral processes
   that were deeply questioned by their citizens. Methodology: Using recent
   data from two of the main sources of comparative public opinion
   available for Latin America-AmericasBarometer and the World Values
   Surveythis work focuses on indicators of citizen support for democracy
   in four countries of the Andean region (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and
   Peru), investigating the effect of government approval on the evaluation
   of democracy. The study uses a methodological design that recognizes
   different levels of support for democracy, to discuss the hypothesis
   that effects should be different between the levels analyzed.
   Conclusions: The results show that more concrete levels of support for
   democracy are more strongly influenced by individual political
   positions, while the values that sustain democracy are not affected at a
   statistically significant level. Originality: The methodology allows
   identifying the multidimensionality of citizen support for democracy and
   how this support depends on different factors according to the studied
   level. The conclusions evidence the existence of dynamics common to
   different societies in relation to democracy.},

Abstract = {Despite the much-increased political salience of basic income in recent
   years, we still know relatively little about its public support. The
   current article contributes to existing knowledge by studying public
   support for basic income from a multidimensional perspective, using a
   vignette experiment that charts popular support for a broad range of
   differently designed types of basic income. The results demonstrate that
   support for basic income is indeed inherently multidimensional, for
   three main reasons. First, some types of basic income are more popular
   than others, especially those that are conditional and equity-based.
   Second, people make significant trade-offs between various policy design
   dimensions and the deservingness criteria associated with them. Third,
   there are important differences in the types of basic income preferred
   by specific ideological groups: while left-wing people differentiate
   little between various proposals, their right-wing counterparts clearly
   prefer more-restrictive proposals. By situating these findings in a
   comparative perspective, the article proposes a novel conceptual
   framework, which postulates that the multidimensionality of support for
   basic income is context dependent. From a policy point-of-view, this is
   relevant in light of the crucial role played by public opinion in
   determining the political feasibility of implementing some form of basic
   income in a real-world setting.},

Abstract = {We convened a conference funded by the National Science Foundation at
   Arizona State University in April 2021. The 40 papers presented at the
   conference, a subset of which form this special issue, together
   demonstrated that, far from collapsing in the face of duress, law is a
   malleable tool that is deployed in novel ways to promote human rights.
   Collectively, the conference participants illustrated that the power of
   human rights lies not in their essentialized transcendence of time,
   culture, and context, but in their enduring promise that a more just
   world can emerge from sustained and creative struggle through, against,
   and at the margins of states, laws, and institutions. Ultimately, the
   key questions to emerge are not whether human rights law and practice
   will survive, but rather, what are the forces that continue to sustain,
   revitalize, and transform them? And what are human rights in the process
   of becoming?},

Abstract = {Do affectively polarised people vote or stay home on election day?
   Although there is an increasing number of comparative studies focusing
   on the origins of partisan affective polarisation, our knowledge about
   its impact on individuals' decision to vote is still limited. This
   article takes a closer look at the relationship between propensity to
   vote and partisan affective polarisation by distinguishing those
   produced by in-party like and by out-party dislike. The results show
   that both in-group like and out-group hate sentiments increase people's
   propensity to vote, and that the effects of the latter are more
   accentuated. The argument presented in the following pages is based on
   the analysis of a two-wave panel study conducted in Spain between April
   and May 2019.},

Abstract = {Attention given to the environment by the British public has fluctuated
   over recent decades. Having peaked in 2007 it declined, yet has recently
   risen dramatically. This raises questions about why public attention to
   the issue changes over time and to what extent this is driven by other
   actors and exogenous forces. This article examines these processes at
   the monthly level through a system of simultaneous equations.
   Methodologically, protest is an important confounding factor when
   analysing the relationship between media and public salience.
   Substantively, protest itself can be predicted by prior public
   attention, but in turn, can be successful in increasing broader
   environmental salience.},

Abstract = {Blockchain is a new general-purpose technology that poses significant
   challenges to policymaking, law, and society. Blockchain is even more
   distinctive than other transformative technologies, as it is by nature a
   global technology; moreover, it operates based on a set of rules and
   principles that have a law-like quality-the lex cryptographia. The
   global nature of blockchain has led to its adoption by international
   organizations such as the United Nations and the World Bank. However,
   the law-like nature of the technology makes some of its uses by
   international organizations questionable from an international law and
   foreign affairs perspective. In this light, the article examines the
   effectiveness and legitimacy of the use of blockchain for international
   policymaking.},

Abstract = {This article explores the expansion of informal property rights
   documents through the case of chiefs' titles in Zambia. Entrepreneurial
   chiefs have created written land rights for citizens on customary land
   in the form of letters, signed maps, and certificates. These documents
   are an alternative to state land titling that allows chiefs to maintain
   their control over land. However, chiefs' titles are extra-legal: they
   are enforced by the same traditional leaders who govern unwritten
   customary rights, raising doubt about whether written land rights can
   strengthen citizens' land claims without changing the existing power
   structures. Evidence from 121 interviews with chiefs, bureaucrats, and
   smallholder farmers and a survey of over 5,500 citizens shows that,
   despite their flaws, chiefs' titles do increase citizens' perceptions of
   tenure security. This suggests that informal property rights documents
   can be a powerful tool in a citizen's arsenal. Further, these findings
   illustrate a process of adaptation and change within customary land
   institutions.},

Abstract = {Before problems can be solved, they must be defined. In global public
   policy, problems are defined in large part by institutions like the
   World Bank, whose research shapes our collective understanding of social
   and economic issues. This article examines how research is produced at
   the World Bank and deemed to be worthwhile and legitimate. Creating and
   capturing research on global policy problems requires organizational
   configurations that operate at the intersection of multiple fields.
   Drawing on an in-depth study of the World Bank research department, this
   article outlines the structures and technologies of evaluation (i.e.,
   the measurements and procedures used in performance reviews and
   promotions) and the social and cultural processes (i.e., the spoken and
   unspoken things that matter) in producing valuable policy research. It
   develops a theoretically informed account of how the conditions of
   measurement and evaluation shape the production of knowledge at a
   dominant multilateral agency. In turn, it unpacks how the internal
   workings of organizations can shape broader epistemic infrastructures
   around global policy problems.},

Abstract = {In recent years, a record number of people have been forcibly displaced
   or migrated due to conflict. Whilst established political science
   research suggests that displaced communities are an added risk factor
   for conflict due to their support for extreme co-ethnic political
   parties and movements, this has been challenged by recent research which
   shows that migrants can be a moderating force. We offer a potential
   reconciliation of these divergent findings by distinguishing between
   first- and second-generation migrants. Due to their relative lack of
   conflict exposure, second-generation migrants will have significantly
   less support for co-ethnic political parties than first-generation
   migrants and those who remain. We test our argument using granular
   survey data comparing Kurds who migrated out of the conflict zone in
   Turkey with those who remained. The results support our theoretical
   framework and have important implications for our understanding of
   migrant attitudes and the long-term effects of conflict exposure.},

Abstract = {How should aid donors respond to human rights violations in `recipient'
   countries? Much of the literature on this topic focuses on whether
   donors use aid conditionality rather than the effectiveness of different
   donor responses in preventing rights abuses. This article argues that to
   better understand the effectiveness of conditionality, and donor
   responses to rights violations more generally, it is necessary to
   consider the role of domestic actors and processes in recipient and
   donor countries. Drawing on the concept of `two-level games', it
   develops a framework for donor responses to rights abuses that
   incorporates international- and domestic-level processes. This article
   examines these dynamics with a case study of donor responses to the
   Anti-Homosexuality Bill/Act in Uganda between 2009 and 2014. The
   analysis shows how different donor responses impacted the struggle
   against the repressive legislation-positively and negatively-through
   their effects on domestic actors. More broadly, the article shows that
   engaging with domestic actors and processes can shed light on how aid
   donors can most effectively respond to human rights violations in
   different political contexts.},

Abstract = {This study employs frame theory tools to describe the identity and
   ideology of al-Qaeda (AQ) and the Islamic State (IS). The aim is to
   identify elements that make the two groups' mobilization effective. The
   article utilizes the concept of identity fields, to explore how the two
   groups divide in-group and out-group identities in protagonists,
   antagonists, and audiences and the concept of core framing tasks to
   examine how their ideology materializes in diagnoses, prognoses, and
   calls to arms. The results indicate that AQ frames its identity as the
   protector of Muslims from the evil West and IS as the sole legitimate
   religious authority guiding Muslims to true Islam. AQ and IS prioritize
   and contextualize their ideological frames differently, despite both
   adhering to the same ideology, namely Salafism-Jihadism. AQ mobilization
   tends to rely more on political frames whereas IS framing is almost
   exclusively religious. Both groups, however, appropriate political and
   religious frames already extant in the minds of Muslim audiences in
   order to mobilize potential adherents.},

Abstract = {This article shows how the proliferation of economic language can
   undermine the political authority of economists. The argument emerges
   from a comparative case study of two early experiments with electricity
   market design. Relying on archival materials and 30 in-depth interviews,
   I examine why political actors ignored the advice of economists in
   California, while they deferred to the experts in the Pennsylvania,
   Jersey, Maryland (PJM) region. The debates were framed in economic
   language, but stakeholders interpreted central concepts differently
   without recognizing the resulting ambiguities. This `discursive
   multivocality' undermined economists' authority as experts. It
   challenged economists' monopoly on the interpretation of economic
   concepts and undercut rhetorical strategies to reassert the superiority
   of their understanding. At the PJM Interconnect, the experts overcame
   this problem by switching to a different conceptual apparatus.
   Ironically, economists could establish their authoritative understanding
   of economics by appealing to a shared understanding of engineering
   problems.},

Title = {Social ecologies of health and conflict-related sexual violence:
   Translating ``healthworlds{''} into transitional justice},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {This article discusses the relationship between health and transitional
   justice through a particular focus on the issue of conflict-related
   sexual violence. It is not, however, about the individual health needs
   of victims-/survivors, nor about possible ways that transitional justice
   processes might address these. Drawing on empirical data from
   Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia and Uganda, it explores some of the health
   legacies of sexual violence in conflict and their wider significance for
   transitional justice. Embracing the World Health Organization's
   definition of health as ``a state of complete physical, mental and
   social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or
   infirmity{''}, the article specifically seeks to demonstrate that
   conflict-related sexual violence (and its frequent entanglement with
   other forms of violence) affects not only individual but also
   social-ecological health. The article's overall contention, thus, is
   that in the context of transitional justice, more than individual health
   matters. The broader ``health{''} of social ecologies themselves is also
   critically important. Ultimately advocating a social-ecological
   reframing of transitional justice, the article utilizes Germond \&
   Cochrane's (2010) concept of ``healthworlds{''} to explore what this
   reframing might look like in practice.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how communities at the urban margins, who are
   under-protected by the state police, understand police reforms through
   an examination of the unusual case of street protests in support of a
   police officer who had killed two young men in Githurai in Nairobi. I
   explore how the under-protection of communities at the urban margins by
   the police leads to a reliance on various forms of vigilantism to
   generate security and justice outcomes. Noting the limitations of
   community vigilantism, I explore how these communities come to rely on
   police vigilantism, a form of vigilantism that has received limited
   attention in African studies. Based on insights generated from data
   collected in Githurai in March and April 2015, I argue that residents of
   Githurai protested against the arrest of a local police vigilante, whom
   they had come to rely on for security, because they considered his
   deployment of violence against suspected criminals to be justified and
   also feared that his arrest would expose them to further insecurity. I
   conclude that police reform efforts should pay attention to the
   innovations that communities have developed at the grassroots to
   generate security and justice outcome in absence of reliable protection
   by the state police.},

Title = {Why Are Counterfactual Assessment Methods Not Widespread in
   Outcome-Based Contracts? A Formal Model Approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {509-523},
Month = {JUN 4},
Abstract = {Counterfactual assessment techniques involving treated and control
   groups, such as randomized control trials, might be used in
   outcome-based contracts to avoid rewarding or sanctioning service
   providers for social outcomes that they did not cause. However, few
   outcome-based contracts adopt payment rules based on counterfactual
   assessment techniques. Potential explanations are that these techniques
   are complex and involve substantial transaction costs. In this paper, we
   develop a theoretical formal model that integrates the literatures of
   incentives and policy evaluation to propose the following alternative
   explanation: counterfactual techniques may lead to counterproductive
   incentive effects if they reduce the likelihood of payment even if
   project managers exert sufficient effort to promote the expected
   interventions. Our model shows that counterfactual assessment may
   undermine effort when the number of treated subjects is small and there
   is limited investment per treated subject. Our formal model also
   suggests that the increased experience of the contract sponsors may
   inhibit the adoption of counterfactual assessment. Simulations and
   descriptive evidence from a unique database of 350 outcome-based
   contracts designed or initiated throughout the world and from linear
   probability models are aligned with our predictions. By offering
   additional explanations on why counterfactual assessment methods are not

Abstract = {Research has demonstrated how the European Parliament has expanded its
   powers vis-a-vis other EU institutions by strategically exploiting
   powers it already holds and appealing to its contribution to democratic
   legitimacy. However, established theories are challenged by the failure
   of the EP to secure the election of a so-called Spitzenkandidat to the
   post of European Commission President in 2019. Was this failure an
   incidental set-back or does it point to a structural limit to the EP's
   ability to expand its powers? Exploring the latter option, this article
   proposes that the 2019 events warrant the revision of the EP-centred
   parliamentarisation thesis that dominates our understanding of EU
   inter-institutional politics. Instead, it develops an alternative theory
   that departs from the conception of the EU as a demoi-cracy. Using the
   events in 2014 and 2019, the article constructs analytical narratives
   for both theoretical positions. Reading the 2019 case through the
   demoi-cratic perspective suggests that national leaders are unlikely to
   allow the EP to reclaim the Spitzenkandidaten-process. More generally,
   it follows from this perspective that the EP can only successfully get
   the member states to share powers, not to cede them.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY},

Abstract = {The literature on carbon pricing offers competing explanations for the
   introduction of carbon taxation. This article contributes to the field
   by highlighting the interaction of dynamic political factors and
   external pressures in explaining the timing of the adoption of carbon
   taxes. Focusing on the second wave of European countries, the study
   combines the multiple streams framework with qualitative comparative
   analysis to identify conditions favourable to the introduction of carbon
   taxes. Additional case studies on Ireland and Portugal serve to
   illuminate the reform process, especially the role of policy
   entrepreneurs. This approach yields three insights. First, fiscal crises
   provide political actors with an opportunity to raise environmental
   taxes. Second, the introduction of carbon taxation is most likely when
   push and pull factors come together, i.e. when high problem pressure
   coincides with governments receptive to environmental issues. Finally,
   the prospects of ``green{''} policy entrepreneurs are strongly
   determined by their standing within the government.},

Abstract = {Utilizing Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) as a basis, this
   article aims to further the understanding of the influence institutional
   factors have on agenda-setting and policy formulation in the European
   Union (EU). It does so by analyzing the policy process of the Just
   Transition Fund (JTF) from agenda-setting to policy formulation by the
   Commission. The research finds that policy entrepreneurship is strongly
   determined by the characteristics and overlap of institutional policy
   windows. In the JTF case, the institutional context enhanced the
   influence of policy entrepreneurs within the European Parliament,
   especially the S\&D party, on the combined process of agenda-setting and
   policy formulation. Therefore, this paper illustrates that EU MSF
   scholarship would benefit from taking institutional factors more into
   account. The conclusions also indicate that supranational institutions
   can play a larger role in EU climate policy formulation than some of the
   current research suggests.},

Abstract = {The Greens in the United Kingdom have benefitted from the fragmentation
   of the party system and the creation of devolved institutions, achieving
   consistent representation at multiple levels of British politics in
   recent years. However, we know little about what they have done in these
   positions. This study uses interviews with Green legislators to
   investigate how they have interpreted the task of opposition at
   Westminster, Holyrood and Stormont. We show that Green legislators'
   approaches to opposition have been influenced by their party identity,
   and that differences in approach between the institutions have largely
   been determined by contrasting political opportunity structures, rather
   than parliamentary rules. These findings highlight the importance of
   party as a factor shaping opposition strategy and the varied roles which
   opposition parties can play within the UK political system.},

Abstract = {Lenin's Marxist theories have aided both African anti-imperialist
   struggles and the study of African political economy. Recently, however,
   some scholars have reinvigorated the postcolonial critique of Marxism as
   a Eurocentric doctrine, one that misunderstands and marginalises Africa
   and its peoples. Following Cedric Robinson, several analysts mention
   Lenin alongside Marx and Engels as a founder of Eurocentric Marxism.
   This article, by contrast, argues that Lenin displayed a deep concern
   for Africa, one that was fundamentally non-Eurocentric. Lenin researched
   Africa extensively in his Notebooks on imperialism. Upon the basis of
   this research, Lenin placed Africa at the centre of his analysis in
   Imperialism: the highest stage of capitalism. It is impossible to
   understand the insights of Lenin's theory of imperialism without
   appreciating Africa's centrality within it. Although Lenin displayed the
   racist views of Africa that dominated his era, these were marginal in
   his thought. Lenin militantly opposed colonialism and supported African
   independence.},

Abstract = {When faced with complex public policy challenges, policymakers grapple
   with a dilemma between assuming direct political control
   (politicisation) or creating `distance' through arm's length, often
   market-orientated governance arrangements (depoliticisation). We contend
   that both processes co-exist and operate simultaneously though
   empirically speaking, little is known about how they interact over time
   to inform policy change. We compare how the Heath and Wilson-Callaghan
   governments responded to this `recurrent dilemma' in the Nationalised
   Industries during the 1970s. Drawing on new archival material, our
   research reveals that a desire to retain political control was
   repeatedly supplemented by attempts to embed depoliticising,
   quasi-market disciplinary mechanisms. Our focus on the `intercurrence'
   of politicisation and depoliticisation, understood as the simultaneous
   operation of older and newer governance arrangements, reveals the long,
   complex lineage of privatisation, addng nuance to accounts that present
   it simplistically as part of a paradigm shift in the 1980s.},

Abstract = {When and why do countries in a wartime coalition engage in diplomacy
   during hostilities? This paper establishes a theoretical framework of
   coalitional diplomacy that highlights each member's private costs and
   benefits to fighting or seeking a negotiated exit. I argue that the
   propensity for coalition members to engage in negotiations is a function
   of the coalition's balance of military contributions, as well as the
   coalition's battlefield successes and failures. Evidence supporting
   these claims stem from a large-scale quantitative analysis of two
   centuries of interstate wars, as well as a close study of the Allies in
   the Crimean War.},

Abstract = {The article argues that the historical conditions under which national
   capitalism developed in post-independence Mozambique pushed the economy
   towards growing financialisation and narrower specialisation of
   production around increasingly basic and simple activities. In
   post-independence Mozambique, national capitalism rose from the ashes of
   state-centred accumulation built around the dominant social structures
   of production inherited from colonialism, under the impulse of
   neoliberal economic reforms and heavy dependency on inflows of private
   international finance. The speculative dynamics of accumulation
   prevented diversification and more complex industrialisation which, in
   turn, reinforced the role of financialisation as a means to and form of
   accumulation of capital. The paper argues that changing these dynamics
   of accumulation requires conscious industrial strategies focused on
   diversification and articulation of production, which cannot be achieved
   without challenging the extractive mode of accumulation and the power
   relationships associated with it.},

Abstract = {Since the 1993 White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment,
   the Commission has emphasised the importance of trans-European networks
   (TENs) for the physical completion of the single market. Despite the
   2004 and 2013 revisions to the TEN-T regulation, redefining and
   expanding the multimodal network, many projects remain unfinished. This
   article explores the Commission's enduring role in EU policy
   coordination from the perspective of hybrid governance, focusing on the
   mediating role of high-level `European Coordinators', the use of
   stakeholders forums, recourse to policy evaluation, and the development
   of new financial instruments. Drawing on recent audit and evaluations
   work by the EU institutions, it explores reconfigurations of
   implementing actors, and engages with notions from the literature on
   experimentalist governance, including networks, informalism and
   deliberation. The analysis suggests that the Commission demonstrates
   resilience as a coordination body in its commitment to `physically
   complete' the single market, while recognising limitations to its
   coordination capacity.},

Title = {A Theoretical Modelling of International Migration on the Explanation of
   the Nature and Motives of Labour Migrants From Ukraine to Poland},
Journal = {STUDIA EUROPEJSKIE-STUDIES IN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {This article considers the concepts and theories of international
   migration which answer questions about the current trends of migration
   flows. Particular emphasis has been placed on the transformation of
   established perceptions of women's migration as, under the influence of
   globalisation in the modern system of international coordinates, there
   is a trend that is interpreted as the ``feminisation{''} of
   international migration. Designing theories and concepts of
   international migration on an explanation of the motives and specifics
   of the adaptation of Ukrainian labour migrants in Poland offers a basis
   upon which to argue that each of them is appropriate for application. In
   addition, a theoretical modelling of migration policy has been
   presented. In practice, national governments use such models of
   migration policy as: the complete exclusion of immigration into a
   country or profess a ``closed-door policy{''}, differentiated
   exclusion/segregation, integration as a gradual and weaker form of
   assimilation, the so-called ``selective policy{''}, and the
   assimilation, multicultural or ``open-door policy{''}. Future scenarios
   for the modelling of migration fl ows represented by leading
   international organisations have been designed. The multidimensional
   MIPEX Index, according to which Poland's policy on migrants is assessed
   as ``equality on paper{''}, is lower than the EU average, and, with a
   score of an estimated 40 points out of a possible 100, has been used to
   assess the trends of modern migration policy of the Republic of Poland.
   The new migration model of Poland leans towards a model of a
   differentiated integration of migrants rather than a multicultural
   policy or assimilation. It has been concluded that migration policy
   should be based on the principle of `` tripartism{''}/ scenarios (the `
   win-win-win' concept) and benefit the donor state, the recipient state,
   and the migrants themselves.},

Abstract = {Group-focused enmity (GFE) and related research have mostly focused on
   variable-centred analyses such as structural equation modelling and
   factor analysis, implicitly assuming that the results apply uniformly to
   all participants in the sample. Person-centred research questions and
   analysis methods, which investigate unobserved heterogeneity in the
   sample, have been lacking in GFE research. Nonetheless, initial evidence
   exists from research on Islamophobia and GFE that various unobserved
   latent classes (i.e., subgroups) differing in their average prejudice
   can be identified within one dataset. In this manuscript, we applied
   factor mixture modelling to investigate unobserved heterogeneity using
   the data of the German GFE survey 2011. We found two latent classes of
   equivalent factor-analytical composition with consistently high versus
   low expressions of target-specific prejudice. No comparison of latent
   GFE means was possible. Membership in the high prejudice latent class
   was associated with higher age, right-wing political orientation, high
   right-wing authoritarianism and high social dominance orientation. Our
   findings demonstrate the importance of exploring unobserved
   heterogeneity in attitudes research and outline how person-centred
   research can complement variable-centred research in order to understand
   social-psychological phenomena.1},

Abstract = {Foreign investment is an important component of the economy of many
   countries. This is the case for Norway too, where foreign-controlled
   enterprises employ 21 percent of the workers in the (private) business
   sectors. We know that foreign investment flows are changing, with
   increased activity from countries that have traditionally invested
   little abroad. This is true for China, especially, but also for India,
   Russia, and some other non-traditional investor countries. In this
   article, we study how Norway's position as a destination for investment
   is changing. We discuss the developments in relation to established
   theories within economics and political science.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, immigration has been the main driver shaping
   Poland's migration policy. This has given rise to the concept and
   problem of an immigrant as an ``other{''} who should be adjusted to
   Polish reality. The idea of parochialism is helpful in addressing the
   matter of the lookingglass self and its consequences for immigration
   policy. This article aims to interpret Poland's immigration policy in
   the context of parochialism and its virtues. It points to the
   consequences of a migration paradigm shift generated by modernisation
   and indigenisation. The methodology embraces a theoretical framing of
   parochialism, an interpretive political analysis approach, a qualitative
   content analysis, and an interpretation of selected public opinion polls
   and surveys. The argument developed in this article holds that Poland's
   immigration policy after 2015 has been marked by the tendency to favour
   parochialism as an attitude which captures immigrants in the
   exclusionary formula of ``others{''}. The mobilisation of the Polish
   population to oppose the inflow of immigrants is in line with their
   ``domestication{''} according to ethno-nationalist standards. Such
   process facilitates the implementation of Poland's immigration policy by
   shifting responsibility from the central authorities to local
   communities.},

Title = {The Post-Communist State Era and Its Impact on Sovereignty: A Case Study
   of Kosovo},
Journal = {STUDIA EUROPEJSKIE-STUDIES IN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {135-152},
Abstract = {Many theoretical perspectives have touched on the concept of
   sovereignty, but the need for more sovereignty-based discussion in
   relation to the postcommunist era still exists. The question of
   sovereignty and its survival in the post- communist era touches on some
   general features such as the attributes, signs, properties, and
   conditions of the concept of sovereignty that have evolved. In the case
   of Kosovo, the issue of sovereignty can be linked to two distinct
   features, namely democracy and human rights. For Kosovo to be a
   sovereign state, it had a mandatory prerequisite to fulfil these two
   features. These features implied the fulfilment of two criteria, in the
   forms of legality and legitimacy and, in reality, these two criteria
   stem from the will of the people. This reflection shows that sovereignty
   in the post-communist era had to be in line with respect for human
   rights as a feature of the principles of democracy. However, the
   transition from the communist system to democracy was not an easy one.
   In this regard, Kosovo has come a long way in achieving sovereignty and
   managed to be declared a sovereign state in 2008. The conditioning of
   Kosovo's sovereignty by the above criteria represents the influence of
   the post-communist era, and its earlier form differs from the prevailing
   form of absolute sovereignty as it existed, for example, in the former
   federations of Russia and Yugoslavia. Kosovo's sovereignty is reflected
   in accordance with the will of the majority of over ninety-five percent
   of the country's population. Moreover, in Kosovo, minorities have
   privileges, such as positive discrimination and the special right that
   constitutional changes on vital issues pertaining to those minorities
   cannot be made without their vote.
   However, in the post-communist era, it was not possible to democratise
   all sovereign states. Some states focused on the power and manner of
   expanding power in their respective territories and fought for the
   recognition of reconfigured sovereignty at the expense of justice and
   rights. Therefore, since the post-communist period, the definition,
   content, and character of sovereignty has been in debate, with a new
   dimension of respect for human rights as a major talking point and as an
   essential mark of the principle of democracy.},

Abstract = {The countries of NATO's eastern flank representing the so- called
   Bucharest Nine include Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania,
   Latvia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Over recent decades,
   NATO has adapted to new challenges and threats to the security
   environment. This article attempts to examine the ongoing armed conflict
   between Russia and Ukraine from the perspective of NATO's eastern flank
   countries as well as to answer the following research questions: are
   NATO member states adequately responding to the threats arising from the
   armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and will NATO be revitalised
   as a result of Russia's revisionist policy?},

Abstract = {Recent studies show that simple recall tasks can make public employees
   more aware of the positive impact they have on others and society. This
   in turn increases their motivation. However, studies often draw on paid
   survey respondents, such as respondents recruited via Amazon MTurk,
   resulting in an unfortunate mismatch between test sample and target
   population. Addressing the need to test recall tasks among real-world
   public servants, we conducted a wide replication (n = 412) of a recent
   study by Vogel and Willems. Our findings suggest that the effect sizes
   of recall tasks are likely relatively smaller when deployed ``in the
   wild.{''} Based on our findings, we propose three themes for a future
   research agenda and point practitioners to areas of attention when
   implementing recall tasks in real-world settings.},

Title = {Negotiating Positionality as a Student and Researcher in Africa:
   Understanding How Seniority and Race Mediate Elite Interviews in African
   Social Contexts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 29},
Abstract = {This article takes a reflexive look at the dilemmas and challenges of
   accessing a predominantly male circle of political and nongovernmental
   elites in the Central African Republic from the perspective of a young
   Black African male student researcher. It focuses on questions of
   positionality, arguing that certain African social norms regarding
   seniority and hierarchy can affect data generation, specifically access
   and interactions within interviews. The article argues that the author's
   identities as a student and researcher complicated access to male and
   senior elite interviewees during field research, thus illustrating anew
   how diasporic Africans might experience the field research exercise
   differently even if accessing elites is generally a difficult exercise.
   This article contributes to understanding power differentials among
   interviewers, including differences among students and researchers, and
   the influence of race during fieldwork by African scholars. This is
   within an emerging literature on fieldwork that focuses on graduate
   students in International Relations and Comparative Politics.},

Abstract = {In 2011, the Government of Quebec, Canada announced an ambitious
   twenty-five-year plan to develop the province's northern region-an area
   nearly twice the size of France. A centrepiece of the Plan Nord is to
   integrate the province's various Indigenous peoples in the sustainable
   development of the region. However, there are early warning signs of the
   potential for future conflict as some Indigenous groups mobilized
   opposition against proposed developments. This raises important
   questions: could the plan enhance prospects for improved cooperation
   between Indigenous peoples and non-Indigenous groups or is it likely to
   engender conflict? Which factors explain the diverging levels of support
   for the plan between the region's principal Indigenous peoples (i.e.
   Cree, Inuit, Innu)? The paper uses the `sons of the soil' (SoS) conflict
   framework to theorize the mechanisms that can give rise to-or prevent
   the escalation of-Indigenous and non-Indigenous conflict in northern
   Quebec. Though typically applied to case studies in the Global South,
   the SoS conflict framework provides a novel approach for understanding
   the contentious politics surrounding land, territory, and natural
   resource development in settler-colonial contexts.},

Title = {Framing States: Unitary Actor Language and Public Support for Coercive
   Foreign Policy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {A defining feature of public (and, often, scholarly) discussion of
   international affairs is the treatment of states as unitary actors, that
   is, akin to individual persons. Drawing upon social-psychological
   research, we theorize that such unitary actor (UA) framing increases the
   degree to which adversarial states are perceived as entitative-that is,
   as relatively united-and, thus, the perceived complicity of a country's
   people in their government's actions. We therefore hypothesize that UA
   framing increases citizens' support for indiscriminate, coercive
   policies against target states. In a content analysis of US elite
   statements spanning three decades, we first establish that UA framing is
   exceedingly common, occurring in nearly two-thirds of all references to
   adversarial states. We then conduct a series of survey experiments on US
   adults, finding that, compared to frames in which a state is described
   as more factious and disunited, UA framing is associated with
   significantly greater willingness to impose harmful, indiscriminate
   economic sanctions and military strikes against target states. Our
   results highlight the utility and applicability of entitativity to
   political science research, and have important implications for the role
   of elite discourse in bolstering public support for hawkish foreign
   policymaking.},

Abstract = {What relations matter? This question sits at the heart of this article
   and addresses in a more thoroughgoing way the methodological and
   ethico-political problems that some relational thinkers have debated. We
   are interested in deep relationalism and the methodological problem of
   delineating which relations matter in a reality defined by an
   ever-unfolding web of relations. By acknowledging the relationality of
   critical international relations (IR) theories, this methodological
   puzzle is explored by recognizing the situatedness of relations that are
   being analyzed. Moreover, this helps us to start a conversation on the
   ethical and political dimensions of deeply relational approaches. By
   placing the ontological work of deep relationalism in dialogue with the
   epistemological and ethico-political aspects of critical theory, we are
   putting forth an account of critical relationalism. Furthermore, we are
   not only arguing for a critical approach to relationalism but also
   adding to one of the main methodological debates in relationalism that
   asks us to carefully consider which relations matter (for our analysis)
   and how we should access them? Finally, this piece advocates for more
   plural grounds for relationalism in IR to critically reflect on which
   relations our theoretical approaches can take us to and why this
   matters.},

Abstract = {This article offers a new conceptual and theoretical model for
   researching music-based peacebuilding, an emerging interdisciplinary
   field that is characterised by heterogeneity of practices, concepts, and
   analytical approaches. Drawing upon findings from a scoping study of 62
   peer-reviewed English language publications that describe music-based
   peacebuilding practices, it presents a typology of six varieties of
   peace that this work can foster. Each peace is constituted by a
   combination of four key variables in approaches to practice and
   implementation: intergroup encounter; intentional engagement with the
   extant conflict or politics that drive the need for peace-promoting
   work; sociality and opportunities for independent social interactions
   and affective ties; and the projection of the peace message to an
   external audience. The typology brings needed coherence to this diverse
   field, providing a nuanced framework for articulating the peacebuilding
   potential of music and for engaging critically with the possibilities,
   limitations, and complexities of creative contributions to
   peacebuilding.},

Abstract = {European integration has led to the proliferation of cross-border
   mobilities across the member states of the European Union (EU). How do
   cross-border virtual and physical interactions impact different types of
   redistributive solidarity? In this article, we test the association
   between transnationalism and support for foreigners' access to the
   domestic welfare state and to general redistributive solidarity to
   reduce inequality. We draw on original public opinion survey data
   collected by the `Reconciling Economic and Social Europe: The Role of
   Values, Ideas and Politics' (REScEU) research project in ten EU
   countries. We argue that European forms of transnationalism increase
   mobility-related solidarity because through cross-border social exchange
   individuals develop feelings of care and responsibility towards ethnic
   `others'. We find that transnationalism has a positive effect on the
   acceptance of both `EU citizens' and `all foreigners' into the domestic
   welfare system. By contrast, transnationalism is associated with a
   decrease in individuals' preferences for economic redistribution to
   reduce income inequality in one's country.},

   government services evolved under conditions of uncertainty and rapid
   change created by COVID-19 in 2020. Based on a qualitative,

   public servants and document analysis, the complexity lens helps us to
   understand how provisions of digital public services were quickly
   adapted and evolved to meet new and emerging needs experienced because
   of the pandemic. Means for making collective sense of the unknown from
   which to plan first steps, learning from doing, agility, co-construction

   Politics},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV 26},
Abstract = {Scholars of world politics can readily list the global governors of our
   time, but why and how did these particular actors gain agency in the
   first place? While there is impressive scholarship on single global
   governors and their respective impact, there is little comparative work
   and systematic theorization on what agency in world politics is and how
   actors gain it. This forum brings together contributions that apply
   relational frameworks to the question, focusing on the dynamics of
   self-agentification, delegation, and recognition. Individual
   contributions detail different empirical cases, from individuals to the
   G20, and introduce concepts for meso-level theorizing. Taken together,
   the contributions call for a more dynamic research agenda that not only
   allows scholars to reconstruct how agency emerges but also pushes us
   toward an agency-focused reframing of global governance, which is needed
   to ensure the continued relevance of the paradigm.},

Abstract = {How do political protests transform into a social movement? Analysing
   Czech anti-war protest events between 2002 and 2009, this study aims at
   identifying particular mechanisms through which the social-movement mode
   of coordination was established out of a fragmented field of activism
   through consecutive protest campaigns. The study shows how broadening
   collective identity and creating instrumental relationships in times
   with the opening of political opportunities is followed by the
   institutionalisation and further expansion of protest cooperation during
   a period of heightened political threats, which establishes a new mode
   of protest coordination.},

Title = {How a study on lived experiences impacted German occupation children - A
   mixed-method long-term approach},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {ObjectiveResearch on the impact study participation has on participants
   has shown that, even though they may find it stressful during
   participation, overall, they appear to benefit personally and emerge
   with a positive cost-benefit-balance. In 2013, the first psychological
   study on German occupation children (GOC), a potentially vulnerable and
   hidden study population, was conducted, after which respondents shared a
   high volume of positive feedback. In the context of a follow-up survey,
   the impact of study participation on participants was investigated to
   determine the causes of this distinctly positive outcome.
   MethodsMixed-methods approach using the standardized Reactions to
   Research Participation Questionnaire (RRPQ) as well as open-ended
   questions on expectations toward participation, and changes due to
   participation in dealing with GOC background and in personal life.
   Analyses included N = 65 participants (mean age 68.92, 40\% men) and
   were carried out with descriptive measures for RRPQ and inductive
   content analysis for open-ended questions. ResultsParticipants specified
   six motives for participation besides answering the standardized form;
   46.2\% (n = 30) saw their expectations met. Although participation was
   related to negative emotions during participation, participants' overall
   experience was positive; 89.2\% (n = 58) stated an inclination to
   participate again. 52.3\% (n = 34) reported participation had helped
   develop new ways of dealing with their GOC experiences; five
   contributing factors were observed. Changes in private life were
   reported by 24.6\% (n = 16); three aspects were identified. The vast
   majority (81.5\%; n = 53) stated, following participation, they were
   able to disclose their GOC background to others. Participants placed
   emphasis on four aspects of this experience. ConclusionAlthough study
   participation was described as emotionally challenging during
   participation, participants felt that the overall impact it had on them
   was positive. The study was the first of its kind and thus presented an
   opportunity for a previously hidden population to step out of the dark,
   simultaneously gaining insight that helped them better understand
   themselves as GOC, and thereby increase their capacity for
   self-acceptance. Participants also benefitted from learning about the
   study's findings and connecting with other GOC through activities that
   ensued. In conclusion, results suggest that vulnerable and/or hidden
   populations benefit from specific attention to their lived experiences
   even at higher age.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to provide insight into mediation as an
   Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to resolve interpersonal conflicts
   for undergraduate students in Hong Kong.Design/methodology/approachMixed
   methods research approach was utilised to examine university students'
   understanding of dispute resolution at their respective universities in
   Hong Kong, and factors that may influence their decision to utilize ADR
   on campus.FindingsThe tendency for university students in Hong Kong to
   voice criticisms was low due to: (1) unawareness of proper grievance
   channels; and (2) fear of potential academic retribution from the
   institution. This may be the result of inadequate promotion and
   transparency in the existing higher education dispute resolution
   framework. Academic staff acknowledged the limitation of the existing
   closed-door dispute resolution system and the need for an alternative
   conflict management system which emphasises on restoration of harmony in
   the university community.Originality/valueAs there is a lack of study
   focusing on ADR practices in Hong Kong universities, this paper provides
   insight into the feasibility of integrating ADR into the existing
   dispute resolution processes in resolving interpersonal conflicts at
   universities in Hong Kong.},

Abstract = {Since the 1970s, neoliberalism has implied a deep reconfiguration of na-
   tional economies and a significant increase in inequalities. The
   International Monetary Fund (IMF), which considers itself above human
   rights, has been a central institutional vehicle in this change through
   its credits and condition- alities that regularly translate into
   violations of the human rights of debtor states' populations.
   Neoliberalism entertains a hegemonic notion of human rights that
   proposes a vision of them based on the-alleged-defense of civil and
   political rights-that focuses on the individuals and distrust of the
   state-to the detriment of economic and social rights-where the
   relational aspect is essential, and the state assumes positive
   obligations. This has led to strong criticism of the ineffectiveness of
   human rights in producing real change in the world. This article
   discusses this minimalist and defeatist interpretation of human rights,
   highlighting their transformative potential in the fields of finance and
   economics. Human rights can function as a method to achieve, in fields
   of high complexity and abstraction, objectives that today enjoy broad
   consensus: reducing poverty, inequality, and climate change. This study
   shows that the marginalization of human rights that characterizes the
   IMF parallels the excessive exercise of its power in the world. Finally,
   some indications are provided regarding how these tensions were
   exacerbated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {Technology is a key factor in the modernization of the State. Social
   networks, one of the most recent technologies, have spread in the
   Administration and have been a subject of study by an academia that has
   pointed out the importance of their institutionalization to achieve a
   successful technological adoption. This paper contributes to this
   debate, focusing on the political variable and how it affects
   institutionalization. For this purpose, we have chosen institutional
   communication, one of the various recognized uses of social technologies
   in institutions, a specific field such as the Spanish state
   administration, and a mixed research technique that includes both a
   descriptive and a quantitative analysis. The results clarify how the
   political variable significantly influences both on the decision to have
   social channels and their daily use and managament structure. Thus, the
   political factor is a barrier that weakens institutionalization,
   limiting the role of public employees, politically biasing the contents
   generated by institutional channels and giving rise to contingent
   management structures. The document offers a series of recommendations
   and some possible lines of research for further explore how the
   political factor affects the adoption of these technologies.},

Abstract = {Policy feedback scholars argue the relationship between policy and
   politics is dynamic and reciprocal. For instance, policies ``make
   citizens,{''} teaching the public who deserves positive government
   treatment and who does not. Furthermore, individual experiences with
   policy shape participation and beliefs about government, which shapes
   future policy. But few scholars have examined how experiences with a law
   shape attitudes toward those targeted by policy. We use a survey of 3000
   respondents on MTurk (including an over-sample of people of color) to
   show how direct and indirect experience with policy shapes social
   constructions of politically relevant groups. Specifically, we examine
   how direct (personal) and indirect (via someone they know well)
   experience with two policy areas (criminal justice and social welfare)
   shape perceptions of the targets of criminal justice and welfare policy.
   We find the effect of policy contact is racialized; policy contact has a
   greater effect on white respondents compared to Black respondents. But
   despite this contact, whites' attitudes about groups' deservingness
   remain lower than those of their Black counterparts.},

Title = {Do Politically Irrelevant Events Cause Conflict? The Cross-continental
   Effects of European Professional Football on Protests in Africa},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},

Pages = {179-216},
Abstract = {We examine whether politically irrelevant events can cause conflicts, by
   analyzing the effects of professional football games in Europe on
   protests in Africa-an unintended spillover across the continents. By
   expanding psychological theories, we argue that the outcomes of the
   football games in Europe can affect African people's subjective
   evaluation of domestic politicians, which in turn can trigger protests.
   By exploiting as-if random variation in the results of 15,102 close
   football games conditional on betting odds, we find that compared to
   draw games, close losses of African players' teams increase peaceful
   protests in their original countries while not changing the likelihood
   of riots or armed conflicts. The effect is particularly large for
   non-ethnic protests targeted at a central government. Close losses also
   temporarily decrease people's trust in their country's leader. By
   contrast, close victories do not have equivalent or compensating effects
   on protests or public opinion. These results suggest asymmetric
   misattribution: people in Africa unreasonably blame domestic politicians
   for bad luck in European football games, prompting protests; but they do
   not credit politicians with football victories.},

Abstract = {In recent years there has been increasing interest in the interactions
   and relationships between victims of armed conflict and former members
   of armed nonstate actors. For many survivors, a critical element of
   restoration and repair is coming to terms with the violence that was
   visited upon them. At the same time, many of those who took part in acts
   of violence have sought to account for and apologize for their
   behavior-to unburden themselves of their knowledge, recover their own
   lost humanity, and be reconciled with those whom they victimized. The
   victim and the perpetrator are both vital elements in any effort at
   truth telling and reconciliation and ultimately the successful
   reincorporation of ex-combatants into the population. The method used by
   Aulas de Paz (Classrooms of Peace) in Colombia is effective in fostering
   interaction between ex-combatants and victims that can contribute to
   truth, forgiveness, and reconciliation. It is a theoretically grounded
   strategy of individual and collective healing that can help advance
   restorative justice in states affected by armed conflict. Los ultimos
   anos han visto un creciente interes en las interacciones y relaciones
   entre victimas de conflictos armados y antiguos miembros de actores
   armados no estatales. Para muchos sobrevivientes, aceptar la violencia
   que se les impuso resulta un elemento critico para la restauracion y
   reparacion. Al mismo tiempo, muchos de quienes participaron en actos de
   violencia han buscado rendir cuentas y disculparse por su comportamiento
   con el objeto de librarse de su conocimiento, recuperar la propia
   humanidad perdida y reconciliarse con aquellos a quienes victimizaron.
   La victima y el perpetrador son elementos vitales en cualquier esfuerzo
   por hablar la verdad, fomentar la reconciliacion y, en ultima instancia,
   reincorporarar exitosamente a los excombatientes a la poblacion. El
   metodo utilizado por Aulas de Paz en Colombia fomenta de manera efectiva
   la interaccion entre excombatientes y victimas, asunto que puede
   contribuir a la verdad, el perdon y la reconciliacion. Se trata de una
   estrategia teoricamente fundamentada de sanacion individual y colectiva
   que puede promover la justicia restaurativa en los estados afectados por
   conflictos armados.},

Abstract = {This article belongs to the special cluster, ``Biographies of Belonging
   in the Holocaust{''}, guest-edited by Natalia Aleksiun and Hana
   Kubatova. This article examines the life story of Felicia Carmelly, a
   Holocaust survivor from southern Bukovina, and follows her geographic
   and demographic journey from Dorna to the deadly camps of Transnistria,
   to postwar Romania and Israel, and finally to contemporary Canada. By
   close reading of her two oral interviews and her later memoirs, it
   reconstructs a particular biography shaped by the violent uprooting of
   Felicia and her family from the places she called home and discusses
   multiple shifts in her identity and a changing sense of belonging. Her
   life offers us a window into the broader questions about Jewish
   survivors and migrants after World War II, the inherent contradictions

Abstract = {This article examines the responses of the US Chamber of Commerce and
   state- and local-level chambers of commerce to Black Lives Matter (BLM).
   The US Chamber of Commerce's Equality of Opportunity Initiative stresses
   the business case for racial equity and the economic benefits that can
   be attained by overcoming race-related inequalities. Many chambers are
   adopting racially progressive positions, often at some cost to
   themselves. This article contributes a typology of stances and actions
   and draws on interviews with American business leaders to characterize
   American business organization responses to BLM. There is some movement
   beyond a progressive neoliberal vision of nondiscrimination to
   acknowledge that it is necessary to ``level the playing field.{''} And
   the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives of state- and
   regional-level chambers suggest that they are making genuine and, in
   some cases, bold and meaningful attempts to advance the cause of racial
   equity. The evidence suggests that popular mobilization and social
   pressure following George Floyd's brutal murder played a critical role
   in enabling this progress. However, the parallels and similarities
   between current chamber and business DEI efforts and business stances in
   the tumultuous 1960s and 1970s raise the question: Can current efforts
   succeed where previous efforts have failed?},

Abstract = {As a global problem with diverse local and regional impacts, climate
   change is an inherently multilevel issue. Focusing on Atlantic Canada,
   we examine regional-local dimensions of Canadian climate politics,
   drawing on data from six legacy newspapers (two national outlets, four
   regional outlets). Claims about the importance of provincial governments
   and municipalities have low levels of media visibility and are more
   salient in regional news outlets. However, federal, provincial, local
   government and political party sources articulate the ideas that
   regional and local actors have important roles to play in climate
   action. While these ideas are not highly visible, they are diffuse and
   high consensus across multilevel political, civil society, and other
   actors. Articulations of the importance of regional and local climate
   governance tend to connect this with issues of carbon pricing and other
   economic dimensions of climate governance. While a few municipal actors
   are highly visible in the mediated policy network, local policy actors
   tend to receive little visibility in either national or regional media
   spheres. By contrast, regional actors from provincial governments and
   political parties are among the top tier of actors in both national and
   provincial media. Our analysis highlights the significance of regional
   political arenas and actors that have received less attention than
   national governments or municipalities as sites of climate governance.},

Abstract = {This article examines the religious conditions in Post-Stalinist
   Czechoslovakia on the example of the Pentecostal movement. It enlarges
   the classical research scope done on a church-state axis by focusing on
   a minority religious group, which is not only oppressed by the system
   driven by atheistic imperatives but also must compete with the rival
   religious organization. By using the concept of the religious field, the
   study argues that the state socialist system was caught between two
   different roles. The state tried to diminish the belief in God, but also
   it was supposed to operate as a guarantor of religious life. The state
   division of roles enabled believers to take an active part in
   negotiating their religious independence and even when they failed, it
   shows that they were not passive objects controlled by the state, but
   active actors with an agency of their own.},

Abstract = {Objective/Context: This study seeks to explore the relationship between
   the conversation that has taken place on the social network Twitter
   about Venezuelan migration and its influence on the public agenda in
   South American countries. Methodology: For data collection, the Crimson
   Hexagon (CH) platform was used, which allows for analyzing the social
   network Twitter and identifying publications related to the Venezuelan
   migration conversation. The algorithm randomly selects a compendium of
   tweets from a specific period (from January 2, 2014, to August 31,
   2019), identifying a set of keywords related to each country's
   linguistic references to Venezuelan migrants, the language (Spanish and
   Portuguese), and the geographical origin of the tweet, in this case,
   nine countries in South America, to carry out a quantitative descriptive
   analysis of the findings. Conclusions: Based on the outset, a
   neutral-negative feeling can be identified. In countries governed by
   right-wing politicians, there is a greater volume of conversation, and
   the topic occupies a more relevant space within the public agenda,
   suggesting that this issue can be used politically and electorally by
   these ideological tendencies. Originality: This research starts with a
   reflection on one of the most important events that has impacted South
   America from the political sphere to public order: the Venezuelan
   migratory wave. However, this event is used by current governments to
   influence their public agenda and strengthen their political positions.},

Abstract = {In recent years, researchers have investigated many cases of new left
   social movements' ``electoral turns{''} in relatively favourable
   contexts that are open for new actors. This article explains how new
   left movements decide to enter the electoral competition despite an
   unfavourable context and low electoral prospects, based on the case
   study of ``Do Not Let Belgrade D(r)own{''}, a municipalist initiative in
   Serbia. The article investigates in particular the role of eventful
   protests in changing activists' perceptions of the electoral strategy
   and describes activists' strategic framing in communicating the
   ``electoral turn{''}.},

Abstract = {How does political imprisonment influence anti-regime protest? We argue
   that political imprisonment facilitates rather than stifles protest.
   Political imprisonment is a salient indicator of arbitrary rule creating
   `embodied grievances'. It enables the formation of dissident networks
   within prisons, and serves as a legitimating credential for former
   inmates to lead resistance. These mechanisms imply that political
   imprisonment is a self-defeating strategy, making it easier for the
   opposition to overcome their collective action problem. We test our
   argument with subnational data from the German Democratic Republic
   between 1984 and 1989. To account for endogenous latent dissent, we use
   originally collected archival data on local surveillance operations.
   Exploiting daily variation in the timing of protests in 1989, we analyze
   the long-term impact of political imprisonment on mobilization. Results
   from survival analyses lend support to our hypothesized relationship.
   Combined with semi-structured interviews to probe our mechanisms, our
   findings suggest that political imprisonment increases the likelihood of
   protest mobilization.},

   Dampening Anti-Government Protests in Turkey},
Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},

Abstract = {Mass protests frequently occur in electoral autocracies. However, the
   opposite is true in Turkey, despite mounting grievances and a strong
   opposition presence with institutional resources. We argue that
   competitive authoritarian regimes, a subset of electoral autocracies,
   may dampen mass protests, allowing the opposition an opportunity to
   defeat the incumbents through elections. Studying Turkey's main
   opposition party, we identify three mechanisms that show how politicians
   strategically respond to the regime's incentives and constraints leading
   to protest-averse behaviour. First, the regime's repression capacity
   discourages the opposition from openly supporting a mass protest.
   Second, the opposition learns to target the median voter, which leads to
   political moderation and protest averseness. Finally, prospective
   electoral success reinforces the opposition's commitment to a
   ballot-centred approach.},

Title = {Why Costly Rivalry Disputes Persist: A Paired Conjoint Experiment in
   Japan and South Korea},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},

Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {The literature suggests that voters have a self-centered incentive to
   call for the de-escalation of conflicts that inflict economic costs on
   them, which explains why economic sanctions and trade wars often lose
   popular support when the resulting cost for the domestic economy rises.
   It is thus puzzling why some costly disputes between two advanced
   democracies are prolonged. Taking a psychological approach, we argue
   that nonviolent yet costly disputes between international rivals can
   fail to de-escalate because the perception of loss invokes anger and
   risk-taking attitudes. We test our argument using a paired conjoint
   experiment involving Japan and South Korea. We find that, in both
   countries, the public becomes more defiant and less supportive of
   de-escalating an ongoing dispute when informed about (1) the high cost
   of the trade restrictions on domestic firms, (2) international (i.e.,
   World Trade Organization) support for the rival country, and (3) the
   rival public's hardline stance on the dispute. These findings lend
   support to our psychological explanation.},

Abstract = {Research in public administration examining the effects of diversity on
   public organizational performance has produced mixed results. However,
   the lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework has failed to provide
   an explanation for the mixed diversity effects. This study introduces a
   systematic analytical model, Categorization-Elaboration Model (CEM), to
   help identify the contextual constructs which can promote the positive
   effects of diversity on public organizational performance. A
   meta-analysis is conducted on 37 quantitative studies to test the
   empirical validity of a CEM constructed theoretical model with 253
   effect sizes which will promote a better understanding of the
   circumstances or contexts that lead to the benefits of diversity within
   public sector organizations. The empirical results of meta-regression
   point to the appropriate range of contextual factors which can alleviate
   the potential negative effects of diversity and promote its overall
   positive effects.},

Title = {Affective polarization in crosscutting communication networks: Offline
   and online evidence from Spain},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {Despite its potentially pernicious consequences for social relations and
   democracy, the study of affective polarization has only recently
   proliferated. Thus, the reasons driving this development-or its
   consequences-are not yet adequately understood. This article addresses
   the role of one specific factor frequently discussed in both academic
   and popular debate-namely, the role of crosscutting communication among
   people of different political leanings. It is a longstanding notion that
   crosscutting communication is crucial to overcoming the prejudice,
   polarization, and attitudinal biases brought on by streamlined
   information diets. However, there is empirical evidence to suggest that
   crosscutting experiences sometimes elevate polarization-especially when
   individuals also have access to like-minded views and when disagreement
   is perceived as intense. The study sheds light on the connection by
   testing hypotheses about the association between crosscutting
   communication and affective polarization in both offline and online
   modalities of political communication. The empirical analyses were based
   on panel data from the E-DEM project covering a random sample of Spanish
   citizens interviewed up to three times between November 2018 and May
   2019-that is, the time running up to the Spanish national election in
   2019. The results suggest that individuals who reported engagement in
   face-to-face discussions with supporters of various parties
   (crosscutting discussions) during this time reported significantly lower
   levels of affective polarization compared to engagement in discussions
   with co-partisans exclusively. Online crosscutting and consensual
   discussion experiences, however, were linked to comparable levels of
   anti-out-group sentiment, suggesting that concerns about the impact of
   online communication being different from offline communication in
   general-and perhaps more harmful-may be overstated. Descriptive evidence
   furthermore indicates that most respondents who engaged in political
   discussions had experiences of discussions with both co-partisans and
   supporters of opposing parties rather than co-partisans exclusively.
   Again, this was true for offline and online communication alike. Insofar
   as the results translate to other contexts as well, they indicate that
   future efforts to explain any surges in affective polarization should
   primarily be focused on other areas of inquiry.},

Abstract = {This article examines policy feedback via economic behavior in the mass
   public, with a focus on consumption behavior. Do public policies affect
   the consumption behavior of mass publics and subsequent policymaking
   processes and outcomes? If so, how? I introduce a policy feedback model
   of consumption behavior in the mass public. Within this model, I advance
   a theoretical argument on the consequences of targeted cash assistance
   policies (TCAPs) for consumer spending behavior and government provision
   of basic utilities in developing countries. Using a randomized field
   experiment in Mexico and pre-post analysis, I find that TCAPs boost
   consumer spending on private access to basic utilities in the short term
   and reduce government provision of basic utilities in the medium term.
   The study pushes policy feedback theorists to think beyond the arena of
   mass politics, and the findings have important implications for social
   policy and human development in developing countries.},

Abstract = {In this article, we draw from qualitative interviews with political
   parties' representatives and a content analysis of party programs to
   identify how political parties frame animal welfare policies in Norway.
   In analyzing the framing of animal welfare and its significance for
   understanding agricultural post-exceptionalism, we found that though
   they frame animal welfare issues in conflicting ways, most see Norwegian
   animal welfare as reasonably good but perceive potential for
   improvement. They also generally understand societal claims as lacking
   or having an unclear factual basis, which has legitimized their
   nonaction as political parties. Even so, because of active new actors
   such as animal welfare organizations and retailers, the parties do not
   believe that public pressure will wane. Although introducing new farm
   animal welfare policies can represent a move towards post-exceptionalism
   in Europe's agri-food sector, the discourse on animal welfare policies
   amongst political parties implies that such is not the case in Norway.},

Abstract = {This introduction to the symposium on ``Robust politics and governance
   in turbulent times{''}; examines how different governance paradigms have
   conceptualized the relationship between order and disorder and stability
   and change. We selectively focus on two prominent and well-established
   paradigms-public bureaucracy and network governance-and then contrast
   them with a third emerging paradigm, robust governance that aims to
   provide stable conditions for the development of robust responses to
   heightened turbulence through a combination of flexible adaptation and
   proactive innovation. We account for the three governance paradigms one
   by one with a view to how they deal with turbulence. We then define
   robust governance, discuss its distinctiveness compared to crisis
   management, resilience and agile management, and investigate the
   conditions and strategies for pursuing it. Finally, we endeavor to
   incorporate the findings of the symposium articles into the new and
   emerging perspective on how to advance robust governance in times of
   turbulence.},

Abstract = {In line with the orientation of EU economic policy, the Spanish
   government has favoured a strategy of internal devaluation as a way of
   adjusting price levels within the currency union and offsetting the fall
   in competitiveness accumulated over time, as evidenced by the persistent
   trade deficit. The results of comparative empirical studies indicate
   that the internal wage devaluation applied in Spain as a crisis exit
   strategy (in the form of labour reforms and, in general, measures to
   contain labour costs) does not seem to have attained the desired goals
   in terms of reducing the relative prices of exports and consolidating a
   model of growth based on external demand. Indeed, the estimates drawn up
   show that tailwinds - the depreciation of the euro as a result of the
   measures taken by the ECB, greater economic activity by trading partners
   and the fall in the price of oil - exercised a decisive influence in the
   trends followed by the prices of exports and the balance of trade during
   the period of crisis management in Spain.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe aim of the paper is to analyse the prevalence of corruption
   in Malaysia since 2004 in relation to political leadership,
   implementation of anti-corruption measures and the political and
   business culture based on money politics.Design/methodology/approachThe
   paper draws from the information and data provided by the Malaysian
   Anti-Corruption Commission, the Malaysian government, international
   organisations, media reports, and academic papers.FindingsThe paper
   analyses the perceived extent of corruption in Malaysia by examining how
   successive governments have dealt with the problem through a wide range
   of measures. Corruption remains widespread because of ineffective
   implementation, a culture of money politics based on mutually beneficial
   crony associations between political actors and business leaders,
   political interference to frustrate enforcement against corruption
   offenders, especially prominent personalities, and the mixed impact of
   corruption prevention measures. The paper concludes that the political
   and business culture and the nature of political leadership have eroded
   the political will to combat grand corruption in
   Malaysia.Originality/valueThis paper builds on previous research on
   corruption in Malaysia and highlights the combined negative impact of
   political leadership and a business and political culture that tolerates
   and espouses corruption, especially through money politics, and the
   consequent weak political will for tackling grand corruption.},

Abstract = {Brazil's evolution as a regional emerging power began under Lula's
   leadership and declined with Rousseff's dismissal and the domestic
   political, economic, and leadership crisis that led to its loss of
   regional relevance, the deterioration of its leadership in South
   America, and its failure to achieve a strategic international alliance
   of middle powers. This decline was expressed on the international level
   in the core-periphery bond developed with China within BRICS and on the
   level of South America in the loss of relevance of the regional
   governance institutions Lula once promoted. La evolucion de Brasil como
   potencia emergente regional empezo bajo el gobierno de Lula y declino
   con la destitucion de Rousseff y la externalizacion de la crisis
   politica, economica y de liderazgo interna y la consiguiente perdida de
   relevancia regional, el deterioro de su liderazgo en Sudamerica y el
   fracaso de objetivos en su alianza internacional de potencias medias.
   Las manifestaciones de la declinacion a nivel internacional se expresan
   en el vinculo de caracter centro-periferia desarrollado con China al
   interior de BRICS y a nivel sudamericano en la perdida de relevancia de
   las instituciones de gobernabilidad regional que Lula habia impulsado.},

Abstract = {The concept of Government as a Platform (GaaP) has recently encountered
   setbacks in practice worldwide. While existing literature on
   inter-governmental collaboration has emphasized organizational
   restructuring and data sharing, this study argues that a pragmatic way
   to improve administrative efficiency in the absence of formal
   institutional change is to adopt an alternative model to GaaP:
   platform-enabled government. Enabled by innovations of the middle-tier
   platform, this new model of platform governance integrates the functions
   of distributed systems of multiple departments into a sequential
   workflow without the requirement of institutional reform or sharing
   proprietary data. To demonstrate how this model facilitates information
   flow across institutional boundaries and improves collaborative
   governance, we analyze horizontal, vertical, and public-private
   collaboration using a diverse case study design. We examine
   administrative review, law enforcement, and contact tracing during the
   pandemic in the context of China. Our findings suggest accommodating
   institutional boundaries is a practical and effective approach to
   advance the digital government agenda in decentralized contexts.},

Abstract = {Nigeria's current democratic dispensation is plagued by a rise in ethnic
   nationalism, agitations for self-determination and secession, claims of
   marginalisation, and ethnic, regional and religious tensions. These
   issues continually dominate state politics. For some analysts, these
   problems are symptoms of a lack of oneness among the multiple
   ethno-linguistic and religious groups that make up the country. They are
   of the view that the solution to the intractable problems lies in
   nation-building, suggesting the enthronement of a sense of common
   nationality. On the contrary, this article argues that the lack of
   national consciousness for a nation may not be the main problem but the
   lack of viable institutions that can promote deep inter-ethnic
   relations. State-(re)building in the form of institution-strengthening
   is rather important for unity in the plural society. Therefore, the
   creation of new institutions and the strengthening of existing ones,
   including the federal system, to produce a viable Nigerian state capable
   of delivering on public goods and good governance is more important to
   address the many challenges confronting the state.},

Abstract = {The UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) is
   at the heart of the UN's follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda and the
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Analysing the first full cycle of
   the HLPF (2016-19), we ask what and how the HLPF delivers. In the early
   debates on its mandate, experts suggested that the HLPF could be an
   orchestrator, arguing that it would likely have to rely upon indirect
   and non-hierarchical forms of governance. Others asked for more or
   expected less. For the analysis of the HLPF's (orchestration) qualities,
   we study the proceedings of the HLPF and specifically the HLPF's review
   of SDG 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions, one of the most
   contested goals and therefore an interesting hard case. Taken together,
   DESA as the secretariat of the HLPF does indeed use orchestration to
   make the most out of the forum's mandate, both through convening and
   shaping third actors' activities. Political conflicts and limited
   resources, however, negatively impact what they can do and what the HLPF
   can deliver. The results of the UN's recent negotiations on the review
   of the HLPF's `format and organizational aspects' (2020-21) did not
   change that.},

Abstract = {The heterogeneity of foreign policy preferences has hampered a more
   effective Common Foreign and Security Policy. We examine the
   dimensionality of the EU foreign policy space by analyzing foreign
   policy votes in the European Parliament (1999-2019). As it contains the
   EU's full geographical and ideological diversity, it is an important
   laboratory for testing expectations about what predicts foreign policy
   positions. Party ideologies structure voting on foreign policy:
   party-political disagreements over the CFSP and military interventions
   matter more on foreign policy votes than others. The left-right
   dimension and the EU integration dimension still explain a considerable
   share of voting patterns, although they matter less on foreign policy
   votes than others.},

Title = {Membership Has Its Privileges: Targeted Killing Norms and the Firewall
   of International Society},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},

Month = {JUL 18},
Abstract = {There has been a long-standing debate over the ethics of targeted
   killing, with many scholars voicing concern over whether technological
   advancements and normative change are driving the normalization of these
   operations. Framed through social constructivism, they argue that the
   persistent use of these operations, combined with a lack of vocal
   opposition among states, makes a global norm cascade in favor of
   targeted killing increasingly possible. However, given the increasing
   number of states that have conducted these operations persistently over
   the past twenty years, why are these operations still bounded to violent
   non-state actors? This paper puts forward an alternative perspective
   that explains the bounded persistence of these operations via a novel
   construction of the international society/international system
   distinction found in the English School of International Politics. It
   argues that international society acts as a firewall against the
   generalization of these practices, compartmentalizing the potential norm
   erosion. In doing so, this paper not only reintroduces the theoretical
   utility of one of the more fundamental theoretical contributions of the
   English School, but also provides a new framework to understand
   interactions between members of international society and other violent
   non-state actors.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the patron-client relationship (PCR) between
   Turkey and Northern Cyprus. The PCR becomes visible in asymmetrically
   configured reciprocal exchanges that create dependence on patron states.
   These exchanges may motivate de facto states to defy, dictate, or demand
   patronage from their patron states, depending on their ontological
   insecurities, which are expressed both by the public in general and by
   the political elite in particular. The paper investigates the elite
   navigations that occur when de facto authorities prioritize local
   political interests to compensate for the failure of self-realization
   stemming from non-recognition or when they seek to mitigate external
   dominance.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate how different types of right parties
   affect immigrant welfare rights across 14 countries (1980-2018) in a
   comprehensive mixed-method study. We argue that populist radical right
   parties (PRRPs) support retrenchment, liberals and conservatives oppose
   expansions, and Christian democrats rather protect or expand rights.
   Accordingly, we expect conservatives and liberals to be more receptive
   to both direct and indirect influence of PRRPs than Christian democrats.
   We apply balanced panel regressions, and also include interactions with
   immigration indicators. Changes in immigrant welfare rights are measured
   using a new and encompassing dataset (MigSP), that maps immigrant
   welfare rights in 14 countries over 38 years. Furthermore, we
   qualitatively assess model-based selected cabinets in Denmark. Our
   evidence confirms pronounced differences between different right-wing
   parties. PRRPs are systematic propellers of cutting rights and affect
   all mainstream right parties when governing together. Christian
   democrats are the least likely to conduct retrenchments. We find no
   quantitative evidence for the indirect effects of PRRPs (contagion) and
   immigration dynamics. The case study evidence, however, points to the
   importance of both factors and discusses why indirect partisan effects
   (contagion) and the politicisation of immigration are very difficult to
   address in the standard regression framework.},

Abstract = {While research into why repression/human rights violation goes up or
   down has thrived over the past 50 years, essentially no effort has been
   made to examine what stops this behavior once under way - especially
   activity that is large-scale as well as violent. To address this topic,
   we put forward the idea of a repressive spell (similar to that in the
   study of war, civil war, and terrorism) and a new theoretical framework
   that conceptualizes repression as a sticky process that is unlikely to
   terminate unless it is disturbed in some manner. Such an orientation is
   important because it leads us to conclude that disturbance is more
   likely to happen under situations of democratization compared to any of
   the factors typically highlighted in the literature and relevant policy
   community. Investigating a new database regarding 239 large-scale
   repression spells from 1976 to 2006, we find that democratization is
   associated with spell-termination and there is little systematic
   pacifying influence from anything else. Additionally, we find that
   nonviolent movements for change principally drive democratization but
   that these movements have little direct impact on state repression
   spells in and of themselves.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have posited that elites are willing to advance the
   redistribution of income and social goods when the negative effects of
   inequality, such as crime and conflict, threaten their own interests.
   Although elites acknowledge these negative effects, their support for
   redistributive policies remains low throughout the Global South. We
   address this paradox using a multi-method research design. Drawing on 56
   in-depth interviews with Brazilian political and economic elites, we
   document how, when discussing the negative effects of inequality,
   interviewees consistently characterized the poor as ignorant, irrational
   and politically incompetent. We use these findings to theorize about the
   negative impact of such perceptions of the poor on elite support for
   redistribution. We then test this relationship using survey data
   gathered from random samples of political and economic elites in Brazil,
   South Africa and Uruguay (N = 544). We find the relationship to be
   robust.},

Abstract = {The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is thought to have
   shaped constitutions profoundly since its adoption in 1948. The authors
   identify two empirical implications that should follow from such
   influence. First, UDHR content should be reflected in subsequent
   national constitutions. Second, such reflections should bear the
   particular marks of the UDHR itself, not those of the postwar zeitgeist
   more broadly. The authors examine the historical evidence at various
   levels to identify and untangle the UDHR's impact. In a macro analysis,
   they leverage an original data set on the content of constitutions since
   1789. They explore historical patterns in the creation and spread of
   rights, and test whether 1948 exhibits a noticeable disruption in rights
   provision. The authors build a multivariate model that predicts rights
   provision with constitution- and rights-level covariates. To gain
   further analytic leverage, they unearth the process that produced the
   UDHR and identify plausible alternative formulations evident in a set of
   discarded proposals. The authors further test the plausibility of UDHR
   influence by searching for direct references to the document in
   subsequent constitutional texts and constitutional proceedings. The
   evidence suggests that the UDHR significantly accelerated the adoption
   of a particular set of constitutional rights.},

Title = {Implementation of Public Policies. Perspective of the Street Level
   Bureaucrats. A Re(view)},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The problems of public policy implementation, which arose in the North
   American school, have been and are a topic of concern for academics and
   scholars, giving rise to several approaches of analysis. The common
   denominator is the gap between policy objectives and their achievements.
   This gave rise to the so-called first-generation studies, which
   originate in the hierarchical or ``top-down{''} view, based on the
   policy-administration dichotomy. The second generation of studies
   inverts the focus of the previous analysis and places it at the base of
   the organizational pyramid, giving rise to the ``bottom-up{''}
   perspective. This is where the interest of this study is oriented,
   specifically from the proposal of Lipsky (1971 and 1980), who
   characterizes and defines public administration personnel at the base
   level as Street Level Bureaucrats (SLBs), defining the meeting space
   between bureaucrats and citizens (State and society), where public
   policies are considered to be executed. From there, multiple studies
   were generated, mainly in the United States and Northern Europe.
   However, in Latin America, empirical research on the subject is scarcer.
   The importance of the approach lies in the possibility of giving
   visibility to the problem of distribution of social services in a
   regional context with the need to overcome growing poverty and the
   problems of public management of most countries in low-income contexts.
   The paper proposes to review the Street Level Bureaucracy approach and
   of the most outstanding empirical works in relation to the
   implementation of social policies, both in the most widely applied
   countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Northern
   Europe, as well as in Latin American countries. The main interest is
   focused on the different institutional contexts of application of the
   theory and its divergences. The conclusions show the different
   trajectories, the evolution and expansion over time of the original
   version of the approach. Also, the need to expand research in Latin
   America, with adaptations to the context, without resigning
   institutional aspects.},

Title = {Can loyal party members be flexible negotiators? Impacts of constituent
   support, term limits and bipartisan roles},

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to conduct two experiments to provide insight
   into the impacts of Congressional party loyalty on negotiating
   flexibility. Constituent support, term limits and bipartisan roles were
   explored as possible moderators of polarization in American political
   negotiations. Design/methodology/approach Experiment 1 used a 2 (party
   loyalty: loyal/thoughtful) x 2 (constituent support: consistent/mixed
   districts) experimental design. In experiment 2, party loyalty was
   constant, and participants were assigned to one of four conditions
   created by a 2 (term limits: restricted/not restricted) x 2 (role:
   coordinator/whip) design. In both experiments, flexibility was measured
   as the percentage of movement on four key budget allocation issues.
   Participants were recruited using Prolific. Findings Experiment 1
   demonstrated that loyalty produced less flexibility, particularly with
   regard to one's own preferred issues. Constituent support did not
   influence flexibility. The second experiment found that absence of term
   limits and presence of bipartisan roles resulted in more movement on the
   other's preferred issues. Research limitations/implications While the
   authors' manipulations have experimental validity, further field
   research is suggested to assess the fidelity of the authors' simulation
   and the ecological validity of the experimental findings. Practical
   implications These findings extend the list of situational levers that
   impact negotiation flexibility. In particular, based on the authors'
   findings, embedding bipartisan roles into traditional Congressional
   processes could help increase negotiating flexibility and cooperation.
   Originality/value Both the experimental task and variables manipulated
   in these experiments are embedded in a US Congressional context.},

Abstract = {How can areas of potential agreement be identified and endorsed by
   citizens in protracted conflicts? In an effort to answer this question,
   the article introduces a conjoint experiment across the ethnically and
   territorially split communities of Cyprus and tests a range of
   hypotheses about the structure of public opinion with respect to a
   future settlement. We test hypotheses on security and credible
   commitments, the legacy of past negotiations, as well as transitional
   justice mechanisms following United Nations plans to mediate the
   conflict between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Contrary to conventional
   wisdom, we demonstrate that a zone of possible agreement (ZOPA) exists
   from a public opinion perspective. We specifically explore power-sharing
   in the context of security, provisions for the internally displaced,
   federal courts, and territorial readjustments and highlight their
   relative importance for public opinion interventions across
   conflict-ridden societies.},

Abstract = {Research on postwar peace focuses primarily on how elites and
   institutions can prevent relapse into civil war. In line with this
   special issue's focus on citizens' experiences, we take a micro-level
   approach to explore peace beyond the absence of war. We investigate how
   members of opposing sides experience peace a decade after a decisive
   victory of the majority. Using original survey data from a
   representative sample of 2000 respondents in 2018 Sri Lanka, we find
   that even one decade after the conflict members of the Sinhalese winning
   majority are consistently more likely to report improvements in peace
   than Tamils, who were represented by the defeated minority. But the
   benefit of a ``victor's peace{''} does not seem to translate into an
   optimistic outlook of the victorious group, nor does it increase
   people's endorsement for repressive state measures. Despite the
   drastically improved physical security for the defeated ethnic minority
   since the war, they experience a deterioration in other dimensions of
   peace. Our findings have important implications for a deeper
   understanding of variations in peace and reconciliation processes.},

Abstract = {Public investment spending declined steadily in advanced economies
   during the last three decades. Germany is a case in point where the
   aggregate decline coincided with growing inequality in investments
   across districts. What explains the variation in local investment
   spending? We assembled a novel data set to investigate the effects of
   structural constraints and partisanship on German districts' investment
   spending from 1995 to 2018. We find that the lack of fiscal and
   administrative capacity significantly influences local investment
   patterns. Yet, within these constraints, partisanship matters.
   Conservative politicians tend to prioritize public investment more than
   the left. This is especially the case when revenues from local taxes are
   low. As the fiscal conditions improve, left-wing politicians increase
   investment more strongly and hence the difference between the left and
   the right disappears. Our findings are indicative of how regional
   economic divergence can emerge even within cooperative federal systems
   and show that, even when decision-makers operate under various
   institutional and structural constraints, partisanship matters for how
   these actors allocate discretionary spending.},

Abstract = {Scholars of the renowned Colombian sociologist and cofounder of
   participatory action research Orlando Fals Borda (1925-2008) have
   generally acknowledged that both his Presbyterian upbringing and his
   friendship with the Catholic priest Camilo Torres strongly influenced
   his thinking and writing. An examination of the way this religious
   background appears in his early academic writing both extends and
   refines this more conventional view by considering how his involvement
   in religious matters influenced his understanding of what social change
   was and hence of his role as a sociologist committed to it. Analysis of
   the complex network of knowledges and relations articulated with regard
   to Fals Borda's involvement with religious matters during a crucial
   stage of his intellectual history sheds light on the close relation
   between ethics, social research, and politics at the basis of
   participatory action research. Eestudiosos del reconocido sociologo

   Orlando Fals Borda (1925-2008) suelen reconocer que tanto su educacion
   presbiteriana como su amistad con el sacerdote catolico Camilo Torres
   influyeron fuertemente en su pensamiento y escritura. Una investigacion
   de la forma en que este trasfondo religioso aparece en su escritura
   academica temprana extiende y refina esta percepcion un tanto
   convencional al considerar como su participacion en asuntos religiosos
   influyo en su comprension de lo que implicaba el cambio social y, por lo
   tanto, de su papel como sociologo comprometido. El analisis de la
   compleja red de conocimientos y relaciones articuladas en torno a la
   participacion de Fals Borda en asuntos religiosos durante un periodo
   crucial de su historia intelectual arroja lluz sobre la estrecha
   relacion entre la etica, la investigacion y la politica que forma la
   base de la investigacion accion participativa.},

Title = {Who Securitizes? Climate Change Discourse in the United Nations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {When and why do states reframe issues as security problems? Which states
   advocate for these shifts? While securitization theory predicts that
   states that are existentially threatened by a problem are most likely to
   attempt to securitize it, I argue that accounting for the dynamics of
   institutional agendas can better explain this phenomenon. States that
   stand to gain agenda control as a result of securitization are likely to
   rhetorically attempt to securitize, while those that are materially
   interested in the issue are less likely to do so. I test this theory in
   the case of the climate change in the United Nations, leveraging data on
   speeches in the General Assembly. I provide the first quantitative test
   of the securitization of climate politics, finding that P5 states
   securitize to expand their agenda control, while Small Island Developing
   States do not securitize, contra previous expectations. I further find
   that the overall climate discourse cannot be characterized as
   securitized. These findings imply that the Security Council is unlikely
   to be significantly involved in climate change policy and also
   demonstrate the importance of rhetoric for political outcomes and for
   the distribution of state power within international organizations.},

Abstract = {In the World Trade Organization (WTO), the co-sponsors of the Joint
   Initiative on Services Domestic Regulation signed the Declaration at the
   conclusion of the negotiations. Incorporating disciplines developed by a
   group of members into the WTO rulebook is fraught with certain
   difficulties because of the plurilateral nature of the outcome and
   possible resistance from non-participating WTO members. Russia is a
   member of this initiative, which aims to reduce regulatory barriers to
   trade in services and does not address market access issues. Despite the
   significant role of the service sector in the economy, Russia faces
   systemic restrictions on increasing services trade, although the need to
   change the structure of foreign trade and diversify the economy has long
   been overdue. The paper argues that the implementation of disciplines in
   line with the common intention to improve domestic regulation will help
   improve Russia's trade in services performance and the business
   environment.},

Title = {Driving Global Convergence in Green Financial Policies: China as Policy
   Pioneer and the EU as Standard Setter},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {358-370},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although policies for green financial systems are proliferating across
   the globe, the dynamics shaping such policies remain inadequately
   understood. With China and the EU at the global forefront of green
   financial policies, this paper demonstrates how they each influence
   global policy norms through their distinct policy models. This
   contributes to the literature, first, by improving our understanding of
   the global green financial policy processes and, second, by challenging
   current expectations from the literature. Analysing three central policy
   areas (information disclosure, taxonomies, and central banking) from an
   institutional approach, the paper, first, finds that green financial
   policies are both proliferating and converging globally. Second, the
   paper finds that China pioneered policy types around 2015, creating an
   Overton Window. Subsequently, since 2018, the EU has been standardising
   policy contents within the policy types that China pioneered. The
   findings suggest that China acts as a policy pioneer through its
   top-down policy approach, whereas the EU acts as a standard setter
   through its bottom-up approach. Although this confirms the literature's
   expectation that the EU creates global standards, it challenges the
   expectation that China is both primarily a recipient of policy practice
   and too unique for other countries to learn from directly. In the
   broader context, the findings imply that the current global situation of
   competing political models may be an advantage as countries complement
   each other through both competition and collaboration. Efforts to align
   financial systems with sustainable development have moved from
   industry-led initiatives to state-led green financial policies, which
   are now proliferating and converging across the globe. China and the EU
   are the most influential actors in shaping how countries across the
   world use green financial policy because China acts as a policy pioneer
   based on its top-down policymaking model and the EU acts as a standard
   setter based on its bottom-up model. Although China and the EU have
   competing governance and policymaking models, their differences may have
   been an advantage to scaling up green financial policies as they
   complement each other through different roles. Awareness of their roles
   and different approaches should inform future China-EU policy
   coordination because harmonisation of practice remains a barrier to
   mainstreaming green finance. Other countries can benefit from awareness
   of policy developments in the EU and China to support their own policy
   development in terms of future scope and contents.},

Abstract = {Across many domains, the European Union relies on a system of regulatory
   network-based enforcement. National agencies work with peers to carry
   out on-the-ground implementation of supranational law. Network-based
   enforcement, however, raises concerns including regulatory capture and
   shirking. We explore how a novel governance tool - arbitrage mitigation
   mechanisms - may address some of these issues. These mechanisms are
   formal institutional procedures, which attempt to generate equivalent
   application of EU law for cross border regulation, and include
   horizontal checks among regulatory peers as well as vertical checks that
   allow civil society to voice accountability concerns. To demonstrate the
   validity of our argument, we examine the General Data Protection
   Regulation (GDPR) and European privacy enforcement. Our study
   contributes to the understanding of enforcement and compliance in
   European regulatory networks and offers a more fine grained
   understanding of when and how European citizens' civil liberties will be
   upheld.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored emerging vulnerabilities in the US
   research and development (R\&D) ecosystem. While an open and
   collaborative environment has been essential for advancing R\&D, this
   approach exposes university-based R\&D to a variety of security threats
   including state-supported efforts, attacks by malicious actors, and
   insufficient internal mitigation. As the pandemic led to more remote
   work and online collaboration, the incidence of exploitation has
   expanded. Increased security measures are needed to insulate and protect
   the R\&D ecosystem, and US innovation more broadly, while maintaining
   the fundamental qualities that have contributed to its historical
   success. In this article, we present the Research Integrity Security
   Certification (RISC) framework. This concept preserves the autonomy of
   the US higher education system while also suggesting a mechanism whose
   effect would be a general enhancement of the security of the US
   university R\&D enterprise with minimal additional state involvement.
   Much of the work in the proposed model is done by market mechanisms and
   self-interested microeconomic calculations that generate beneficial
   aggregate effects. The RISC framework modernizes the university R\&D
   enterprise while strengthening it to operate in this evolving security
   environment.},

Abstract = {Twenty-six years after the Dayton Peace Agreement, Bosnia and
   Herzegovina's constitution has remained largely intact, despite a
   well-established consensus on the necessity of reforming the post-Dayton
   system. This article looks at the Prud and Butmir Processes, two of the
   last unsuccessful attempts at comprehensive constitutional reform, with
   a focus on the political elite from the Republika Srpska. We use
   securitization theory, combining content and discourse analyses, to
   understand how the Prud and Butmir Processes, and by extension the
   overall constitutional reform, were successfully framed as existential
   threats to the Republika Srpska by the ethnopolitical elite, justifying
   the continuation of conflict-perpetuating routines.},

Abstract = {Jose Carlos Mariategui's open engagement with Marxist theory and his
   adaptation of its ideas to his Latin American reality brought him into
   conflict with other leftists. At a continental conference of communist
   parties in Buenos Aires in 1929, he criticized the Comintern's proposal
   to carve up the Americas into independent African-descent and Quechua
   and Aymara republics, arguing that conceptualizing the struggle in
   ethnic rather than class terms was a mistake. From documents preserved
   in the Comintern archives it appears that these comments had echoes in
   Moscow. Two newly translated Spanish-language documents on the
   ``national question{''} challenge notions that Comintern officials were
   unaware of or ill-informed about developments in Latin America and are
   important to understanding their responses and challenges to his ideas
   on race and oppressed nationalities. El compromiso abierto de Jose
   Carlos Mariategui con la teoria marxista y su adaptacion de estas ideas
   a la realidad latinoamericana lo pusieron en conflicto con otras y otros
   de la izquierda. En una conferencia continental de partidos comunistas
   en Buenos Aires en 1929, critico la propuesta de la Internacional
   Comunista de dividir las Americas en republicas independientes
   afrodescendientes y quechuas y aymaras, argumentando que conceptualizar
   la lucha en terminos etnicos en lugar de terminos de clase era un error.
   Los documentos conservados en los archivos de la Internacional Comunista
   sugieren que estos comentarios hicieron eco en Moscu. Dos documentos en
   espanol recientemente traducidos en torno a la ``cuestion nacional{''}
   desafian las nociones de que los funcionarios de la Internacional
   Comunista no estaban al tanto o estaban mal informados sobre los
   acontecimientos en America Latina, asunto que resultan importante para
   comprender sus respuestas y desafios a las ideas de Mariategui sobre
   raza y nacionalidades oprimidas.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Many recorded roll calls in Congress each year are votes on bills that
   have no chance of becoming law, or are purely symbolic, or are
   procedural without policy content. Yet models of voting and measurement
   models of member preferences make assumptions that vote choices are
   largely about utility derived from policies. We consider the possibility
   that votes plausibly connected to policy and votes not plausibly
   connected to policy may have different data-generating processes and
   rely on different utility functions. Substantively, similarity across
   different contexts for policy change implies an importance of messaging
   over policy. Methodologically, similarity across these contexts is
   necessary to avoid biasing estimates of member preferences. We find that
   members' voting patterns are highly stable across contexts in which
   policy change is credible and not credible. This indicates that existing
   measures of ideal points are likely not dramatically biased by the
   inclusion of policy-irrelevant votes.},

Abstract = {As Latin America entered the turn to the left, there was a recovery and
   renewal of the work of Jose Carlos Mariategui. The ``practical
   socialism{''} that he advocated and led in the course of a short but
   brilliant political career (basically, the 1920s) has much to teach us
   today if set in its proper historical context and not reduced to
   catchphrases. Mariategui was, arguably, the first Marxist in Latin
   America, and his open, imaginative, transgressive, and energizing
   writings may well illuminate our paths in the 2020s. His was not a
   Marxist catechism but a living Marxism. What we can take from Mariategui
   is a grounded Marxism-devoid of all theoreticisms-that, understood in
   its historical context, may point toward a period of renewal after the
   seeming collapse of the left project to build a twenty-first-century
   socialism. A medida que America Latina dio un giro izquierdista se
   produjo una recuperacion y renovacion de la obra de Jose Carlos
   Mariategui. El ``socialismo practico{''} que el defendio y dirigio
   durante su corta pero brillante carrera politica (basicamente, la decada
   de 1920) tiene mucho que ensenarnos hoy si se mira en su contexto
   historico adecuado y no se reduce a frases hechas. Mariategui fue,
   posiblemente, el primer marxista latinoamericano y sus escritos
   abiertos, imaginativos, transgresores y llenos de energia bien pueden
   iluminar nuestro camino en la decada de 2020. El suyo no era un
   catecismo marxista sino un marxismo vivo. Lo que podemos tomar de
   Mariategui es un marxismo fundamentado, desprovisto de todo teoricismo
   que, entendido en su contexto historico, puede apuntar hacia un periodo
   de renovacion despues del aparente colapso del proyecto de izquierda
   para construir un socialismo del siglo XXI.},

Abstract = {Perceptions of governmental responsiveness matter because of their
   influence on the willingness of citizens to participate in politics and
   thereby express their interests and hold policymakers accountable. Where
   do external efficacy attitudes emerge? In recent years, scholars have
   examined this question by turning to personality traits, especially
   extraversion. Extant studies reveal a positive relationship between
   extraversion and external efficacy, but thus far they have focused on
   high-income democracies. How consistent are findings across countries
   with varying levels of political and economic development? In my view,
   the answer depends on the level of corruption and its implications for
   external efficacy. Where low (high) levels of bribery and other forms of
   malfeasance enable (impede) public influence on governmental
   decision-making, greater levels of extraversion will increase (decrease)
   perceptions of governmental responsiveness. I test my hypothesis with
   three sources of nationally representative survey data that include
   countries from North America, Latin America, and the Caribbean. My
   results have implications for the quality of democracy.},

Abstract = {This article describes how legal professionals and families contribute
   to the widening, legitimation and concealment of the gender wealth gap.
   It is based on ethnographic observation, study of legal files and
   statistical data on gender wealth inequality in France. Despite formally
   equal law, family wealth arrangements in moments of estate planning and
   marital breakdown tend to reproduce gender inequality. The main legal
   professionals involved are lawyers and notaries. In their interactions
   with family members, they carry out reversed accounting, a logic of
   practice in which the result comes first and computation comes after. As
   families and legal professionals strive to preserve real estate and
   businesses, or to minimize taxes, they produce inventories, estimations
   and distributions of assets which disadvantage women, even though shares
   appear to be formally equal. Female legal professionals, as well as
   female clients, may endorse this concern, and thus, also unwittingly
   contribute to the gender wealth gap.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has spurred a discussion about the role of the
   European Union (EU) in the governance of cross-border health threats.
   Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is another major global health challenge
   that requires international collective action to be resolved. By using
   survey data from experts on AMR from 29 European countries, this paper
   investigates the support for an increase in the power of EU over AMR.
   Based on insights from collective action theory, we hypothesize that
   experts who believe that other countries free ride, will be more
   supportive of EU as a Leviathan in the European response to AMR. The
   results show that the experts generally were strongly in favor of
   expanding the authority of the EU over AMR. Furthermore, in line with
   theoretical expectations, experts who think that other countries free
   ride, are particularly supportive of more EU power over AMR.},

Abstract = {Studies have investigated the equalizing effect of childcare provision
   and parental leave schemes on gendered work patterns. However, as the
   relationship between policies and individual time allocations to paid
   work is complex and challenging to empirically assess, previous research
   has clarified single aspects of this complexity. The present study
   theoretically and empirically combines a household perspective by
   considering the work behaviours of two partners within one household
   (i.e. a household's lived family model) with a comparative approach to
   systematically analyse relationships between specific policy designs and
   households' paid work patterns in a large sample. The findings imply
   that extensive childcare policies are systematically related to an
   egalitarian household organization, mostly among those with small
   children. This association can be observed across households with
   varying levels of egalitarian norms. Conversely, the findings suggest
   that the current design of parental leave policies in the 21 European
   countries does not allow for a true assessment of the potential of leave
   schemes to influence the within-household division of labor.},

Title = {Topology, Scene and Asymmetries in Security Provision in a Small South
   African City},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {14-23},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This paper builds on the notions of topology, scene and relationality in
   this special edition by highlighting asymmetries following from
   overdependence on private security companies (PSCs) in a settler
   colonial context. The locus is the JB Marks Municipality in South
   Africa. This municipality includes the historically white and
   middleclass town of Potchefstroom and the historically black township of
   Ikageng. These two scenes differentially address the gap left by an
   under-resourced state police. In Potchefstroom, PSCs, social media
   platforms and other infrastructures are intertwined with the sociality
   of daily life. In Ikageng, a `vigilante group', the Peri Peri, has
   attempted to fill a similar gap. While reliance on racist and classist
   state policing has been pointed out as problematic globally, this paper
   suggests that reliance on non-state policing may not be any less
   problematic. The paper argues that tacit and provisional acceptance,
   which can be withdrawn, of the technically extra-legal activities by
   non-state security providers, might, in the interim, be a pragmatic way
   to allow effective security provision by non-state actors. However,
   tacit approval is no substitute for addressing a broader topology of
   inequality and insecurity through macroeconomic and spatial
   transformation.},

Title = {International Bureaucrats and Organizational Performance.
   Country-Specific Knowledge and Sectoral Knowledge in World Bank Projects},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {International organizations (IOs) try to incorporate policy-specific
   best practices and country-specific knowledge to increase well-informed
   decision-making. However, the relative contribution of the two kinds of
   knowledge to organizational performance is insufficiently understood.
   The article addresses this gap by focusing on the role of staff in World
   Bank performance. It posits that country-specific knowledge, sectoral
   knowledge, and their combination positively contribute to World Bank
   projects. The argument is tested drawing on a novel database on the
   tenure, nationality, and educational background of World Bank Task Team
   Leaders. Three findings stand out. First, country-specific knowledge
   seems to matter on average, while sectoral knowledge does not. Second,
   there is some evidence that staff that combine both kinds of knowledge
   are empowered to make more positive contributions to performance. Third,
   the diversity and relevance of experience, not length of tenure, are
   associated with more success. The findings contribute to discussions on
   international bureaucracies by highlighting how differences between the
   knowledge of individual staff shape their decision-making and
   performance. IOs could better tap into the existing resources in their
   bureaucracies to enhance their performance by rotating staff less
   frequently between duty stations.},

Abstract = {Whereas populist citizens are usually described as being driven by
   individual discontent, this article builds on the notion that they are
   also spurred by sociotropic concerns. Taking the French Yellow Vests
   populist movement and its flagship referendum on popular initiative as a
   case study, we address the mechanism by which discontent is directed
   into an instrumental orientation, and how this mechanism translates into
   voting choice. Using a conjoint experiment, we find that a candidate
   supportive of citizen initiative referendum garners the most support,
   especially among protesters with strong people-centric attitudes, even
   when competing with a candidate signaling her ideological proximity by
   means of an antielite statement. Results therefore enrich extant
   literature on voter-politician congruency by suggesting that congruency
   between people-centrism and the prospects of more direct democracy is a
   way for populist citizens to make their vote choice.},

Title = {Does legal aid improve access to justice in `fragile' settings? Evidence
   from Burundi},

Abstract = {Access to justice is often described as key for building and
   consolidating peace and enhancing socio-economic development in fragile
   and post-conflict states. Since the 2000s, legal empowerment has been
   one of the most popular approaches to improve such access, and a growing
   literature has presented mixed evidence on the quality of its outcomes.
   We evaluate and discuss the impact of a locally provisioned legal aid
   program on justice-seekers' use of dispute resolution fora, legal
   agency, and trust in judicial institutions. The program was implemented
   between 2011 and 2014 in 26 municipalities of rural Burundi. We consider
   its effects on 486 beneficiaries using various propensity score-matching
   methods and data on non-beneficiaries from two distinct control groups
   (n = 3,267). Forty-eight interviews with key informants help discuss
   judicial practices. We find that the program increased the use of courts
   but not trust in the judiciary. It had no significant impact on the use
   of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Qualitative and
   quantitative evidence suggests that justice-seekers' perception of the
   treatment they received in courts, also known as procedural justice,
   shaped their perception of accessing justice. Qualitative evidence also
   points to a possible `watchdog effect': in some cases, the presence of a
   legal adviser may have pushed judges to better comply with procedures.
   While legal aid programs can improve access to courts, it does not
   necessarily mean an erosion of judicial `forum shopping' or that trust
   in state institutions is reinforced and rights fully realized.},

Abstract = {This article considers the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the
   UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement as a `flexible and imaginative' response to
   the problems that Brexit has created for the island of Ireland. It looks
   at the purpose of the Protocol and its origins, noting the reasons why
   flexibility was required from both sides. It then considers the ways in
   which precariousness from its conception has been demonstrated in its
   first year of operation. This focuses upon four main areas:
   implementation, dynamic alignment, the democratic consent vote, and the
   UK-EU relationship. Its core argument is the `flexibility' that the
   Protocol requires also means a certain degree of ambiguity. In the
   absence of a stable UK-EU relationship, this precariousness could
   exacerbate the difficulties of meeting the policy challenges that
   surround the Protocol for Northern Ireland, the UK, Ireland and the EU.},

Abstract = {The present study addresses the effect of the discourse of elites on
   Twitter on citizens' affective polarisation through a quasi-experiment
   that was embedded in a survey panel. Participants were invited to follow
   one of the Twitter accounts of nine candidates from the main political
   parties during the 2019 European Parliament electoral campaign in Spain.
   Experiment compliance among participants was confirmed using
   web-tracking data (passive metre). The results show that exposure to
   candidates' Twitter accounts by self-selection does not increase
   affective polarisation. Although high levels of polarisation might
   contribute to building echo chambers, the polarising content contained
   in the partisan Twitter accounts has no effect on increasing affective
   polarisation, even among those who strongly identify with such parties.
   This finding confirms the so-called limited media effect hypothesis for
   social media.},

Abstract = {Does media diet diversity influence affective polarisation of the
   public? To test this hypothesis we analyse data from Spain, which like
   other South European countries has a highly politicised media system.
   The study operationalises media diet diversity based on survey and
   web-tracking data. It considers diversity both in terms of the quantity
   of media consumed and exposure to opposing viewpoints using the two
   politico-ideological dimensions that conventionally define Spanish
   politics: left-right and centre-periphery. The results are rather
   complex and show certain ambivalence. As expected, a more diverse media
   diet generally tends to depolarise individuals; however, when
   considering the centre-periphery dimension, we find that media diet
   diversity can further exacerbate polarisation. That highlights the role
   identities can play as a potential source of polarisation.},

Abstract = {Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Kurdish women reported sexual violence
   in state custody during intense conflicts between the Turkish military
   and the guerrilla organization PKK. Drawing on archival research and
   in-depth interviews with lawyers and activists in Turkey, we trace the
   development of legal mobilization by human rights lawyers and activists
   who characterized state-led sexual violence in the Kurdish region as a
   war crime against women and brought cases before domestic courts and the
   European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Inspired by the work of Kerem
   Altiparmak, we develop the concept of ``legal exhaustion{''} to
   characterize the emotional and relational aspects of legal mobilization
   in the context of war and counterterrorism politics. Bringing together
   scholarship in sociolegal studies and critical approaches to human
   rights, we argue that legal exhaustion is productive-not just an
   unproductive and constraining state-prompting human rights lawyers to
   sustain legal mobilization in/outside courts and critique national and
   international laws.},

Abstract = {Why do major powers attempt foreign-imposed regime change (FIRC)? This
   article builds on existing security theory, proposing that a major power
   looks for signals that a government might exit that major power's
   international hierarchy and/or enter an adversary's hierarchy. Major
   powers are more likely to attempt FIRC against states that signal
   shifting preferences. The article tests the theory on American FIRC
   attempts from 1947 to 1989, covert and overt, failed and successful,
   proposing that when a hierarchy member or neutral state engaged in
   economic expropriation, this signaled possible exit from the US
   hierarchy and/or entry into the Soviet hierarchy, making a US FIRC
   attempt against that state more likely. It also presents an alternative
   theory, that economic special interests drove US FIRC attempts. Using
   new data on expropriations, the article supports the security theory, as
   expropriations by US hierarchy members made FIRC attempts more likely,
   but does not support the special interests theory.},

Abstract = {Despite helpful categorizations about the EU's role in external energy
   governance, more analysis is needed on the factors likely to enable or
   constrain the EU's actorness. This article builds on the theoretical
   framework of actorness as a heuristic device to assess the extent to
   which its different components of opportunity, capability, and presence
   impact on the EU's ability to be an actor in external energy governance.
   Looking at the case study of Nord Stream 2, the pipeline aiming to
   double the amount of energy transiting from Russia to Germany, the
   article argues that EU actorness depends on several constraining
   factors, such as the distribution of competence between the EU and its
   member states, the unwillingness of the latter to delegate competence to
   the former, and the existence of conflicting preferences across member
   states. The article applies a process-tracing method and builds on EU
   official documents, grey literature, and interview data.},

Abstract = {Although the amount of policy-relevant academic research has grown in
   recent years, studies still find that policy practitioners seldom employ
   such research in their decisionmaking. This study considers potential
   methods for increasing government officials' use of academic studies
   (impact evidence). We investigate how administrative accountability
   mechanisms as suggested by principal-agent approaches - screening,
   monitoring, autonomy and sanctions - correlate with practitioner
   engagement with impact evidence. Original survey data from 300
   government officials in two developing countries, Peru and India,
   suggest that all four mechanisms are correlated with self-reported
   interest in or use of impact evidence. When we measured the actual use
   of such evidence on a website we created to facilitate that outcome;
   however, we found that only sanctions (income) correlate with actual
   use. These findings highlight the potential of administrative
   accountability to increase bureaucrats' use of impact evidence but also
   warn of possible limitations.},

Abstract = {International election observation has become a standard practice in
   democratizing countries. Doubts have been cast on the ability of
   electoral observers to accurately judge the freedom and fairness of an
   electoral process, and the scholarly literature has still not reached a
   consensus on the unintended consequences of election observation. This
   article empirically tests the hypothesis that observers can deter
   election-day fraud through a natural experiment on polling-station-level
   election results. Using data from the Ukraine 2004 presidential
   election, it will show that OSCE/ODIHR observation has both immediate
   and lasting effect on domestic political actors' behavior. Results do
   support the usefulness of election observation in reducing election-day
   fraud.},

Abstract = {Finland promoted a value-based agenda as the President of the European
   Union (EU) Council in 2019. The focus was especially on the defence of
   the rule of law principle. A role as a strong value promoter departs
   from the pragmatic and cautious tradition of Finnish EU policy. In this
   article, I will ask why Finland chose to promote values, and what kind
   of political debate preceded its Presidency term. Second, I will look at
   the actual promotion of the common values during the Presidency. Third,
   I will provide some evaluations of the success of Finland's value-based
   approach. The analysis draws from comprehensive documentary sources
   related to Finnish EU policy and her Presidency term, and from 33
   semi-structured research interviews among the key Finnish politicians,
   civil servants and civil society organization representatives in 2020.
   The article shows that values were thoroughly debated before the term
   and their relevance increased as the Presidency approached. Finland also
   succeeded in promoting several values, especially by linking them to
   practical questions. The article argues that evaluating the success of
   Finland's approach is more contentious, which may be tackled several
   ways.},

Title = {Phronesis at the Human-Earth Nexus: Managed Retreat},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {FEB 24},
Abstract = {This study explores how experiences from the current pandemic can inform
   societal responses to future climate change. To that end, an established
   philosophical concept of geoscientific insights (geoethics) is utilized
   to advice on governance under systemic uncertainty that, in turn, is a
   critical feature of complex-adaptive dynamics. Illustrative examples are
   the Covid-19 health pandemic and the impact of the global sea-level rise
   to threatening heights in the early 22nd Century. The term
   ``geoethics{''} labels an emergent geo-philosophical school of thought
   rooted in geoscience expertise. When combined with contemporary
   political philosophies, geoethics leads to a geo-philosophical framework
   that can support adaptation to complex-adaptive dynamics by favoring
   multi-agent and context-depending processes (e.g., learning-by-doing).
   The proposed geo-philosophical framework merges geoethics with the
   political philosophies of H. Jonas (1903-1993), L. Kohlberg (1927-1987),
   and M. Bunge (1919-2020). These contemporary philosophies emphasize as
   relevant for achieving a modern caretaking society, respectively, ``the
   hierarchy of societal coordination processes,{''} ``the
   intergenerational responsibility of agents of change,{''} and ``the
   balancing of individual wellbeing (happiness) and duties.{''} When these
   philosophies are combined with geoethics, a logical approach can be
   derived for policy design and decision-making. It emphasizes the
   ``autonomy{''} (of the human agent) combined with a civic culture that
   favors ``trustworthiness,{''} ``scientific culture.{''} and a ``culture
   of inclusive justice.{''} We argue that governance of adaptation to
   complex-adaptive dynamics (e.g., climate change impact) can be informed
   by the geo- and society-centric perspectives of the proposed
   geo-philosophical framework. It can address ``Human Earth Nexus{''}
   governance issues using the knowledge of both natural and social
   sciences and applying the lens of geoethical thinking.},

Abstract = {This article uses a case study of Uganda to examine the contentious
   politics surrounding Indigenous land rights in contemporary Africa,
   notably regarding the right to `free, prior and informed consent'
   (FPIC). Drawing upon insights from recent fieldwork, it contrasts the
   diverse struggles of two of Uganda's most prominent Indigenous groups.
   Whereas the Batwa constitute a small group of (traditionally)
   hunter-gatherers from the southwestern District of Kisoro (and
   surrounding areas) who have low capacity to challenge the state, the
   Karamojong are a much larger group of agro-pastoralists from the
   northeastern region of Karamoja who have a long history of conflict and
   opposition to the central government. These cases highlight the
   diverging capacities of groups to protect their traditional lands, yet
   their shared struggle to secure both legal recognition as Indigenous and
   their right to FPIC from a hostile government. Given the obstacles
   facing these groups and the potential for FPIC to deepen cleavages
   between-and within-communities, the article concludes with some
   reflections for advancing the rights of Uganda's Indigenous peoples
   without enflaming the divisive identity politics that can accompany
   Indigenous land rights movements in certain political contexts.},

Abstract = {Situational awareness in the face of hybrid campaigns is undermined by
   `blind spots', which this article conceptualises. Blind spots are where
   legal or political frameworks preclude intelligence gathering below the
   threshold of war. Drawing on a historical case study of alterations in
   legislation and security police directives in Norway from 1950-2021, the
   analysis shows how an influence operation's blind spot varied along with
   shifts in the balance between national security concerns and democratic
   individual rights. Recent initiatives to criminalise domestic
   collaboration with foreign influence operators are discussed, and the
   advent of AI and microtargeting presented as a challenge out of reach of
   such legislation.},

Abstract = {This article proceeds from the question: how do prices in markets work?
   In socio-economic theories, I find two answers to this question. The
   structural-coordinative approach explains prices as
   outcomes-coordinative effects of pricing scripts installed by exogenous,
   institutionalized social structures. The performative-epistemological
   approach explains prices as market devices-endogenous
   performative-epistemological tools of marketization. While not
   necessarily antithetical, the two theories define market knowledge,
   pricing and price in distinct ways. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork
   from the Swedish meat industry, this article examines the merits of the
   two aforementioned theories and the prospects for unifying them. The
   conclusion presents an empirically grounded proposal for such a
   unification, emphasizing that prices, in practice, simultaneously
   express embedding social structures and mobilize marketization. A
   unified theory of market prices allows for identifying and analysing the
   recursive relation of social structures and performed episteme in
   pricing; how prices both express and realize market organization.},

Abstract = {Around the world, voluntary programs are an increasingly prevalent
   regulatory instrument in governing nonprofit organizations. But accounts
   of mechanisms driving nonprofits' participation in those programs are
   underdeveloped. This article combines and expands insights from
   voluntary regulation and institutional work theories to examine the
   impact of government's informal relational work on nonprofits'
   regulatory participation. Drawing on interviews and survey data from a
   random sample of 203 nonprofits in Shenzhen, China, the authors study
   the country's pioneering government-sponsored voluntary accreditation
   program and its varying receptions among nonprofits. The empirical
   analysis shows that politically embedded nonprofits, those with closer
   organizational connections with the local government, are more likely to
   participate in accreditation. Since government agencies rely on existing
   regulatory networks to conduct relational work at both organizational
   and personal levels to persuade or cajole nonprofits to participate,
   they tend to direct their recruitment efforts towards more politically
   embedded nonprofits. However, these targeted recruitment practices may
   generate reactions much more complicated than the dichotomy of
   acceptance versus resistance, which ultimately facilitates some
   nonprofits seeking accreditation while deterring others.},

Abstract = {When more actors-politicians, bureaucrats, or citizens-get involved in
   the process of policy implementation, they bring different understanding
   of their roles and objectives as participants in the policy. These
   understandings are the means-ends relationships shaping actors' behavior
   during the implementation process, analyzed in the literature as
   institutional logics. How do these institutional logics interact during
   the process of implementation? We argue that institutional logics do not
   only seamlessly coexist, but they interact in diverse ways: they may
   coincide, complement, clash or be unrelated. To make these interactions
   empirically observable, we put forward a working definition for each of
   them. Using an in-depth case study of a participatory budget in Cananea,
   a municipality in northern Mexico, we show how the way these logics
   interact affects implementation: by performing their own role, actors
   advance their own purpose and contribute to the implementation process,
   even when they understand it differently. We find that the interaction
   among those logics do not impede effective implementation, as long as
   they do not clash.},

Abstract = {Activation is an efficacious policy paradigm in modern welfare states.
   Taking the case of Germany, we study the relationship between the
   embeddedness of benefit recipients in activating labor market
   institutions and individual labor supply. Using panel data, we estimate
   the effects of transitions between key institutional states with
   different degrees of activation on reservation wages (RWs). We show that
   RWs react to activation: the transition from gainful employment to
   unemployment benefit receipt leads to an average decrease of 3.1\% in
   RWs. The transition from gainful employment to welfare benefit
   receipt-an institutional state with far more rigorous activation-leads
   to a stronger decrease of 4.9\%. Mediation analyses show that the income
   associated with different institutional states is the predominant
   mechanism that drives the effect on RWs. However, subjective social
   status also partly mediates the effect. Implications of these findings
   for active labor market policies are discussed.},

Abstract = {Studies on party system collapse or individual-party breakdowns view
   programmatic inconsistency or convergence as necessary for abrupt party
   system change. In theory, a new or fringe contender can suddenly emerge
   and disrupt the party system under such circumstances. We test that
   claim by examining Nayib Bukele's 2019 presidential election victory in
   El Salvador. With data from the AmericasBarometer, we estimate probit
   models and predictive margins to examine the individual-level
   determinants of disruption in an institutionalised and ideologically
   polarised party system. The empirical results reveal that Bukele won
   amid salient ideological differences between traditional parties and
   that critical views towards democracy fueled his core support.
   Therefore, we conclude that a significant disruption in an
   institutionalised party system can occur notwithstanding robust
   ideological differences between leading contenders. Critical attitudes
   towards democracy can represent a driving force behind a party system's
   disruption.},

Abstract = {Much of the quantitative conflict resolution literature focuses on
   peacemaking efforts aimed at resolving international conflict or civil
   wars that involve state forces, while ignoring non-state conflict
   between communal groups, rebel groups, or militias. This article aims to
   contribute to filling this gap in research. I first put forward a
   typology of non-state conflicts, based two dimensions: (1) whether the
   conflictissues are local or national; and (2) whether the conflict
   parties receiveexternal support or not. Next, I provide some descriptive
   statistics on the conclusion of peace agreements in non-state conflicts,
   which suggest that in locations of peacekeeping operations, the
   involvement of peacekeeping staff in negotiations makes these
   negotiations more likely to end in the conclusion of an agreement. The
   article considers several possible causal mechanism that drive this
   effectiveness, including the arranging of logistics, the provision of
   security, and mitigating biases of relevant stakeholders.},

Abstract = {In this piece we respond to three commentators of our book, Mending
   Democracy, and emphasize the ways the book seeks to contribute to the
   theory and practice of democracy. We reflect on the possibilities and
   limits of democratic mending in societies characterised by economic
   inequality and asymmetric power relations, as well as in countries with
   less established institutions of liberal democracy. We draw attention to
   the agency and creativity of ordinary people in advancing meaningful
   democratic reform even under less favourable conditions, and in unlikely
   places.},

Abstract = {Using data covering most European Union Member States, we study how the
   support for national governments has unravelled in the first months of
   the COVID pandemic. Motivated by the growing evidence on the
   uneveneconomic impact of this crisis across genders, we study if
   suchunequal economic burden is related to differences in support for
   public authorities between men and women. While the support for national
   governments has overall faded in the period considered, the decline has
   been more pronounced for women and working women in particular. We find
   indication that the decline in support signals a shift in concerns among
   Europeans and women in particular, from the health emergency to the
   economic consequences of the pandemic. We impute up to a third of the
   widening gender gap in support for government to the shift of emphasis
   from the health to the economic dimension of the crisis.},

Abstract = {International human rights law (IHRL) is often conceived of and taught
   as a system for enforcing specific, individual rights. In fact, IHRL's
   mandate extends far beyond individual rights to imposing broad
   structural constraints on states. The role of IHRL in national
   governance is a function of its relationship to the primary constitutive
   value of the modern world public order, human dignity. Through this
   relationship, IHRL exerts a centripetal doctrinal pull on all levels of
   public policy. This article explains the implications of IHRL's unique
   role in world public order for its interaction with the municipal laws
   and policies of states. It develops a theory of regime interaction
   between IHRL and municipal law, tracing the influence of IHRL on good
   governance to four of its features that constrain government decision
   making. It concludes with a discussion of the implications of the
   theories developed in the article for domestic legislation and policy.},

Abstract = {The reorganization of governments is crucial for parties to express
   their policy preferences once they reach office. Yet these activities
   are not confined to the direct aftermath of general elections or to
   wide-ranging structural reforms. Instead, governments reorganize and
   adjust their machinery of government all the time. This paper aims to
   assess these structural choices with a particular focus at the core of
   the state, comparing four Western European democracies (Germany, France,
   the Netherlands, and United Kingdom) from 1980 to 2013. Our empirical
   analysis shows that stronger shifts in cabinets' ideological profiles in
   the short- and long-term as well as the units' proximity to political
   executives yield significant effects. In contrast, Conservative
   governments, commonly regarded as key promoters of reorganizing
   governments, are not significant for the likelihood of structural
   change. We discuss the effects of this politics of government
   reorganization for different research debates assessing the inner
   workings of governments.},

Abstract = {After the catastrophic 9/11 terrorist attacks, the United States (US)
   launched a war in Afghanistan to combat terrorism as a major
   non-traditional security threat. Twenty years later, Afghanistan is
   still struggling for solidarity, stability, and development, and remains
   a hotbed for transnational terrorism. Although observers view China as a
   key player in Afghanistan, which will fill the strategic vacuum left by
   the US withdrawal, a successful Chinese approach in Afghanistan depends
   on many factors including the US competition strategy vis-a-vis China,
   the Taliban's rule, neighbouring countries' interests and choices with
   respect to Afghanistan, and other factors. Therefore, China may devise a
   realistic, pragmatic, constructive, and cooperative approach to address
   the non-traditional security challenges in Afghanistan. Taking due
   cognisance of the bitter stories of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan,
   China maintained a low-key stance in Afghanistan after the Soviets
   withdrew from the country. After 1991, to address the security concerns
   in Xinjiang, China supported the building of a stable, peaceful, and
   prosperous Afghanistan and seeks to avoid any military presence in the
   country. China will largely maintain this prudent approach in
   Afghanistan after US withdrawal from the country.},

Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},

Volume = {50},
Number = {2},
Pages = {261-281},

Abstract = {Since old-age programmes mitigate life-course risks that are relevant to
   individuals across socioeconomic groups in ageing societies, all parties
   have a political incentive to support these initiatives. Nevertheless,
   pre-existing partisan commitments bind the policy instruments that
   parties use. Cabinet-level analyses of OECD economies demonstrate that
   left incumbency relies more on public expenditure than right-wing
   governments. What is more important is that, in the context of large
   elderly populations, pension coverage is greater under right-leaning
   governments, while pension replacement rates are higher in left-leaning
   governments. This shows that party behaviour related to life
   course-related policies cannot be explained by the conventional
   pro-expansion versus the pro-retrenchment partisan politics. Rather, a
   focus on partisan variation in the use of policy instruments is
   required.},

Abstract = {This theory development article employs neo-Durkheimian institutional
   theory to present a fresh understanding of policy styles in the policy
   process. Calls for resilient, robust, agile and improvisatory
   policymaking are not readily compatible with each other. Each of these
   styles carries risks and each generates anomalies. Each tends to decay
   over time. Governments should therefore expect risks of inconsistency
   and decay in policymaking shaped by these styles. The article argues
   that these styles, and their risks and tensions, and the trajectories of
   their decay all arise from the contrasting forms of informal social
   organisation among policymakers in which they are cultivated. These
   forms of social organisation give rise to distinct types of bounded
   rationality, which shape decision-making differently in each ordering.},

Abstract = {While the firm-level distributional consequences of market
   liberalization are well understood, previous studies have paid only
   limited attention to how variations in domestic institutions across
   countries affect the winners and losers from opening up to trade. We
   argue that the presence of coordinated wage-bargaining institutions,
   which impose a ceiling on wage increases, and state-subsidized
   vocational training, which creates a large supply of highly skilled
   workers, generate labor market frictions. Upward wage rigidity, in
   particular, helps smaller firms weather the rising competition and
   increasing labor costs triggered by trade liberalization. We test this
   hypothesis using a firm-level data set of European Union countries,
   which includes more than 800,000 manufacturing firms between 2003 and
   2014. We find that, for productive firms, gains from trade are 20
   percent larger in countries with liberal market economies than they are
   in coordinated market economies. Symmetrically, less productive firms in
   coordinated market economies experience significantly smaller revenue
   losses compared to liberal market economies. We show that both the
   presence of an institutionalized wage ceiling and the availability of
   subsidized vocational training are key mechanisms for reducing the
   reallocation of revenue from unproductive to productive firms in
   coordinated market economies compared to liberal market economies. In
   line with our theory, we find that wages and employment in liberalized
   industries increase differentially across both types of labor markets.
   Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that trade liberalization
   triggers a differential demand for redistribution at the individual
   level across different labor markets, which is in line with our
   firm-level analysis.},

Pages = {236-254},
Abstract = {Norwegian diplomacy has seen many everyday heroes, but few who have done
   something unique. The article discusses the main candidate for the role,
   Fridtjof Nansen. Nansen carried out a number of different diplomatic
   func-tions at the behest of the Norwegian state and International
   Organisations, no less than four of which were unique. He increased
   Norway's room for manoeu-vre by contributing to placing a Danish king
   with a British-born wife on the throne upon the country's independence
   in 1905. He then successfully negoti-ated a Great Power-guaranteed
   Integrity Treaty for the new state. Nansen also secured a treaty on
   vital goods delivery with the United States for Norway in 1918. Most
   famously, in the1920s, he helped hundreds of thousands of ref-ugees with
   disaster relief, but also by manipulating structural preconditions so
   that they received identity papers and could cross borders, for which he
   received the 1922 Nobel Peace prize. Nansen's weakness as a diplomat was
   his egocentrism, complete with a programmatic aversion against seeing
   his specific mission as part of a united foreign policy orchestrated
   elsewhere. He more than made up for this by his expert handling of
   diplomacy's other two basic functions, information gathering and
   negotiation, which underlay all his four unique successes.},

Abstract = {There are many influential studies relating to the phenomenon of ``good
   governance{''} in legal, economic or political dimensions. The major
   purpose of this paper is to present an interdisciplinary approach that
   attempts to integrate legal, economic, and political fields to analyse
   the indicated concept. This article aims at illustrating the
   interactions and interdependences between ``good governance{''} and the
   school of law and economics, especially within the European Integration
   process, founded on the said principles. Apart from legal and economic
   issues, the indicated areas form a specific field of politics which
   should be perceived through the prism of political science. The economic
   approach requires focusing attention on the process of profit
   maximisation, however, one should not ignore the element of classical
   political disputes. The hypothesis of this article is the following
   statement: the decomposition of the liberal idea of law and economy may
   translate into a downturn of the European supranational structures,
   leading to the modification of institutions relying on the principles of
   ``good governance{''}.},

Abstract = {This article refers to the economic diplomacy of Turkiye and illustrates
   some changes during the history of the country's political and economic
   diplomacy. The background of the economic diplomacy process has been
   clarified and detailed information has been included. Bipolar and
   unipolar periods are analysed within the framework of economic and
   political diplomacies in their natural state. The development process of
   the Turkish economic diplomacy strategy is identified during particular
   periods in Turkish history. The structural transformation of Turkiye as
   regards its inward-oriented to outward-oriented economic policies has
   been evaluated. The mechanisms of Turkiye's multi-directional foreign
   policy, bilateral trade, and diplomatic relations between Turkiye, the
   EU and other countries are examined. The role of dependence and
   interdependence in economics are given in the context of economic
   globalisation. For this research, the historical methodology has been
   used. It is suggested that collaborative problem solving with all the
   institutions involved in economic and political decisions could lead to
   better outcomes for the country in the international arena.},

Abstract = {This article takes a closer look at various analyses of the
   international intervention in Afghanistan, which point at different
   reasons for the developments that took take place in August 2021.
   Developments that the American president Biden shortly before the
   Taliban takeover assured the world would not take place. Three factors
   stand out in previous analyses of the years that passed by in
   Afghanistan. First, that there were ongoing challenges with
   capacity-building. Challenges that had been pointed out by analysts,
   researchers and in the many evaluation and lessons-learned reports from
   the war. Secondly, that the purpose of the war on the part of the allied
   forces changed character as time went on. The common purpose was easier
   to see in the beginning of the war, but the intervention efforts turned
   into a purpose-dense delta, where the countries involved and their
   successive governments balanced considerations to alliances, domestic
   support, national security interests and value political agendas. Third,
   that the Taliban seemingly had gradually - and not overnight - built up
   strength and control, and at the same time been involved in a political
   process through their exile office in Doha that helped pave the way for
   their takeover.},

Abstract = {The political and institutional crisis in Brazil from 2015, fueled
   largely by corruption probes and lawfare, had severe repercussions
   within the Brazilian construction and energy sectors. While many
   international investors withdrew from Brazil in this period, Chinese
   investment surged. This article accounts for the particular
   characteristics of Chinese investments, such as sectorial
   complementarities, risk assessment, market size attraction, and

Abstract = {Political issues sometimes display an intriguing combination of high
   degrees of complexity, low political saliency, and high levels of
   administrative autonomy. This article investigates how this type of
   issues shapes the relationship between politicians and the public
   service. More specifically, we advance the notion of ``administrative
   action space{''} to describe the emergence of collaborative governance
   when directives from the political level are intermittent or absent.
   Using an illustrative case on the administration of measures to address
   antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a transnational public health issue in
   Europe, we find that senior public servants nested in epistemic
   communities play a leading role in driving agency and facilitating
   governance of complex but low-salient issues when administrative
   autonomy is extensive.},

Abstract = {Autocratic leaders rely on intelligence machineries for regime and
   personal security. They often manage large, powerful, unaccountable
   organisations, which they hold close. But, despite their close
   relationship with - and reliance upon - intelligence, autocrats also
   frequently struggle to use it to enhance decision-making and foreign
   policy, and consequently suffer avoidable intelligence failures. This
   article argues that Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is
   illustrative of this broader, though understudied, pattern of autocratic
   mismanagement of strategic intelligence. The invasion was both spurred
   and accompanied by a catastrophic intelligence failure, the
   responsibility for which rests with Vladimir Putin, the arbiter of a
   system with limited capacity to offer dispassionate strategic
   assessments. His failure is characteristic of autocratic regimes
   assessing foreign developments, including Putin's Soviet predecessors.
   This article contributes to the emerging scholarship on intelligence in
   autocratic regimes by examining Putin's use of intelligence in the
   Ukraine War in the context of the broader literature on intelligence and
   decision.},

Abstract = {This article systematically examines how access of business groups and
   nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to the executive branch of the
   European Union varies across political heads, civil servants, and an
   understudied yet critical intermediary figure of the executive branch:
   political advisers. Building upon exchange theory, we argue that the
   occurrence of a meeting between public officials and interest groups
   depends on information and legitimacy sought and offered by both types
   of actors, the public officials' public exposure, and the interest
   groups' lobbying strategies. The empirical analysis is focused on the
   executive body of the European Union (i.e., the European Commission).
   Our results show that, while political advisers and civil servants are
   more likely to meet with business groups than with NGOs, political heads
   are not biased in favor of any of these two groups.},

Abstract = {Do elite cues exert extensive, conditional or minimal influence on
   public support for military alliances in the United States? I assess the
   boundaries of elite leadership on public opinion towards alliances by
   dividing partisan respondents into wings based on isolationism and
   militant assertiveness. If co-partisan elite cues change public
   attitudes across three or four wings within their party, elites exert
   extensive influence. Elite cues exert conditional influence if they
   reach two party wings, and minimal influence if they impact one or no
   wings. Using two conjoint survey experiments to examine public attitudes
   towards forming and maintaining international alliances, I find that
   elite cues exert extensive influence, but some individuals hold rigid
   alliance attitudes. Staunch alliance supporters in the Democratic party
   and consistent alliance skeptics in the Republican party both discount
   elite cues. Therefore, elites can lead most party wings with alliance
   cues, but intra-party divisions can constrain their influence.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the results of a field experiment to assess the
   collaborative effects of community participation in the Ugandan oil and
   gas sector. Our research design assesses collaborative impacts as
   relational between community members and different decision-makers in
   the sector and measures these impacts from the point of view of local
   people. Local people often face power imbalances in collaborative
   governance. Decision-makers are increasingly attempting to mitigate such
   imbalances to improve outcomes for communities, but little experimental
   evidence exists showing the impact of such efforts. Using multilevel
   ordered logit models, we estimate positive treatment effects, finding
   that encouraging the equitable participation of communities improves
   collaboration with other actors. Next, we use machine-learning
   techniques to demonstrate a method for targeting communities most likely
   to benefit from the intervention. We estimate that purposefully
   targeting communities that would benefit most yields a treatment effect
   about twice as large, relative to pure random assignment. Our results
   provide evidence that interventions mindful of community needs can
   improve collaborative governance and shows how such communities can be
   most effectively targeted. The experiment took place across 107 villages
   (53 treatment and 54 control) and the unit of statistical analysis is
   the household, where we report outcomes measured from 6,062 household
   surveys (approximately half at baseline and half at endline).},

Title = {Hybrid knowledge and climate-resilient agriculture practices of the
   Tharu in the western Tarai, Nepal},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Indigenous knowledge can function as a basis of innovation in
   agriculture because it is not only culturally accepted, but often also
   environmentally adaptive. The debates and misunderstandings regarding
   the relations between Indigenous and scientific knowledge are
   transforming into a trend to integrate all knowledge to deal with
   complex issues, such as climate change. In this study we explore the
   understandings of the Tharu people of their farming system in relation
   to adaptation and mitigation of climate change, based on mixed methods
   design using both ethnographic analysis of their specific agriculture
   practices from participant observation and a survey of 229 households in
   the western Tarai of Nepal. Among our findings is the fit of the
   traditional agricultural calendar of the Tharu with the labor regimen of
   agricultural seasons. We found that conservation tillage-oriented
   agricultural practices, such as relay cropping, including zero-tillage,
   remain important in the farming system. Although this practice is
   decreasing, particularly due to the low yield as compared to the
   conventional tillage system, relay sowing and zero-tillage in the
   lowlands and uplands remain important for timely crop sowing. Similarly,
   mixed cropping is prevalent, particularly among small holders, for
   subsistence-based farming, in part due to higher yield than sole
   cropping. We conclude that Indigenous knowledge regarding climate and
   agriculture practices assists making informed decisions for
   climate-resilient and low emission agriculture. Although some
   traditional climate-resilient agriculture practices may yield lower
   profit than those derived from scientific knowledge/methods, the Tharu
   have therefore embraced ``hybrid knowledge{''}-a combination of
   Indigenous and scientific knowledge, technology and practice-to balance
   increased yield and profit maximization with concurrent decreased
   vulnerability to extreme weather events. We argue that it is not useful
   to make firm distinctions among traditional, Indigenous and local
   knowledge in the age of hybridity. This hybridity is evident in the
   complementarity of the use of improved varieties and scientific
   agricultural practices for the major grains and the continuing use of
   landraces for minor crops such as lentils, peas and mustard. However,
   further research on the sustainable productivity of such practices is
   required before their widespread dissemination.},

Abstract = {Military power is central to diplomacy and much of international
   relations, yet common quantitative measures have limited surface
   validity. This limitation stems from focusing on latent power and only
   indirectly incorporating major weapon systems. I contend that weapons
   are central to military power and present a new measure of country
   military power based primarily on armaments. The measure includes major
   naval, air and land weapons as well as nuclear weapons and ballistic
   missile capability. I examine the surface, content and context validity
   of the measure and compare it to existing measures. I show that this
   measure of material military power (MMP) has more surface and context
   validity than alternative measures. I find that MMP better predicts war
   outcomes, better accounts for militarized threats, and performs well as
   a control variable for country power.},

Title = {Fighting against Jihad? Blood Revenge and Anti-Insurgent Mobilization in
   Jihadist Civil Wars},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {48},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {Previous studies have shown that many recent Jihadist insurgencies
   differ from other types of civil wars due to their high levels of
   civilian victimization and their incidence among tribal and honorific
   societies. We argue that these characteristics of Jihadist wars may have
   an effect on anti-rebel mobilization among the local population.
   Notwithstanding the importance of political and sectarian motives,
   brutal violence against civilians frequently ignites cycles of blood
   feuds in societies still abiding by customary traditional laws. We argue
   that excessive violence against civilians that facilitates blood revenge
   should not be overlooked as one of the primary causes of anti-rebel
   mobilization in Jihadist civil wars. We draw our empirical insights by
   examining how and why local population mobilized against Jihadist
   insurgents during civil wars in Chechnya. Our findings based on unique
   interviews with both participants and non-participants of Chechen
   conflicts in the 1990s and the early 2000s illustrate that both
   excessive civilian victimization by Jihadist rebels and ensuing cycles
   of blood revenge functioned as robust anti-insurgent mobilization
   mechanisms.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the 2021 Glasgow meeting of the Paris Agreement, where
   states embedded a 2050 pathway to net zero that will overshoot the
   Earth's remaining carbon budget for 1.5 degrees C, attention is turning
   to the flaws of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This
   article highlights ways in which it blocks effective climate action,
   which has been acknowledged by states who are now pursuing voluntary and
   nonbinding initiatives on coal, forests, and oil and gas. The article
   assesses new proposals for treaties on deforestation, the elimination of
   coal, and a fossil fuel nonproliferation treaty. It argues that states
   should take these proposals to the UN General Assembly and adopt them as
   binding treaties consistent with holding global heating at 1.5 degrees
   C. Following the model of the Nuclear Weapons Convention it further
   argues that these treaties should be folded into a full Greenhouse
   Convention, supported by a powerful International Climate Agency, to
   secure a net zero world. Drawing upon new proposals for an Earth-centric
   law that takes in the totality of social-natural processes at the
   planetary scale, these proposals could form part of a reformed
   international legal architecture that could be equal to the diabolical
   governance challenges of the Anthropocene.},

   (1) governments prefer to shift responsibility to other levels and (2)
   an unclear distribution of formal responsibilities complicates blame
   allocation to a single actor. Considering the temporal location of such
   strategies - in anticipation or as a reaction to adverse events - the
   article tests these assumptions. Drawing on the case of air quality
   policy in Mexico City, the article uses causal process tracing to
   develop the mechanism leading to an anticipatory strategy and its
   unfolding. If the distribution of responsibilities on connected policy
   instruments is clear and major political actors share power, then
   government levels from different parties engage in a joint anticipatory
   strategy to avoid crisis and keep stability. The mechanism breakdown
   leads to reactive behaviour and policy change. Contextual changes
   redistributing power can destabilise the arrangements, leading to
   reactive blame games, fostering policy change.},

Abstract = {Past scholarship has documented that the poor are more likely to
   withhold their policy preferences in public opinion surveys, suggesting
   income gaps in political engagement. Despite the wealth of scholarly
   interest in opinion formation, however, previous studies focused almost
   exclusively on opinion gaps in preferences, leaving income-related gaps
   in policy prioritisation virtually unexamined. Drawing on 596 public
   opinion surveys conducted with nearly 700,000 Americans over 55 years,
   we make a comprehensive attempt to examine income-level differences in
   ``don't know{''} responses to the most important problem (MIP) question.
   Our results show that the less affluent are more likely to say ``don't
   know{''} when asked about the MIP facing their country, even after
   controlling for various factors including educational attainment and
   political attention. Importantly, we also show that income-related
   differences in opinionation cross cut other socio-economic differences
   in policy prioritisation. These results have important implications for
   the study of public opinion.},

Abstract = {It has become commonplace to argue that Benjamin Constant and Alexis de
   Tocqueville form a distinct French liberal tradition going back to
   Montesquieu. Yet Tocqueville showed little interest in Constant, and
   early nineteenth-century French liberals did not recognize Montesquieu
   as the father of French liberalism. Based on these observations, this
   essay demonstrates that the French liberal tradition is a belated
   construction and explains how, when, and why it was invented. Exhuming
   the origins of the French liberal tradition, I argue, is important for
   our understanding of the history of liberalism and the mechanisms behind
   ideology formation.},

Abstract = {Paulo Freire is known for his liberatory approach to education. Less
   discussed are his reflections on charitable giving, aid, and welfare
   programs, which he criticizes for their ``false generosity.{''} He
   argues that superficially generous acts of giving are often false in
   that they serve to uphold uneven power dynamics and the economic status
   quo, maintaining the oppressed in a position of manipulability and
   dependency. The distribution of aid by populist state actors is often
   rife with paternalistic false generosity, allowing politicians to use
   their positions of power to reap benefits from recipients. Peru's
   state-sponsored comedores populares (communal kitchens that distribute
   state-subsidized food aid) have employed false generosity to build
   political loyalty in seeking to control an unpaid labor force that
   maintains a seemingly benevolent image of the generous state. Paulo
   Freire es conocido por su liberador enfoque en torno a la educacion.
   Menos discutidas son sus reflexiones sobre las donaciones caritativas,
   la ayuda y los programas de bienestar, asuntos que critico como basados
   en una ``falsa generosidad{''}. Segun el, los actos caritativos
   superficialmente generosos a menudo resultan falsos en tanto permiten
   conservar una dinamica de poder desigual y el status quo economico,
   manteniendo a los oprimidos en una posicion de manipulabilidad y
   dependencia. La distribucion de la ayuda por parte de actores estatales
   populistas a menudo esta plagada de una falsa generosidad paternalista,
   asunto que permite a los politicos usar su posicion de poder para
   obtener beneficios de quienes la reciben. Los comedores populares
   patrocinados por el Estado en Peru (cocinas comunales que distribuyen
   ayuda alimentaria subsidiada por el gobierno) han empleado dicha falsa
   generosidad para construir lealtad politica en un intento por controlar
   una fuerza laboral no remunerada y mantener, a la vez, una imagen
   aparentemente benevolente de un Estado generoso.},

Abstract = {Studies on digitalization and business power tend to focus on digital
   platform firms. In contrast, we argue that data, digital technologies
   and digital infrastructures create novel digital power resources (DPR)
   for firms throughout sectors. DPR can be structural, that is, rooted in
   data and digital technologies, and infrastructural, that is, rooted in
   digital infrastructure. We propose indicators and apply them to a sample
   of 120 large firms from the USA, UK, France and Germany, active in five
   sectors. We find that firms from all sectors control DPR but the
   sectoral distribution varies depending on the national
   political-economic context. Lastly, we demonstrate the analytical value
   added of our concept by explaining variation in business preferences and
   strategies toward data sovereignty and data-sharing regulation in the
   German automotive sector. Our DPR concept improves our understanding of
   why and how business seeks to influence (digital) policies and politics
   in digital(ized) capitalism in general.},

Abstract = {Life under Stalinism in the 1930s challenged Jews, particularly the
   young, with innumerable compromises to their religious and ethnic
   identity, yielding unexpected responses during World War II and the
   Holocaust. This article analyzes how Jewish youth raised in 1930s
   Vitebsk in the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic acquired firsthand
   knowledge of the language and customs of their Slavic neighbors, and how
   some of this cohort harnessed their experiences and understanding in
   their attempts to survive during the Holocaust. Bolshevik policies
   unique to Soviet Belarus affected its Jews in ways distinct from their
   counterparts elsewhere in the Soviet Union. Nationalities and religious
   policies as well as the Five-Year Plans and the Great Terror served as
   the context for this situation, shaping and distorting transmission of
   Jewish traditions along with changing the dynamics of the family and
   social relationships. Young Jews in Vitebsk learned Slavic languages and
   culture from their neighbors, in Soviet schools, and through other
   means. After the German invasion in 1941, the application of these
   skills and knowledge are a common thread through the survival narratives
   of young Holocaust survivors from Soviet Vitebsk.},

Abstract = {Soldiers and officers of the Red Army were among the first military
   personnel to encounter the destruction of the Ukrainian and Belarussian
   Jewish communities late in World War II. A significant proportion of the
   hundreds of thousands of Jews who served in the Red Army between 1943
   and 1945 learned of the deaths of their own family members while they
   were in active duty. By examining the historical details and literary
   conventions of a small number of autobiographies and oral history
   interviews, the chapter discusses the range of reactions of these
   combatants to the destruction of their communities, from immediate
   retaliation to working with Soviet authorities to identify and convict
   collaborators. In addition, the chapter examines how a narrator's
   current country of residence appears to influence the framing of his
   memoir.},

   field of peace studies itself is inclusive of non-Western voices and
   perspectives. This article presents a new dataset of 4,318 journal
   articles on peace indexed in Web of Science between 2015 and 2018 to
   discover asymmetric patterns of publication and scholarly gatekeeping
   between higher-income and lower-income countries. Analysis of the data
   collected suggests that 15 years after the `local turn,' higher-income
   countries continue to dominate the field across the domains of
   publishing institutions; scholarship about non-high-income countries;
   the conduct and focus of research collaborations; claims to
   theorization; and the discourse of the field. However, positive change
   is being driven by a proliferation of scholarship in upper-middle-income
   countries, characterized by intranational collaborations between
   scholars writing about their own countries in their own national
   journals.},

Abstract = {The Big Four professional services firms - PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and EY -
   promote, sanction, and regularise the behaviour and practices of
   business and government. This is especially the case in the area of
   multinational tax avoidance. This large, and growing, sector of the Big
   Four's business model places them at the centre of both causing and
   addressing the problem. Their role is not limited to advising MNCs on
   complex tax structures. They also advise governments and international
   organisations on regulatory reform of the global tax system. This
   article examines their role in so doing through an analysis of
   Australian Senate Inquiry hearings and responses to the OECD reform
   programme on the digitalisation of the economy. We show that advice
   provided by the Big Four is not purely technical, but is intended to
   achieve a global corporate tax system that is either globally
   dis-harmonised or a matter of national regulatory incrementalism. This
   is despite their claims of supporting global regulation based on
   multilateral agreements. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the Big Four
   use their significant structural power to discursively undermine the
   ideals of the OECD, the leading international organisation working to
   reform global taxation.},

Abstract = {This study examines how an important reform of local governance-village
   democracy-in the world's most populous areas has affected the happiness
   of residents in rural China. We find that introducing elections per se
   has no significant impact. In comparison, direct nomination of local
   leaders by villagers, which is a form of competitive election involving
   a high degree of public participation in political decision making,
   leads to higher levels of happiness. Further mechanism analyses show
   that direct nomination improves the local accountability of elected
   leaders by boosting the quality and effort of village heads and their
   governance performance by lowering the tax burden of villagers and
   vitalizing local public services. Our results highlight the importance
   of public participation in democracy and the underlying role of local
   accountability in affecting the subjective well-beings of citizens.},

Abstract = {Ceasefires are arrangements through which conflict parties commit to
   stop fighting. They are a common part of intra-state conflict. Existing
   research on intra-state ceasefires is largely limited to case studies
   and guidance notes for the policy and practice community. What has to
   date been lacking is a complementing body of comparative quantitative
   analysis to identify broader ceasefire trends and test the wider
   applicability of theory. Recent advancements in ceasefire data offer new
   opportunities to broaden the research agenda on ceasefires. This special
   section sets out the current state of the art in ceasefire research and
   provides the intellectual foundations to advance a new sub-field of
   quantitative ceasefire research. We discuss the conceptual challenges
   facing the study of ceasefires, offer a brief overview of ceasefire
   research focusing on the functions, timing, and sustainability of
   arrangements, and discuss the collective contributions of the articles
   included within this special section, and the implications for research
   and practice.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, many discussions revolve around the topic of consider smart
   city factors if they want to provide quality services to their citizens
   and implement policies effectively. Therefore, in this paper, we focus
   on smart cities, but look at them from a different perspective - from
   the citizens' point of view. In each of the 25 largest cities in
   Croatia, we asked citizens to rate their satisfaction with the
   dimensions of smart cities and rank them in terms of importance. We used
   the results in the AHP analysis to rank the cities according to their
   smart city performance from the citizens' perspective. In addition, we
   use DEA, to study the efficiency of the use of the city budget for
   projects related to the development of a smart city. While we present
   the high-ranking Croatian cities as examples of good practices, we also
   emphasize the efficient use of budgets by the not so high-ranking cities
   and their realization of investment needs in this area. Our study
   contributes to the understanding of smart cities from the citizens'
   perspective and expands the knowledge base on the development of smart
   cities in Croatia.},

Title = {Conceptualizing good global statehood: progressive foreign policy after
   the populist moment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL THEORY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {This article explores the theoretical challenges for normatively
   progressive foreign policy following the rise of populist nationalism
   during the 2010s, using analytical concepts from the English School. It
   argues that populist nationalism exposes a problem of internal dissensus
   on the future trajectories of solidarist international society, within
   the Western states that have traditionally been its principal
   supporters. The `populist moment' reveals problems of disconnection
   between domestic publics, the practices, and institutions of
   contemporary international society, and state actions that are premised
   in part on ethical regard for non-citizens. The article contends that,
   as an interface point between rooted communities and global ethical
   concerns, progressive foreign policy approaches have an important role
   to play in ameliorating these disconnections. However, these approaches
   must look beyond a simple `re-booting' of liberal internationalism,
   focussing instead on building a path towards solidarist international
   society that is rooted in everyday-lived experiences, communities, and
   identities within the state. Building upon theorizations of good
   international citizenship, the article advances an alternative framework
   of good global statehood, which draws upon a coproduction methodology as
   a means of creating progressive foreign policies that are better attuned
   to pluralism and diversity across, but also within state borders.},

Abstract = {With the advent of the `age of conspiracism', the harmfulness of
   conspiratorial narratives and mindsets on individuals' mentalities, on
   social relations, and on democracy, has been widely researched by
   political scientists and psychologists. One known negative effect of
   conspiracy theories is the escalation toward political radicalism. This
   study goes beyond the exploration of mechanisms underpinning the
   relationship between conspiracy theory and radicalization to focus on
   possible approaches to mitigating them. This study sheds light on the
   role of counter-conspiracy approaches in the process of
   deradicalization, adopting the case study of antiChina sentiment and
   racial prejudice amid the Covid-19 pandemic, through conducting an
   experiment (N= 300). The results suggest that, during critical events
   such as the Covid-19 pandemic, exposure to countermeasures to
   conspiracist information can reduce individual acceptance of radicalism.
   We investigated two methods of countering conspiracy theory, and found
   that: (1) a content-targeted `inoculation' approach to countering
   conspiracy theory can prevent the intensification of radicalization, but
   does not produce a significant deradicalization effect; and (2) an
   audience-focused `disenchantment' method can enable cognitive
   deradicalization, effectively reducing the perception of competitive
   victimhood, and of real and symbolic threats. This study is one of the
   first attempts to address causality between deradicalization and
   countermeasures to conspiracy theories in the US-China relations.},

Abstract = {The fight against climate change increasingly connects International
   Organizations (IOs), national governments, and subnational governments.
   How are international funds to fight climate change and environmental
   degradation distributed to subnational beneficiaries? We develop a novel
   multilevel theory that poses that tension between the preferences of the
   IO and national governments helps explain the subnational distribution
   of environmental aid - even more than pure environmental or social need.
   Simply put, whomever contributes more to IO-sponsored green projects
   determines who gets funds at the subnational level. While we understand
   that both actors have multiple preferences associated with green aid
   allocation, our theory of multilevel fund allocation expects the IO to
   prioritize provinces and states with low-development. Conversely,
   national governments will prioritize domestic electoral interests. We
   test this theory with a new data from the largest international donor of
   environmental aid, the Global Environment Facility. Empirically, we
   focus on Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico between 1997 and 2017.},

Abstract = {French civil-military relations under the 5th Republic are marked by the
   imposing figure of the President, because of their role in nuclear
   deterrence. In that context, the role of the ministry of defence in
   general, and of its leader (the minister) in particular, is ambiguous:
   the minister is technically not the highest authority in charge of
   defence issues (since both the Prime Minister and the President are
   constitutionally tasked with important responsibilities in the defence
   realm), but they nevertheless need to find a role between the
   presidential guidelines and the military demands. In this article, we
   show that civil-military relations within the French ministry of Defence
   are therefore characterized by an ``unstable equilibrium{''}: the
   history of the French MoD is rife with regular swings between the
   primacy of the military or the primacy of civilians. Overall, the French
   MoD has adopted a model civil-military relations which is structurally
   unstable, due to the shifting legitimacy of the military elite within
   the French bureaucracy and the importance of the personality of the
   political and military actors involved: without fundamentally altering
   bureaucratic rules and organization, the power balance between civilian
   and military actors can quickly evolve. To a degree, this shows the
   plasticity of French civil-military relations and its ability to adapt
   to the actors involved, especially the President.},

Abstract = {Fratelli d'Italia (FdI) is the new rising star of Italian politics.
   Scholars and pundits briskly categorised it as a (new) populist radical
   right (PRR) party. Still, FdI's newness needs to be properly framed. A
   splinter party of the Popolo della Liberta, it claims a direct lineage
   with the Alleanza Nazionale - two cases not easily agglutinated into the
   PRR family. The article analyses the (dis)continuity associated with
   FdI, examining ideology, organisation, and the continuity of elites. It
   demonstrates that FdI's organisation and political elites largely
   overlap with its predecessor parties. However, FdI accomplished a major
   ideological rebranding, positioning itself as radically different from
   both the mainstream centre-right and the post-fascist tradition of the
   Italian right.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how provincial top leaders' promotion incentives
   drive their strategies for eco-environmental performance in China.
   Economic growth, a short-term interest, should be integrated with
   ecological sustainability, a long-term interest, for sustainable
   development. We used green efficiency and green total factor
   productivity as proxies for eco-environmental performance. We then
   utilized a generalized ordered logit model to analyze the relationship
   between eco-environmental performance and position change among
   provincial officials in China. For provincial party committee
   secretaries, the short-term political performance achieved by supporting
   and investing in non-green economic practices served only to prevent
   their demotion, as promotions were obtained via improving green
   efficiency; however, for provincial governors, improving green
   efficiency can both reduce the risk of demotion and increase the
   probability of promotion. After the implementation of the new
   Environmental Protection Law in 2015, improving green total factor
   productivity can more efficiently reduce the likelihood of demotion
   among provincial party committee secretaries while enhancing the effects
   of eco-environmental performance on position change among provincial
   party committee secretaries. Our study improves the single-oriented,
   super-efficiency data envelopment analysis model to optimize the process
   of solving both input- and output-oriented problems simultaneously and
   realizes efficiency ranking for eco-environmental performance among
   provincial officials. Furthermore, this finding deepens our
   understanding of both the promotion system for Chinese local leaders and
   motivations for eco-environmental performance.},

Abstract = {Natural disasters are devastating in many ways; the impact is worse when
   government response is insufficient. Guatemala's government has a
   history of corruption and of contributing to socially constructed
   vulnerability; government policies have made parts of the population
   more insecure and vulnerable to disasters. Our study examines individual
   perceptions of how volunteers, first responders, and members of
   nongovernmental organizations responded to the deadly eruption of Volcan
   de Fuego (Volcano of Fire) in Guatemala in 2018, and how this experience
   influenced their views of the government as well as their own role in
   civil society. To gain an understanding of civil society reaction, we
   conducted field research in Guatemala in 2019 and 2020; in addition, we
   analyzed Facebook posts from a nongovernmental organization formed in
   the wake of the disaster over the course of two and a half years. Our
   research suggests that, in the absence of government efficacy, civil
   society will take a greater role in responding to disasters, despite
   incurring personal risk by doing so. In addition, it gives voice to the
   experience of many who witnessed the immediate aftermath of the
   disaster, adding their insights to the narrative of the tragedy.},

Abstract = {What reduces individual support for the use of violence among groups
   seeking self-determination? This article advances a new explanation for
   changes in popular support for violence - international recognition -
   and evaluates this explanation using a survey experiment of Palestinians
   priming the 2012 UNGA recognition of Palestine. The analysis shows that
   priming recognition reduces support for violence among a key segment of
   the population, nonpartisans, who have weaker and more fluid prior
   beliefs about the use of violence than partisans. The article argues
   that recognition reduces support for violence among nonpartisans by
   conveying new information that shifts the expected payoffs of violent
   and nonviolent strategies. This article deepens the incorporation of
   party politics into the study of conflict and demonstrates that
   international diplomatic engagement can reduce popular support for
   violence in an ongoing conflict. This is important because most
   previously identified determinants of support for violence are either
   very difficult to change or change very slowly.},

Abstract = {Why do some governments manage to curb protest while others cannot and
   turmoil escalates to a social outbreak? This study proposes a
   theoretical argument that specifies how discretionary spending reduces
   conflict, highlighting the role of social movements in managing
   protests. It examines this and alternative arguments in Argentina, a
   country with strong social movements and historically large
   mobilizations, using statistical analysis with an original database on
   protests and a population of 364 national government programs between
   2008 and 2019. The article makes a contribution by finding a
   differential effect between specific types of social spending,
   programmatic and discretional, and protests. It also specifies the
   linkage between the main variables using qualitative evidence during two
   presidencies. The goal of discretionary distribution is not to win an
   election but to ensure governance. The article finally raises some
   comparative implications on the role of social movements and welfare
   spending in Latin America.},

Abstract = {When do politicians respond to individuals' public service complaints?
   Technological solutions-termed e-governance-have been shown to help
   increase responsiveness in some developing nations where they serve to
   connect individuals, politicians, and bureaucrats for the first time. I
   argue that in country-contexts like India, where personal connections to
   bureaucrats and politicians are common, politicians are less responsive
   to complaints registered with e-governance systems than to complaints
   delivered via personal connections. Using data from public complaints,
   complaint responses, and field interviews in Delhi, I show that
   politicians are not responsive when complaints submitted to e-governance
   systems increase, but that they are responsive to complaints submitted
   to them through personal connections. This result suggests that the
   introduction of an e-governance system does not necessarily increase
   government performance. Politicians are incentivized to be more
   responsive to complaints registered directly with them because those
   complaints are more likely to generate electoral benefits.},

Abstract = {Drawing from research on organizational learning culture, knowledge
   sharing (KS), and job characteristics theory, this study investigates
   the mediating role of KS in the link between organizational learning
   culture (OLC) and employee's innovative behavior (IB), as well as how
   this mediating effect might be moderated by job autonomy (JA). Data
   captured from 1420 public employees of 33 local governments in South
   Korea shows that OLC affects employees' IB, while the effect size is
   reduced when controlling for the role of KS. Further, JA moderates the
   positive relationship between KS and IB, such that the relationship
   becomes invigorated at higher levels of JA. The findings also reveal
   that the indirect effect of OLC on IB through KS is more pronounced at
   higher levels of JA, which offers evidence of moderated mediation. We
   discuss the significant implications of our findings for future research
   and practice.},

   Counter-Militancy Efforts against Sinai Peninsula-Based Threats},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 24},
Abstract = {This article explores Sinai Peninsula-based militant threats to Israeli
   national security and Israel's efforts to address these threats. Though
   Israel primarily relies on coercive actions like targeted killings and
   airstrikes in other hostile fronts, Israel prioritizes defensive
   measures (i.e. barrier construction, missile defence systems) and
   intelligence cooperation with Egypt to counter a mutual enemy. Sinai
   attacks targeting Israel, which fluctuate based on organizational
   objectives and capabilities, aim to provoke Israeli retaliation and
   disrupt bilateral ties with Egypt - a cornerstone of regional interstate
   stability. However, Israel's pragmatic counterterrorism measures have
   helped contain cross-border threats and strengthen Egypt-Israel
   relations to new heights. This case sheds light on how other strong
   states could face militant threats from territory of a neighboring
   partner while pursuing a delicate balance to preserve bilateral ties and
   ensure national security.},

Abstract = {The choice between protecting friendly soldiers or foreign civilians is
   a critical strategic dilemma faced in modern war. Prevailing theories
   suggest that casualties among both groups depress war support in Western
   democratic societies. Yet we know little about how ordinary citizens
   balance force protection and civilian casualty avoidance, and whether
   public opinion differs across Western democracies. Using survey
   experiments, we test three micro-foundations for what we call
   individuals' ``harm-transfer preferences:{''} self-interest, perception
   of soldiers' consent to risk-taking, and nationalism. We find that
   respondents' perception of soldiers' consent and respondents'
   nationalism explain individual-level variation in harm-transfer
   preferences. Moreover, Israeli citizens are significantly more likely
   than American or British citizens to prefer protecting friendly forces
   over avoiding foreign civilian casualties. This is associated with
   higher levels of nationalism and the perceptions that soldiers do not
   consent to risking their lives in Israel compared to the United States
   and the United Kingdom.},

Abstract = {Populism is a political ontology, in which political being is centered
   on the question of collective identity. It is also a political theology
   embedded within constitutional democracy. In the United States, three
   major varieties have attempted to resolve a question implicitly posed by
   the Constitution: who are `We the People'? These traditions are
   pluralistic, white supremacist, and Pan-African populism. For white
   supremacist populists, White people become the people. Pluralistic
   populism seeks to create a multi-ethnic and multi-racial collective
   identity around economic questions. Pan-African populism decenters
   Whiteness to build Black cultural, economic, and political power.
   Populist movements often emerge during times of crisis when collective
   identities are disrupted. I look back to three World War I era movements
   to gain insight into contemporary populisms. A study of the Ku Klux
   Klan, the Industrial Workers of the World, and Garveyism, suggests
   conflicts between the varieties of populism in the United States existed
   long before Donald Trump entered the national stage.},

Abstract = {International humanitarian aid organizations have a duty to provide
   protection and assistance to displaced persons and other vulnerable
   groups worldwide. In doing so, they collect personal and often highly
   sensitive information that may be of interest to international justice
   institutions investigating violations of international human rights and
   humanitarian law. The question arises whether humanitarian organizations
   can-or should-share information with these institutions? Is it possible
   to find a middle ground that balances the rights, duties, and priorities
   of those involved? This article examines four issues that affect
   information sharing between humanitarian organizations and international
   justice institutions: (1) the right to privacy and justice; (2) mandate
   requirements; (3) policy requirements; and (4) organizational culture.
   The article is based on an extensive literature review and interviews
   with twenty-eight current or former staff members at humanitarian
   organizations, international tribunals, and United Nations mechanisms
   and commissions of inquiry.},

Title = {State personhood and ontological security as a framework of existence:
   moving beyond identity, discovering sovereignty},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-21},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The concepts of `self' and `identity' are often implicitly conflated in
   constructivist research, limiting our understanding of important
   theoretical issues. The Ontological Security Studies (OSS) literature
   provides one example of this, often reducing a concern with `security of
   the self' to a matter of identity, thereby limiting OSS' analytical
   reach. This article draws from the writings of Laing and Giddens to make
   the case for keeping `self' and `identity' analytically distinct.
   Understanding ontological security as a multidimensional framework meant
   to affirm the self's existence, it proposes to see `identity' as just
   one dimension of ontological security, and to conceptualize `self' in
   terms of personhood. Such a reading allows us to grasp the discursive
   and ritualistic institution of sovereignty as an existential framework
   on which the personhood, and therefore ontological security, of all
   states depends. Thus, OSS would benefit from considering ontological
   security beyond identity. Beyond this, the article shows that
   distinguishing more clearly between `self' and `identity' illuminates
   the debate on state personhood in IR, indicating that paying more
   attention to these key concepts would be helpful for constructivist
   research more generally.},

Abstract = {Unidimensional measures of democracy fail to account for the complex and
   varied nature of political systems. This article disaggregates the
   concept of democracy and proposes a multidimensional conceptualization
   to account for this variation in institutional configurations. Three
   theoretically informed dimensions are featured: participation, electoral
   contestation, and constraints on the executive. The three dimensions
   constitute a cube covering all regime types, in which we place countries
   using V-Dem data from 1789 to 2019. This cube of democracy patterns
   reveals several interesting observations. We trace historical patterns
   of democratization and discuss how countries across the world have taken
   different paths at different times. Our conceptualization shows that
   political systems with a similar score along a unidimensional scale are
   often quite distinct. In addition, across the globe for 200 years,
   certain configurations of political institutions rarely occur.
   Furthermore, our approach reveals interesting patterns of regime
   convergence and divergence over time. Finally, we show that the typical
   pathways to democracy have changed since 1789. This multidimensional
   conceptualization ultimately opens up new avenues for research in which
   institutional variation and change can be studied in greater detail.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in
   Kenya's leather sector. It explores how public governance impacts SMEs'
   technological capabilities and access to global value chains (GVCs). By
   public governance, we mean all government regulations and interventions
   set in place to shape the organization of value chains. Drawing on
   interview data, the article compares Kenya's leather handbag and
   footwear manufacturers. On the one hand, handbag SMEs have succeeded in
   upgrading and entering GVCs through a combination of foreign knowledge
   and partnership with local universities. Despite meeting with public
   governance barriers, this process has enabled the transfer of
   technological capabilities from foreign-owned firms to a number of
   emerging SMEs owned by Kenyan nationals. On the other hand, leather
   footwear production was developed during the 1970s by large firms under
   state support. As protectionist measures were lifted in the 1990s, firms
   shut down and producers moved into the informal economy, replicating
   outdated capabilities in a context of price-driven competition, thereby
   limiting upgrading and participation in GVCs. The article concludes by
   comparing these findings with the experience of Kenya's apparel
   manufacturers and highlighting the critical need for GVC research to
   account for the role public governance in shaping firms' technological
   capabilities and access to global markets.},

Abstract = {The current research reveals that the pursuit of peace entails an
   inherent paradox. The urgent need to save lives and alleviate human
   suffering necessitates swift solutions to the problem of intergroup
   conflict. However, because the human mind associates peace with longer
   time horizons, people anticipate peace more when considering the distant
   rather than the near future. Six experiments demonstrate a robust and
   large effect whereby thinking about the distant future promotes the
   prospects of peace compared to thinking about the near future. These
   experiments also provide evidence for the role that construal fit, that
   is, the tendency to match high temporal distance with abstractness,
   plays in this effect. We discuss implications for shorter-term and
   longer-term peace interventions.},

Title = {The Effect of Curfews on Political Preferences},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUN 30},
Abstract = {Governments often use curfews as counterinsurgency measures. Do such
   state actions affect citizens' political preferences? We argue that
   citizens' responses depend on their group alignment. Citizens who are
   aligned with the government are more likely to interpret state actions
   as serving their interests and reward the governing parties as a result.
   Citizens who are aligned with the insurgent movement, however, are
   likely to interpret these same actions as targeted and disengage from
   politics: they have no reason to reward the governing parties and may
   also be fearful of expressing support for the parties affiliated with
   the insurgent movement. We find support for this argument with survey
   data from Turkey, fielded before and during curfews. When exposed to
   curfews, Turks generally increase their support for the governing party.
   However Kurds do not increase their support for the governing party or
   the opposition; instead, we present strong evidence that they withdraw
   their support from the Kurdish opposition and become more hesitant to
   express any political preferences.},

Abstract = {Our analysis asks whether the pandemic situation affects welfare state
   support in Germany. The pandemic has increased the health and income
   risks calling for welfare state intervention. While increased needs,
   more deservingness, and higher state responsibility during such a crisis
   would suggest augmented support generally and among those at risk, this
   might be a short-term effect and cost considerations could reverse this
   trend. We study public attitudes towards four key social policy areas
   based on the German Internet Panel (GIP). We use three waves prior and
   further three waves since the pandemic had been declared in March 2020.
   The analysis shows both continuity in the popularity of social policies,
   in particular health and pensions, and some short-term increase in
   support for unemployment and family policies. The results after nearly 2
   years suggest rather continuation with some thermostatic short-term
   boosts in support instead of any long-lasting change.},

Abstract = {The Northern Ireland 1998 Good Friday Agreement has generated a global
   industry of ``lessons from Northern Ireland{''} to other conflict
   situations. While a lively polemical literature has been debating what
   exactly should these lessons be and whether they could be validly
   exported, this article adopts the prism of the ``politics of
   comparison{''}: examining why and how certain actors appeal to analogies
   with other societies, and the causes and functions of such appeals. The
   article explores the case-study of the resonance of the Northern Ireland
   analogy in Israeli public discourse. It identifies and analyses four
   themes: the analogy with Northern Ireland is used as an argument for
   hope; as a source of peacemaking models; as self-justification, to
   deflect blame; and to legitimize narrow local interventions. The article
   contributes to literatures on the politics of comparisons, and political
   dynamics in the context of intractable conflicts.},

Abstract = {This research note is a textual comparison between different versions of
   Deng Xiaoping's two speeches in May and June 1989 using recently
   accessible scanned copies of original documents distributed to local
   officials. It reveals numerous alterations-including both deletions and
   additions-in the later published texts. The research note suggests that
   in the context of the early 1990s, these editorial efforts were made to
   restore the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party by highlighting
   Deng's image as a pragmatic reformer, maintaining Jiang Zemin's position
   as the core of the new leadership, downplaying the party's internal
   struggles and corruption, and assuring people that China would continue
   its market-oriented reform. More broadly, findings in the research note
   showcase the essential role of propaganda in legitimation under the
   Chinese communist regime.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 22},
Abstract = {The focus of this conclusion is on the SI contributions. All the
   contributors focus on key international actors and their actions and
   their necessary interaction with a significant evolving order. The
   evolution and the interaction continues without pause. While there is
   some confusion between structure and behavior such that formal
   institutions may act more formally but also informally, all acknowledge
   that there is value in distinguishing formal from informal institutions.
   There is a great deal of valuable analysis in the contributions around
   these formal and informal institutions: what identifies them and how
   they operate. There is an effort as well to be comparative and also
   quantitative and qualitative. In the end structural analysis would be
   even further advanced by distinguishing regional from global and
   particularly leader-led from other informals. Finally, today's global
   order requires us to accept the influence of nonstate actors as well as
   substate actors. The order evolves.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},

Volume = {44},

Pages = {519-534},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {This study applies continuous wavelet analysis to examine
   defense-education and defense-healthcare relations in the US and
   Britain. It discovers four empirical patterns that have not been shown
   in the existing literature. First, the defense-welfare tradeoff rarely
   occurs at cycles less than 6 years and hence is not a short-run
   phenomenon. Second, very noticeable bilateral tradeoffs between
   education and defense can be detected. The effect, however, is more
   pronounced in the direction from education to defense. Third, the
   defense-welfare tradeoff is much less likely to occur in
   defense-healthcare relations than defense-education relations. Fourth, a
   structural change in the defense-healthcare relationship occurred during
   the 1960s, after which the defense-healthcare connection became
   primarily complementary. Together, the established patterns question the
   assumption that the defense sector has a dominant power in budget
   allocation. They also raise new theoretical and empirical questions
   demanding future research efforts.},

Abstract = {This study aims to advance our knowledge about the role of public
   participation in formulating budgetary decisions of local governments.
   By focusing on participatory budgeting as a prominent form of public
   participation in the budgetary process, we posit that participatory
   budgeting serves two important roles in aligning the fiscal outcomes of
   local governments with citizen preferences: (1) increased transparency
   of the local budget and (2) improved budget literacy of citizens. This
   study investigates a link between participatory budgeting and the fiscal
   outcomes of local governments by utilizing data drawn from Korean local
   governments for seven fiscal years. Employing instrumental variable
   regression to address endogeneity, there is strong evidence that public
   participation and deliberation during the participatory budgeting
   process have a positive association with the fiscal balance. There is
   also weak evidence that the authority delegated to participatory
   budgeting participants affects the fiscal balance. The findings of this
   study imply that it is the quality of public participation that matters
   in holding the government accountable for its fiscal decisions.},

Abstract = {As climate change continues to increase both the frequency and intensity
   of environmental hazards and disasters, the need for a cohesive national
   mitigation policy grows. As the environmental federalism scholarship
   indicates, the inherent tension in federal, state, and local policy
   implementation highlights that despite a national need, environmental
   quality is a local public good. To complicate matters, there is
   disagreement about the optimal level of decision-making regarding the
   adoption and implementation of environmental policy. This study
   addresses this gap by considering the role of policy ambiguity and
   conflict in policy implementation. The analysis relies on primary
   qualitative data collected from open-ended interviews with 22 local
   government officials in 12 municipalities following Hurricane Harvey.
   Through the lens of policy ambiguity and conflict, we find confirmatory
   support for the idea that policies with less ambiguous goals are more
   likely to be implemented. Furthermore, we find that policy conflict
   arises when local governments perceive there is little for the community
   to gain by implementing the federal program. Thus, the level of
   protection afforded to citizens varies greatly between communities and
   is influenced heavily by politics. This research supports the
   Ambiguity-Conflict Model of policy implementation, an oft-cited but
   rarely tested theoretical framework for assessing the intergovernmental
   politics of policy implementation. It also demonstrates the barriers to
   local implementation of federal environmental policy in a nested system
   of government.},

Abstract = {What are the distributional implications of European institutional
   integration? This article argues that European institutional integration
   exerts a moderating effect on the relationship between trade union
   strength and income inequality-particularly inequality at the top-within
   countries of the European Union (EU). I contend that European
   institutional integration reduces the bargaining power of trade unions
   due to rising market competition and decreasing union control over the
   supply of labor. Thus, the effectiveness of trade unions in reducing
   inequality should decline with progressing European institutional
   integration. On the basis of a long-term within-country analysis of the
   EU15, I will show that the effect of trade unions on inequality varies
   strongly with European institutional integration. Consistent with the
   theoretical argument, the inequality-reducing effect of trade unions
   becomes substantially lower the more a country integrates in the EU.},

Title = {An Empirical Research on How to Tackle Infodemic in China: Stakeholders
   and Algorithms},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by an infodemic, which has now
   become a global concern. Despite the relatively timely and extensive
   guidelines regarding COVID-19 prevention and treatment, effective and
   standardized solutions for managing this infodemic are still lacking. In
   light of the ubiquity of social media in China, various algorithms have
   been applied to new media platforms to help combat COVID-19,
   particularly, misinformation and disinformation. Inspired by the model
   of `blocking the spread of the virus, treating the infected population,
   and improving immunity' for the prevention and control of the COVID-19
   pandemic, this study examines three dominant forms of
   algorithms-collaborative filtering recommendation, content-based
   recommendation, and knowledge-based recommendation-and proposes a
   theoretical model called Block, Push, and Intervene (BPI). This model
   calls for the timely blocking of misinformation and disinformation,
   precisely delivering authentic information to people affected by the
   infodemic and intervening in some potential issues in advance. Based on
   the BPI framework, we conducted semi-structured interviews with relevant
   staffs in charge of Bytedance, Tencent, Sina Weibo, Baidu, and The
   National Internet Information Office's Center for Reporting Illegal and
   Adverse Information, to summarize the patterns of algorithms used
   against the infodemic. Additionally, an online panel survey is used to
   analyze public perceptions of the severity of the infodemic on each
   platform. By evaluating the cross-validated results of the survey sample
   and semi-structured interviews on the role of algorithms against
   infodemic, this study contributes both to the understanding of the
   working details and practices surrounding information epidemics in the
   context of China, as well as to the systematic research on the unique
   use of information technology in the midst of public health crises.},

Abstract = {Performance evaluations often convey values promoted by the government.
   However, it is unclear in the Chinese context what `performance' means
   when referring to appraised values because little empirical evidence
   exists, particularly regarding the relations between values. This study
   examines Hangzhou, a pioneering case among Chinese municipalities of
   comprehensive performance evaluation, to analyze the relations between
   values. We examined 2,422 performance evaluation reports and policies
   released to the public. After conducting content and social network
   analyses, we theorized the public values structure were composed of
   relations of hierarchy, proximity, and causality. Our findings indicate
   prime values were listed prior to instrumental or market-driven values.
   The proximity between public interest and quality is demonstrated by the
   highest correlation coefficients. Each value cluster contains a causal
   relationship, indicating one value is the means to another. We discuss
   the values-oriented approach to performance evaluation, the contextual
   nature of public values studies, and the limits of using public
   satisfaction in performance evaluation. As an exploratory study, this
   work identifies values advocated by local governments in China; such
   findings are absent from existing research. Moreover, this study
   provides a practical method for empirically studying public values.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25
   May 2020, and the international uprisings which followed, racism moved
   to the forefront of public discourse. Yet, racism has no fixed
   interpretation and is a term used by different individuals and
   organisations for various functional and ideological purposes. This
   study provides an analysis of the ways that racism is discussed in four
   UK newspapers using a mixed-methods framework incorporating critical
   race theory, corpus linguistics, and the discourse-historical approach.
   It is argued that, as the protests were taking place, systemic racism
   began to be foregrounded over individualised forms of racism in
   newspaper discourse. However, journalists continued to use strategies of
   positive self-presentation to place racism outside of themselves and
   within racist `others', leading them to stand against racism in the
   abstract, while potentially diminishing possibilities for structural
   change.},

Abstract = {The rising of religious intrastate armed conflicts in recent years has a
   significant impact on the world order. Despite a growing literature on
   the relationship between religion and conflict we know little about the
   conditions under which peace processes of religious conflicts may
   succeed. Studies show that addressing issues of transitional justice
   during conflicts may promote peace. This study examines the role of
   transitional justice in peace processes of religious conflicts. Our
   study uses quantitative analysis utilizing the Transitional Justice in
   Peace Processes (TJPP) Dataset, which contains innovative information on
   worldwide peace negotiations between 1989 and 2014. The TJPP dataset
   identifies six elements of transitional justice: truth commissions,
   reconciliation processes, reparations programs, restitution and
   rehabilitation of refugees, amnesties and prisoners' release. Findings
   demonstrate that peace processes of religious conflicts are more likely
   to use transitional justice elements, yet these peace efforts are less
   likely to reach a full peace agreement.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to examine the effects of formal and informal
   institutional factors (i.e. marketization and guanxi culture) on
   interorganizational conflicts (IOCs) and their interaction effects.
   Design/methodology/approach Drawing on IOC literature and an
   institution-based view, the authors use a sample of 12,022 Chinese firms
   from the World Bank's Investment Climate Survey. A zero-inflated
   negative binomial regression was used to analyze the data. Findings The
   results suggest that guanxi culture has U-shaped effects, but
   marketization does not negatively affect IOCs. Furthermore, a low level
   of marketization weakens the U-shaped effect of guanxi culture on IOCs.
   A moderate level of guanxi culture can enable marketization to reduce
   IOCs. Practical implications This study provides a better understanding
   of the management of IOCs. Managers should fully understand the
   differential effects of the institutional environment in different
   regions and their interactions by adopting different response
   strategies. Originality/value This study enriches the literature on
   IOCs' antecedents and contextual factors by examining the institutions'
   direct and interaction effects on IOCs.},

Abstract = {Engagement with the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda by military
   actors has caused concern among some of its civil society advocates. For
   example, NATO has adopted the WPS agenda as an increasingly visible part
   of its self-narrative. Yet what had distinguished NATO's engagement with
   WPS from many other actors is that it came without civil society
   involvement. The establishment of a Civil Society Advisory Panel (CSAP)
   on WPS in 2014 is therefore highly significant for both NATO and the WPS
   agenda. Despite this, the efficacy of such consultation is not clear-cut
   nor its potential to mitigate militarised understandings of WPS and
   support transformative engagement with the agenda, particularly given
   the wariness of some civil society to engage with NATO. Drawing on
   interviews with civil society, this article interrogates their
   perceptions of NATO in order to understand the potential of such
   engagements to support transformative understandings of WPS and more
   broadly the efficacy of civil society engagement with military
   institutions. In so doing, it examines how such consultation adds to our
   understanding of NATO as an institution of international hegemonic
   masculinity.},

Abstract = {What are the effects of citizen grievances on autocrats' fiscal
   spending? I argue that autocrats will increase fiscal spending only when
   grievances may jeopardize stability. I hypothesize that when Internet
   penetration is high, a marginal increase in labor strikes and
   administrative lawsuits leads to increased spending on social welfare,
   health, education, and housing support. Evidence from China's 31
   provinces (2006-2019) supports this hypothesis. The results are robust
   to instrumental variable strategies. The results may run against the
   expectations of the ``selectorate theory{''} which posits that autocrats
   are generally disinclined to increase spending for citizens. My theory
   and evidence suggest that grievances will be perceived differently by
   autocrats according to different levels of connectivity, leading to
   different levels of spending.},

Abstract = {Conventional thinking proposes that naming and shaming pushes publics to
   oppose government policies that are claimed to violate human rights. We
   explore the extent to which international organizations' (IOs') efforts
   to name and shame target governments can be frustrated by the target
   governments' efforts to advance a counter-narrative. We test this using
   a survey-based experiment that focuses on the use of prolonged solitary
   confinement in US prisons. The results suggest that government messaging
   has powerful effects on public opinion. These effects are more readily
   discernible than the effects of IO signals. We also find some limited
   evidence to suggest that messages from international nongovernmental
   organizations can, by themselves, elicit a backlash among the
   respondents. Surprisingly, we found similar effects among both Democrats
   and Republicans. This demonstrates important limitations to IOs' naming
   and shaming tactics.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the role of constitutional
   control in the framework of state lawmaking and law enforcement
   functions and the impact of constitutional control bodies on political
   development, economic transformation, and social policy. This study
   examines the role and place of constitutional control in the state legal
   mechanism, the advantages and disadvantages of specialized and
   non-specialized constitutional control, preventive constitutional
   control. The study concludes that the model of nonspecialized
   centralized constitutional control is very promising, capable of
   effectively balancing the logic of decisionism (discretion) and the
   scope of constitutional responsibilities. This study examines the
   relationship between the constitutional control and decisionism from the
   point of view of the Russian legal system. In practical terms, this
   study is of interest to representatives of the legal profession,
   practicing in the field of human rights protection, human rights
   organizations, and members of the judiciary.},

   MPs, who overwhelmingly voted `remain' in the referendum, was to choose
   between their responsibilities as elected representatives and to
   implement the political mandate expressed through the exercise of direct
   democracy. Brexit, as the Miller I judgment confirms, alters the UK
   constitution by removing rights which UK and EU citizens enjoyed under
   the EU Treaties. In giving effect to Brexit, Parliament's constitutional
   relationship with the Executive, which had positioned itself politically
   as upholding the `will of the people', was severely tested as the
   Cherry/Miller II prorogation judgment illustrates. Within a context of
   political turmoil and minority government, the Brexit process brought
   into sharp focus the conflict between what has been described as a
   `Whitehall versus Westminster' interpretation of the relationship
   between Parliament and the Executive within the UK Constitution.},

Abstract = {The Korean COVID-19 surveillance system generates public discourses on
   good citizenship regarding civic duty, human rights, and social equality
   by releasing the travel history information of COVID-19 patients to the
   public. Through digital ethnography, this article examines how good
   citizenship is constructed in three material contexts - things, places,
   and mobility - associated with COVID-19 patients' movements. From the
   new materialist perspective, citizenship is an outcome of the
   socio-material assemblage of things, people, and institutions. We view
   travel history information as `actants' that affect people's behaviors,
   especially, mom cafes mothers' conception of good citizenship. This
   citizenship involves materiality related to face masks and COVID-19, a
   sense of place in terms of crowded places, and the physical mobility of
   COVID-19 patients. The disclosure policy on travel history information
   plays a vital role in overweighing civic duty over human rights and
   social equality by decontextualizing the life of COVID-19 patients due
   to concerns over privacy infringement. This policy spawns a uniform
   citizenship that overlooks the economic and cultural differences among
   COVID-19 patients. Ultimately, irregular employees, sexual minorities,
   and delivery workers carry a greater burden in complying with the civic
   duties of the general population.},

Abstract = {Why do elites and ordinary individuals support targeting peripheral
   minorities? This study argues that high income inequality in the society
   and economic communitarianism among its population form the social basis
   for diversionary domestic conflict. When income inequality in society is
   high, the elites have an incentive to divert popular discontent toward
   peripheral minorities. High income inequality also raises the
   expectations for state assistance among the economically communitarian
   population strata, who tend to regard the minorities as a target for
   resource extraction. I test these conjectures using the case of Russia
   and Chechnya and find support for the proposed theory.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to assess how the European Union advances its
   role as a global security actor and how it deploys the military forces
   provided by the member states. Tracing the current debate of the
   identity and means of the European Union, we analyze the two maritime
   operations, EU NAVFOR Somalia (Operation Atalanta) and EUNAVFOR MED
   (Operation Sophia) from a naval diplomacy perspective. Naval diplomacy
   acknowledge a more versatile role for naval forces, not just military
   advancement and force projection. For this purpose, we need to go beyond
   mission descriptions and operational mandates in order to analyze and
   assess the two operations from within, relying on internal reports and
   interviews with senior officers who have participated in the operations.
   Results show that naval forces seeks cooperation with International
   organizations, NGOs, and third countries in order to facilitate security
   and good order of the global common of international water. Still,
   complex security problems are not resolved in this manner and EU
   maritime operations are highly political, thus facing an uncertain
   future as a tool of CSDP.<br />},

Abstract = {This article analyzes how the 2020 Polish Presidential election was
   affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic in the context of global
   democratic backsliding. Specifically, this article examines how the
   incumbency advantage of President Andrzej Duda was bolstered during the
   pandemic by the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS). Although PiS was
   unable to carry out every planned electoral manipulation, the party
   nonetheless helped Duda secure a second term in office in a historically
   close election. On the one hand, this article illustrates that while
   many of the tactics undertaken by PiS were within the limits of the
   letter of the law, its actions still undermined the spirit of Polish
   democracy. On the other hand, this article also contributes to the
   literature on democratic backsliding by underscoring the fact that the
   election in Poland was free and fair, which makes this regime
   qualitatively different from other cases in the region.},

   trends, provide technical and programming expertise, as well as
   evaluation functions. Historically consultancies were introduced to
   public administrations to prevent market dominance and to respond to
   demands for specialized professional services. This relationship morphed
   into an expanded global market for a wide range of consultancy services
   that national and international administrations purchase. We explore how
   consultancies and public administrations interact through a discussion
   of task-setting based on recognition of: (i) what party can make claims
   to support a public ethos, (ii) what forms of expertise are most
   relevant for solving the problem, and (iii) status in who can best
   tackle uncertainties.},

Abstract = {Trans-national jihadist groups have established themselves across many
   contexts. However, we have limited knowledge about the larger picture of
   how such groups tap into various inter-religious, sectarian, or ethnic
   divisions. To address this research gap, we explore: How do
   trans-national jihadist groups mobilize on the basis of different forms
   of identity cleavages? Our empirical analysis focuses on all
   trans-national jihadist groups who have challenged governments in civil
   wars. We find that mobilization along ethnic divisions is the most
   common cleavage, and is increasing most over time. We also find that
   sectarian mobilization is rare, but associated with significant
   escalation of violence.},

Abstract = {The past decade has witnessed rapid growth in popular protest, alongside
   an upsurge in research on collective action. The proliferation of
   research has been both productive and fragmenting: We have an excellent
   understanding of the many factors that shape participation in collective
   action, but we lack a framework that explains how these factors fit
   together. The Model of Belonging, Individual differences, Life
   experience and Interaction Sustaining Engagement (MOBILISE) addresses
   this gap to explain when, why, how, and for whom, collective action
   manifests. MOBILISE suggests that participation in collective action is
   shaped by individual differences (micro) and life experiences which,
   separately and in combination, lead to the formation of a group
   consciousness (meso) via the collectivization of grievance. Group
   consciousness is, in turn, the proximal predictor of collective action.
   Collective action itself has outcomes for people (dis/empowerment) and
   societies. These micro and meso processes occur in the context of macro
   societal factors relating to the cultural, political, and economic
   environment. MOBILISE highlights the transformational role of
   interaction in explaining the global reach and rapidity with which
   popular movements can form.},

Abstract = {An increasing number of countries have recently cracked down on
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Much of this crackdown is
   sanctioned by law and represents a bureaucratic form of repression that
   could indicate more severe human rights abuses in the future. This is
   especially the case for democracies, which, unlike autocracies, may not
   aggressively attack civic space. We explore whether crackdowns on NGOs
   predict broader human rights repression. Anti-NGO laws are among the
   most subtle means of repression and attract lesser domestic and
   international condemnation compared to the use of violence. Using
   original data on NGO repression, we test whether NGO crackdown is a
   predictor of political terror and violations of physical integrity
   rights and civil liberties. We find that although de jure anti-NGO laws
   provide little information in predicting future repression, their
   patterns of implementation-or de facto civil society repression-predict
   worsening respect for physical integrity rights and civil liberties.},

Abstract = {Argentina's public university system has shifted from the indelible
   reformist tradition of 1918, with its emancipatory and Latin American
   perspective, to a commodified education in line with the global logic
   introducing neoliberal rationality and the neoliberal subject into the
   Universidad Nacional de Cuyo. A review of recent reforms and a
   description of the university's institutional measures is followed by
   possible lines of resistance, combining ideas from the 1918 reformist
   movement and the current Argentine feminist movement. La universidad
   publica argentina esta sufriendo una conversion de la tradicion de
   indeleble marca reformista desde 1918 (de horizonte emancipatorio y
   latinoamericano) a una educacion mercantilizada segun la logica global
   de la racionalidad neoliberal y del sujeto neoliberal, visible en la
   Universidad Nacional de Cuyo. Repaso reformas nacionales recientes, y
   describo las disposiciones institucionales de la universidad para llegar
   a una discusion sobre coordenadas posibles de resistencia entrecruzando
   ideas del movimiento reformista de 1918 y el actual movimiento feminista

Abstract = {is a reference to Kant's philosophy. For Kant, ``reason's natural
   illusions are not merely revealed by subtle philosophical analysis but
   unavoidably manifest themselves in the form of actual contradictions
   each side of which seems . . . plausible.{''}1 In a similar vein, the
   antinomies of refugee reason are not merely the results of a theoretical
   exercise but forms of ``actual contradictions.{''} To overcome the
   impasse of the antinomies, Kant recommended adapting the key distinction
   of transcendental idealism between appearances and things in themselves.
   This solution might be tempting, for instance, when brought to bear on
   refugee subalternity,2 which could be resolved by conceding that the
   sociopolitical construction of their existence ``for us{''} does not get
   at their being in and for themselves. (As a matter of fact, the backdrop
   for Spivak's notion of subalternity is thoroughly Kantian, in that no
   representation is able to express the being of the represented, which
   endures as a kind of oppressed and mute thing in itself.) Here, however,
   we exhaust the usefulness of Kant and must turn to Hegel and Marx. That
   is to say, we must dialectically affirm the nonillusory nature and
   necessity of self-contradiction (Hegel), as well as insist on tackling
   actual contradictions in actuality, in and through political practice
   (Marx). Needless to say, the ambit of this practice ought to be
   significantly wider than the refugee question: it would need to occupy
   itself with},

Abstract = {As in the rest of the world, during the last decade Latin American
   States have been promoting various initiatives of ``open government{''},
   which recently reached parliaments and the courts, in a transition to an
   ``open State{''}. This article reflects upon the prospects of these
   management philosophies becoming dominant paradigms of public governance
   in the region, in times of exponential changes characterizing the 4th
   Industrial Revolution, which pose new and complex challenges to state
   management. The emergence of open government is placed within the
   historical sequence of the successive paradigms that have dominated the
   field of public management, in order to find out the degree of
   continuity or rupture it implied vis-a-vis its predecessors. Then, it is
   examined the assumptions and challenges implicit in the adoption of its
   principles, as well as their modes of application. Finally, it is
   speculated about the perspectives of open government or open State
   becoming the threshold of typical way of governance of a deliberative
   democracy.},

Abstract = {How does partisan polarization in the United States affect foreign
   perceptions of its security commitments and global leadership? In a
   survey experiment fielded to 2000 adults in the United Kingdom, I
   demonstrate that priming respondents to think about US polarization
   negatively impacts their evaluations of the US-UK bilateral
   relationship. These impacts are stronger for the long-term, reputational
   consequences of polarization than for immediate security concerns. While
   foreign allies do not expect the United States to renege on existing
   security commitments, perceptions of extreme polarization make them less
   willing to engage in future partnerships with the United States and more
   skeptical of its global leadership. I find that these negative
   reputational consequences of polarization are driven by perceptions of
   preference-based, ideological polarization rather than identity-based,
   affective polarization. The results suggest that American allies
   anticipate that increasing divergence between the Republican and
   Democratic Party will create future uncertainty around US foreign
   policy.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, the European Union (EU) has faced a severe
   migration crisis that brought to the fore the issues of borders and
   security-including security at borders and the borders of security. This
   article introduces the special issue `Shifting Borders of European
   (In)Securities: Human Security, Border (In)Security and Mobility in
   Security' going beyond the traditional dichotomy vision of borders,
   namely inclusion versus exclusion (Panebianco 2016). It sets the scene
   to examine the proliferating insecurities at and in reference to EU
   borders, suggesting a migrant-centred understanding of human security
   and mobility and its complex relations to-and tensions with-more
   traditional conceptions of border security. In particular, this
   introductory paper opens up the possibility of disentangling the
   complexity of (in)securities and (im)mobilities. Like the rest of the
   special issue, it shows that state security and human security are not
   mutually exclusive and can in fact be mutually reinforcing, even if this
   unfortunately remains the exception rather than the norm in practice.
   The paper (and the special issue) seeks to elaborate a more
   comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the challenges of shifting
   borders of European (in)securities, thus shedding light on complex
   migration phenomena and contributing to better understanding of these
   issues and what can be done about them in, but also beyond, academia.},

Abstract = {Friendship is an important aspect of a state's ability to succeed in
   great power politics, especially with regards to international order
   reshaping or building. Through engaging with the extant literature on
   friendship in International Relations, it is posited that while
   friendships tend to arise along strategic or normative dimensions, the
   most important (and enduring) friendships are bilateral relationships
   which are also culturally and historically aligned-what this article
   terms a bona fide international friendship. With China's rise continuing
   apace, the importance for it to have friends, especially powerful ones,
   is self-evident. This article examines the concept of friendship in the
   scope of China's foreign policymaking, identifying an increased effort
   to cultivate friendships. However, this article argues that as it
   currently stands, China does not appear to have any significant bona
   fide friends. Russia may yet emerge as a serious contender as a bona
   fide friend for China, but substantial issues may arise in that
   friendship in the coming decades. Thus, for China, and other aspiring
   international powers, building bona fide international friendships with
   prominent international powers is a critical task ahead because
   international orders underpinned by bona fide friendships will likely be
   more resilient than those orders that are not.},

Abstract = {Highly contested energy and environmental policy issues are often
   characterized by entrenched policy debates and inconsistent or failed
   policies. This study examines the cognition of polarized policy
   positions in an effort to explain what factors influence the mental
   models' individuals use to think about hydraulic fracturing and adopted
   policy positions on the controversial issue of hydraulic fracturing. The
   study first examines the role of affect on the use of ``cognitive policy
   images{''} or the individual-level mental models used to represent
   policy positions on hydraulic fracturing using structural topic
   modeling. Next, regression analysis is used to estimate the effects of
   theoretically relevant factors on cognition. While previous studies have
   focused on public attitudes, this study takes a comparative approach to
   examine policy elite and public cognition around this controversial
   issue. A comparative approach not only points to subtle differences in
   how elites and members of the general public cognitively process this
   controversial policy issue but also provides some insight into how
   political sophistication factors into cognition and influences policy
   positions on hydraulic fracturing practices. Conclusions discuss some
   practical, methodological, and theoretical implications of this work.},

Abstract = {Although the field of transitional justice is expanding rapidly,
   research on its effects remains underdeveloped, despite its presumed
   importance for human rights and democratic consolidation. The field
   suffers from incompatible approaches and definitions, disputed causal
   models and conclusions, and a multiplicity of dependent variables.
   Quantitative work struggles to ground measurement and hypothesis testing
   in nuanced conceptions of transitional justice's causal processes.
   Robust understanding of effects requires integrating qualitative and
   quantitative approaches while balancing accuracy with parsimony. This
   article first revisits and builds on a key quantitative work: Olsen et
   al.'s Transitional Justice in Balance (2010). Using an expanded dataset
   to repeat their descriptive and statistical analysis of the effects of
   transitional justice, the article finds results only marginally
   consistent with their original findings. This reassessment is the basis
   for proposed revisions to their causal model, conceptualization,
   measurement, and hypothesis testing. The proposed approach includes a
   two-step causal model, differentiated measurement of transitional
   justice mechanisms, and hypotheses that are more deeply grounded in the
   insights of qualitative studies. These revisions provide a framework
   with rich potential for comparative quantitative analysis of the effects
   of transitional justice.},

Abstract = {This article examines organizational legitimacy within a volatile
   socio-political context. Drawing on qualitative data from non-profit
   organizations (NPOs) in the Russian Federation, we explore the question
   of how organizations gain regulatory legitimacy in such an uncertain and
   hostile socio-political context. Our study highlights that in such a
   context, the state often fails to grant regulatory legitimacy to NPOs.
   In response, NPOs seek to achieve regulatory legitimacy via symbolic
   acts and supplement these with a range of substantive activities. Such
   actions help demonstrate organizational effectiveness to the government
   and generate trust with individuals in the regional state apparatus. We
   show that regulatory legitimacy requires a more nuanced examination in
   contexts that make it difficult for organizations to routinize its
   attainment. Thus, our article contributes to legitimacy theory by
   exploring how key aspects of organizational legitimacy are conditioned
   and constituted by the socio-political context.},

Title = {Who should ``do more{''} about climate change? Cultural theory,
   polycentricity, and public support for climate change actions across
   actors and governments},

Abstract = {Under a polycentric approach to climate change, action is taken at
   different scales and across all levels of government and sectors of
   society. Some scholars have argued that such an approach is the best
   lens to view the governance of climate change and that a polycentric
   approach has advantages in addressing collective-action problems.
   However, taking a polycentric approach would require public support for
   action at multiple scales. The issue of climate change is polarized
   across political beliefs and cultural worldviews and little research has
   examined how the public views climate action at one level of government
   relative to others as well as relative to actions by the private sector
   and by individuals. Using an original survey of the US public from
   October 2017, I explore who it is that the public thinks should ``do
   more{''} about climate change and the role that the cultural worldviews
   posited by cultural theory-hierarchical, egalitarian, individualist, and
   fatalist-plays in shaping those opinions. Overall, I find support for
   multiple actors doing more to address climate change, but with
   differences in support between egalitarians and individualists for
   actors overall and for the federal government in particular.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to discussions about subnational responses to the
   coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in federal countries. In the
   scholarship on federalism and public policy, few studies seek to
   understand the factors that shape subnational differences in welfare
   levels. This article seeks to better understand this issue in Brazil by
   exploring how, in a context with little national-level coordination,
   subnational governments tackle the inequalities exacerbated by the
   COVID-19 pandemic. This study analyzes two social policy areas with
   distinct national-level coordination mechanisms and federal
   responsibilities: social assistance and education. Two multi-level cases
   are examined: the states of Amazonas and Sao Paulo and the cities of
   Manaus and Sao Paulo. This analysis relies on quantitative data, mainly
   social indicators, and qualitative data collected through documents and
   in-depth interviews. Social assistance and education policy actors in
   Amazonas and Sao Paulo faced at times significant obstacles adapting
   and/or creating policies to tackle inequalities, resulting in a
   fend-for-yourself federalism and fragmented subnational policies.
   Differences in subnational responses can be explained by distinct policy
   legacies and previous capacity, which were key in organizing a useful
   response to the pandemic. However, to fully explain subnational
   responses, the role of actors within institutional contexts must also be
   taken into account. In social assistance, shared responsibilities among
   different levels of government led to competition and credit claiming
   dynamics, reinforcing fragmented and uncoordinated responses. In
   education, decentralization and more stable funding allowed political
   leadership to activate and mobilize subnational capacities and other
   actors at the subnational level, producing more sustainable responses.},

Abstract = {One of the ways in which opposition activists in Zimbabwe receive
   funding is through democracy assistance. Focusing on the late 1990s to
   2016, this article explores the effect the receipt of such aid had on
   the ways in which opposition activists organise and on their ideological
   orientation. The authors show that the availability of such funds
   contributed to the commercialisation of the struggle whereby opposition
   activists began to view activism as a way to earn a living. Furthermore,
   this funding led to a decline in trust, passion and voluntarism among
   opposition activists. And, finally, dependence on foreign funding
   resulted in ideological shifts in Zimbabwean opposition parties and
   organisations whereby radical, left-leaning positions were abandoned in
   order to secure funding. The authors suggest that local strategies for
   funding such struggles for democracy must be given greater consideration
   to promote transformational possibilities and new participatory forms of
   democracy.},

Abstract = {How has the process of institution and governance building in Africa, a
   domain traditionally subject to western development interventions, been
   changed by Chinese-led development? Taking Uganda's roads sector, and
   particularly its main implementing agency the Ugandan National Roads
   Authority as a case study, I argue that traditional donors' influence on
   sectorial institution building has not been replaced or dislodged by
   China's growing presence. This presence primarily took the form of
   Chinese construction companies operating as profit-driven contractors
   interested mainly in quick project turnaround rather than in
   systematically shaping sectorial governance in the host country.
   Moreover, not only did traditional donors' development financing remain
   dominant vis-a-vis China, but the ways in which their interventions were
   designed, exercised, and monitored in the post-conditionality regime
   characteristically differed from their Chinese counterparts, ensuring
   their embedded and enduring role in the reforming of sectorial state
   institutions. As such, a tacit division of labour took shape between
   Chinese and western engagements in Uganda's roads sector: China focused
   on `hard' physical road construction whilst traditional donors on the
   `soft' aspects of sectorial governance and policy. The availability of
   both forms of development engagements with their distinctive foci
   enables issue-specific agency for Uganda to develop its roads sector,
   and yet they together appear to create favourable conditions for the
   Ugandan leadership's increasing authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {Not all successful unarmed civil insurrections against dictatorships
   take place in a dramatic mass uprising with hundreds of thousands
   occupying central squares in the capital city. There have also been
   cases of nonviolent struggles against autocratic regimes that failed to
   topple the dictatorship in a revolutionary wave, but did succeed in
   forcing a series of legal, constitutional and institutional reforms over
   a period of several years that eventually evolved into a liberal
   democratic order. These more gradualist transitions have taken place
   across different regions and against different kinds of authoritarian
   systems. This webinar will tell the story of pro-democracy movements in
   three of these countries-Brazil, South Korea and Kenya-and how they were
   able to force, over time, autocratic governments to agree to substantive
   democratic reforms. By focusing on the role of civil society, this
   presentation challenges dominant, top-down, institution- and elite-based
   approaches to democratization.},
