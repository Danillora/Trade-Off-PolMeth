Abstract = {Governments initiate major public sector reforms for various reasons.
   Although change leadership appears crucial, its role in implementing
   reforms in public organizations receives scant attention. Insights from
   public administration and change management literature help to bridge
   the gap between these macrolevel and microlevel perspectives. Our
   multilevel study of two youth care organizations addressing public
   sector reform explores how leadership behavior-and in interaction
   between top and middle managers-contributes to the concept of what we
   call change embeddedness among front-line employees. The use of
   leadership behaviors during the reform that are leader centric (shaping)
   appear to be associated with greater ambiguity and worse change
   embeddedness. However, leadership focused on engaging employees and
   boundary spanning with external organizations seems to support the
   embeddedness of the reform, especially when these behaviors are
   connected to a clear sense of purpose around the change.},

Abstract = {The 20-year mission in Afghanistan for which the United States (US) had
   sacrificed tremendous blood and treasure ended in the worst way
   imaginable with a poorly planned and executed withdrawal that saw the
   Taliban immediately retake power and form a hardline interim government
   that includes known terrorist leaders. The manner in which the US
   handled negotiations with the Taliban over the last three years
   contributed to the speed with which they were able to over-run the
   country in August 2021. The return of Taliban rule will likely increase
   terrorism challenges both for the region and on a global scale as groups
   like Al-Qaeda rebuild in the country and foreign terrorist fighters
   relocate there to find shelter under a regime ruled by fellow Islamist
   radicals. Moving forward, the US must work with like-minded nations to
   condition assistance and diplomatic recognition on the Taliban meeting
   certain human rights and counterterrorism conditions and improve its
   remote counterterrorism capabilities.},

Abstract = {Although the Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most widely
   ratified human rights treaty, threats to children's rights persist
   globally. One reason is that states have not met their threshold
   obligation to ensure that children's rights are widely known, so that
   they may be respected and ensured. This article argues that an important
   way to disseminate children's rights among children and adults is to
   partner with the arts. The article examines the benefits of a
   partnership between children's rights and the arts and discusses the key
   elements of a children's rights approach to the arts, as well as
   challenges to address.},

Title = {COVID-19 as a trigger for innovation in policy action for older persons?
   Evidence from Asia},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {168-186},
Month = {JAN 28},
Abstract = {COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on older people, in terms of
   their susceptibility to the disease and increased fatality rates, while
   also by creating barriers to health care access, social isolation,
   psychological and financial burdens. Policy responses provide an
   opportunity to understand whether the demands of this crisis have led to
   the development of policy innovations to meet the needs of aging
   populations. We analyzed an illustrative corpus of policies collected by
   HelpAge International across Asia in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India,
   Iran, Japan, Korea, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Vietnam. We identified
   different policy types that impacted older persons during the pandemic.
   We also observed the degree to which these policies support arguments
   for paradigmatic policy changes by examining different models of
   intersectoral and multisectoral collaborations, and the kinds of
   policies where these multiactor arrangements were the most common. From
   our analysis, we identify two main areas where COVID-19 policies are
   most likely to lead to more long-lasting innovation in Asia. The first
   is in the upgrading of infrastructures to ensure access to benefits, and
   to develop remote and doorstep banking. The second area is well-being
   and caring support, such as the development of programs to provide
   increased services to support home-based older persons, including
   telemedicine, delivery services for medical and other supplies, and
   remote support for older persons and their carers. These changes, while
   important, are consistent with ``acceleration{''} models of policy
   change, where COVID-19 responses sped up, and scaled up, programs
   consistent with current institutional and organizational structures.},

Abstract = {In recent years, interest has grown in how Transitional Justice (TJ) can
   approach colonial harms and their long-lasting effects, because of a
   lacuna in both TJ practice and academic research . Scant attention has
   been paid, particularly, to how peace processes themselves can be
   undermined by ongoing colonial legacies. In this article, we offer an
   in-depth case study on Colombia, particularly the Havana Peace Accord of
   2016, and discuss how the debris - to use Stoler's term - of Spanish
   colonialism relating to land, ethnicity and gender have become evident
   throughout the process: during the negotiations, in the campaigns prior
   to the referendum, and while undertaking its implementation. We argue
   that peace processes must account for ongoing harms rooted in colonial
   projects; in the first instance, to provide structural justice for those
   who suffer these harms in a broader sense and, also, to protect the
   specific aims of the peace process in question.},

Title = {Regionalism and regional organisations: exploring the dynamics of

Abstract = {Two elements define regional integration in Latin America: its extension
   in time and its plurality. Analyses abound regarding the drivers
   underlying regional cooperation, the specific institutional design, its
   effects, and impact. However, studies have not yet provided full answers
   to the question of how regional institutions emerge and change through
   time in Latin America. To investigate this rather underexplored issue, I
   contribute a dynamic analytical framework whereby interests and ideas
   are taken as factors that interact with each other within a specified
   institutional environment, thus shaping processes of institutional
   creation, change and development. The argument advanced is that whereas
   the role of states and presidents remains constant, ideas and the
   existing regional organisations face presidents with either limitations
   or resources depending on the degree of synergy and convergence between
   states' material interests and regional ideas and institutions. Based on
   the particular ideational and institutional configuration, three
   patterns of change may emerge: creation, conversion, and layering. The
   paper draws on comparative regionalism and institutionalism studies and
   empirically explores more than 25 years of regional cooperation in Latin
   America. Focus is on the comparative assessment of the Common Market of
   the South and the Union of South American Nations.},

Abstract = {Recent work finds evidence that partisan calculations, not ideological
   preferences, drive congressional decisions on foreign policy. While
   legislators support the wars launched by their party's presidents, they
   often oppose those by the other party's presidents. However, it is
   unclear whether such partisan calculations are limited to a narrow set
   of security votes or whether they are part of a broad pattern of foreign
   policymaking in Congress. To examine the importance of partisan versus
   ideological motivations, we examine the substantive contributions
   legislators make to, and the votes they cast on, foreign policy
   measures. Specifically, we collect sponsorship and voting data on
   amendments that allow Congress to restrict presidential spending on
   defense programs and foreign aid. In analyzing data from 1971 to 2016,
   we find that ideology is the most consistent factor that determines
   whether legislators propose and support spending limits on
   security-related bills.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how standards of hegemonic femininity in
   Kazakhstan are utilised by the public in online spaces to police Kazakh
   women's bodies, glorify national culture, and normalise violence against
   women who do not conform to these standards. Drawing upon discourse
   analysis as the primary method for examining available comments on
   Facebook and Instagram, this paper is one of the first studies of modern
   Kazakh nationalism from a critical gendered perspective that situates
   discourses about Kazakh women in the context of sexual violence and
   demonstrates the ``weaponisation{''} of women's bodies and the
   normalisation of violence against them in online spaces.},

Abstract = {Government organizations increasingly use crowdsourcing platforms to
   interact with citizens and integrate their requests in designing and
   delivering public services. Drawing on attribution theory, this study
   asks how the causal attributions of the government response to a citizen
   request affect continued participation in crowdsourcing platforms. To
   test our hypotheses, we use a 7-year dataset of both online requests
   from citizens to government and government responses to citizen
   requests. We focus on citizen requests that are denied by government,
   and find that the reasoning for denying a request is related with
   continued participation behavior. Citizens are less willing to
   collaborate further with government via the platform, when their
   requests are denied although the locus of causality is with the
   government. This study contributes to research on the role of
   responsiveness in digital interaction between citizens and government
   and highlights the importance of rationale transparency to sustain
   citizen participation.},

Abstract = {There is growing evidence that, led by the U.S., a transformation of
   trans-Atlantic counter-terrorism (CT) has occurred since 9/11. However,
   a theoretically informed framework for understanding how this has
   happened remains elusive. Using post-Fordist industrial theory and new
   evidence collected from senior practitioners across the trans-Atlantic
   space, this article provides a novel conceptual framework for
   understanding how states have transformed CT organization since 9/11,
   primarily in response to global jihadism. It shows how many of these
   solutions are remarkably similar and based on post-Fordist business
   and/or military best practices, including centralization and
   decentralization; integration of core and periphery workforces; a
   network approach to knowledge sharing; and outsourcing. The conclusion
   discusses the effectiveness of these solutions and their use in meeting
   new policy challenges.},

Abstract = {Addressing the topic of ethical investment, this paper considers stock
   market indices related to climate change and provides the first
   comprehensive analysis of the links between low-carbon equities and
   conventional equities. Results show that in the long run, low carbon
   economy indices do not behave like conventional indices, and no balance
   relationship is identified between the two, such that investors can find
   in the low-carbon sector an opportunity to diversify investment as an
   alternative to traditional equity investment. In the short-run, the two
   investment segments display identical behaviour, especially in
   contemporary terms, with daily dynamics driven fundamentally by market
   factors. These results will help regulators and policy makers to design
   policies for sustainable equity investment according to macroprudential
   policies.},

Abstract = {In Mozambique, policy discourses supporting the expansion of large-scale
   capitalist agriculture have largely focused on its potential to increase
   agricultural production and productivity. In particular, they have
   highlighted the potential contribution to rural employment and income,
   and their impacts on poverty reduction. Yet in focusing narrowly on
   these dynamics, they have ignored the contradictions of social
   reproduction of labour often associated with the expansion of capitalist
   production. This paper explores these contradictions by considering
   primary and secondary evidence from two contexts of expansion of
   large-scale capitalist agriculture in Mozambique. It argues that these
   contradictions have manifested in diverse forms, reflecting the extent
   to which forms of expansion and (re)organisation of sectors of
   capitalist agricultural production, and the associated forms of labour
   exploitation, have affected different spheres of social reproduction of
   labour in these contexts. Moreover, the paper suggests, they have
   reproduced more broadly, as the expansion/intensification of the
   extractive logic of accumulation has compromised `alternative' spaces of
   social reproduction.},

Title = {The Evolution of the Socio-political Situation of the Republic of
   Turkiye in the 20th Century Efforts Towards the Europeanisation of the

Abstract = {The events related to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the
   proclamation of the Republic of Turkiye contributed to a complete
   departure from the system of constitutional monarchy in favour of a
   parliamentary democracy. Owing to the decisions on Europeanisation and
   implemented reforms, i.e., adopting a Civil Code based on the Swiss
   code, a Criminal Code reflecting the Italian code, a Commercial Code
   underpinned by the German code (1924), and the transition to the Latin
   alphabet which replaced Arabic (1928), as well as education reforms
   (1925), women's suffrage (1934), and the introduction of surnames
   (1935), etc. the Turkish people became a European society, aware of
   their rights and obligations. The transition from a singleparty regime
   to a multi-party period (1946) allowed for democracy to be consolidated.
   Turkiye's participation in strictly European and international political
   and military organisations was of vital significance and turned the
   country into an extremely important state. Its failed efforts to join
   the EEC, and, subsequently, the European Union, resulted in Turkiye
   abandoning its interest in this form of cooperation (1997).
   The socio-political transformations that took place in the 20th century,
   highlighted in this article, characterise this dynamically changing
   period. The evolution of the views of Turkish society was clearly marked
   in the second half of the 20th century, which led to serious changes in
   the mindsets of the Turkish people and completely altered the image of
   the country post-2002, allowing the newly established Justice and
   Development Party to assume power (2002).},

Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {80},
Number = {1},
Pages = {170-183},
Abstract = {Norwegian climate policy has increasingly become closely linked to EU
   climate regulations. This article analyzes how and why Norway has linked
   its climate policy to the EU???s and what room for maneuvering the
   cooperation with the EU gives Norwegian authorities. Through the EEA
   agreement, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) has covered about
   half of Norway???s emissions, mainly from industry and the petroleum
   sector, since 2008. Since 2021, non-ETS emissions from transport,
   agriculture, construction and waste have also been covered by a separate
   time-limited agreement with the EU, as a supplement to the EEA
   agreement. This cooperation obliges Norway to cut emissions every year
   until 2030. The agreement also binds Norway to comply with EU
   regulations for the emissions and uptake of greenhouse gases related to
   forests and other land use. In practice, Norway is fully obliged to
   comply with the EU???s climate policy regulations until 2030. The
   analysis shows that this close connection has increased the political
   pressure to cut greenhouse gas emissions domestically. At the same time,
   Norway has chosen to keep all flexibility options open to implement the
   cuts in the EU instead. Whether these opportunities will be used is
   largely a political question that probably will shape the climate debate
   until 2030. The final design and structure of the EU???s Green Deal and
   Norway???s connection to it will also affect the maneuvering room for
   climate cuts at home versus abroad.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has constrained the ability of states across the
   world to govern and control their territories. As the state reduces its
   activities, space opens for violent non-state actors working for and
   against the state to fill the vacuum. Highlighting this trend, the
   present study evaluates the effects of COVID-19 and pandemics more
   broadly on attacks by non-state actors. Our theory emphasizes the
   incentives of both rebels and pro-government non-state actors (PGNs) to
   increase their attack frequency as disease spreads and the state
   retracts its governance activities to preserve resources needed
   elsewhere. In the first case, we highlight how the pandemic allows
   rebels to reduce asymmetries of power with respect to the military and
   establish themselves as a viable government alternative. In the second
   case, PGNs, which provide an alternative to militaries, are deployed to
   these contested spaces to thwart or pre-empt rebellion during the
   pandemic. Employing daily-level data on the annual change in armed
   conflict and COVID-19 cases across 127 countries between 1 January 2020
   and 15 June 2020, we test both claims using an econometric
   identification strategy. We do not find clear evidence that COVID-19 led
   to a higher frequency of rebel attacks, suggesting that these groups
   prefer to bolster their standing using nonviolent means, or avoid
   fighting and preserve their resources. In contrast, we find that the
   frequency of PGN attacks has increased with COVID-19 prevalence compared
   with last year. Case studies of insurgent and PGN activity in
   Afghanistan and Nigeria lend additional support to these results,
   illustrating some underlying mechanisms. Our findings explore overlooked
   challenges that pandemics and other disasters pose to conflict
   mitigation and the role PGNs play in these contexts.},

Title = {The Barents Cooperation Amid Geopolitical Tensions: A Discourse Analysis
   of Norwegian Experiences},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},

Volume = {80},
Number = {3},
Pages = {350-374},
Abstract = {Back in 1993 the formalization of the Barents-cooperation signaled a new
   political approach in the Arctic region, High North, and Norwegian
   Russiapolicy. In the area where militarization was strong and which
   formed the Wests northernmost border with the Soviet Union during the
   Cold War, Norway, together with Finland, Sweden and Russia, outlined a
   joint foreign policy engagement where peace and stability were at the
   top of the agenda. Today, almost 30 years later, the Barents-cooperation
   is surrounded by growing geopolitical tension - especially highlighted
   in the period after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. In this
   article we try to answer the question: What is the Barents-cooperation
   in the context of today's international political situation? By
   emphasizing the voices of the actors in the cooperation, as this article
   does, we take a step into a field characterized by political tensions,
   by arguments, and a diversity of opinions within the Norwegian foreign
   policy field. Based on interviews with actors from the
   Barents-cooperation, the article presents three different discourses: a
   geopolitically updated legitimization; a counterweight to the dominant
   representation of Russia; and a representation of the agency of the
   Barents-cooperation in light of future Norwegian-Russian relations.},

Abstract = {The chapter explores the concept of citizenship in legal, social, and
   cultural terms and examines its inclusivity and exclusivity with respect
   to the various social groups that existed during the earlier part of the
   Third Republic (1870-1914). It also provides a description of the new
   local political institutions created in Pondicherry. Concepts of
   categorization, self-understanding, and Max Weber's sense of belonging
   together facilitate our understanding of how groups belong to the
   imperial nation, but also the extent to which they would support the
   Third Republic's political project. Subsequently, the political
   infighting regarding citizenship presents the major issues and different
   hopes that were at stake for diverse factions on the ground and how
   thoroughly universal republican rights were implemented in Pondicherry.},

Abstract = {This contribution addresses the strategical, political, and cultural
   significance of the Aland Islands between Russia, Sweden, and Finland
   from 1809 to the present day. During the first half of the 19th century,
   Russia fulfilled, with the conquest of the Aland Islands, one of its
   military goals which had been in place since the Petrine period, namely,
   to push forward the country's military control as far as to the Western
   border of Finland in order to secure Russia's capital St. Petersburg,
   and to threaten the capital of the kingdom of Sweden, Stockholm, in
   order to prevent a Swedish act of revenge for the loss of Sweden's
   control of the Eastern Baltic during the Great Northern War. At the same
   time, the islands were, in a political and cultural sense, an important
   ingredient of the upcoming Swedish and Finnish national movements. After
   the loss of Finland, the countries had tried to find solace in national
   culture and past glories. In this respect, the question of why Sweden,
   during the Finnish Civil War, sent troops to the Aland Islands can be
   interpreted as part of Sweden's anti-Russian military agenda as well as
   being part of its cultural mission to protect the islands against
   Finnish and Russian attempts to make the island part of Finnish or
   Russian culture, and to subdue the overwhelmingly-Swedishspeaking
   population in the context of a Finnish national state. This
   Swedish-Finnish opposition, though, turned, during the interwar period,
   into a secret collaboration against Russian military interests in the
   Eastern Baltic region, whereby the control of the Aland Islands played a
   central role. Despite minor yet critical situations, the islands have
   enjoyed relative calm ever since. However, the outbreak of Russia's
   Ukrainian War threatens to cast doubt once again on the islands' status.},

Abstract = {Classical strategic theorists constitute an important pillar of military
   strategy education, but their texts are often interpreted in
   contradictory ways. This article aims to draw attention to the problem
   of contrasting interpretations, focusing on the interpretations of
   Thucydides, Sun-Tzu and Clausewitz. The article surveys popular
   interpretations of these classics, identifies the main differences
   between them, and uses deductive logic to draw out the implications of
   this state of affairs for the study of military strategy.},

   Democracy Promotion Research},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 29},
Abstract = {In this article, we address the question of how policy orientation
   shapes academic research from a sociological perspective. Policy
   orientation involves the mobilization of scientific resources and the
   ``mobilization of the world.{''} Our analysis is based on Bourdieusian
   field theory and focuses on democracy promotion research (DPR). It shows
   that DPR is a heterogeneous academic field characterized by the
   field-specific demand for policy orientation. (Western) Scholars and,
   particularly, scholar-practitioners occupy central positions, and
   field-specific practices of policy orientation include stocktaking,
   evaluation, problem identification, and critical intervention. While we
   derive these insights from analysis of DPR, our findings are useful for
   the study of policy orientation in similar academic fields. For the
   reflexive and systematic analysis of how policy orientation shapes, for
   example, development studies and human rights research, we suggest a
   focus on interrelations between academic fields, field-specific
   struggles, and relationships with the respective policy fields.},

Abstract = {The Post-Rebel Electoral Parties (PREP) dataset offers an important new
   tool to study the transformation of rebel groups into political parties.
   It provides longitudinal data on the electoral participation and
   performance in national elections of political parties formed by armed
   opposition groups after civil war. Post-rebel electoral parties sit at
   the center of overlapping research agendas that address how best to
   build durable peace, and how to build resilient political systems and
   capable states after devastating conflict. A better understanding of how
   and why these parties participate and perform in elections over time is
   critical to any assessment of liberal peacebuilding. These parties -
   their strategic choices, organizational development, and impact on the
   political systems in which they participate - are also relevant to the
   broader study of comparative democratization, political parties, and
   party systems. Our dataset follows these parties forward through up to
   three decades of participation in postwar electoral politics. The
   current version of the data consists of 78 distinct parties derived from
   56 conflict actors. The data cover 322 legislative election years and
   216 executive elections in 39 countries over 30 years (1990-2021). This
   article describes the data and articulates the need for and motivation
   behind the dataset. We then illustrate the relevance of the data by
   testing the impact of rebel participation on the long-term peace.},

Title = {Ruptures and resurgences: Marking the spatiality of transgender identity
   in India since the enactment of Transgender Persons Act 2019},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {Transgender groups in India constitute an indigenous community with a
   rich and vivid culture and history. However, it is unfortunate that
   under the hegemonic influence of heteronormative traditions, the
   democratic inclusion and accommodation of transgender groups could never
   take place. This exclusion and neglect have recently been challenged
   through the activism of several groups, which has given rise to a new
   chapter in the democratic unfolding in India. This article attempts to
   evaluate the social activism of transgender groups on two planes. One
   plane attempts to evaluate it in terms of the uniqueness of an
   indigenous social movement and the areas that distinguish it from other
   social movements. It is interesting to note that what started as a
   purely identity-based social movement has now acquired dimensions of
   redistributive justice. The second plane attempts to evaluate the social
   activism of transgender groups in terms of the achievements and advances
   made by the movement on the social and political fronts. This evaluation
   is necessary in order to appraise the trajectory of the politics of
   transgender groups, which could foretell the direction of the activism
   and help in understanding the future scope and direction. The article
   takes up three arguments in the context of the legal framework put in
   effect by the state. The first point of discussion is the effectiveness
   of the transgender ID provided by the Transgender Persons Act and the
   possible challenges and loopholes related to it. While the state
   provides legal recognition through the issuance of the transgender ID
   card, it only remains a symbolic marker as the de facto identity remains
   unchanged, unless changed by the person themselves. The second point of
   discussion is the emerging rift amongst transgender groups with respect
   to the reforms introduced recently. This rift has a tendency to pull in
   the opposite direction, causing tensions. The final aspect of my
   discussion relates to the subsequent challenges that emerge from the
   legal recognition of transgender persons. These challenges touch upon
   the various aspects of legal, political, social, and economic
   policymaking and are inevitable for understanding the concerns of
   transgender persons in India.},

Abstract = {This paper brings the ``scale question{''} into the discussion of urban
   movements in Southeast Europe and offers a multispatial framework for
   their analysis. It focuses on the shifting scale of urban movements in
   Serbia, which was recently united in a wider citizen's platform. The
   paper reveals that scaling up from the single-issue initiative to a
   national political alliance is a challenging process that takes place on
   multiple scales. The main challenges are co-optation and tension between
   urban issues and issues in other spaces beyond the (capital) city. My
   explanation considers the centralised semi-authoritarian national
   government and the urban-rural divide in Serbia. This paper brings the

Title = {A grammar of institutions for complex legal topics: Resolving statutory

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Laws are a unique type of primary data: they structure our everyday
   interactions and are publicly available to all people. How can we assess
   the law's effect when multiple overlapping and cross-referencing
   statutes constrain and incentivize behavior simultaneously? I present a
   principled method for aggregating the legal rules coded in multiple laws
   into a single legal institution to help us understand and better
   characterize complex, interconnected, and sometimes contradictory
   bundles of legal rules. The method utilizes Institutional Grammar (IG),
   which scholars have used to code legal language into comparable
   institutional statements. The method is amenable to any legal topic and
   is especially appropriate when multiple statutes simultaneously comprise
   the legal institution in a single jurisdiction. To illustrate, I draw on
   the laws regulating civil society organizations (CS0s), which offer a
   valuable and substantively important prism to study legal texts as the
   cause of social phenomena or the outcome of a political process. I
   discuss my proposed method in three parts: first, why using IG enhances
   a coding instrument's validity; second, how an IG-based instrument
   allows researchers to scale up coded values of separate laws into a
   jurisdiction-level value; finally, I compare techniques for estimating
   descriptive measures of a jurisdiction's legal institution.},

Abstract = {Given the myriad of policy instruments aimed at enhancing water quantity
   conservation available to municipalities, what drives them to opt for a
   market-based instrument (MBI)? MBIs can be effective and efficient
   policy instruments to enhance water quantity conservation, but there is
   little known about why municipalities utilize them. This study
   hypothesizes that three contextual elements influence a municipality's
   use of an MBI: the natural, political, and structural environment. The
   results from two logistic regression models suggest that in a
   municipality suffering a higher drought level, both a conservative
   political environment and operating under a council-manager form of
   government (with the effect more pronounced under a non-council-manager
   form) will increase the likelihood that it will use an MBI to address
   water conservation.},

Abstract = {The study explores the divergence in data protection enforcement
   strategies among national agencies. Whereas the literature on
   cross-national enforcement practices is scarce, this study develops a
   scale for data protection enforcement strategies and measures and
   compares enforcement choices across agencies. Based on survey responses
   from 18 DPAs, interviews with DPA employees, and secondary sources on
   GPDR enforcement, the paper clusters DPAs based on enforcement
   strategies, analyzes cross-national variations, and investigates
   misalignments between strategy and actions. Using Fuzzy-Set Qualitative
   Comparative Analysis, the paper tests how bureaucratic and political
   contexts - organizational capacities, budget sources, and issue saliency
   - impact enforcement choices. Almost half of the studied DPAs reflect
   high deterrence by their strategy, but for many of them, lack of
   resources and expertise inhibits the translation of strategy into
   practice. This study provides a starting point for understanding the
   national impacts of Europeanization post-GDPR, adding empirical support
   for theorizing about enforcement across the EU.},

Abstract = {The urban project ``Skopje 2014{''} was not particularly welcomed by
   citizens, however, despite the popular discontentment, and controversial
   implementation, it did not instigate mass resistance at its outset. We
   analyze the role of social activism, the state's deployed strategy of
   coercion, and the inability to form a broader unity to contest the
   project at its outset. Subsequently, we contextualize the project within
   the social movements that emerged between 2013-2016. By juxtaposing two
   periods, we explain why mass resistance occurred in 2016 but not at the
   project's outset, analyzing the activist scene, the political landscape
   and the nature of the regime.},

Abstract = {We present a new dataset of membership in informal international
   organizations-IOs founded with non-binding instruments-which constitute
   one-third of operating IOs. We introduce state-IO-year-level membership
   data for 195 countries that complements the dataset on formal IOs from
   the Correlates of War Project. We explain our conceptualization of an
   informal IO, contrast it with other approaches, and detail the data
   collection process. We illustrate similarities and differences across
   formal and informal IOs, and across states and regions. We explain how
   our data validate or challenge conjectures about informal cooperation
   that have been inaccessible for lack of data. We demonstrate that while
   formal and informal IOs are similar in size, the composition of informal
   memberships in informal IOs is more fragmented. While informal IOs are a
   growing part of the governance portfolios of most states, some countries
   and regions participate more. We conclude by outlining elements of the
   research program our dataset unlocks.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the permitting proceeding for the capacity
   expansion of the Dakota Access and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipelines
   in Illinois. Drawing on field research undertaken between 2018-2021, we
   examine how a grassroots-led coalition of climate activists - Save Our
   Illinois Land (SOIL) - navigated the Illinois Commerce Commission's
   institutional context to oppose regulatory approval. We argue that SOIL
   mobilized procedural aspects of the regulatory process to politicize a
   highly path-dependent and techno-managerial administrative proceeding.
   SOIL did so to open political space for greater consideration of and
   deliberation around socio-ecological challenges like climate change in
   pipeline governance. While U.S. focused, our findings highlight the
   difficulties inherent to employing institutionalized participation as a
   mechanism to politicize energy governance and engage in contentious
   energy politics. Climate advocates face complex challenges that inhibit
   their ability to unsettle the power structures that reinforce
   carbon-intensive systems and promote inclusive and climate-driven energy
   infrastructure governance.},

Abstract = {This paper undertakes a theoretical review of the main interpretations
   made by the social and human sciences on the Chilean popular revolt of
   2019-2020 and its antecedents framed in a prolonged sociopolitical
   crisis. To this end, the paper is structured in four sections. First, a
   contextual characterization of the popular revolt is carried out,
   placing it as an exceptional phenomenon in recent history. Second, a
   review of early analyzes (1997-2005) is presented, in which the
   literature begins to account for social tensions and problems. Third, a
   review of the analyzes framed in the appearance of social conflict in
   Chile in the period 2011-2018 is performed to, finally, identify the
   readings specifically focused on the 2019-2020 revolt. The research was
   based on the review of 135 books, essays, academic articles and reports,
   in addition to a score of press releases and reports. From this, a
   grouping process was conducted around the central theses presented by
   the authors. This work allows us to identify three aspects: 1) the
   central nodes of analytical proposals on the phenomenon in each period,
   2) the analytical continuities and discontinuities between periods, and
   3) the central nodes of the current debate. This proposal combines the
   presentation of interpretations, together with the characterization of
   events and antecedents that allow the contextual framing of the
   discussions.},

Abstract = {Policies concerning undocumented immigrants are inevitably ambivalent,
   creating uncertainty and confusion in the implementation process. We
   identify a clear example of this ambivalence -U.S. law setting standards
   for determining the credibility of asylum seekers-that resulted in an
   increase in asylum grants despite policymakers' intention to make it
   harder for individuals to obtain the status. We argue that this law, The
   REAL ID Act of 2005, sent mixed messages to immigration judges (IJs),
   street-level bureaucrats who implement immigration policy. It increased
   IJ discretion, but set vague limits. We theorize that IJs, behaving in a
   bounded rationality framework, use their professional legal training as
   a short-cut and look primarily to the courts for guidance. Our evidence
   supports our argument. After the passage of the REAL ID Act, IJ
   decision-making is more closely aligned with the preferences of their
   political and legal principals, and, in the final score, the federal
   circuit courts are the winners.},

Title = {Performing control in the Swedish Twitter sphere or: How a 1920s'
   Russian linguist helps us understand dynamics of digital authority},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Social media has created new public spheres that provide alternative
   sources of social and political authority. Such ``digital authority{''}
   has conventionally been interpreted in metric terms, without qualitative
   distinctions. Based on Twitter data from four different Swedish state
   agencies during the first 15 months of the COVID-19 crisis, this paper
   looks at the different kinds of modes of interaction Twitter enables and
   their impact on state agencies digital authority. Theoretically this
   paper applies Valentin Voloshinov's classical theory on reported speech,
   developed in the 1920s, to the concept of digital authority in the
   Twitter-sphere of the 2020s. Besides these theoretical contributions to
   media and communication studies, the main findings are that retweets are
   generally used to affirm and spread information thus strengthening the
   digital authority of the origin of the tweet whilst replies and
   quote-tweets are used to undermine the credibility of the sender and the
   content of the original tweet, often by resorting to irony. As the
   COVID-19 crisis prolongs, we observe increasing share of critical
   commentary and diminishing overall attention to government actors in
   Sweden. The roles of different state agencies are mirrored by the type
   of interaction they generate. This article also shows the usefulness of
   qualitative study of social media interaction in order to reveal the
   dynamics of digital authority construed in social media.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the Islamisation of knowledge policy that the
   Islamist regime in the Sudan undertook between 1989 and 2019. It
   investigates the inner workings of this policy, its epistemic
   orientations, methodologies, and practices to understand the
   relationship between religion, education, and politics. The article
   argues that the Islamisation of knowledge project is comprised of a set
   of ideas, epistemic theories, and empirical programmes that aim to
   `liberate' Muslims from coloniality and rebuild their minds in
   accordance with an Islamic epistemology. It uncovers how Islamisation of
   knowledge protagonists portray their epistemology in their intellectual
   forums and academia. How are the ideas, theories, and educational
   programmes associated with this form of knowledge implemented through
   academic institutions? The article addresses analytical conceptions such
   as Islamic thought and scrutinizes the doctrine, epistemic orientation,
   and socio-cultural representations imposed on students by Islamisation
   of knowledge proponents through education policy and curricular
   programmes. What is Islamic in their educational philosophies and
   practices? What conceptions of Islamisation underpin this epistemic
   discourse and practices in academic institutions in the Sudan? At what
   points do Islam and education ontologically converge and diverge? How do
   they accommodate one another? The article delves into a detailed
   ethnography that answers these questions.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2023},

Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {589-607},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Faith-based actors (FBAs) are increasingly active in climate policy, and
   a growing literature focuses on how specific faith characteristics
   (theological and organizational) might shape climate action. This paper
   examines an under-researched dimension of their action. Using the
   example of Christian FBAs in Scotland, we examine their distinctive role
   as ``climate intermediaries{''} - ``go-betweens{''} between policymakers
   and their policy targets. We construct a framework of three core
   intermediary capabilities - representation, mobilization, aggregation -
   and examine strategies adopted to implement those capabilities. Using
   documentary data we identify FBA involvement in domestic and global
   climate policy, examining how certain Christian FBAs seek to shape
   government policy, but also aim to change the actions and behaviours of
   their congregations and members. While FBA action has not alone shaped
   climate policy or agreements, we find their linkage role is distinct and
   multi-directional. First, by mediating ``downwards{''}, FBAs mobilize
   action on global climate concerns within their own congregations. By
   converting parishioners' religious concern into global action, these
   FBAs link the local to the global, but also the spiritual to the
   practical. FBAs also operate ``upwards{''} to successfully aggregate
   specific theological knowledge, and translate it into a powerful,
   general moral imperative for climate action.},

Abstract = {This article examines the advantages and limits of late non-Jewish
   witness testimonies in Holocaust research. Grounding my conclusions in
   more than 150 biographical interviews conducted in small communities of
   contemporary Western Ukraine (historically Eastern Galicia) in
   2017-2019, I dwell on the specificity of such sources and offer
   guidelines on how to work with them. As I show, late witness testimonies
   typically consist of multiple layers that can only be understood when
   analyzed within the wider life story of the interviewee, and when read
   against a deep knowledge of local history. When following these
   introduced guidelines, late non-Jewish witness interviews can be an
   extremely valuable source, especially for rural communities where no
   Jewish testimonies are available. This source allows us to further
   examine the complexity of identity and belonging, estrangement and
   intimacy, in ethnically mixed communities during World War II and
   immediately after, but also memories of the nonexisting world today.},

Title = {Born between war and peace: Situating peacekeeper-fathered children in
   research on children born of war},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {4},
Month = {OCT 14},
Abstract = {In the last two decades, academic research has made significant progress
   exploring the life courses of so-called ``children born of war{''}
   (CBOW). Similarly, the unintended consequences of peacekeeping
   operations, including the experiences of victims of sexual exploitation
   and abuse, and children born of these interactions, have received
   preliminary academic attention. This paper compares peacekeeper-fathered
   children (PKFC) to other CBOW to determine how these two groups relate
   to one another. We draw on research conducted in two peacekeeping
   contexts where personnel have been accused of fathering and abandoning
   children (Haiti and the Democratic Republic of Congo) to empirically
   situate PKFC within the category of CBOW. We introduce 5,388
   micro-narratives from Haitian and Congolese community members (Haiti n =
   2,541, DRC = 2,858) and 113 qualitative interviews with
   mothers/grandmothers of PKFC (Haiti n = 18, DRC n = 60) and PKFC (DRC n
   = 35) to investigate how PKFC fit in the CBOW paradigm. Our findings
   demonstrate that many of the multi-level adversities faced by PKFC
   resemble those of the broader reference group. Given their shared
   developmental needs and experiences of exclusion, we conclude that PKFC
   constitute CBOW and ought to be included in conceptualisations
   pertaining to them. Acknowledging PKFC as CBOW offers new opportunities
   for policy development to (a) enhance protection and support of all CBOW
   and (b) remind states of their commitments to uphold the rights of all
   children.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate the role of minority dissent (MD)
   as an antecedent for task (TC) and relationship conflict (RC) in groups
   engaged in multiparty collaboration. The authors hypothesized that MD
   triggers both TC and RC and that the association between MD and RC is
   mediated by TC. Moreover, the authors hypothesized that the positive
   association between MD and RC is attenuated by social acceptance, while
   the positive association between TC and RC is attenuated by trust.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors have tested the hypotheses in 36
   groups comprising in total 145 professionals that attended a two-day
   workshop on working across organizational boundaries and who filled in
   three surveys during a multiparty simulation. The authors used
   multilevel mediation analyses to test the hypotheses. Findings The
   results generally supported the role of MD as an antecedent for both TC
   and RC as well as the mediating role of TC in the relationship between
   MD and RC. The attenuating role of social acceptance in the relationship
   between MD and RC was fully supported, while the attenuating role of
   trust in the relationship between TC and RC was not supported. Research
   limitations/implications This study is based on a rather small sample
   and used a cross-lagged data collection design, and no causal claims can
   be derived from the findings. Behavioral multiparty simulations create a
   realistic context in which the authors investigate the dynamics of
   conflict transformation and explore the interplay of MD, TC and RC.
   Social implications As nowadays, multiparty systems are engaged in
   dealing with important societal challenges and because RC is detrimental
   for collaborative effectiveness, the results have important implications
   for facilitating effective collaboration in such complex systems.
   Originality/value This study makes an important contribution to the
   literature on conflict in multiparty systems by showing that as an
   antecedent of intragroup conflict, MD can have both a beneficial as well
   as a detrimental impact on the conflict dynamics of multiparty systems.
   It points out the importance of social acceptance as a buffer against
   the detrimental role of MD.},

Abstract = {EU citizenship's long-lasting dependency on worker rights has been
   scrutinised by the literature since the introduction of the status.
   Three new volumes deal with the intertwined evolution between the two in
   the longue duree, all by applying the stress tests of our times: Brexit
   and Euroscepticism. In a complementary way, both nuts and bolts and
   fissures of EU citizenship emerge and portray a novel citizenship that
   caters to the mobile, bypassing the sedentariness of national
   citizenship, but still lacks in the protection of the non-mobile and
   economically inactive. In the future, the literature could benefit from
   a closer connection to EU integration theories as well as from a more
   attentive look at how Brexit is the perfect exposer of both strengths
   and weaknesses of EU citizenship.},

Abstract = {Social movement approaches have explored how protest movements
   transition into terrorist organizations. However, there has been little
   academic work examining potential causal mechanisms that drive the
   movement of individuals from nonviolent organizations to violent ones.
   This study uses priming theory to explain how nonviolent organizations
   can function as inadvertent gateways that facilitate the movement of
   individuals into violent organizations. Rather than elaborating on
   social contacts between nonviolent and violent organizations, priming
   shifts the analytical focus to socialization processes inside gateway
   organizations and how they can be exploited by violent organizations
   through framing. The study also analyzes priming in gateway
   organizations as a gendered process. Although the examples provided are
   drawn from the Islamist context, the priming process applies to all
   religious, far-left, far-right, and nationalist/separatist groups.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the development of the mix of EU climate policy
   instruments and the level of climate policy integration (CPI) in the
   twenty-first century. Complementing established criteria of ambition and
   stringency, analysis of the instrument mix and CPI enables a fuller
   assessment of the transformational potential of EU climate governance.
   We argue that both have significantly advanced towards matching the
   `super-wicked' nature of the climate challenge, although important gaps
   and challenges remain in addressing all relevant sectors, barriers and
   drivers. First, EU climate governance has `thickened' through a stepwise
   layering of various economic, regulatory, procedural, and informational
   instruments. Second, this thickening has gone hand in hand with an
   expansion and strengthening of CPI. The European Green Deal promises to
   further complement the instrument mix and to universalise and prioritise
   CPI, but major initiatives remain to be proposed and realised for the
   Green Deal to propel the needed comprehensive transformation.},

Abstract = {Individuals' risk perceptions shape their attitudes and behaviors, and
   to the extent that governments respond to public demands, they also
   influence public policy priorities. Conversely, risk misperceptions-that
   is, when risk perceptions do not align with realities-may lead to
   suboptimal behaviors and inefficient public policy. This study
   investigates the phenomena of environmental risk misperceptions.
   Specifically, with an original survey that enables a direct comparison
   of perceived and actual environmental risks at the local level, it
   examines the relationships between personal attributes and risk
   misperceptions. The findings show that individuals exhibit optimism bias
   in assessing local environmental risk. On average, people rank their
   communities as experiencing less risk from toxic air pollution than
   objective measures suggest. Moreover, Whites, males, conservatives, and
   older people tend to have larger optimism bias and have lower chances of
   possessing correct risk perceptions than their counterparts,
   respectively, while respondents who are married, poor, who go to church
   regularly, and have strong pro-environmental orientation, tend to have
   smaller optimism bias and have higher chances of possessing correct risk
   perceptions than their respective counterparts. The systematic
   misperception of local environmental risk underscores the importance of
   information provision and risk communication, and the sociopolitical
   correlates of misperception suggest that targeted and more nuanced
   strategies are required to correct misperceptions.},

Abstract = {This Policy Insight discusses what was the world's largest dedicated
   third-party ceasefire monitoring operation, the Special Monitoring
   Mission (SMM), which, until the Russian invasion in early 2022, oversaw
   a ceasefire in Ukraine. Although it may now seem obvious to conclude
   that the SMM failed to deter conflict escalation, this once-heralded,
   `model' mission provides insights for the design and implementation of
   other ceasefire monitoring efforts. This Policy Insight argues that the
   limitations and differing interpretations of the SMM's mandate, an
   inability to attribute responsibility for violations, and a failure to
   act in response to violations substantially weakened the practice of
   ceasefire monitoring in Ukraine. Still, important lessons can be
   identified for future monitoring work, whether in Ukraine or elsewhere,
   including agreeing on the mechanisms for consequences when violations
   occur, better understanding the limitations of remote sensing technology
   in monitoring, and establishing more robust planning for mission
   suspension, evacuation, and termination.},

Abstract = {How should we reconcile covert war with normative theories of the
   democratic peace? Proponents argue that these interventions are
   consistent with democratic peace theory, as leaders intervene covertly
   to escape backlash by a public that has internalized liberal norms. Yet
   we know little about public opinion regarding the covert use of force.
   Using a survey experiment, we find that respondents are more favorable
   towards covert interventions against democratic targets than our
   theories assume, and that even citizens who value transparency the most
   still wrestle with a trade-off between their normative commitments and
   the instrumental benefits they perceive covert actions to hold. Our
   results thus help to explain why American leaders have repeatedly chosen
   to conduct covert military operations against fellow democracies, and
   raise important questions about the scope conditions of normative
   theories of the democratic peace.},

Abstract = {Televised debates represent an integral part of election campaigns and
   with the introduction of the Spitzenkandidaten process also became part
   of the European Parliament (EP) elections campaign. Various
   characteristics of EP elections such as a generally lower (perceived)
   relevance of and participation in the elections, and also the relatively
   unknown lead candidates running for Commission President assign TV
   debates a crucial role to inform European citizens and assist them in
   their voting decision. Focusing on the second edition of the `Eurovision
   debate' during the 2019 EP elections campaign, this article examines the
   impact of debate exposure on both the decision to turn out and party
   choice. The study uses original flash survey data collected after the
   debate in five countries (DE, DK, ES, HU, NL). These data are part of a
   larger panel-survey study, which allows to examine immediate effects in
   the days after the debate and also for the eventual decision on Election
   Day. Although citizens' debate exposure varies considerably across
   countries, and watchers further differ in their evaluations of the
   candidate performances, the results show a surprisingly negative effect
   of debate exposure on turnout, especially among more interested
   citizens, and basically no effects on party choice.},

Title = {Is There a Language of Terrorists? A Comparative Manifesto Analysis},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 3},
Abstract = {Previous research has shown that identity fusion can motivate violent
   self-sacrifice when the group is threatened. In this study we conducted
   an ethnographic content analysis of fifteen manifestos - expressing
   varied levels of extremism - to examine whether fusion and other
   relevant variables can be reliably identified and if the predictions of
   the fusion-plus-threat model are supported. Our findings indicate that
   linguistic proxies for identity fusion combined with mediating and
   moderating variables such as existential threat narratives,
   violence-condoning group norms and dehumanizing vocabulary, can be
   reliably identified and are more prevalent in the documents of would-be
   terrorists. This method may contribute to predicting the likelihood that
   individuals will engage in acts of violent extremism.},

Abstract = {Purpose Guided by the job demands-resources model, this study aims to
   investigate the underlying mediation mechanisms through which vertical
   relationship conflict between employees and their supervisors and
   horizontal relationship conflict between employees and their colleagues
   escalate into work disengagement. It proposes exhaustion and workplace
   social isolation as the mediators and explores the relative importance
   of vertical and horizontal relationship conflicts in influencing work
   disengagement through the distinct impacts of the mediators.
   Design/methodology/approach Data collected from a three-wave study of
   181 online-questionnaire respondents are used to test the research model
   using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings
   Vertical relationship conflict has an indirect effect on work
   disengagement via exhaustion, whereas horizontal relationship conflict
   has an indirect effect on work disengagement via workplace social
   isolation. Compared with horizontal relationship conflict, vertical
   relationship conflict exerts a stronger effect on work disengagement.
   Originality/value This study addresses a void in the literature on
   relationship conflict by investigating work disengagement from the
   perspective of both vertical and horizontal relationship conflict as
   well as from the perspective of both strain- and resource-centric
   mediators (i.e. exhaustion and workplace social isolation,
   respectively), providing a comparatively detailed analysis.},

Abstract = {This article investigates two recent cases of academic mobbing in the
   United States. The first concerns Bruce Gilley, whose paper ``The Case
   for Colonialism,{''} published in Third World Quarterly, was heavily
   criticized by the academic left. The second concerns Rebecca Tuvel,
   whose article ``In Defense of Transracialism,{''} published in Hypatia:
   A Journal of Feminist Philosophy, was equally reviled. In both cases,
   the authors and journal editors endured extreme on-line criticism,
   including some death threats. The authors analyze this on-line academic
   bullying through the lens of social psychology. They particularly
   identify a scissors logic, opening up a major division between the
   politics of academia and the general public; a new ideology of
   safetyism; and a new culture of complaint. They argue that these new
   on-line and sociological phenomena amount to ideacide, or the attempt to
   extinguish ideas rather than debate them either within the academy or
   within the public spheres.},

Abstract = {The result of the Brexit referendum and its effect on subsequent UK
   elections have attracted a large amount of media and scholarly interest,
   but there has been minimal research into gender and voting behaviour at
   the referendum. Similarly, gendered differences in Euroscepticism have
   had little attention. This article seeks to understand how attitudes
   towards the European Union vary by age and gender and whether such
   gender-age gaps are associated with gender differences in attributes
   known to predict European Union attitudes and support for Leave/Remain.
   The article finds a gender gap in Euroscepticism in under-45s and in
   Brexit vote choice in under-25s. It demonstrates that socioeconomic and
   value differences by gender are associated with the gender gap in
   younger age groups, but not older. As such differences seem likely to
   persist, this article suggests that gender divides will continue to have
   electoral and democratic consequences in the United Kingdom and across
   Europe.},

Abstract = {Despite the importance of Christian democracy for economic and social
   policies throughout the 20th century, we know very little about the
   incorporation of labor interests into Catholic parties. Existing
   accounts claim that the formation of Catholic worker organizations is
   rooted in the process of industrialization and reforms of Catholic
   social teachings. In contrast, I argue that the integration of the
   workers' wing was dependent on the position of farmers' and business
   associations within Catholic parties and the integrative capacities of
   local religious institutions. The migration of Catholics from peripheral
   to industrialized areas put pressure on Catholic elites in urban centers
   to integrate workers via class-based associations. In contrast,
   entrenched interest groups of farmers and businesses, as well as
   clerical associations, fend off the creation of workers' associations in
   rural regions in which industrialization took place. My argument is
   supported by newly collected district-level and survey data.},

Abstract = {Intelligence is generally collected and used in secret to inform
   internal audiences. Before and after Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
   however, the UK and US governments have deployed intelligence
   extensively to influence external audiences, both publicly and
   privately, regarding Russian intentions, capabilities and practices, and
   the consequences of Russian actions. While the scale, manner and
   initially pre-emptive nature of these disclosures represent a
   significant evolutionary step in how liberal-democratic governments use
   their intelligence assets, current practice has built upon historical
   precedents. This article examines why states choose to use intelligence
   - including fabricated intelligence - for influencing external
   audiences; the different methods they deploy for doing so; the gains and
   costs of publicising intelligence; and how the use of intelligence
   during the Russia-Ukraine conflict should be understood within broader
   historical and contemporary trends. The authors conclude that while
   liberal democracies' use of intelligence in public is to be welcomed for
   its greater transparency, careful risk management will be needed if this
   approach is to continue.},

Title = {Government Agencies in Uruguay: Characteristics and Autonomy of the
   Decentralized Administration},

Abstract = {The creation of agencies has become a popular trend in the world and in
   Latin America since the New Public Management reforms. Agencies are
   organizations with greater levels of autonomy from the center of
   government, which gives them, in theory, greater independence from
   political fluctuations while they are capable of being more efficient in
   the quality and management of their services. This article presents the
   application in Uruguay of the COBRA (Comparative Public Organization
   Data Base for Research and Analysis - network) project methodology for
   characterizing and measuring the levels of autonomy of decentralized
   public sector agencies. Based on the application of a questionnaire to
   qualified informants, the study analyzes 56 decentralized entities in
   Uruguay from 2015 to 2020. Among its main results, it shows that there
   are no significant differences in terms of autonomy in policy definition
   or resource management between entities governed by public law and those
   of non-state type. It also highlights that the largest decentralized
   entities, both those dedicated to the provision of public welfare
   services and those of a commercial nature, continue to operate
   predominantly within the framework of public law and enjoy significant
   levels of autonomy with respect to the center of government. On the
   other hand, despite their steady growth, the creation of agencies in
   Uruguay (or smaller administrative structures governed by or with
   similar characteristics to those of private law) does not evidence a
   search for greater managerial autonomy with respect to the
   organizational formats typical of public law. These institutional
   formats reflect a pattern of State functioning built on partisan
   control, negotiations and political co-participation, rather than a
   logic focused on efficiency or management improvements.},

Abstract = {In recent years, instruments of governance, including citizens' panels
   (citizens' assemblies) have gained interest all over the world,
   including Poland. The danger of its application stems from the fact that
   they assume the desire to allocate more and more political power to
   partners at the expense of legitimate authorities. Hence, the purpose of
   this article is to examine the axiological foundations of the
   instruments of governance, focusing on the value of truth. In the
   conclusion of the research, it was stated that the implementation of the
   citizens' panels in Gda??sk leads to violations of the value of truth,
   one of the pillars of Latin civilization.},

Abstract = {A growing body of research stresses finding out why some non-state armed
   groups in Syria survive longer than others. Despite this encouraging
   uptick in scholarship, studies have focused on the individual methods
   these groups have adopted. The extant literature suffers from a lack of
   comprehensive and rigorous analytical explanation based on a model that
   reveals the logic behind these groups' actions within the savagery,
   ferocity, and cruelty of other rival actors. By focusing on three
   significant cases in Syria, this study develops a new analytical
   perspective to unpack the strategic logic behind NSAGs' survival in a
   competitive, anarchical conflict environment.},

Abstract = {Do individuals previously targeted by genocide become more supportive of
   other victimized groups? How are these political lessons internalized
   and passed down across generations? To answer these questions, the
   authors leverage original survey data collected among Holocaust
   survivors in the United States and their descendants, Jews with no
   immediate family connection to the Holocaust, and non-Jewish Americans.
   They find that historical victimization is associated with increased
   support for vulnerable out-groups, generating stable political attitudes
   that endure across generations. Holocaust survivors are most supportive
   of aiding refugees, followed by descendants, especially those who grew
   up discussing the Holocaust with their survivor relatives. An embedded
   experiment demonstrates the steadfastness of these attitudes: unlike
   non-Jews or Jews without survivor relatives, survivors' and descendants'
   views toward refugees do not change after reading an in-group versus
   out-group-protective interpretation of the ``never again{''} imperative.
   Histories of victimization can play an ameliorative role in intergroup
   relations.},

Abstract = {This study contributes to debates on varieties of clientelism through an
   analysis of brokerage and ruling party patronage at urban markets in
   Harare, Zimbabwe. Urban markets are sites of contestation between the
   opposition-dominated city council and actors aligned with the ruling
   party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF).
   Based on qualitative case study research at two designated markets, the
   article demonstrates how ruling party brokers are central to organizing
   patronage and political mobilization, thus sustaining authoritarian
   politics. While ruling party patronage is a deliberate strategy to
   control urban spaces, the article demonstrates how it is being
   negotiated. Factionalism within ZANU-PF shifted the power of brokers,
   and the lockdown enforced in response to the coronavirus disease 2019
   pandemic in 2020 caused a rupture, offering the city council and
   opposition-aligned youth the opportunity to (re)claim control over
   vending spaces. This article contributes to debates on clientelism in
   authoritarian regime settings, by showing the imbrication of coercion
   and patronage in the role of the broker and demonstrating how patronage
   is organized vertically through brokerage. This study extends the study
   of clientelism beyond electoral politics, since brokers are not always
   politicians, but nonetheless are part of the systems of ruling party
   patronage.},

Abstract = {Forums provide venues where different actors from the public
   administration sector, the interest group sector, or the research sector
   jointly discuss an issue of common interest. This article analyses which
   types of benefits are related to actors' investing working time to
   forums. Actors' dedication and work are basic predicates for forums to
   be able to produce outputs. The analysis of members of eight forums
   dealing with habitat and natural hazard governance in Switzerland
   suggests that actors participating in forums attribute more importance
   to exchange benefits, corresponding to opportunities of interaction with
   other actors - than to policy benefits - corresponding to opportunities
   for actors to influence policy or practice. However, more working time
   is invested by actors that lend importance to individual benefits - as
   opposed to collective benefits. These findings are important for
   understanding why actors provide work for forums in collaborative and
   polycentric governance systems.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the art world as a setting for hegemonic status
   or prestige politics. Powerful states engage in art world status-seeking
   but appear to face challenges distinct to the art world in so doing. To
   explain, I adopt a Bourdieusian forms of capital approach, framing the
   art world as a social field with distinctive contentious dynamics and
   symbolic politics. I argue states must work through art world networks
   and institutions to pursue status there, observing local rules in so
   doing. I frame art world prestige as symbolic capital-the overt,
   observable pursuit of which tends to undermine any gains. Hegemonic
   incumbents and challengers face differing such constraints. The existing
   global art world models rules and standards by homology on that of the
   current hegemon. A challenger must adapt to this status quo before they
   can revise it. I unpack these dynamics in the cases of America, China,
   and India. I focus on their shifting standing in the global art market
   and performances of national aggrandizement at a recurring global art
   world event: the Venice Biennale.},

Abstract = {Cultural events can mask latent potential for a resurgence of violence
   following negotiated settlement, building sectarian identities and
   support through otherwise-legitimate forms of expression. This article
   examines this phenomenon in Northern Ireland, investigating how
   Loyalists utilize Eleventh Night bonfires. It is argued that, in
   becoming more professional in construction and more sectarian in
   imagery, bonfires build and maintain paramilitary power, generate
   political capital within Unionism, and reinforce boundaries between
   groups. Bonfires are a key part of the culture war which has developed
   in Northern Ireland, raising vital questions about the role of culture
   following negotiated settlement in deeply-divided societies more
   broadly.},

Abstract = {What are the effects of the intensification of energy interdependence
   between Russia, the world's second largest exporter of hydrocarbons, and
   China, the world's largest importer? Bilateral interdependence is the
   lever for the hybridization of the institutions governing international
   energy relations. Based on the issues of power and energy security, the
   intensification of interdependence leads to institutional changes, known
   as hybridization, which are linked to a specific security-efficiency
   trade-off. Four factors shape this hybridization: the structural context
   faced by the actors, the strategic behaviour of the state-firms complex,
   sectoral properties and existing institutional arrangements.},

Abstract = {Policies are continually subjected to turbulence and crises. Interest in
   policy robustness as a fundamental way to deal with what cannot be
   foreseen is increasing. Thus, there is a flourishing stream of
   literature suggesting that policies need to be designed to be agile and
   flexible. However, the associated characteristics remain undeveloped.
   This article fills this gap by drawing on lessons obtained from the
   unplanned behaviors that were adopted in the management of the COVID-19
   pandemic. Individual and organizational behaviors characterized by
   outside the box thinking, improvisation, and fast learning yielded
   solutions to unexpected problems. In this article, some of these
   emblematic unplanned behaviors are assessed, and the research builds on
   the literature on policy robustness, crisis management, and
   organizational theory to identify three enabling conditions to design
   more robust policies: coordinated autonomy, training for unplanned
   responses, and political institutional capacity.},

Abstract = {International relations (ir) are an object of sociology as any other.
   Contrary to the Anglo-Saxon founding fathers of the discipline of IR who
   have been very attached to delineating domestic affairs (realm of
   welfare) and international politics (quest of survival), Guillaume Devin
   was never interested to stick to a theoretical perspective of ir which
   would be detached from sociological input. Beyond sociology, he always
   tried to open the study of ir to other social sciences, history, and
   law. This article attempts to give an account of this multidimensional
   study of ir.},

Abstract = {Many international agreements of the European Union establish what we
   call joint bodies (JBs). Examples of such bodies include joint
   committees, joint sub-committees, and association and cooperation
   councils. Over the years, the EU has built an impressive global web of
   JBs, which bring together EU and third-country executive officials and
   play a key role in governing EU external relations. But not all of them
   are created equal, with some considerably stronger than others. What
   explains this variation in `JB strength'? We formulate a cost-benefit
   argument, where stronger JBs generate greater costs and are primarily
   included in agreements promising greater benefits. Benefits, in turn,
   are greater if implementation helps the EU attain its goals, parties are
   interdependent, and agreements have a broad scope. Drawing on an
   original dataset of 547 agreements concluded since 1992, we find support
   for the argument that the EU strategically establishes joint bodies
   `where they matter most'.},

Abstract = {Governments often change their internal territorial divisions to pursue
   either political or governance goals. Over the recent decades,
   territorial reforms of splitting local government units, known as
   government fragmentation, have gained popularity in the developing
   world, and further stimulate the ongoing discussion about jurisdiction
   size and the quality of government. Building on this stream of
   literature, this paper seeks to empirically examine how the design of
   the primary administrative division affects the overall capacity of the
   state to implement its policies. Drawing on a country-year panel of 132
   developing countries in the 1960-2012 period, the paper documents an
   inverse U-shaped relationship between the degree of government
   fragmentation and state capacity measured by different indicators, which
   suggests a tradeoff in designing administrative divisions. Furthermore,
   the curvilinear relationship is found more pronounced in countries under
   a unitary government system or with a high level of ethnic
   fractionalization.},

   Germany and Czech Republic},

Abstract = {This article seeks to shed more light on the reasons for the regionally
   uneven distribution of populist attitudes. We take into account both
   individual-level and contextual drivers and focus mainly on the latter.
   We argue that regional peripheralization processes are a key contextual
   condition driving populist attitudes, especially in post-communist
   settings. The empirical analysis is based on a unique dataset combining
   comparable items from two representative surveys covering Germany (N =
   2112) and the Czech Republic (N = 1000) with economic and demographic
   characteristics of relevant regional contexts in both countries (167
   constituencies in Germany and 77 districts in the Czech Republic). Using
   multilevel regression models, the article shows that individual-level
   characteristics do not alone drive populist attitudes. In contrast, the
   results show that living in peripheral areas of the Czech Republic and
   eastern Germany increases the likelihood of having populist attitudes.
   These peripheries are characterized by unfavourable economic conditions
   in the Czech Republic and demographic decline in eastern Germany.},

Title = {Family caring for the elderly during the pandemic in Hong Kong:
   perspective from Confucian familism},

Abstract = {Purpose - The aim of this paper is to argue for the values of familial
   caring and relationships in addition to the provision of social media
   technology during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong
   Kong.Design/methodology/approach - The discussion of this paper has
   adopted an inter-disciplinary approach by integrating health care system
   and psychological analysis, based on cultural philosophical argument
   through the hermeneutic approach of classical texts and critical
   analysis.Findings - The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the dilemma
   between the public health measures for COVID-19 and sustaining elderly
   social psychological health through familial connection. From a
   Confucian perspective, the practice of filial piety (xiao, ?), which
   demands taking care of parents, is essential for one's moral formation,
   and for one's becoming a virtuous (ren, humaneness) person. The
   necessity of taking care of elderly parents by adult children is not
   something that can be explained in terms of consequentialism. Indeed,
   the rising trend of instrumental rationality seems to weaken rather than
   strengthen the sense of filial obligation. In the face of the COVID-19
   pandemic which tends to separate connections between family members, the
   author argues that we should emphasize the values of familial caring and
   relationship because it enhances the elderly's characteristic of
   resilience.Originality/value -This paper shows that while social media
   technology has mitigated the negative effect of social distancing, such
   online relationships should never replace the bodily connections between
   the elderly and their family members from a Confucian perspective.},

Abstract = {China's maritime militia groups have attracted much scholarly attention
   in recent years. Systematically funded and trained by the Chinese
   authorities, the militia groups help advance China's maritime claims but
   risk both intended and unintended physical clashes at sea. Based on the
   2001 Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful
   Acts, this study explores the possibility of establishing and
   recognizing China's state responsibility in relation to the
   internationally wrongful conduct of its maritime militia. China's
   maritime militia groups blur the line between fishing boats and naval
   forces. In essence, they are empowered to perform the critical function
   of the Chinese government as provided by Chinese internal laws. As shown
   by emerging evidence, China's maritime militia groups are also
   instructed, directed, and/or controlled by the Chinese state organs
   including military authority and party leadership, both central and
   local. This study finds that the conduct of Chinese maritime militia
   constitutes the breach of China's international obligations in terms of
   (1) due regard for other states, (2) maritime safety, (3) marine
   environment protection and preservation, and/or (4) the overfishing ban.},

Abstract = {In 2022, India captured global attention over its response to the war in
   Ukraine. While calling for both parties' return to diplomacy, India
   abstained from several United Nations resolutions condemning Russian
   aggression. For a country that ostensibly subscribes to the values of
   democracy and territorial integrity, its response appeared frustrating
   and contradictory, but it is broadly consistent with its long-standing
   policy of non-alignment. Although India's relationship with China is
   increasingly contentious, New Delhi is not yet fully convinced that it
   is in India's interest to swing westwards. The country's relations with
   Russia and China are deep, complex and substantive. In addition to the
   military and economic benefits it derives from its connection with
   Russia, New Delhi and Moscow share an avowed preference for a more
   equal, multipolar world. India will eventually have to reflect on the
   extent to which it can sustain its balancing act.},

Abstract = {Why do governments severely punish some dissidents while showing mercy
   to others? This study argues that when constrained by limited
   information on dissent, states have incentives to cast the net of
   repression wider by executing not just key dissent actors but also
   members closely connected to them to ensure demobilization. States also
   crave information, and granting clemency to defectors who bring in
   information improves state intelligence. Given that tips have different
   values, regimes will grant clemency to defectors who are closely
   connected to key dissent actors and possess high-value tips, allowing
   the state to pursue top fugitives and dissolve resistance more
   efficiently. Using newly declassified data on political victims during
   Taiwan's White Terror authoritarian period, I find that the regime tends
   to execute both key actors (i.e., leaders and recruiters) and their
   closely connected members. Defectors who share information tend to
   receive mercy, but defectors closely connected to key actors are much
   less likely to face execution than less connected defectors. These
   findings shed new insight into the toolkit dictators use to gather
   intelligence on dissent and how strategic clemency induces defection and
   betrayal among dissidents, helping destroy dissent networks from within.},

Title = {Revisiting the Jihad Ideology in Islamic International Law and its
   Appropriation by Nonstate Actors},

Abstract = {Jihad is quintessentially a religious doctrine and, notwithstanding
   difficulties of conceptualization, constitutes a foundational principle
   of both the shari'a (religious law of Islam) and (the siyar) Islamic
   international law. Jihad, in all its variants, is designed to further
   the will and dictates of God Almighty and must be distinguished from
   worldly struggles such as tribal rivalries and national conflicts or
   international wars. With its focus on Jihad, this article has four key
   objectives: First, since the Jihad ideology has retained primacy and
   centrality within the historiography of the siyar, this article
   critically examines its key facets. Second, in its historical
   incarnation, Jihad obligations were placed upon the whole of the Muslim
   community as fard al-kifayah (collective obligation). However, in more
   recent times, the doctrine has been appropriated almost exclusively by
   terrorist organizations, who have insisted that Jihad is in fact fard
   al-'ayn (individual obligation) to be pursued aggressively by
   individuals and non-State actors. This appropriation is manifested in
   the practices of terrorists and radical organizations, including
   Al-Qaeda and ISIS, as well as by the Taliban regime that retook control
   of Afghanistan in 2021. In evaluating the adoption and implementation of
   the Jihad ideology by contemporary terrorist or radical organizations,
   this article assesses the future direction of this doctrine within
   contemporary Muslim societies. Third, Jihad, overtime, has adopted the
   form of Islam's helium iustum (just war) and enunciated rules justifying
   or legitimizing the use of force as well as determining and regulating
   the conduct of hostilities. The Jihad ideology segments and
   distinguishes between what is termed as jus ad helium (laws which
   provide grounds justifying the use of force) and jus in hello (laws
   which regulate the conduct of hostilities). This article investigates
   the various substantial juristic dissensions that exist in the
   conceptualization of the pre-modern Jihad principles relating to jus in
   Bello and jus ad bellum. Fourth, while the article demonstrates that the
   Jihad ideology pervades Islamic international law, an investigation into
   the siyar also provides evidence that Islamic international law has also
   been significantly engaged with other important subjects within Muslim
   jurisdictions including diplomatic immunities, international trade and
   commercial relations.},

Title = {Mixed Governance Principles in the Gulf Lowlands of Mesoamerica},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {With antecedents reaching back to the Olmec era (1500-600 BCE), complex
   societies from CE 300-900/1000 in the Gulf lowlands display
   architectural and material culture indications of both authoritarian and
   collective governance principles over two large areas, each with a
   distinctive version of a common architectural layout. The two areas
   include multiple polities adhering to particular layouts of structures
   providing key urban services. Our information derives from pedestrian
   surveys and mapping covering about 5,000 km(2), plus remote sensing over
   53,000 km(2). Remote sensing reveals the extraordinary extent and
   consistency of the predominant architectural patterns. Starting with the
   Olmec era and continuing to CE 600 some sculpture glorifies individual
   rulers, but, at the same time, architecture shows the importance of
   corporate groups and public access to services that represent a more
   collective emphasis. Between CE 300 to 900, monumental platforms that
   supported palatial residences indicate powerful elites and rulers. Long
   mounds located on each side of the main plazas likely supported multiple
   rooms used by corporate civic groups. In some centers, multiple plaza
   groups attest to division of authority across several factions, as do
   chains of plazas in other cases. Thus, both authoritarian and collective
   principles are built into the design of urban centers. The replication
   of common architectural patterns across the study area suggests open
   networks of interaction consonant with low-density urbanism in the
   tropics. We concentrate our discussion of governance in south-central
   Veracruz during CE 300-900, for which we have more complete data, and we
   more briefly characterize the larger temporal and spatial framework.
   Eventually these urban networks collapsed due to a complex set of
   factors, but one ingredient may have been increasing disparities in
   wealth and corrosion of collective action.},

Abstract = {Blockchain technology enables new kinds of decentralized systems. Thus,
   it has often been advocated as a ``disruptive{''} technology that could
   have the potentiality of reshaping political, economic, and social
   relations, ``solving{''} problems like corruption, power centralization,
   and distrust toward political institutions. Blockchain has been
   gradually gaining attention beyond finance and is thus applied by a
   range of different actors. This includes local, regional, and national
   governments interested in the potentiality of experimenting with
   blockchain-supported governance. This article contributes to identifying
   blockchain as a contested socio-political object prone to contradictory
   political imaginaries regarding its potentialities, particularly when
   applied to policy. The article explores some of the most praised of
   blockchain's affordances (e.g., decentralization and transparency) in
   the context of Estonia, one of the most cited examples of blockchain
   governmental applications. Estonia has received international attention
   as the alleged first national infrastructure integrating blockchain.
   However, so far, few have asked: what kind of blockchain-based tools
   have been built by the Estonian government in practice and why? And to
   what extent do blockchain-based governmental applications reflect the
   original promises of disruption of the crypto-community? This article
   draws on a qualitative approach to explore several blockchain-based
   socio-technical objects to identify the narratives that have emerged in
   Estonia. The research shows clear contrasting views between stakeholders
   and technical experts from inside and outside the institutional sphere.
   The conflict revolves around two different social imaginaries associated
   with permissioned vs. public blockchains. The paper concludes with an
   analysis of the profound political implications of each vision.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a critical global issue with profound local impacts.
   Recent scholarship on local government action to address climate change
   has primarily focused on cities, with less attention paid to how smaller
   municipalities and rural communities are tackling the issue. Our
   research investigates how the capacity of urban and rural municipalities
   in New York State (NYS) affects their ability to take climate action,
   utilizing data from a statewide survey, interviews, and secondary data
   on municipal participation in the NYS Climate Smart Communities program.
   We investigated how municipal capacity (including individual,
   management, and broader contextual factors) influences climate change
   action in rural and urban communities. We find that only a quarter of
   NYS municipalities have taken climate action, and most are mitigation
   rather than adaptation actions. There is significantly more climate
   action and municipal climate network participation in urban versus rural
   communities. Most local municipal officials believe that climate change
   is occurring and feel the impacts, yet most are unsure about addressing
   it at the local level. Climate action is best predicted by individual
   municipal capacity variables of strong climate beliefs and knowledge,
   and contextual variables of being in an urban municipality versus a
   rural one, and participation in climate networks. Key barriers to local
   climate action include the lack of human, financial, and technical
   resource capacity. Municipal climate networks can help overcome capacity
   limitations, particularly for resource-limited rural communities.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether and the extent to which Chinese Marxist
   atheism and religious freedom exist in dualistic opposition, along with
   how Marxist atheism has been instantiated in the practical restrictions
   on religious freedom imposed by the Chinese Communist Party at the
   institutional level. Moreover, it develops an integrated model of
   Party-state-religion relations, articulating the dualistic structure of
   both Marxist atheism and the restricted religious freedom in China's
   authoritarian context. Furthermore, it provides a nuanced analysis of
   the reinforcement of the dominance of Marxist atheism as a restriction
   on religious freedom through the integrated legalistic- political
   approach adopted in the revision of the Regulation on Religious Affairs
   in 2017, taking Protestant house churches as an illustrative example.},

Title = {Framing the Cacerolazo: An Analysis of a Social Protest in

Abstract = {Objective/Context: In the hybrid media system, Twitter users can propose
   alternative framings to those defined by media. In the context of the
   2019 social protest in Ecuador, the framing confrontation was organized
   around hashtag \#cacerolazo: different frames interpreted differently
   the meaning of the protest designated with this name. Methodology: The
   study analyzed 119,756 tweets containing trending hashtags related to
   the protest. The most frequent terms were analyzed, and it was observed
   that the word ``cacerolazo{''} was framed and organized into three
   groups according to its context: 1) opposition to the government, which
   was the most popular; 2) support for the government, and 3) neutral. The
   framing defined by digital media for the same word was examined and
   categorized into groups for comparison; this allowed disambiguating the
   meaning of the word ``cacerolazo{''} in the tweets. As a result, 67\% of
   the tweets with the hashtag were in group 1 (opposition to the
   government). Thus, it was determined that, for the community considered
   in this study, the act of performing a cacerolazo retains its meaning of
   protest and it is not a call for peace. Conclusions: The framing of
   hashtag \#cacerolazo was mostly promoted by users whose publications
   were against the government, and it quoted and criticized the framing
   established by the media. Originality: The word2vec model was used,
   which is an automated methodology that helps identify different frames
   defined by social media users during a certain event.},

Title = {A Doomed Technology? On Gene Editing in Bavarian Livestock Agriculture,
   Policy Field Conflicts and Responsible Research and Innovation},

Abstract = {The emergence of CRISPR-Cas9 has recently, for the first time, rendered
   the large-scale genetic modification of livestock animals such as cows,
   pigs, and chickens possible. Novel editing targets range from genes that
   curb disease vulnerabilities, increase muscle mass, or convey
   hornlessness, to the development of transgenic pigs for medical use. In
   this article, we discuss the efforts of a transdisciplinary research
   consortium in Bavaria, Germany, to test the technical and social
   feasibility of using CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing as a novel
   technology in Bavarian small- to medium-scale livestock agriculture. The
   consortium comprised life scientists, local breeding associations, legal
   scholars, and social scientists from Science \& Technology Studies (STS)
   and aimed to promote Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) for gene
   editing technologies. Research focused on gene editing applications that
   improved animal health and all editing targets were co-developed with
   local breeding associations to meet the situated needs of small- to
   medium-scale livestock farmers in Bavaria. In this article, we discuss
   why the agricultural stakeholders in the project, that is, the
   representatives of local breeding associations, considered that, despite
   the project's success in generating positive research outcomes, it would
   be unlikely that results will be implemented in Bavarian livestock
   agriculture. We describe this situation in terms of a tension between
   agendas in the science and technology policy field and in the
   agricultural policy field in Bavaria that impacts local farmers' ability
   to adopt gene editing technologies. We further discuss what it might
   mean for RRI practices if public stakeholders are unlikely to benefit
   from the outcomes of RRI practices due to policy field conflicts or
   other contextual constraints and how STS scholars and other social
   scientists involved in RRI projects could adjust their practices to
   possibly redistribute benefits.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes energy relations in the area encompassed by
   Russia, the EU, and their ``common neighborhood{''} composed of Ukraine,
   Belarus, and Moldova through the lens of the interaction and tension
   between regionalism and regionalization. It investigates how the
   interaction between these two processes is reflected on the ground, and
   how the friction between institutionalized, from-above integration
   ({''}regionalism{''}) may clash with the more bottom-up process
   involving the ``making{''} of regions through day-to-day infrastructural
   and production-chain links ({''}regionalization{''}). Based on an
   analysis of trans-regional production chains in the oil, natural gas,
   and electricity sectors, it hypothesizes that the competitive energy
   regionalisms we are observing in the EU-Russia neighborhood (exemplified
   by the EU-led European Energy Community and the Russia-led Eurasian
   Economic Union mismatch with the underlying flows and production chains,
   with important economic and political implications.},

Abstract = {Afghanistan is a profoundly insecure country, with a very high rate of
   insurgent violence affecting large swathes of the population. Despite
   contributing to physical and economic insecurity across the country,
   Taliban insurgents have succeeded in creating what we call the ``paradox
   of the heavy-handed insurgent.{''} Insurgents use attacks on
   government-controlled areas to generate public support by fostering a
   reputation for effective security provision for the civilian population
   under its control. For civilians who have a strong unmet need for
   physical security - especially those in rural and contested communities
   - heavy-handed insurgents are preferable to government forces who are
   perceived as either incompetent or unwilling to provide governance. We
   test this argument using data from the 2018 Asia Society Survey of the
   Afghan People. We find that the most important factor driving sympathy
   for the Taliban among Afghan Pashtuns is their sense of insecurity where
   they live. This indicates that an insurgent group that wears down
   government forces and weakens their ability to provide public goods and
   services can actually benefit by appearing as the more viable
   alternative for governance despite their heavy-handed tactics.},

Abstract = {This article examines the rise of the koglweogo self-defence groups in
   Burkina Faso, developing an empirical analysis of their practices and a
   conceptual approach to their ambiguous status. The article describes the
   `koglweogos'' rise since 2014, their growth across urban and rural areas
   in Burkina Faso, and their involvement in tasks from crime-fighting to
   counterterrorism. The article builds on the existing literature on
   vigilantism and security provision in African states and outlines a
   conceptual framework highlighting the koglweogos' pursuit of
   recognition. The koglweogo toggle between overlapping `amateur' and
   `professional' repertoires of security discourse and practice, pursuing
   recognition as security professionals but also the autonomy and
   flexibility of working in the margins. This emphasizes the symbolic
   value, social and political contestability, discursive construction, and
   imaginaries of security whilst eschewing a state/non-state binary. The
   article draws on fieldwork carried out with multiple koglweogo groups to
   highlight their role as auxiliaries in global security governance, their
   production of security claims in the absence of recognition, their
   production of public authority, and their relationship of collaboration
   with and contestation of the state. The article concludes with
   reflections on the broader utility of the concept of `security amateur'
   in Africa and further afield.},

Abstract = {Two prominent features in current world affairs are the unprecedented
   level of global economic integration and the growing incidence of
   intrastate violence. We develop and test a novel argument linking global
   integration through foreign investment to intrastate armed conflict. The
   presence of multinational corporations in developing countries can cause
   market concentration, resulting in high rents. Disputes between
   governments and would-be challengers over the appropriation of these
   rents are likely to turn violent, increasing the incidence of armed
   conflict. State capacity mitigates this positive association between
   foreign investment and intrastate war. Strong states have the capacity
   to deter rebellions, address citizens' demands through institutionalized
   mechanisms, and credibly commit to the peaceful resolution of conflicts.
   Using data from developing countries for over four decades and
   addressing potential endogeneity and selection biases, we find strong
   support for our hypotheses. Our findings have important implications for
   understanding the link between economic interdependence and conflict.},

Abstract = {This article explores the effects of a reform inspired by New Public
   Management with the objective of analyzing whether the incorporation of
   technical criteria in the selection system for Senior Public Management
   (SADP) in Chile generates positive effects on institutional performance.
   Using quantitative, public and objective information from 72 Chilean
   public services, for the period 2004 to 2015, five statistical models
   are estimated using data panel. The explanatory variable used is the
   length of tenure of the SAPD appointee, which accounts for accumulated
   experience. Five outcome variables related to institutional performance
   are used, one for each model: productivity, efficiency, annual budget
   execution, budget execution at the third quarter and compliance with
   performance indicators. The results show that there are only significant
   effects of the SADP on compliance with the performance indicators, which
   indicates that the political-technical system for the selection of top
   management in Chile has not had the expected results since its creation.
   One of the possible causes is the low time of permanence in the
   position, less than three years, which is not enough to achieve the
   required learning to contribute to the improvement of management and
   service provision.},

Abstract = {Since 2013, China has undertaken extensive reclamation and construction
   on several reefs in the Spratly Island chain in the South China Sea.
   China has since been adding new construction and fortifications to the
   land features that had undergone reclamation between late 2013 and 2015,
   but none of the new projects rivalled the large-scale reclamation from
   2014-15, and nor has China reclaimed any new land features. Land
   reclamation has theoretical and empirical implications. The literature
   regarding maritime disputes in the South China Sea is rich and plenty.
   Many studies, however, focus on China's bilateral assertive or coercive
   behaviour as well as China's general strategy in the South China Sea,
   not land reclamation per se. What explains the timing of China's
   large-scale land reclamation in the South China Sea? Why did China
   decide to initiate large-scale land reclamation in the first place? This
   paper, therefore, conducts a comprehensive case study analysing China's
   land reclamation decisions. I argue that China's land reclamation is a
   result of capability, rationale, and opportunities which include a
   calculation of U.S. resolve. This study has implications for
   understanding Chinese foreign policy decision-making and contributes to
   the credibility debate in the coercion literature.},

Abstract = {Empirical research generally supports the dyadic-level
   trade-promotes-peace hypothesis, while demonstrating that the
   relationship is weaker, more complex, and more conditional than liberal
   theory suggests. We shift to the system level and examine a neglected
   path to conflict in economically interdependent systems. In the great
   power competition for support among smaller states, a great power at a
   competitive disadvantage in economic instruments of influence may be
   incentivised to adopt more militarised strategies. We illustrate our
   argument with case studies of Austro-Hungarian and Russian influence
   strategies before the First World War and of Prussian strategies among
   German states before the Franco-Prussian War.},

Abstract = {This article studies the institutional conditions that facilitate
   voluntary member state cooperation in the implementation of regional
   development policy in Switzerland. Cooperation is crucial for the
   implementation of regional development policies given that functional
   perimeters do generally not coincide with institutional borders.
   Research on the governance of horizontal interorganizational cooperation
   often focuses on local entities and institutionalized networks, we
   examine the voluntary cooperation of higher-tier subnational entities.
   We apply the institutional collective action framework to the
   implementation of a regional policy in highly federalist Switzerland
   where subnational entities have considerable discretionary power. The
   empirical analysis of comprehensive data on implemented development
   projects and a survey of all responsible subnational actors show that
   cooperation between higher-tier subnational entities faces strong
   institutional constraints. We conclude that more top-down guidance is
   necessary when horizontal cooperation is a condition for policy success.},

Abstract = {How have differently institutionalized welfare regimes dealt with the
   Covid-19 crisis? In particular, how have they confronted the social and
   economic inequalities exposed by the virus? Taking three European
   countries-Germany, Sweden, and the UK, corresponding broadly to
   conservative-continental, social democratic, and liberal regime
   types-this paper tracks the virus response in the areas of income and
   employment protection and health and residential care. With attention
   paid to issues of ``capacity{''} and the institutional arrangements in
   each case, we find that institutional histories in Germany and Sweden
   permitted a certain recidivistic reliance on established practices in
   the areas of employment and social protection. In sum, certain social
   and economic inequalities were mitigated as these countries set aside
   recent trends toward ``liberalization{''} and mobilized longer-standing
   institutional capacities to protect some groups, although by no means
   all. Evidence of this trend is less clear in the health and residential
   care sectors, where Germany had existing capacity, allowing its older
   population to weather the crisis in better order than its counterparts
   in Sweden and the UK. In the UK, welfare liberalization has led to
   increased social and economic inequalities and funding reductions in
   health and residential care-all of which have reduced the country's
   ability to deal with severe crisis. The Covid response in this case was
   agile, but also chaotic, with little being done to ameliorate the
   positions of the most vulnerable groups.},

Title = {Premodern Confederacies: Balancing Strategic Collective Action and Local
   Autonomy},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {A confederacy is generally understood to be a formal, institutionalized
   alliance of peoples who act in mutual support to achieve common ends.
   While the emergence and maintenance of early and pre-modern states have
   received tremendous scholarly attention in the social sciences, the same
   cannot be said for confederations. This paper examines common features
   of premodern confederacies as an initial effort towards developing a
   body of theory aimed at exploring and explaining confederacies, leagues,
   and other modes of collective and regional governance. The central
   thesis posed is that confederation was an ongoing political process that
   provided a means for a diverse range of political formations to achieve
   collective strategic goals at a distance without sacrificing autonomy.
   Selected case studies ranging from Pre-Columbian North America to
   Medieval Europe are explored to evaluate this position. The case studies
   show that confederacies were capable of integrating a diverse range of
   political formations, from tribes to kingdoms. The question of whether
   or not confederacies constitute `good government' is considered and
   since the objective of a confederacy is generally not to govern, the
   answer depends on the political organization of its constituent parts.},

Abstract = {Collaboration has become an imperative of many new healthcare policies;
   however, little attention has been paid to how system-level narratives
   in both policy documents and the media create boundaries that shape
   implementation processes. By using boundary work as a theoretical lens,
   this article critically analyses the discourse found in both policy
   documents and the media surrounding the 2015 Dutch LTC reform. This
   discourse analysis contributes, first, by revealing two separate
   narratives - one epic, one tragic - which we argue represent different
   rhetorical styles used to (de-) legitimise symbolic boundaries. Second,
   we contribute by unravelling boundary work in both the social and
   symbolic dimensions to show how the design of the 2015 reform led to a
   tension-ridden position for local actors: symbolic boundaries demanded
   integration, while social boundaries imposed differentiation. These
   findings have implications for literature on boundary work as well as
   for policy design and its local implementation.},

Abstract = {Tanzania's legislature, or Bunge, has undergone considerable change in
   recent decades, gradually strengthening to attain unprecedented
   influence during Jakaya Kikwete's presidency (2005-2015) only to decline
   again under President John Magufuli (2015-2021). This article
   investigates Bunge's institutional evolution, asking what explains
   institutional change within an authoritarian legislature, dominated in
   this case by the ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi. Building on recent
   literature highlighting the influence of elite contestation on
   legislative outcomes, the article seeks to go further by probing the
   nature and origins of the elite factions driving legislative
   institutional change. It uses insights from a recent political
   settlements literature, as well as older work on African political
   economy, to outline how changes to Tanzania's Parliament have both
   reflected-and magnified-shifting patterns of elite contestation within
   CCM. These elite power struggles, in turn, vary with changes in the
   extent of private wealth accumulation and the related expansion of rival
   patron-client factions. When private accumulation has continued
   relatively uninhibited, as was true under Kikwete but not Magufuli, then
   factional contestation intensified and surfaced in parliament, helping
   to drive legislative institutional strengthening. For this analysis, I
   use interview and archival data gathered during extensive fieldwork.},

Abstract = {Single-issue referendums - which give voters a say on specific European
   Union (EU) policies or general questions of European integration - were
   rarely employed before the 2000s, but they have since become
   commonplace. Examples include Greece's 2015 referendum on negotiations
   with the EU and International Monetary Fund (IMF), Hungary's 2016
   referendum on the relocation of refugees between EU member states and
   the UK's 2016 vote to leave the EU. This article asks why we are seeing
   more single-issue referendums in the EU. Surveying different theoretical
   perspectives on the conditions under which such votes occur, it
   considers single-issue referendums as being driven by (1) the search for
   strategic advantage in a two-level game, (2) domestic effects and (3)
   problems of consentification. Case studies of eight single-issue
   referendums show that domestic effects matter but offer limited evidence
   of hand tying. Most single-issue referendums, it finds, were called by
   governments wrestling with issues that could win legal approval but not
   political legitimacy. This instrument of direct democracy will remain a
   feature of EU politics, we contend, as member states wrestle with
   domestic effects and the challenge of (de)legitimating EU decisions
   through traditional means.},

Abstract = {5G networks are at the center of geopolitical competition. The United
   States has denounced market leader Huawei's ability to break into
   allies' sensitive networks and it has tried to convince Europeans to ban
   the Chinese group from their 5G markets. How are European governments
   and industries reacting to 5G politicization? This article argues that
   government-industry interactions in the handling of politically salient
   issues are mediated by the country's political system. In
   executive-dominated countries, the government would centralize
   policymaking. In parliament-dominated countries, the government would
   delegate politically salient issues to the industry to bypass diffuse
   power-sharing and fragmented coalition-building. The article adds that
   political economy acts as an intervening variable. In public governance
   ecosystems, governments and industries interact through informal
   coordination; in private governance ecosystems, the two actors rely on
   formal contracting. The empirical analysis focuses on British, Dutch,
   French, and Italian reactions to 5G politicization, yielding favorable
   results to the hypotheses.},

Title = {Human Rights Fallout of Nuclear Detonations: Reevaluating `Threshold
   Thinking' in Assisting Victims of Nuclear Testing},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {76-90},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Atmospheric nuclear test detonations conducted by USA, USSR, UK, France
   and China, 1945-1980, generated radioactive particles that were
   dispersed by weather patterns, returning to earth as fallout. People who
   lived `downwind' face ongoing risks from their exposure to ionizing
   radiation, as well as psychological, social, cultural and political
   distress. However, testing states obscured these humanitarian
   consequences by claiming that fallout could be contained to specific
   spatial zones, that there are `thresholds' below which radiation
   exposure has negligible health impacts and that socio-political forms of
   harm should be disregarded. While the scientific consensus concludes
   fallout circulates in complex, nonlinear patterns; there is no safe
   level of radiation exposure; and nuclear testing can generate tremendous
   anxiety, what Liboiron calls `threshold thinking' continues to underlie
   policies ostensibly assisting victims of nuclear weapons. This article
   offers examples from responses to French Pacific nuclear testing,
   showing how access to compensation and other assistance has often been
   conditioned on threshold qualifications that function to limit downwind
   communities' access to assistance and remedy. Victim assistance and
   environmental remediation obligations in the 2017 Treaty on the
   Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons offer opportunities to move beyond
   reductive policy logics to multifaceted, human rights-based approaches
   to affected communities' concerns.},

Abstract = {Foreign domestic workers are vulnerable everywhere in the world but are
   particularly so in frozen conflict societies. The article describes
   their poor living and working conditions in the Republic of Cyprus and
   argues that these have been exacerbated by the social consequences of
   the frozen conflict on the island. It focuses on three social
   consequences of the frozen conflict, namely that it has deprioritised
   the feminist agenda, normalised nationalist narratives and created a
   skewed understanding of human rights. Combined, these explain why
   protecting the rights of foreign domestic workers in Cyprus is even less
   of a priority than elsewhere.},

Abstract = {This article aims to present the Marxist theoretical framework based on
   Nicos Poulantzas???s thought to analyse regionalism in Latin America. We
   propose that regionalism is determined by the interests of the bourgeois
   hegemonic fraction in the power bloc. The originality of the theoretical
   proposal presented lies in the thesis that regionalisms are the fruit of
   relations between power blocs of the member states. The article
   illustrates the recent processes of regionalism in Latin America that,
   from this theoretical proposal???s point of view, can vary among the
   following models: open regionalism (related to the interests of
   comprador bourgeoisie); multidimensional regionalism (linked to internal
   bourgeoisie interests); and anti-imperialism (related to a national
   bourgeoisie project). We conclude that the dependency of these social
   formations, the presence of foreign capital, and the role of US
   imperialism should be considered in the analysis of regionalism in Latin
   America.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Abstract = {Group-Focused Enmity describes the idea that different outgroup-specific
   prejudices can be aggregated to a lar ger syndrome of inequality-based
   derogation of others. This focus section brings together three studies
   on Group-Focused Enmity that had been registered and peer-reviewed
   before they were conducted. All of the reports advance the Group-Focused
   Enmity literature in important ways and demonstrate the fruitfulness of
   the concept. They also show that using sophisticated methods can help us
   to address novel and exciting questions, and demonstrate the
   opportunities that preregistration offers for studies analysing
   secondary data.},

Abstract = {Part one discusses the emergence of Russia studies in Norway over the
   last 35 years. Part two laments our lack of knowledge regarding who the
   receiver of comments by researchers actually are. Part three discusses
   dialogism, parrhesia and phronesis as qualities needed for a researcher
   to be a good pundit. The article ends with a defence for continuing a
   policy of containment towards Russia rather than shifting to the two
   alternative policies, which are appeasement and roll-back.},

Abstract = {The arrival of Jair Bolsonaro to the Brazilian presidency brought many
   changes to foreign policy. Based on new ideas in a new foreign
   policymaking format, several patterns of international behavior were
   questioned and replaced by new guidelines and actions that created
   friction with international partners. Brazil's behavior towards South
   America was one of the areas most impacted by this shift. This paper
   reflects upon Bolsonaro's foreign policy for the region, influenced by
   these changes and marked by disinterest on policymakers' part,
   highlighting how ideational factors underpinned behaviors, actors, and
   actions.},

   protection. It deals in more details with the new fifth domain -
   cyberspace. In this context, security threats are mentioned and some

Title = {The Evolution of Databases in the Age of Targeted Sanctions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 29},
Abstract = {Databases constitute key research tools in sanctions scholarship. Over
   the past few years, we have witnessed a proliferation of sanctions
   databases: while only a single dataset was available until 2009, this
   number had increased to five by 2020; thus, the choice has more than
   doubled in less than a decade. This essay assesses the evolution
   observed. It reviews the five major datasets, comparing some of their
   basic choices, and evaluates them along two dimensions: the extent to
   which they capture targeted sanctions and the degree to which they
   brought innovations to the subfield. We find that targeted sanctions are
   not adequately reflected in databases, which remain state-centric in
   their approach. We conclude that the crafting of new databases does not
   entail an incremental refinement in which each iteration renders its
   predecessors obsolete. Rather, the evolution observed has resulted in a
   diverse set of options with different emphases. We nevertheless observe
   that a trend toward innovation has yielded to one toward consolidation,
   more focused on enlarging the empirical testing ground than in
   innovating. We conclude by discussing implications for the development
   of sanctions scholarship.},

Abstract = {The literature dealing with representative bureaucracy emphasizes the
   role that minority street-level bureaucrats may play when, directly and
   indirectly, they actively represent clients with whom they share a
   common identity. My study goes further, contributing to the
   implementation literature, by examining why and how these street-level
   bureaucrats use their discretion to shape non-minority clients'
   attitudes toward minorities. I explore this phenomenon empirically
   through interviews with 36 Israeli lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB)
   teachers. I analyze the traditional methods they routinely adopt, such
   as exposing students to information about minorities, encouraging open
   discussions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+)
   issues in the classroom, and entrepreneurially developing and
   introducing innovative learning programs. I illustrate how they respond
   to ad hoc cases (e.g., protecting LGBTQ+ clients or taking advantage of
   outside events to promote understanding of relevant issues) and the
   approach of leading by example.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to identify the causes, dynamics, and characteristics of
   the Iraqi Shia militia's funding method for political and military
   operations. The Iraqi post-2003 institutional features of political
   participation and the economic system created an atmosphere where the
   clergy's political position was highly esteemed. The legitimacy of one
   sect over another, discriminatory practices, and active participation in
   the repression of one sect can be seen as another chance for the state
   cultivates a struggle for rigid resources. The paper's central theme is
   to determine how the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) get
   financialized for their activity and identify/examine how these PMF can
   collect money. First, we start with a historical review of the Iraqi
   state formation/building post-2003, then look at the Iraqi state and
   assess its form and condition post-2003. In the second part, we identify
   the reasons behind the rising of ISIS and PMF. The third part, the most
   significant part of the paper, includes categorizing and classifying
   Iraqi Shia armed groups' complex, multilayer, and intertwined financial
   sources. Finally, each of these financial sources will be discussed and
   examined.},

Abstract = {In this study, perceptions of security and civic services were measured
   among the Israeli-Arab minority youth. Three hundred participants
   completed a questionnaire assessing their propensity to enrol in
   security and civic services. Both types of national service were
   correlated with life satisfaction in Israel and three temporal
   attraction and repulsion factors that occurred in 2020-2021: the IDF
   assisting local municipalities during the COVID-19 pandemic, hostilities
   between Jews and Arabs in May 2021, and crime in Arab communities. A
   strong positive correlation was found between life satisfaction and
   willingness to engage in security and national service. The temporal
   factors did not mediate this correlation. Finally, the possibility of
   recruiting Arab minorities to security organizations is discussed.},

Abstract = {Environmental governance in many high-income democracies relies to some
   extent on self-regulation by the private sector. Yet, this policy mode
   is contested and proponents of top-down government regulation argue that
   voluntary corporate sustainability commitments remain shallow and rarely
   are more than greenwashing. I assess to what extent firms' business
   conduct is subject to societal checks and balances, in particular,
   whether public support for regulation constitutes a control mechanism of
   corporate contributions to environmental goods. I rely on an original
   survey experiment (N = 2112) conducted with a representative sample of
   the Swiss voting population. The analysis shows that accusing firms of
   greenwashing reduces both citizens' perceived effectiveness of
   self-regulation and perceived synergy of corporate profits and
   environmental protection. However, this attitudinal shift only
   translates into modest updates in respondents' policy preferences. As a
   result, short-run shifts in public support for regulation are an
   unlikely societal control mechanism of business conduct.},

Abstract = {Transnational environmental law (TEL) is a relatively new field of
   research that is agitated by the concept of the Anthropocene. Like
   environmental law. TEL suffers from certain methodological challenges
   which are exacerbated by the sheer ammount of activity involved in the
   generation of transnational legal norms and regulation. This article
   argues that, despite some of these challenges, TEL is well placed to
   evolve further to better regulate human activity in the Anthropocene. It
   argues that to better reflect on what the Anthropocene means for TEL and
   how it may develop in practice, it must engage further with power, the
   problem of erasure of weaker actors, and the legacies of colonialism on
   the one hand, and the sciences - particularly Earth system science and
   ecology - on the other. By doing so it would offer a more robust
   analysis of TEL and insights into its further development in practice.},

Abstract = {Deliberative mini-publics are increasingly used to try to tackle public
   discontent with the functioning of democracy. However, the ability of
   mini-publics to increase perceptions of legitimate decision-making among
   citizens at large remains unclear, given especially that existing
   studies have not considered the potentially damaging effects of
   mini-public recommendations not being followed. We designed,
   pre-registered, and ran a survey experiment in Ireland to test the
   effects of mini-publics on legitimacy perceptions conditional on whether
   or not their non-binding policy recommendations are honored (N = 1309).
   We find that mini-publics increase legitimacy perceptions among the
   broader citizenry; however, these beneficial effects are largely limited
   to situations in which their recommendations are honored. Additional
   results suggest that it makes no difference whether mini-public
   recommendations are overturned by elected representatives or by citizens
   in a referendum. Finally, we find that the legitimacy-enhancing effects
   of participatory processes are driven by citizens with low political
   trust.},

Abstract = {Beyond the more spontaneous and reactive urban mass protests against
   corruption, the most sustained and explicit challenge to neoliberal
   policies in postwar Guatemala has been advanced by rural communities. As
   the case of Peaceful Resistance La Puya and its opposition to a mining
   project indicates, this form of agency has gone beyond indigenous
   territories to localized resistances in areas of mixed or primarily
   ladino population. A key factor in explaining the persistence of this
   process of defense of territory is the emphasis its members put on
   preserving the strong horizontal features of their locally rooted
   mobilizing structure. This has reinforced their antagonistic position
   toward the promoters of the mining project while encouraging the
   appropriation of the struggle among community members.},

Abstract = {Policymakers and scholars have in recent years paid increasing attention
   to the climate-security nexus. However, discussions have been
   overwhelmingly focused on the security implications of climate change,
   neglecting the question of the climate implications of alternative
   approaches to security. On closer inspection, security policies can
   impact global warming in at least four ways. First, security apparatuses
   produce direct greenhouse gas emissions. Second, security policies can
   condition domestic decarbonisation efforts by competing, to a greater or
   lesser extent, with green transition efforts for public investment. Some
   policies will also be more likely than others to foster climate-friendly
   technological spill-overs. Third, security policies can affect spending
   priorities in other states, thus shaping decarbonisation efforts
   overseas. Finally, security competition can influence the wider climate
   for environmental cooperation. Accordingly, when assessing alternative
   security policies, observers should factor in known climate costs as
   well as the potential for creating negative externalities vis-a-vis
   decarbonisation efforts.},

Abstract = {The yellow vest movement in France was triggered by a fuel tax increase.
   The increase was designed to reduce petrol consumption and hence
   emissions. However, the costs of this policy were unequally distributed
   among citizens. The yellow vests illustrate that abstract support for
   public action against climate change is not enough to secure support for
   concrete policies. These policies run the risk of being opposed by
   citizens when their costs are unevenly spread across society. Through a
   survey experiment on Norwegian citizens, we analyse how different policy
   characteristics generate `support gaps' within society. Particularly, we
   contrast two stylized profiles: `urban elites' (high-educated urbanites)
   and `yellow vests' (low-educated ruralites). We find that opposition
   rises with the individual cost of the policy but in a non-linear way.
   Environmental earmarking and invoking personal responsibility widen the
   gap between yellow vests, urban elites, and the rest of society.
   Redistribution to low-income households and invoking international
   commitments help to bridge such gaps. We argue that, instead of focusing
   on aggregate levels of support, both policymakers and academics should
   rather pay attention to the polarizing effects of certain policy
   attributes.},

Abstract = {To better understand the government-business relations and the
   governance in China, this study investigates the effects of Chinese
   business leaders' membership in the National People's Congress (NPC) on
   government subsidy, firm's strategic change, and labor inefficiency. Our
   sample consists of 959 firms with business leaders in the 10th and 11th
   NPC, which account for 88\% of the total firms that have business
   leaders in the NPC. To make a valid comparison, we used various criteria
   to create a matching sample of 44,894 firms that have no business
   leaders in the NPC. The results suggest that NPC membership has a
   positive effect on government subsidy, and negative effects on firm's
   strategic change and labor inefficiency. After conducting a post-hoc
   analysis, we found interesting interaction effects of NPC membership and
   firm ownership upon firm's strategic change and labor inefficiency.
   State-owned firms had stronger negative relationships between NPC
   membership and strategic change, and between NPC membership and labor
   inefficiency.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {This study explores the motives of small Arab donors for the provision
   of aid. The existing literature of financial assistance separates donors
   into two main categories, namely large donors, who are geopolitically
   motivated, and small donors, who allocate aid according to recipients'
   needs. Contrary to this practice in the literature, this article argues
   that there is a third category, that is, small Arab donors. This third
   category combines elements from the other two. By utilising multiple
   documentary sources, this article finds that the moral obligations of
   aid are often side-lined, as aid decisions are determined by the
   domestic and foreign policy agendas of donors. Although considered as
   small donors, this situation results in the use of aid as an instrument
   to promote donors' interests in the region. The three case studies
   (Kuwait, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates) reveal the different
   strategies that small Arab donors pursue in order to achieve their
   geopolitical and economic objectives.},

Abstract = {Do nuclear weapons deter low-level military conflict? Although the
   political effects of nuclear weapons have been debated for more than
   seventy years, scholarship has yet to produce a clear answer. We design
   a study that reduces the risk of omitted variable bias relative to prior
   research. Our analysis compares the rates of conflict among eventual
   nuclear powers in the periods before and after they obtained an arsenal.
   We include two-way fixed effects to control for time-invariant
   state-specific confounders and address common shocks. Our findings
   indicate that switching from nonnuclear status to a nuclear arsenal
   decreases the risk of being targeted in militarized interstate disputes
   (MID) by nonnuclear challengers. However, when it comes to low-level
   conflict, nuclear powers do not appear to be deterred from instigating
   disputes with other nuclear-armed states. This result stands in contrast
   to most prior studies, which conclude that the possession of nuclear
   weapons increases or does not reliably decrease the risk of being
   targeted-even for nonnuclear challengers. Although there are clear
   limits to the deterrence benefits of nuclear weapons at low levels of
   conflict, states can reduce their vulnerability to some degree by
   developing a nuclear arsenal.},

Abstract = {While public consideration of social equity pre-dates Minnowbrook
   (Blessett et al., 2019; Burnier, 2021), the field formally recognized
   social equity as its fourth pillar after the conference (Frederickson,
   1971). The National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA, 2000), Svara
   and Brunet (2004, 2005), and Johnson and Svara (2011) outlined a unified
   social equity framework along four dimensions: procedural fairness,
   access, quality, and outcomes. We build on this important work by
   offering a polycentric extension, which considers what social equity
   means when government programs are often place-based and delivered in an
   intergovernmental context with multiple decision-making units across
   spatial levels (e.g., state, city, neighborhood) simultaneously. Using
   the Community Development Block Grant as an example, we demonstrate the
   importance of careful consideration of geographic levels in the delivery
   of public goods for understanding the program's social equity
   implications. The polycentric framework can be a useful tool for
   evaluating the social equity of policies.},

Abstract = {Public support for and voluntary compliance with protective policy
   measures are crucial to mitigating the spread of infectious disease.
   However, it is unclear why and how people with diverse cultural biases
   support particular protective policies. Relying on the Cultural Theory
   (CT) of risk, we hypothesize that value congruence with social
   distancing and a vaccine mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic influences
   the level of public support for and compliance with these protective
   policies. Analyzing a Chinese nationwide sample, we find that the
   effects of cultural biases on public support and compliance vary not
   only with cultural biases but by how these are mediated through value
   congruence with particular protective policies. As hypothesized,
   hierarchical cultural biases increase public support for and compliance
   with social distancing and a vaccine mandates both directly and
   (indirectly) through value congruence. By contrast, as hypothesized,
   fatalistic cultural biases decrease public support for and compliance
   with social distancing both directly and (indirectly) through lack of
   value congruence and individualistic biases decrease public support for
   and compliance with social distancing and a vaccine mandate both
   directly and (indirectly) through lack of value congruence. However, the
   hypothesized effects of fatalistic biases did not hold for the vaccine
   mandate. We discuss reasons why these latter hypotheses regarding the
   vaccine mandate were not validated and suggest that risk analysts and
   communicators do more to discover and explain why particular protective
   policies are congruent with diverse cultural values.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe paper aims to address the gap in the literature related to
   students' mindsets and learning activities through investigation of the
   differences in students' expectations of, feelings towards, and
   perceptions of an overseas study tour based on their mindset. The study
   provides an in-depth analysis of students with different mindsets and
   proposes the use of overseas tours and intercultural learning to foster
   students' growth mindset.Design/methodology/approachAn overseas study
   tour hosted by a self-financing tertiary institution in Hong Kong was
   selected for investigation. 13 sub-degree students participated in the
   study tour during the summer term in 2018. Two types of primary data -
   quantitative (i.e., a questionnaire survey) and qualitative (i.e.,
   in-depth interviews) - of fixed mindset and growth mindset students were
   collected for analysis.FindingsThe findings indicate differences in
   students' expectations of, feelings towards, and perceptions of an
   overseas study tour depending on whether they demonstrate a fixed or
   growth mindset. The growth mindset students had more and higher
   expectations of the study tour, all of which were related to personal
   growth and development. The fixed mindset students did not have as much
   of a desire for personal development and their expectations were easily
   met. Both growth and fixed mindset students had positive feelings and
   perceptions of the tour.Originality/valueResearch on the application
   value of overseas study tours in helping students from self-financing
   tertiary institutions develop a growth mindset is scarce, and thus
   warrants further investigation.},

Abstract = {How has public healthcare spending prepared countries for tackling the
   COVID-19 pandemic? Arguably, spending is the primary policy tool of
   governments for providing effective health. We argue that the
   effectiveness of spending for reducing COVID deaths is conditional on
   the existence of healthcare equity and lower political corruption
   because the health sector is particularly susceptible to political
   spending. Our results, obtained using ordinary least squares and
   two-stage least squares estimations, suggest that higher spending
   targeted at reducing inequitable access to health has reduced COVID
   deaths. Consistent with the findings of others, our results indirectly
   suggest that health spending is necessary, but not sufficient unless
   accompanied by good governance and equitable access. Equitable health
   systems ease the effects of COVID presumably because they allow states
   to reach and treat people more effectively. Spending aimed at increasing
   health system capacity by increasing access thus seems a sound strategy
   for fighting the spread of disease, ultimately benefiting us all.},

   experience. Particularly, students' application of knowledge and
   improvement of multiple skills in work-integrated learning, their
   influence on positive industry image change due to the COVID-19
   pandemic, and students' desired career prospect were
   explored.Design/methodology/approachA questionnaire survey with valid

   management was conducted in four colleges/universities in Guangdong,
   China in 2021. PLS-SEM method was used to analyze the data.FindingsIt
   was found that students' multiple skills had improved through
   application of knowledge in work-integrated learning. Skill improvement
   helped form positive industry image change and shape future career
   prospect. However, such positive industry image change did not impact
   students' career prospect directly.Originality/valueToday,
   work-integrated learning has become one of the most valuable
   opportunities for students in hospitality and tourism management to gain
   industry experience. However, recent literature has largely examined the
   negative impacts of COVID-19, whereas few studies have examined the

Abstract = {PurposeIn Morocco, universities have opted for online courses as a
   national effort to contain the coronavirus since the early stage. This
   article aims to analyze university students' satisfaction with their
   distance learning experience during the COVID-19
   pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThis article is based on the
   statistical analysis of a survey conducted in 2020 at the national level
   among 800 university students from all disciplines enrolled in open
   access and regulated access institutions in Morocco. Econometrically,
   the authors used the ordinal logistic regression model after checking
   several conditions justifying its use.FindingsFindings from analysis
   reveal that students lacking basic computer skills have a negative
   perception of this new mode of learning. The results also show a certain
   sensitivity of the students to the way in which the courses are taught.
   The satisfaction of the learners largely depends on the duration of the
   courses, the interactivity, and the teaching methods adopted. In
   designing, developing, and delivering distance education courses,
   students' needs should be taken care of.Originality/valueThis article
   suggests that for public policies, professional training for teachers
   should equip them with the pedagogical skills so that they can adjust
   their teaching according to students' levels. Training in digital tools
   must also be provided to bridge the digital divide and accelerate
   positive change and adaptation to this new mode of training. In
   addition, this article highlights the role of interactivity in
   increasing adaptation to distance learning.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic challenged the common belief that government
   institutions are incapable of adaptating. But it also reveals that,
   despite substantial gains in poverty reduction since the 1990s and
   countless versions of ``state reform{''}, the Latin America and
   Caribbean region remains in crisis. This presentation will address the
   need to ``recast{''} state reform to build resilient communities. It
   focuses on the need to rethink the effort to implement the 2030 Agenda,
   as well as the contributions of evidence-based decision-making systems.
   Given the desire for citizens to play an influential role in governance
   and state reform, three conditions are discussed that would make citizen
   participation and engagement prevalent. Finally, it argues for engaging
   universities as engines of growth and development in support of
   effective institutions and sustainable communities.},

   concepts of position and process power to develop an analytical
   framework that conceptualizes negotiations as dynamic interactions
   between the two. We contend that negotiation outcomes rest on a
   country's ability to shape subsequent network configurations based on
   its initial network position and its competent performance of practices.
   Among other things, our framework offers a nuanced understanding of the
   formation and role of coalition groupings as well as the forms of social
   relational power that can emerge among states. As we argue, states can
   both `be' (due to exogenous and pre-existing factors) and `become'
   powerful (thanks to the social dynamics unique to each negotiation).},

   assessing the role of social forces},

Abstract = {This article discusses why Latin American post-neoliberal parties have
   varied in their strategies of capital flow management. In brief, I
   propose that two complementary channels favor the pursuit of heterodox
   strategies: high degree of pressure from popular sectors that push for
   an immediate macroeconomic reorientation, and strategic allies among
   economic elites that mitigate the credibility losses associated with
   this decision. The comparative case-study on Argentina under Kirchnerism
   (2003-2015) and Brazil under the Workers' Party (2003-2016) provides
   support for this argument. In the former case, the ruling party had to
   address the demands from strong and autonomous unions and social
   movements, while counting on a strategic alliance with domestic
   manufacturing producers. In the latter, conversely, the governing party
   lacked strategic allies among economic elites and could overlook the
   agenda of weak and subordinate popular organisations. In other words,
   both popular and elite channels favored the adoption of a heterodox
   strategy of capital flow management by Kirchnerism, while neither of
   them did in the case of the Workers' Party. In Argentina, the option for
   heterodoxy also contributed to the repoliticisation of capital flow
   management by returning the visibility of this policy issue and
   impelling policymakers to go beyond technocratic discourses.},

Abstract = {How does the state's behavior in negotiations with one non-state group
   influence the behavior of other non-state actors? We argue that the
   dynamics of different conflicts within the same country are
   interdependent, and that a state develops a reputation through its
   interactions with each conflict party. This reputation provides a
   valuable source of information that other groups use to judge the
   state's cooperative intentions. When a state develops a reputation for
   cooperation, this increases the likelihood of (indirect) reciprocation
   from other groups. More specifically, we argue that when states enter
   into (and honor) a ceasefire with one rebel group, they demonstrate a
   credible reputation for cooperation. A credible reputation for
   cooperation, we posit, increases the likelihood that other conflict
   parties enter into ceasefires with the state, or that they de-escalate
   their military activities. We test our claims using the new civil
   conflict ceasefire dataset and find support for our argument.},

Abstract = {Recently, political contestation on climate change has increased
   considerably. Not least, world-wide protests by the Fridays for Future
   movement have brought the issue to the fore of the policy-agenda.
   However, following classic ideas of partisan theory, the movement
   depends on political parties to translate their demands into political
   action. Based on multiple data sources (i.e. social media and
   parliamentary debates), we, therefore, investigate reactions of 19
   parties to the movement in three European countries (Austria, Germany
   and Sweden) and analyse reasons for their varying responses in a
   qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). Overall, parties stay true to
   their general ideological position and party competition only exerts a
   mild impact on party reactions to the movement while their traditional
   left-right positioning or environmental preferences explain their
   responses. Thus, despite Fridays for Future's moderate demands and its
   measured appearance it was not able to generate general support from
   centre-right parties.},

Abstract = {The paper aims to investigate the economic consequences of the COVID-19
   pandemic through the prism of local finances in the Mazovia region. The
   rationale for this research comes from the observation that lockdown and
   a reduced economic activity affect revenues of local budgets. Thus, a
   question arises about the effect of decreased local budgets on local
   expenditure and the implementation of development strategies. The method
   applied was a survey carried out on a sample consisting of all the local
   administrative units (LAU) in the region. The results show that the
   ``scissors effect `` of rising expenditure and falling revenues applies
   to all the LAU. The analysis provides evidence that the characteristics
   of urban and rural LAU have consequences not only for their resilience
   against the COVID-19 pandemic but influence their strategies and actions
   adopted in response to the crisis.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the sources of bureaucratic fragmentation and
   coherence in the Democratic Republic of Congo by exploring the
   connections and tensions between interface bureaucracies and the
   back-office administration tasked with managing the public payroll
   system. Building on the `real governance' literature and the notion of
   `infrastructural power', we analyse the recent history of payroll
   management in Congo and especially its evolution over the last decades
   of state implosion and reconstruction so as to gauge the potential of
   different drivers of state infrastructural power. The return of the
   state in the first decades of the twenty-first century led to a
   spectacular and unprecedented growth in the number of civil servants,
   made possible by a reconstituted state budget and renewed donor
   engagement. Yet this growth largely reflects increased political
   competition and further disarticulated the payroll system, increasing
   its vulnerability to the issue of ghost workers. The case study shows
   important trade-offs, in processes of post-conflict reconstruction,
   between the triple objectives of building state infrastructural power,
   making use of it to improve public service delivery, and its
   democratization.},

Title = {Radical conservatism and the Heideggerian right: Heidegger, de Benoist,
   Dugin},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {The paper studies the significance of Martin Heidegger's philosophy of
   history for two key thinkers of contemporary radical conservatism and
   the Identitarian movement, Alain de Benoist and Aleksandr Dugin.
   Heidegger's often-overlooked affinities with the German ``conservative
   revolution{''} of the Weimar period have in recent years been emphasized
   by an emerging radical-conservative ``right-Heideggerian{''}
   orientation. I first discuss the later Heidegger's
   ``being-historical{''} narrative of the culmination and end of the
   metaphysical foundations of Western modernity in the contemporary
   Nietzschean era of nihilism and of an emerging postmodern ``other
   beginning{''} of Western thinking, focused on historical and cultural
   relativism and particularism. In Heidegger's work of the 1930s and
   1940s, we find attempts to apply this historical narrative to
   interpreting contemporary geopolitical and ideological phenomena in ways
   that connect Heidegger to certain central ideas and concerns of the
   conservative revolutionaries, especially Carl Schmitt's geopolitical
   particularism. De Benoist, the key name of the French Nouvelle Droite
   and a founding figure of contemporary Identitarianism, is particularly
   inspired by Heidegger's reading of Nietzsche as the culmination of the
   ``metaphysics of subjectivity{''} dominating Western modernity. For de
   Benoist, this modern metaphysics is the root of the ``ideology of the
   Same{''} underlying the liberal universalism and individualism that he
   opposes in the name of a cultural ethnopluralism. De Benoist's Russian
   disciple Dugin bases the pluralistic geopolitics of his
   radical-conservative ``fourth political theory{''} on the legacy of the
   conservative revolution, the key intellectual model of which Dugin
   discovers in Heidegger's notion of the ``other beginning{''}.},

Title = {Troubled Comparative Trajectories and the Statistical Construction of

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Since 9/11, a number of scholars added gender as a new variable to
   explain how economic, political, and/or social developments in the
   Middle East have diverged from developments elsewhere. These studies
   relied almost exclusively on statistical analysis and frequently
   discounted much of the extant literature, especially the more feminist
   and historically sensitive and in-depth qualitative works on the subject
   matter. Almost uniformly, the point of departure for many of these works
   was the disempowered socioeconomic and/or political status of
   Arab/Muslim women. Most of the scholars of these works had no gender
   expertise and had never written on women previously. Regardless, these
   works spawned an important discussion in the field of comparative
   politics and their scholarly impact has been noteworthy. Such
   scholarship, however, is not benign. Accordingly, this article seeks to
   answer two critical questions: How does the work of non-gender
   specialists of Middle East and North Africa (MENA) come to have such a
   significant impact on the study of women and politics in the field of
   comparative politics? How can we approach these research inquiries
   differently so that expertise, lived realities, and history matter? The
   article argues that feminist international relations could serve as a
   critical corrective to this current trajectory of comparative politics
   research. This corrective also requires a commitment to feminist
   scholarship that begins with women's lives and seeks to eliminate gender
   inequality, as well as greater understanding of the composition and
   changing structure of our disciplinary communities.},

Abstract = {Throughout the 20(th) century, women were leading intellectuals on
   International Relations (IR). They thought, wrote, and taught on this
   subject in numerous political, professional, intimate, and intellectual
   contexts. They wrote some of the earliest and most powerful theoretical
   statements of what would later become core approaches to contemporary
   international theory. Yet, historical women, those working before the
   late 20(th) century, are almost completely missing in IR's intellectual
   and disciplinary histories, including histories of its main theoretical
   traditions. In this forum, leading historians and theorists of IR
   respond to the recent findings of the Leverhulme project on Women and
   the History of International Thought (WHIT), particularly its first two
   book-length publications on the centrality of women to early IR
   discourses and subsequent erasure from its history and
   conceptualization. The forum is introduced by members of the WHIT
   project. Collectively, the essays suggest the implications of the
   erasure and recovery of women's international thought are significant
   and wide-ranging.},

Abstract = {Why do individuals engage in violence against the state? This research
   investigates the biological and environmental determinants of
   individual-level participation in political violence through the use of
   a Candidate Gene Association, gene-environment interaction, study.
   Existing research has demonstrated that variation in a specific gene
   (called MAO-A) is associated with aggression. However, relatively little
   scholarly attention has been paid to the interaction with the
   environment; specifically, the ways in which repressive political
   environments differentially incite acts of violence. Using original
   genetic, survey and experimental data collected on participants and
   non-participants of political violence, I find that under conditions of
   political repression, individuals with the low MAO-A genetic variant are
   significantly more likely to engage in acts of political violence. By
   examining both the genetic and environmental factors influencing
   political violence, the results make a significant contribution to our
   understanding of how genetic variation may lead to violence.},

Abstract = {The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) was first initiated by the
   United States, Japan, Australia, and India in 2007 but did not succeed
   and was quickly deactivated. Ten years later, the QUAD was revived in
   2017 and has been reinvented by the four powers into an informal
   alliance. Adopting the theoretical lens of offensive realism, this study
   explains the QUAD's transformation according to the changing relative
   power distribution in the Indo-Pacific region. It empirically argues
   that the increasingly unbalanced multipolarity in the Indo-Pacific
   region is the structural factor that led to the revival and reinvention
   of the QUAD since 2017. The future of the QUAD hinges on the future
   trajectories of the US-China great power competition in the Indo-Pacific
   region.},

Abstract = {Begun in 2000, China's Great Western Development Campaign (GWDC) sought
   to reinforce party-state legitimation narratives by extending economic
   development to peripheral regions often populated by ethnic minorities.
   In extending aid to minority communities, the Chinese Communist Party
   (CCP) promoted narratives about its own provision of stability and
   prosperity, and endeavored to exert further control over the conduct of
   ethnic politics. However, while this subsidization of development in
   minority communities produced macro-level success, it also contributed
   to fragmentation of ethnic identity and perpetuation of instability in
   daily interactions. In this article, I examine the CCP's attempt to
   subsidize the creation of a branded ethnic economy around the production
   of handmade noodles (lamian) in ethnic Hui communities in rural Qinghai
   Province. I argue that while the state's investment in lamian did
   increase income in Hui communities, the migration that accompanied this
   developmental aid led to increased contestation of the boundaries of Hui
   identity and contributed to marginalization and alienation of the Hui
   migrants involved. I argue that these consequences stemming from the
   funding of the lamian economy allow the CCP to effect greater control
   through channeling measures. However, such measures also illuminate the
   limitations of performance-based legitimation strategies which justify
   the implementation of ever-increasing measures of control that risk
   overreach.},

Abstract = {The world's population is increasingly concentrated in cities. Research
   on urbanization's implications for peace and security has been hampered
   by a lack of comparable data on political mobilization and violence at
   the city level across space and through time, however. Urban Social
   Disorder 3.0 is a detailed event dataset covering 186 national capitals
   and major urban centers from 1960 to 2014. It includes 12 types of
   nonviolent and violent events, detailing the actors involved and their
   targets, start and end dates of each event, and the number of
   participants and deaths. We provide an overview of the main features of
   these data, and trends in urban social disorder across space and time.
   We demonstrate the utility of the dataset by analyzing the relationship
   between city size and the frequency of lethal disorder events. We find a
   positive relationship between city population and lethal urban social
   disorder, unlike previous studies. These new data raise promising
   avenues for future research on democratization; climate change and food
   security; and spillovers between different forms of mobilization and
   violence.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Revenue, especially that from agricultural crops, has been considered
   fundamental for the development of state capacity. While existing
   research has mostly focused on dynamics of violence, we know less about
   the impact of commodities shocks on a key dimension of state power:
   property taxation. In this article, I explore how and why land-based
   coalitions-alliances between landowners and paramilitaries around the
   appropriation of land-undermine taxation during civil conflict. Focusing
   on the expansion of oil palm in Colombia and using a
   difference-in-differences design, I leverage the international price of
   oil palm and municipal variation in crop suitability. I find that, in
   municipalities with higher paramilitary violence and land concentration,
   the palm shock was associated with lower taxation, outdated cadastral
   information, and lower land values. This article underscores the
   deleterious consequences of land inequality for the state's extractive
   capacity even in moments of agricultural abundance.},

Abstract = {The past two decades have witnessed a tremendous increase in the
   scholarly attention paid to the European Union (EU)'s external relations
   as well as the nature of the union's role in world politics. With an aim
   to contribute to the EU-as-a-power debate, this research explores how EU
   economic and market-related norms and policies have been promoted and
   received by taking the EU's relations with Association of Southeast
   Asian Nations (ASEAN) as an empirical case study. Drawing on
   transnational diffusion literature, this paper seeks to bridge existing
   scholarly discussions on Normative Power Europe and Market or Regulatory
   Power Europe, offering a more nuanced understanding of subjects of the
   EU's externalization, as well as the processes and effectiveness of the
   EU's diffusion of market-related norms and regulatory approaches.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the changing nature of the English and Swedish
   states between 1800 and 2020 from the perspective of ordinary citizens.
   We identify 13 typical life situations and then describe the types of
   citizens who interacted with the state, the number and types of public
   officials with whom they interacted, and where those interactions took
   place. We distinguish among three typical social groups: the poor, the
   middle, and the rich. We find, among other things, that the poor became
   objects of government policy much earlier than other groups, but they
   also remained in a world of parochial poor relief even as the middle and
   the rich began to interact with a more functionally differentiated,
   professional bureaucracy. These findings have important implications for
   scholarly debates on when the state began to interact directly with the
   civilian masses and the unevenness of state activities and capacities
   within countries.},

Abstract = {Whom do states target with violent repression? While we know that states
   are more likely to repress threats to their rule, precisely who is
   threatening enough to warrant this response is less clear. To address
   this question, we focus on a set of actors who often bear the brunt of
   state force - ethnopolitical minority organizations - and argue that
   certain organizational behaviors and attributes are more threatening
   than others and therefore are more likely to be repressed. Using data
   from the Middle East and North Africa, our findings show which
   challengers are threatening enough to elicit violent repression.},

Abstract = {Persistent efforts to meet the demand for cross-organizational
   collaboration and trust-based management have been halted by a mixture
   of bureaucratic inertia and entrenched New Public Management thinking.
   This article explores whether the COVID-crisis has broken the reform
   deadlock. Based on a handful of recent surveys and interviews conducted
   by Danish public sector organizations, we look at the crisis-induced
   transformations in local public administration. The main finding is that
   the pandemic has forced administrative agencies to collaborate with each
   other to solve new and pressing problems in a turbulent environment.
   Similarly, it has urged public managers to trust the skills and
   motivation of their employees, who must solve administrative tasks in
   innovative ways and with limited managerial support, supervision and
   monitoring. While changes may amount to little more than a temporary
   departure from normalcy, lesson-drawing, learning retention and
   proactive leadership may help to produce a sustainable transformation.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of the Euro debt crisis, negative stereotypes about
   Southern Europeans were (re)activated across Northern European
   countries. Because these stereotypes make explicit reference to
   productivity-relevant traits, they have the potential to influence
   employers' hiring decisions. We draw on a sub-sample of the Growth,
   Equal Opportunities, Migration and Markets discrimination study (GEMM)
   to investigate the responses of over 3500 firms based in Germany, the
   Netherlands and Norway to identical (fictitious) young applicants born
   to Greek, Spanish, Italian and native-born parents. Using French
   descendants as a placebo treatment and sub-Saharan African descendants
   as a benchmark treatment, we find severe levels of hiring discrimination
   against Southern European descendants in both Norway and the
   Netherlands, but not in Germany. Discrimination in Norway seems largely
   driven by employers' preferences for applicants of native descent, while
   in the Netherlands discrimination seems specifically targeted against
   Greek and Spanish descendants. Dutch employers' propensity to penalize
   these two groups seems driven by information deficits.},

Abstract = {Blockchain technology has applications that can revolutionize political
   and economic governance. Although most of the academic literature on
   blockchain has focused on Bitcoin, there is a need to look at the
   feasibility of new humanitarian applications. This study will proceed in
   two steps. First, it surveys current theoretical and practical work on
   how blockchain can be used to help protect the human rights of migrants
   and refugees, primarily through creation of digital identities. Then it
   conducts a critical examination of two major cases: the Building Blocks
   initiative by the World Food Programme in Jordan and the Rohingya
   Project. We find that blockchain can be useful in empowering vulnerable
   individuals, but the empowerment of organizations creates potential
   human rights risks, such as the infringement of privacy and
   discrimination. Therefore, adequate safeguards should be in place to
   ensure that blockchain initiatives meet their true purposes of
   protecting the most vulnerable groups.},

Abstract = {Election pledges feature prominently in the theory and practice of
   representation and have been examined extensively in a growing field of
   comparative research. However, research in this field has largely
   ignored non-Western democracies and the world's largest electoral
   democracy, India. The present analysis begins to fill this lacuna by
   examining election pledges made by Indian parties at the national level
   over a period of two decades (1999-2019) and comparing this with
   selected Western parties. The extension of research on election pledges
   to India prompts us to assess the relevance of pledges to the
   distinctive characteristics of Indian party competition. This differs
   markedly from the spatial model of party competition that is often
   applied in pledge research in Western systems. Party competition in
   India is instead characterised largely by valence politics on
   socioeconomic issues and by identity politics on religious issues. The
   quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the distinct features
   of pledges in policy areas characterised by valence and identity
   politics. We discuss the implications of the findings for understanding
   party competition in India and for the broader research programme on
   election pledges.},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {In the last 40 years, the international community has made considerable
   progress towards the regulation of inhumane conventional weapons (ICWs)
   by adopting treaties that regulate or ban these weapons. However, many
   states have still not joined these treaties or have joined them with a
   considerable delay. These ratification decisions cannot be
   satisfactorily explained by the existing literature on the origin of ICW
   treaties, which stress the role of global socialization processes. This
   article offers a theoretical argument that explains state decisions on
   the ratification of ICW treaties. It argues that while democracies and
   countries located in regions with high ratification rates are prone to
   ratify ICW treaties, an insecure external environment impedes or delays
   ratification. The argument also claims that security costs resulting
   from the characteristics of the individual treaties can modify the
   effects of these explanatory factors. To provide an empirical test for
   the argument, the article conducts a survival analysis that covers the
   ratification processes of the three existing ICW treaties.},

Abstract = {This article investigates changes in routine tasks and computer use in
   European jobs in the period 1995-2015, putting them in the context of
   the debates on the future of work and the impact of automation. Digital
   technologies not only affect employment shifts but also shape work
   organization. A shift-share analysis combining European Working
   Conditions Survey and European Labour Force Survey data assesses to what
   extent recent changes in tasks are the result of changes in the
   structure of employment (shifts in employment across jobs) or changes in
   the content of work itself (transformation in the task contents and
   methods within jobs). The results suggest contrasting trends between
   observed changes in tasks measures within jobs and compositional shifts
   in employment for routine tasks indexes. Employment structures are
   de-routinizing while work itself is becoming more routine. These results
   seem also related to the increased use of computers at work during the
   same period.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do citizens consider external sanctions against
   their country to be appropriate? Based on the literature on blame
   shifting, we argue that citizens should become less likely to support
   external sanctions if their government defends itself, especially if it
   seeks to shift the blame to the external actors (blame effect). However,
   this effect may be moderated by which actor identifies and claims the
   norm violation (source effect) and by whether citizens trust their
   government (trust effect). We test our expectations by conducting a
   survey experiment on EU sanctions against democratic backsliding in six
   countries (n = 12,000). Our results corroborate the blame and source
   effects, but disconfirm the trust effect. These findings have important
   implications for the literatures on blame shifting and external
   sanctions as well as for how the EU and other International
   Organizations should design their sanctioning mechanisms.},

Title = {Emergency: A Vernacular Contextual Approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Abstract = {Security scholars have traditionally viewed emergency as a state of
   exception that triggers a struggle for survival, justifying the breaking
   of rules and excesses of state power. While there have been attempts to
   decouple security from its survivalist logic, emergency has remained an
   analytical blind spot in security studies. The dominance of an
   elite-centric, exceptionalist paradigm in the study of emergency has
   foreclosed the possibility of alternative conceptions of emergency and
   neglected the voices of structurally disempowered agents. This paper
   advances a vernacular contextual research agenda that is sensitive to
   the empirical diversity of emergency meanings and practices while
   foregrounding emergency claims made by non-elite actors. Challenging the
   idea of emergency as a form of ``anti-politics,{''} the paper contends
   that emergency should be understood as an intrinsic part of politics. It
   then recovers an alternative, ``emancipatory{''} conception of emergency
   as an extraordinary moment of spontaneous beginnings that can activate
   the collective agency of marginalized actors. The final section
   establishes conceptual foundations for actor-centered, grounded
   empirical research into emergency politics and suggests avenues for
   future research. Contextualizing emergency and attuning to the voices
   and experiences of everyday actors are crucial to remove the key
   variable that ties security to the logic of survival and exception.},

Title = {The Impact of Domestic Surveillance on Political Imprisonment: Evidence
   from the German Democratic Republic},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUN 29},
Abstract = {How does domestic surveillance affect the frequency of political
   imprisonments in autocratic states? In contrast to conventional wisdom,
   I argue that surveillance reduces the frequency of political
   imprisonments in power-maximizing autocracies. Surveillance decreases
   uncertainty about the correct targets of repression, allowing for more
   selective detentions and shifts to silent instruments of repression. To
   investigate these claims, I draw on a unique county-level dataset of
   political imprisonment in the German Democratic Republic between 1984
   and 1988. I proxy the number of monitored individuals with newly
   collected county-level data on surveillance operations. I use ordinary
   least squares (OLS) regression, random effects, and instrumental
   variable models to investigate the impact of surveillance on political
   imprisonment. I find that higher shares of spies per monitored
   individual were associated with a reduction of political imprisonment.
   Further, increasing levels of spy infiltration were linked to a
   systematic shift to silent instruments of repression.},

Abstract = {The article takes stock of the eclectic Africa's International Relations
   (AIR) scholarship with a view to setting a new research agenda for this
   vibrant subfield of International Relations (IR). It argues that the AIR
   community has taken a defensive approach to knowledge production and
   dissemination. It calls on AIR scholars to shift the emphasis from
   reactionary scholarship to an offensive knowledge production and
   dissemination by building research around five key themes. The article
   shows that a research agenda in the five areas can give epistemic
   freedom to AIR scholars, contribute to freeing IR discipline from
   Euro-American metanarratives, and ultimately put AIR scholars in a
   position to develop analytical frameworks capable of capturing nuances
   and complexities of international life in Africa.},

Abstract = {In November 2020, Ethiopia descended into full-scale civil war which,
   owing to mass atrocities and regional intervention, metastasized into
   among the most acute humanitarian emergencies in the world. The violent
   fragmentation of state authority tarnished Ethiopia's internationally
   sanctioned role as regional peacekeeper and developmental leader-an
   ``anchor state{''} of the Pax Americana in the Horn of Africa. While
   acknowledging the complex, multidimensional origins of the conflict,
   this article examines how efforts by the U.S. government to reinvent the
   strategic relationship during the 2018-2020 political transition in
   Addis Ababa helped pave the road to war. We argue that U.S. policymakers
   provided largely unconditional support to Ethiopia's new Prime Minister
   Abiy Ahmed, creating problems of moral hazard that encouraged
   confrontation between rival political forces. The story of U.S.
   engagement in Ethiopia in this period illustrates the perils of
   Washington's efforts to rebalance fraught relations with its most
   important regional anchors.},

Abstract = {While mainstream elite actors with the ability to shape public discourse
   (politicians, academics, and the media) generally oppose far-right
   politics, it is widely argued that such politics represent democratic
   populist grievances, whether cultural or economic: `this is what the
   people want' and the mainstream should listen. Building on discourse
   theoretical approaches, this article uses opinion surveys on immigration
   to argue that rather than following `what the people want', elite actors
   play an active part in shaping and constructing public opinion and
   legitimising reactionary politics. This article thus interrogates how
   public opinion is constructed through a process of mediation, how
   certain narratives are hyped and others obstructed. What this highlights
   is that rather than the result of a simple bottom-up `democratic'
   demand, the rise of the far right must also be studied and understood as
   a top-down process: public opinion is not only a construction but also
   an agenda shaper, rather than a simple agenda tester. This article
   ultimately finds that `the people' can be misrepresented in four
   principal ways: a people to be followed; a people to be blamed; a people
   to legitimise reactionary and elitist discourse and politics; and a
   circumscribed people.},

Abstract = {Since the Second World War, the Labour Party has alternated between
   periods in which it has been positioned further to the left and others
   when it has been further to the right. The standard explanation for
   those oscillations is electoral-ideological. Labour moves to the right
   (towards the political centre) when it prioritises electoral
   considerations, usually after a period in opposition. It moves to the
   left when it prioritises ideology, usually after periods in government.
   Against this we propose a political economy-policy explanation. Labour
   moves to the right and a redistributive economic strategy when the
   economy is performing reasonably well. It moves to the left and adopts a
   structural economic reform programme when the economy is perceived to be
   in crisis. We argue that the political economy-policy explanation offers
   a more satisfactory account of when and why Labour has changed its
   spatial policy positioning in this period. By acknowledging the role of
   what we term `policy reasoning' in the processes by which political
   parties (and the public) adopt and change spatial policy positions, our
   approach provides an alternative to the mechanistic models deriving from
   Downsian rational choice theory. It suggests that, contrary to general
   expectation, the Labour Party under Keir Starmer does not need to react
   to its 2019 election defeat by shifting significantly to the right.},

Title = {How Do Economic Sanctions Affect Public Opinion and Consumer Behavior in
   Target States? Evidence from China's Economic Sanctions on South Korea},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Previous research shows that economic sanctions affect three facets of
   public opinion in target states: support for the policy at issue,
   support for the target government, and hostility toward the sanctioner.
   We explore the dynamics between the facets of opinion and link them to
   consumer behavior. How do supportive opinions of the policy and the
   target government lead to hostility? How does this hostility affect
   consumers' propensity to buy the sanctioner's branded products? We
   examine a case in which China imposed economic sanctions on South Korea
   in opposition to South Korea's decision to deploy Terminal High Altitude
   Area Defense. We collect comments from relevant newspaper articles and
   conduct attitude analysis using machine learning. We conduct
   difference-in-differences analyses using barcode-level data regarding
   monthly beer sales, for which we argue boycotts are more likely to
   occur. We find that a backlash effect in public opinion occurred with
   respect to two facets of opinion. However, despite the public
   antagonism, we observe no significant backlash in consumer behavior.
   These findings imply that effects of economic sanctions in target states
   are multidimensional and thus it is too simplistic to assess the
   effectiveness of economic sanctions only by looking at public opinion in
   target states.},

Abstract = {Does social cohesion explain variation in violence within divided
   cities? In line with insights drawn from the ethnic politics,
   criminology and urban geography literature we suggest that explaining
   variation in intergroup violence is not possible by relying on
   motivational elements alone, and attention to social cohesion is
   required as well. While cohesion can facilitate collective action that
   aids violent mobilization, it can also strengthen social order that
   contributes to the group's capability to control and prevent unrest. We
   test these relationships using an application of a latent variable model
   to an integration of survey results, crime data and expert-coded data in
   order to measure cohesion in East Jerusalem neighborhoods. We then
   analyze its impact on riots using three original geolocated datasets
   recording violence in the neighborhoods between the years 2013 and 2015.
   Our results reveal that even with controls for economic and political
   determinants of violence, as well as for spatial clustering and temporal
   explanations, neighborhood-level social cohesion is a robust explanatory
   variable that negatively correlates with riots.<br />},

Abstract = {Energy markets policy in Great Britain has been largely delegated from
   elected representatives to a market regulator: the Office of Gas and
   Electricity Markets (Ofgem). Regulatory legitimacy requires due process
   and appropriate expertise to expose the regulator to democratic
   influence. As the legitimacy of regulatory participation processes start
   to be discussed more intensively in the European context, this timely
   article examines the relationship between the use of policy formulation
   tools and the resulting legitimacy gained by an independent market
   regulator. It employs a detailed case study analysing how participatory
   policy formulation tools - deliberative focus groups with members of the
   public, and stakeholder consultations - were used in energy markets
   policy formulation in Ofgem between 2007 and 2016. Through assessing the
   actors, venues, capacities and effects associated with selection and use
   of the tools, it finds there were inequalities of influence between
   different policy actors which posed a significant challenge to
   legitimacy.},

Title = {Voting Patterns in Western European Countries. Class-Party Family
   Alignments and Their Mediation by Political Values},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {This article investigates voters' preferences for party families in
   Western European countries' general elections in the 2000s. According to
   the realignment literature, ``traditional{''} class voting patterns have
   been replaced by new class-party alignments: upper-middle employee
   classes joined the electoral bases of left parties, whereas radical
   right actors introduced in the electoral competition of the most
   deprived strata of the population, labeled ``left behind{''}. This
   article aims to answer to the research questions: do social class and
   political values affect voting behavior in Western European general
   elections? Which direction are these variables associated with the
   preference of party families? The first section outlines the theoretical
   framework, accounting for the ``societal modernization{''} processes,
   which have been affecting Western societies since the late 1960s. Among
   the ``traditional{''} cleavages, the literature assumes the realignment
   of class voting patterns, as well as alignments between value
   orientations and political preferences. Indeed, class-party alignments
   are mediated by the political supply's mobilization of voters according
   to their value orientations. Such appeals differ among party families,
   partly explaining why specific classes constitute their electoral bases
   or contested stronghold. The theoretical framework hypothesizes
   political values as clustered in three ideologies (social and economic
   conservatism-liberalism, and authoritarianism-libertarianism). Those
   political values, which do not assimilate in ideologies, constitute more
   proximal factors, i.e., evaluations of specific political issues close
   to elections (attitudes). Having defined class voting realignment and a
   theoretical account of value voting, the paper empirically investigates
   their associations with vote choices in Western Europe. The analyses
   ground on European Social Survey data, aggregating the responses
   concerning the 12 Western European countries for which data are
   available in all waves. The dependent variable clusters the parties,
   which competed in the general elections occurred in the time span
   considered, in party families. Fixed effects multinomial logistic
   regression models are performed to detect which social classes
   constitute party families' bases or contested stronghold and how more
   proximal variables based on values account for class voting patterns.
   The results clearly show whose social classes are more likely to have
   voted for radical left, center-left, center-right, and radical right
   party families. Political ideologies account for a portion of these
   preferences for mainstream political actors, whereas political attitudes
   partly explain the introduction of radical right parties in the
   competition for working classes with left families.},

Title = {The Politics and Metapolitics of Left-Wing Decline and Revival},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Conventional studies on left-wing decline focus primarily on the
   electoral losses of left-wing parties. This contribution argues that
   left wing decline should not only be understood in terms of support, but
   also in terms of ideological positioning. The Left may be in decline
   because of electoral support or because left-wing parties cease to be
   Left. More fundamentally the Left may be in decline because left-wing
   ideologies no longer inform public policy or shape political conflict,
   which points to a more metapolitical shift in ``hegemonic ideology{''}.
   Taking this into account has important implications for understanding
   Left decline (and eventual revival). As will be demonstrated in six
   different scenarios, the Left may decline because of electoral shifts to
   the right or because parties reposition themselves to the right.
   Reviving the Left therefore not only implies that Left-wing parties win
   back voters, but it can also be achieved on a so-called metapolitical
   level: by shifting ideological positions or even hegemonic ideology to
   the Left. It is argued that especially with regard to shifting
   ideological positions, smaller parties in the political margins play a
   crucial role. The article concludes by discussing the implications and
   challenges for different political parties as well as the way in which
   political scientists can more comprehensively assess Left decline.},

Abstract = {Collaborative efforts across sectors, scales, and government levels have
   been effective in addressing the goals to reduce petroleum use and
   mitigate environmental issues in the U.S. While community contexts shape
   local collaborative governance, diverse local interests do not
   necessarily translate into collaborations without proper facilitating
   efforts. This study expands the theoretical discussion on the concept of
   collaborative platforms, which is understudied despite their wide use as
   a governance instrument to catalyze local collaboration. Specifically,
   the way platforms mediate to create local collaborations among diverse
   local-level interests and improve outcomes has not been studied much to
   date. Using data on the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Cities
   program to promote local collaborative governance related to alternative
   fuels, this paper examines the way collaborative platforms create,
   scale, and affect the outcome of supplying alternative fueling
   infrastructure. The results of multi-level mixed-effects models indicate
   that the collaborative platform integrates local interests to create and
   scale local collaboration, and achieves better outcomes leveraging local
   interests.},

Abstract = {U-turns by populist parties are not a new phenomenon. The 2021 electoral
   campaign in Estonia was marked by episodes that combined cultural
   hybridity and political opportunism. The nationalist Conservative
   People's Party of Estonia (EKRE) was reprimanded by the Language
   Inspectorate for using Russian-language campaign posters with no
   Estonian translation. The same party was celebrating Estonian
   independence with a concert performing Soviet-time popular music. These
   episodes appeared quite surprising in the Estonian context, but not
   unique in a wider European perspective. We tackle the following
   question: why and how national conservative parties appeal to groups
   previously treated as domestic others.},

Abstract = {Building upon past findings on terrorism and individual-level
   politically conservative self-identification, I evaluate the effect of
   terrorism mortality reminders on conservative self-placement with three
   survey experiments, using non-representative Facebook samples in Turkey
   (2018, 2020). The scant existing experimental findings outside the usual
   Northwestern European and North American environment make it difficult
   to assess how the context (e.g., the longevity and diversity of
   terrorism problems in a country) can explain the alignment between
   terrorism threats and conservatism. In non-Western areas such as Turkey,
   with various types of terrorism over time, the link between terrorism
   threat and conservatism may remain uniform. However, the fear of death
   in a terrorist attack elicited by the terrorism mortality salience would
   create psychological strain and make individuals suppress
   terrorism-related death-thoughts by moving away from conservatism,
   reminding them of the human body's vulnerability to threats and igniting
   fearfulness. Using the Terror Management Theory perspective, this study
   explored the causal mechanism running from terrorism mortality reminder
   to terrorism mortality fear to conservative self-identification. In all
   three studies, conservatism decreased when the respondents felt fearful
   of terrorism mortality and the treated respondents became more
   conservative if the terrorism mortality fear was kept at its average
   value (as a covariate).},

Abstract = {Policy formulation is a crucial stage of the policy cycle, where social
   problems and demands are addressed, and transformed into government
   policies. This stage is complex and is one of the least analytically
   developed stages of the policy making process. In this article, we
   propose an adaptation of the EMMIE framework (created to review and rate
   the quality of evidence on crime reduction initiatives) as a practical
   means of encouraging an evidence based, systematic way of formulating
   policies. We argue that the five components of EMMIE (i.e. Effect,
   Mechanisms, Moderators, Implementation and Economics) provide useful
   dimensions that policy makers can apply to understand, plan and
   formulate successful policies. We suggest the application of the adapted
   EMMIE framework can improve policy formulation and in turn increase the
   likelihood of effective policy implementation and evaluation.},

Title = {The Concept of Anxiety in Ontological Security Studies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {The growing literature on ontological security theory (OST) in
   international relations, ontological security studies (OSS), is
   characterized by great internal diversity. This internal pluralism is
   one of its greatest strengths, but it is also potentially confusing, for
   example, when different works using an ontological security lens arrive
   at contradictory conclusions without it being obvious why. In order to
   make sense of this diversity, this article traces two interrelated
   conceptual divergences related to the notion of anxiety. The first one
   concerns the observation that anxiety is seemingly both debilitating and
   an impediment to action, as well as a call to action, inspiring
   adaptation and change. The second divergence centers on whether
   ontological security is at all attainable, which is largely a matter of
   whether anxiety is best understood as an extraordinary and temporally
   limited condition or as an ever-present and normal part of life. This
   article argues that the divergent answers to these questions, and the
   problems they give rise to, are primarily the result of ambiguity with
   regard to the key concept of anxiety. The malleable nature of the
   concept of anxiety engenders deviating interpretations and applications
   among scholars. While awareness of these issues already goes a long way
   toward making sense of some of the diversity within OSS, this article
   further suggests ways to increase the conceptual clarity of anxiety and
   to address the two issues of change and attainability. Doing so
   increases our conceptual understanding of OST.},

Abstract = {PurposeCorruption and dishonesty in the political and bureaucratic
   realms have impeded the ability of local governments to provide services
   and social justice in Nepali society. In light of this, the purpose of
   this research is to answer the key research question: what are the
   possibilities and limitations of local government in implementing
   constitutionally guaranteed rights in order to transform local
   communities?Design/methodology/approachThis study gathered qualitative
   data from 14 local governments in seven provinces. A total of 56
   in-depth interviews were held with elected representatives, political
   parties, and government officials at both the national and local levels.
   Both open-ended and open-structured questionnaires were employed for the
   interviews.FindingsThe results indicate that capacity is a major
   constraint for local governments, which should be addressed to achieve
   successful local governance, inclusive citizen engagement, and strong
   technical, administrative and fiscal capabilities. Lack of local
   autonomy, political conflict and social class differences, external
   engagement, and conservative hierarchic government bureaucracy are major
   hurdles to growing capacity.Originality/valueThis paper analyses the
   capacity of newly restructured local governments through qualitative
   approach. It attempts to understand to what extent the Nepali local
   governments are capable in delivering the services at the local level as
   closest unit of the citizens.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis article discusses the consequences of unethical leadership,
   particularly, the leader-follower relationship in the delivery of
   agricultural advisory services in Tanzania. It analyses the means
   through which ethical leadership framework can be used to address the
   problem of unethical leadership in this
   context.Design/methodology/approachThe article uses a comparative case
   study design to explain the position of ethical leadership in the
   delivery of agricultural advisory services in two local governments:
   Morogoro Municipality in Eastern Tanzania, and Hai District in Northern
   Tanzania.FindingsThe research shows that the delivery of agricultural
   extension services in Tanzania is guided by formal rules, which define
   the roles and responsibilities of local government officials and field
   workers. These roles and responsibilities are driven by national-level
   guidelines written by the Ministry of Agriculture. The guidelines define
   the key responsibilities of village, Ward and District level
   Agricultural Extension Officers. In developing the working schedule,
   agricultural extension workers at the village and ward levels are guided
   by an annual calendar that defines the seasons of the year and the
   relevant knowledge required by farmers. Nevertheless, the implementation
   of these schedules is compromised by a lack of resources and morale of
   field workers who in turn, cope through charging for the services, which
   is considered as their prime motives.Originality/valueThe findings can
   be of interest to national and local government policymakers and
   officials dealing with the delivery of agricultural advisory services in
   Tanzania.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe article addresses the tension between Corporate Social
   Responsibility (CSR) and the right to work in times of the COVID-19
   pandemic. Accordingly, it explores the operation of corporations in
   adopting policies of mandatory vaccination and the role of the courts
   regarding these CSR patterns.Design/methodology/approachThe article
   examines court case studies of CSR practices regarding unvaccinated
   employees during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel and the United
   States.FindingsThe findings show that the Israeli system adopted the
   regulating for individual discretionary CSR approach, whereas the
   American system adopted the regulating for ethical-public CSR approach.
   Adopting the latter infringes upon the right to work of unvaccinated
   employees. While in Israel, the possibility of compelling employees to
   vaccinate is denied, in the American model, mandatory vaccination is
   possible. As opposed to the American model, in the Israeli model, there
   is an obligation to consider proportionate measures to isolate the
   employees while allowing them to continue working.Originality/valueThe
   article introduces two possible notions of regulating CSR in times of
   the pandemic - regulating for individual discretionary CSR which is
   labor-oriented and regulating for ethical-public CSR which is focused on
   public aspects. While the former posits that corporations should advance
   individual interests of employees and their right to work, the latter
   claims that corporations should advance the public interest in health.
   Following the problems resulting from the Israeli and American cases,
   the article draws on the lines for a suggested approach that courts
   should embrace.},

Abstract = {Households face two politically salient risks associated with financial
   instability. The first risk, which has existed for perhaps centuries, is
   associated with the indirect effect of systemic banking crises on
   employment and income flows. The second risk arises from the direct
   effects of crises on asset prices and thus household wealth stocks.
   Historically, the second risk mainly affected only a narrow wealthy
   elite. We argue that the rapid expansion and financialization of
   middle-class wealth since the mid-20th century mean that many voters now
   have `great expectations' regarding government responsibility to protect
   their wealth. The political risks of financial instability for incumbent
   governments have thus increased sharply, especially when institutional
   constraints hamper their ability to respond to voters' new expectations.
   We show that the probability of incumbent governments facing significant
   institutional constraints retaining office after systemic banking crises
   has indeed fallen sharply in recent decades compared to the pre-1945
   period.},

Abstract = {What role did gender and sexuality play in the making of the 1949 Geneva
   Conventions? And how did the drafters of the most important document
   ever formulated for armed conflict envision men and women's rights in
   wartime? Until now, most scholars have treated these questions only
   marginally. Drawing on multi-archival materials and critical and
   feminist approaches to international law, this article demonstrates how
   the Conventions' drafters tried to recover prewar sex differences as
   part of a much larger sexual restoration after 1945. Instrumentalizing
   the sexes proved integral to humanitarian law's construction in the
   fragile geopolitical landscape of the early Cold War and decolonization.
   Gendering the Geneva Conventions has a special significance for
   practitioners and scholars tracing the origins of international law. It
   exposes how gender has shaped the very nature of international law in
   wartime and offers new perspectives on questions relating to
   international law, global legal politics, and sexual violence.},

Abstract = {Calling for a ``data revolution,{''} the United Nations Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs) seek to promote progress in matters related to
   planet, people, prosperity, peace, and partnerships (the ``5Ps{''}) by
   mobilizing an all-encompassing datafying system that heavily relies on
   quantification. As such, the SDGs serve as a unique window that
   showcases the most up-to-date materials, methods, and forms of expertise
   in datafying practices, while also incentivizing local and national
   appropriation, with all the difficulties this entails. The article looks
   at the policy dynamics around SDG localization and the role of
   participatory methodologies, especially citizen-generated data, in
   Brazil's engagement with the agenda. We depart from interviews conducted
   with various actors involved with SDG implementation, including civil
   society and public servants, and from engagement with the work conducted
   by one NGO specialized in citizen-generated data in the peripheries of
   Rio de Janeiro. Two important findings are highlighted: Localizing
   strategies, i.e., those that aim to take subnational contexts into
   account in the achievement of the SDGs, have been used to promote an
   agenda on rights and, in addition, there has been a strong focus on
   local narratives as central aspects of communicating scientific data,
   where progress on the SDGs is but one vehicle in the struggle against
   statistical invisibility and political exclusion. These findings lead us
   to argue for a politics of care that can change how we do global public
   policy.},

Abstract = {During the first weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic, European Union (EU)
   member states competed over scarce countermeasures. Regarding vaccines,
   a few member states launched exclusive joint endeavours, yet eventually,
   the EU centralised vaccine provisioning. The EU's external vaccine
   diplomacy proceeded almost inversely. After stepping into the breach in
   global health governance, European leadership faltered and global
   collaboration progressed more slowly. This article explores Europe's
   diverging trajectories in the regional and global provisioning of
   Covid-19 vaccines. Focussing on the European Commission's leadership, we
   investigate to what extent it promoted regional and international
   cooperation and with what success. We also explain which factors enabled
   and constrained Commission leadership. Employing a controlled comparison
   and process tracing, we find that Commission leadership was more
   extensive and impactful in regional than in global vaccine provisioning.
   Member state support was the main enabling condition. Without support,
   institutional capacity and resources were insufficient for impactful
   leadership.},

Abstract = {The limited and coordinated use of travel measures to control the
   international spread of disease, based on scientific evidence and
   respect for human rights, are core tenets of the World Health
   Organization's (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHR). Yet, during
   the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been near universal and largely
   uncoordinated use of travel measures by national governments,
   characterized by wide variation in what measures have been used, when
   and how they have been applied, and whom they have been applicable to.
   Given the significant social and economic impacts caused by travel
   measures, analyses to date have sought to understand the effectiveness
   of specific measures, in reducing importation and onward spread of
   SARS-CoV-2, or needed efforts to strengthen compliance with the IHR.
   There has been limited study of the role of national-level policy making
   to explain these widely varying practices. Applying path dependency
   theory to Canadian policies on travel measures, this paper analyses the
   interaction between science and politics during four key periods of the
   pandemic response. Bringing together systematic reviews of the
   scientific literature with parliamentary records, we argue that the
   evidentiary gap on travel measures during the initial pandemic wave was
   filled by political and economic influences that shaped when, how and
   for whom testing and quarantine measures for travelers were applied.
   These influences then created a degree of path dependency that limited
   the capacity of government officials to change policy during subsequent
   waves of the pandemic. This was accompanied by frequent government
   claims of reliance on science and evidence but limited transparency
   about what and how scientific evidence informed policy decisions. We
   argue that, over time, this further politicized the issue of travel
   measures and undermined public trust. We conclude that fuller
   understanding of the interaction between science and politics in
   national decision-making about border management during the COVID-19
   pandemic is essential to future efforts to strengthen international
   coordination under the IHR.},

   Established Political Parties in Germany},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The digitalization of human life has impacted many aspects of politics
   in the last two decades. Intra-party decision-making is one of them.
   While new political parties appear to be rather native digital
   organizations, established parties are increasingly beginning to
   incorporate online tools into their internal processes. However, not
   much is known about how intra-party selectorates evaluate the
   digitalization of a crucial decision-making process. This study asks
   whether party members who participate in candidate selection support
   online consultations-or not. Using an original large-N dataset on the
   preferences of party members attending candidate selection assemblies
   for the German Bundestag, we determine variables that increase or
   decrease the likelihood to support the introduction of online
   consultations as part of intra-party democracy. Our results show that
   attitudes toward digitalization do not depend on a generational or a
   partisan factor, as might have been expected. Instead, we highlight that
   digitalization support is first and foremost related to, on the one
   hand, the seniority in the party, and, on the other, on one's
   preferences toward inclusion. We relate these findings to the
   distribution of powers and incentives within the party and discuss both
   the implications of these results and what they might mean for
   established parties trying to reform.},

Abstract = {This research examines the relationship between populist thinking and
   global crisis-solving motivations concerning climate change and the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from five European countries (Switzerland,
   France, Finland, Greece, and Italy), we test a model where
   crisis-related science skepticism-understood as the defense of
   commonsense knowledge against scientific expertise-mediates the
   association between populist thinking and crisis-mitigation attitudes.
   The results show considerable convergence across national contexts.
   Relative deprivation predicts endorsement of two core components of
   populism's thin ideology, people sovereignty and antielitism. These
   subdimensions of populism are linked to science skepticism, although
   variably across contexts. Science skepticism then leads to a lower sense
   of personal responsibility for climate change mitigation and to negative
   attitudes towards a governmental measure to contain the COVID-19
   pandemic. Findings further show that under specific conditions, the
   populist request for greater democratic participation may mobilize
   individuals to get involved in crisis mitigation. Overall, our results
   highlight the role of politicized common sense in motivating and
   justifying opposition to measures and policies based on scientific
   expertise. We conclude that science skepticism, rather than populism per
   se, explains cynical and dismissive attitudes towards global crises.},

Abstract = {Scholarship about both politics and policy tends to represent tools of
   direct democracy as veto points that are used to prevent policy change.
   In this study, we move beyond this unidimensional view and explain the
   conditions under which instruments of direct democracy can be conducive
   to policy change. We investigate both the direct and indirect effects of
   citizens??? initiatives to show that, under certain conditions, these
   can provide an opportunity for incremental yet potentially
   transformative policy change. We offer a systematic and comparative
   assessment of the policy effects generated by a set of European
   Citizens??? Initiatives (ECIs). ECIs provide an ideal setting for
   uncovering the potential indirect policy effects since they are not
   legally binding. Interestingly, some ECIs had tangible effects on EU
   policies, and these effects materialised over time and at different
   levels of the EU???s political system, and can be regarded as building
   blocks for potentially},

Abstract = {The outcome of the UK referendum on 23 June 2016 was a major political
   event in the history of European integration. A member state voted for
   exit over voice and was on a journey to third country status. The
   objective of this article is twofold. First, it analyses the EU's
   response to Brexit, including the role of process, up to the departure
   of the UK from the Union on 31 January 2020. Second, it explains why the
   EU adopted the approach that it did. The analytical lens builds on
   Kooiman's three governing orders, all of which were deployed in managing
   Brexit.},

Title = {Why Rebels Stop Fighting: Organizational Decline and Desertion in
   Colombia's Insurgency},
Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {207-252},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Objective/Context: Desertion, or the unauthorized exit from an armed
   group, has major implications for counterinsurgency, war termination,
   and recruitment dynamics. While existing research stresses the
   importance of individual motivations for desertion, organizational
   decline, in the form of military and financial adversity, can also
   condition desertion. Organizational decline undermines a group's
   instruments to channel individual preferences into collective action.
   These instruments include selective incentives, ideological appeal, and
   coercion. When the binding power of these instruments diminishes,
   individual desires start to dominate behavior, making desertion more
   likely. Methodology: The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
   insurgency is used to examine this argument with a multimethod approach.
   First, a quantitative analysis employs unique data on more than 19,000
   reported FARC deserters from 2002 to 2017, provided by the Colombian
   Ministry of Defense. Guarding against threats to causal inference,
   statistical analysis indicates that organizational decline drives
   desertion. Second, a qualitative analysis uses a large body of detailed
   reports on interviews with deserters conducted by Colombian military
   personnel. Conclusions: The reports demonstrate that organizational
   decline weakens selective incentives, group ideology, and a credible
   coercive regime, and fosters desertion through these mechanisms.
   Originality: These findings provide key insights for policymakers, given
   that desertion can both contribute to ending conflict and accelerate the
   recruitment of new combatants.},

Abstract = {Improving citizen compliance is a major goal of public administration,
   especially during crises. Although social media are widely used by
   government agencies across the globe, it is still unclear that whether
   the use of social media can help local governments improve citizen
   compliance especially during crises. Based on an original daily panel
   dataset of 189 cities in China during COVID-19, this study provides
   empirical evidence for the positive effect that crisis-related social
   media posts published by local government agencies has on citizen
   compliance. In addition, this effect is mediated by the topic of
   prevention measures in social media posts, and is stronger in cities
   with higher GDP per capita, better educated citizens and wider internet
   coverage. The findings imply that social media is an efficient and
   low-cost tool to assist local government agencies to achieve public
   administration objectives during crises, and its efficacy is largely
   dependent on regional socioeconomic status.},

Abstract = {The ability of trans-national jihadist organizations to exploit war,
   state collapse and geopolitical upheaval in the Middle East to expand
   and consolidate their global networks, is of major concern. This has led
   to a growing literature that investigates the factors that may or may
   not lead to the expansion of organizations such as al-Qaeda and Islamic
   State, but this literature has focused less on the continued agency of
   the affiliate once integrated into the trans-national jihadist
   organization. This article contributes to ongoing debates on
   inter-organizational dynamics within trans-national jihadist
   organizations by using the proxy war literature to explore the factors
   that may foster or inhibit the agency of local affiliates of
   trans-national jihadist organizations. It uses the case of al-Qaeda in
   the Arabian Peninsula to explore how a local affiliate navigates between
   the local and international. Specifically, the article suggests that
   al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula displays substantial agency in how it
   navigates between local integration and its relationship to al-Qaeda
   central. In doing this, the article underscores the need to look beyond
   rhetoric aimed at an international audience to get a fuller
   understanding of the affiliates of trans-national jihadist
   organizations.},

Title = {Redefining Global Jihad and Its Termination: The Subjugation of al-Qaeda
   by Its Former Franchise in Syria},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Abstract = {The globalization of jihad has proceeded in several stages from the
   mobilization against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the 1980s to
   Islamic State's current campaign. The end of global jihad is nonetheless
   less understood, including the conditions in which jihadi groups could
   reject al-Qaeda (AQ) or Islamic State (IS). This article examines this
   question through the trajectory of a former AQ franchise, jabhat
   al-nusra (JaN), that became hay'at tahrir al-sham (HTS) in 2017. This
   article argues that global jihad is not absolute. Global jihad exists on
   a spectrum of four inter-connected dimensions that can be disaggregated.
   In Syria, JaN was only partially globalist when it emerged. JaN's
   rejection of IS and AQ resulted from its opposition to their strategic
   objectives against the backdrop of the evolution of the Syrian conflict,
   which eroded JaN's globalism and made it particularly costly. This
   article is based on extensive field research and interviews with HTS's
   leadership in Idlib and other insurgents that have interacted with the
   group over the years.},

Abstract = {The ways in which collective memories are constructed in the present is
   important in explaining how people choose to commemorate their nation's
   history. The present research focused on the context of Australia Day, a
   controversial national holiday that falls on January 26, which is a date
   that marks the beginning of colonization. We conducted field surveys of
   community members participating in an Invasion Day protest pushing for
   Indigenous rights (n = 219) and community members enjoying the public
   holiday in a public park (n = 174). We found that greater recognition of
   colonial history explained protesters' (vs. nonprotesters') greater
   support for changing the date of Australia Day. Further, protesters'
   lower levels of perceived continuity and higher levels of desired
   continuity of First Australian culture was linked to greater support for
   changing the date of Australia Day compared to the nonprotesters. These
   findings suggest that creating consensus over contested collective
   memories of a nation's history requires greater recognition of the
   ongoing impact of past atrocities.},

Abstract = {Despite the increasing attention paid to sustainability management and
   the wide prevalence of the United Nation's SDGs (Sustainable Development
   Goals) in the discourse of business and society, there is little nuanced
   understanding of the impact of culture on sustainable development in
   international contexts, and on the globalisation of emerging economies
   in particular. By juxtaposing the literature streams of sensemaking,
   micro-foundations, and collaborative partnerships, this paper presents
   an investigation into how culture and sensemaking influence sustainable
   development. Our research context - Chinese globalisation endeavours -
   includes Chinese overseas acquisitions and the globalisation of
   traditional Chinese medicine. This paper illuminates the role played by
   sensemaking and Taoist philosophy with regard to sustainable
   development. Taking a micro-foundational perspective, we show how both
   cultural and institutional contexts can influence sustainable
   development in Chinese globalisation endeavours enacted in the form of
   collaborative partnerships.},

Abstract = {The 2021 legislative elections exacerbated the crisis of political
   representation in the Republic of Cyprus, with important changes in
   voter behaviour yet to materialise in party systemic change. Corruption
   and, to a lesser extent, the pandemic dominated the political campaign
   and added to voter disaffection with traditional political parties,
   including the opposition. The growing appetite for political protest was
   largely scattered among various new parties and platforms, which failed
   to win electoral representation. Traditional parties scored their worst
   results ever and the far-right ELAM nearly doubled its electorate, while
   abstention stabilised at record high levels.},

Abstract = {Although international and domestic laws prohibit child marriage,
   millions of girls are married every year worldwide, a trend only
   aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the turn of the century, the
   global advocacy movement to end child marriage has gained momentum by
   standardizing its framing, using testimonies and symbols to generate
   empathy and mobilize solidarity, and engaging with policymakers to end
   the practice. In this article, I draw on newspaper articles, advocacy
   reports, and interviews with activists in the United States and Latin
   America to identify the reasons behind its success. I also discuss
   several challenges activists are grappling with as the movement evolves,
   including intra-network dynamics regarding the centrality of sexuality
   and the forms child marriage adopts around the world.},

Abstract = {Small Island Developing States (SIDS) ambitiously pursue their
   development agendas while facing resource and governance constraints.
   Global processes like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include
   governance norms with the potential to influence national institutional
   arrangements and policy. National implementation processes are dynamic
   and contest, reinterpret, and/or apply external norms in varied ways.
   Although much of the success in SDG implementation depends on
   understanding these dynamic processes, surprisingly, the question has
   received little scholarly attention. This study explores the power of
   SDGs to act as a broker for sustainability governance. First, I
   construct a framework of five governance norms with nine implementation
   pathways that characterise the SDG governance. Second, using national
   reports to the United Nations, I provide evidence of how SIDS applied
   this framework in the years immediately following the launch of the
   Agenda 2030. In most cases, although recognising their value, states had
   not incorporated the implementation pathways. The findings suggest that
   greater attention should be given to governance capacity-building to
   support SIDS-led sustainable development national agendas. This study
   contributes to discourses on the ability of global processes to improve
   national governance, to the constructivists' norm penetration debates,
   and to debates and policy on SDGs and governance.},

Title = {Complexity and Dissonance: Islamic Law States and the International
   Order},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},

Month = {MAR 12},
Abstract = {It is safe to say that much of international law-the bedrock of the
   international order-has been shaped by the Western legal doctrine. How
   does the Islamic legal tradition relate to international law? What are
   Islamic law states' (ILS) stance toward the global order and
   international relations? This article offers a fresh perspective of
   similarities and differences between international law and Islamic law.
   ILS' patterns of commitments to a number of international treaties and
   institutions reveal a nuanced picture of these states' position in the
   contemporary global order. I bring together the
   English-language-dominated field of international relations and the
   Arabic-language literature on global order and Islamic law. I trace
   Islam's contributions to international law and argue that international
   law and Islamic law share more similarities than they are given credit
   for. However, the inherent diversity of Islamic law and the lack of an
   authoritative body of Islamic international law muddle effects of
   historical cross-fertilization between Islamic law and international
   law. In reality, ILS' position in the global order is not about a
   fundamental clash of values. A much more intricate picture emerges. In
   an important way, this paper sketches an emerging research agenda for
   understanding ILS' position in the modern global order.},

Abstract = {Polarization in the USA has been on the rise for several decades. In
   this context, few observers expect politics today to stop ``at the
   water's edge,{''} as the old cliche goes. But key questions about the
   relationship between polarization and US foreign policy remain to be
   fully answered. To what extent are American ideas about foreign policy
   now polarized along partisan lines? How is polarization changing the
   foreign policy behavior of the US Congress and President? And how is
   polarization altering the effectiveness of US foreign policy and
   influencing America's role in the world? In this introductory article to
   our special issue ``Domestic Polarization and US Foreign Policy: Ideas,
   Institutions, and Policy Implications,{''} we provide an overview of key
   debates and existing knowledge about these questions, highlight
   important new findings from the contributions to the special issue, and
   suggest avenues for further research on this increasingly important
   topic.},

   Processes and Joint Production},

Abstract = {Most early sedentary villages (c. 1500-500 BCE) in the Valley of Oaxaca,
   Mexico, were situated on or near well-watered land. Around 500 BCE, a
   new hilltop center, Monte Alban, was established at the nexus of the
   valley's three arms, where agriculture was far riskier due to unreliable
   rainfall and a dearth of permanent water sources. During the era of its
   establishment, not only was Monte Alban larger than any earlier
   community in the region, but many other settlers moved into the rural
   area around Monte Alban. This marked shift in settlement patterns in the
   Valley of Oaxaca and the underlying processes associated with the
   foundation of Monte Alban have long been debated. How can we account for
   the immigration of people, some likely from beyond the region itself, to
   an area where they faced greater risks of crop failure? One perspective,
   reliant on uniform models of premodern states as despotic, viewed the
   process from a basically top-down lens; leaders coerced subalterns to
   move near the capital to provide sustenance for the new center. Yet more
   recent research has found that governance at Monte Alban was generally
   more collective than autocratic, and productive activities were centered
   in domestic units and not managed from above. Based on these new
   empirical foundations, we reassess earlier settlement and land use
   studies for the Valley of Oaxaca and view this critical transition as
   initiated through coactive processes in which new institutions were
   formed and new relations forged. Shifts in defense, ritual, domestic
   organization, craft production, and exchange all coincided with this
   episode of growth fostered by joint production, which intensified
   agrarian yields through increased domestic labor investments.},

Abstract = {Despite the proliferation of research on public service motivation
   (PSM), fundamental questions about its origins continue to evade
   scholars: Is PSM driven by genetics, socialized through experiences, or
   both? If PSM is socialized, when does socialization occur? Answering
   these questions is critical for reconciling the state versus trait
   debate, and for assessing the validity of practical implications
   prescribed by PSM studies. Utilizing ``nature's own experiment,{''} we
   adopt a classical twin design with 1035 twin pairs to identify how
   genetic heritability, a common environment, or unique environment and
   experiences can explain variation in PSM. Results show that PSM is
   heavily influenced by individuals' unique environments and experiences;
   not by genetics. This lends strong evidence to PSM's uniqueness as a
   motivational construct as related ``other-regarding{''} concepts show
   sizeable genetic components. Finally, our results corroborate that PSM
   is a human resource with dynamic properties organizations can cultivate
   to enhance productivity in public service workforces.},

Abstract = {The world is faced with an escalating arms race in outer space at the
   very time that this vital, if vulnerable, environment is experiencing
   rapid growth in orbiting satellites and the array of services they
   provide. After years of relative stagnation, multilateral diplomatic
   activity is being re-energised, spurred by the revival of debris-causing
   anti-satellite weapons (ASAT) tests. A British initiative has resulted
   in the creation of a new United Nations diplomatic forum on `Reducing
   Space Threats Through Norms, Rules and Principles of Responsible
   Behaviours'. Although geopolitical tensions between leading space powers

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Number = {3},
Pages = {741-765},
Abstract = {When do people care about relative gains in trade? Much of the
   international relations scholarship-and much of the political rhetoric
   on trade-would lead us to expect support for a trade policy that
   benefits ourselves more than it benefits others. Yet, a large
   interdisciplinary literature also points to the prevalence and
   importance of other-regarding preferences, rendering the conventional
   wisdom contestable. We investigate whether and how relative gains
   influence trade preferences through an original survey experiment in the
   midst of the China-US trade war. We find that in a win-win scenario,
   relative gains shape trade opinion: if both sides are gaining, people
   want to gain more than their foreign trade partner. However, these
   considerations are offset in a win-lose scenario where the other side is
   losing out. Relative-gains considerations causally affect opinion on
   trade, but not in a ``beggar-thy-neighbor{''} or even a
   ``beggar-thy-rival{''} situation. These findings contribute to our
   understanding of the role of relative gains in international relations
   and provide the first experimental evidence that relative-gains
   considerations can be offset by other-regarding preferences in
   international trade.},

Title = {The mobile and carceral logics of Haifa Port},
Journal = {POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAR 2},
Abstract = {This article investigates Haifa Port's carceral and mobile geographies
   by examining how Israel is being re-made, rebranded, and harnessed as
   `safe and secure space' for the transits of global capital. The article
   contends with ports as key protagonists of empire, situated in an
   enduring and ongoing history of colonial routes and route-making that
   are raced and moving with/through the transits of colonised bodies and
   commodities. Haifa Port - and Israel itself - are examined as nodes in a
   matrix of global colonial-capitalist relations, moulded to an essential
   geographic rationale, in which everything moves and must continue
   circulating. Yet, in exploring the specific dense and durable
   materialities of Haifa Port - and the racial logics of the settler
   colonial state - the article also works to understand that which becomes
   contained and fixed in particular sites, spaces, bodies, and lives. This
   also helps point to whom and what sits outside them - vulnerable and
   threatening to Israel's participation in global economic circuits and
   orders.},

Abstract = {The rhetoric of populism stresses benefiting ``the people{''} who have
   been ignored by a corrupt elite, whether that elite is political or
   economic. If the reality is to match the rhetoric, then populist
   governments should provide social and economic benefits for the public,
   including healthcare, education, and income redistribution. This paper
   examines the effects of populist governments in the American South
   during the time of the Great Depression on a number of indicators of
   social and economic well-being. The general finding is that the populist
   governments were successful in the short term in producing changes, but
   that these changes were not sustained over time.},

Abstract = {This forum takes up the question of how to do work in Historical
   International Relations (IR). Especially in the past decade, scholars
   have debated what modes of analysis are best suited to this sort of work
   and how Historical IR relates to the disciplines of History and
   International Relations. The contributors to this forum intervene in
   these debates and converge on three issues facing Historical
   IR-questions of methods, ontology, and disciplinary boundaries. We
   outline the convergences and differences among the contributors on those
   points in this introduction, and we conclude by offering a definition of
   Historical IR in an effort to clarify its position within the discipline
   of IR.},

Abstract = {In this article, we use the COVID-19 pandemic to study governance
   through digital technologies. We investigate ???digital contact
   tracing??? (DCT) apps developed in Austria and Norway and find their
   emergence, contestation and stabilisation as moments in which norms and
   values are puzzled through, and distributions of power change. We show
   that debates on DCT apps involved disputes on ???digital citizenship???,
   that is, on the scope and nature of data that authorities are allowed to
   collect from citizens. Remarkably, these disputes were settled through
   the enrolment of a framework developed jointly by Apple and Google.
   Software became akin to a constitution that enshrined understandings of
   good citizenship into technological design, while also being a means
   through which geographies of power materialised. This article
   contributes to literature on technological governance by showing how the
   rising salience of technologies in governance transform political
   geographies and, as a consequence, democratic lives.},

Abstract = {Challenging influential perspectives that downplay the role of shared
   rebel constituencies, we argue that they represent important causes of
   rebel alliances. Yet, we theorize distinct effects for different types
   of constituency. While compatible political aspirations push both
   organizations with a common ideological constituency and those with a
   common ethnic constituency to ally, for co-ethnic organizations this
   cooperation-inducing effect is offset by a cooperation-suppressing
   effect due to their higher risk of inter-rebel war. Leveraging a novel
   dataset of alliances in multiparty civil wars (1946-2015), we find
   support for our theoretical expectations. Shared ideological
   constituencies have a larger and more robust positive effect on the
   probability of alliances than shared ethnic constituencies. Furthermore,
   we find that co-ethnic rebel organizations tend to establish informal
   alliances only, while organizations sharing an ideological constituency
   are drawn to formal alliances.},

Abstract = {Young people's involvement in violent extremism remains a concern in
   many countries, including Indonesia. This study examined direct and
   indirect relationships between indicators of existential anxiety,
   political efficacy, extrinsic religiosity, and support for violent
   extremism. Two hundred and ten young Indonesians were recruited to the
   study and all completed an anonymous online survey containing the
   measures of interest. The findings suggest that indicators of
   existential anxiety are related to greater support for violent
   extremism, but this relationship may be dependent on perceptions of
   political efficacy and religious orientation. Future research could
   explore whether support for violent extremism can be reduced by
   enhancing young people's sense of control and political efficacy.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to examine the mechanisms of the 3 N model (need,
   narrative, and network) by testing a serial mediation model of group
   identity and ideology. We propose two rival hypotheses: need for
   significance predicts violent extremism, and its relationship is
   serially mediated by (1) group identity and ideology (Model 1); (2)
   ideology and group identity (Model 2). To test the hypotheses, we
   conducted a survey of 137 terrorism detainees from prisons across
   Indonesia. The results revealed that Model 1 had a better fit than Model
   2, suggesting the important role of group processes in developing
   violent extremism's ideology.},

Abstract = {Growing reliance on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the effort to
   combat militant groups has led to considerable debate about the
   consequences of this new mode of warfare. While critics have focused on
   the impact of civilian casualties on militant recruitment and the
   resulting use of terrorism, evidence suggests that `drones' are
   paradoxically more effective in limiting civilian deaths compared to
   other forms of military force. This article demonstrates a different
   causal pathway connecting militant use of force to terrorist attacks.
   Drone strikes encourage militants to displace operations to urban
   centers. Confronted with unfamiliar terrain and greater government
   capacity, militants emphasize terrorist attacks against civilians. The
   article explores these dynamics in the longest running drone campaign,
   in Pakistan. While civilian casualties from drone strikes have no
   discernible effect on terrorism, strikes that kill militants increase
   terrorist attacks against civilians in urban settings, while failing to
   reduce attacks on government targets.},

Abstract = {The High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on sustainable development is a
   unique hybrid structure of authority established at the 2012 United
   Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. Its design is conceived
   on the basis of the experience with, and shortcomings of, its
   predecessor, the Commission on Sustainable Development. The underlying
   premise is a grand policy ambition of implementation of sustainable
   development through follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for
   Sustainable Development and the 17 sustainable development goals.
   Approaching its first decade of existence, the HLPF should be a valid
   subject of evaluation. This article presents a review and appraisal of
   its work with a predominant focus on its voluntary national reviews
   (VNRs) process, revealing some of its fundamental deficiencies and need
   for rather radical improvement. Given the magnitude of persisting global
   challenges, institutional limitations and weaknesses surrounding the
   HLPF and ensuing risks associated with the implementation of sustainable
   development agenda, this article proposes alternatives to the existing
   modalities of status and operation.},

Abstract = {The Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan has brought both opportunities and
   challenges for Pakistan. As Islamabad is relieved by India's exit from
   Afghanistan, it continues to worry more about the spill-over of the
   situation in Afghanistan into Pakistan. Among key non-traditional
   security challenges are extremism, terrorism, refugees and drug
   trafficking and Islamabad continues to express serious concerns on how
   the new development in Afghanistan can pose a serious threat to
   Pakistan's peace and security. With a friendly regime in Kabul, however,
   Pakistan has an opportunity to handle these challenges through a mix of
   bilateral and multilateral options. By examining historical and
   contemporary dynamics, this article assesses the seriousness of
   non-traditional security threats vis-a-vis Afghanistan for Pakistan.
   Islamabad's immediate non-traditional security concerns focus on how the
   new developments in Afghanistan will possibly influence religious
   extremism and terrorism at home. Finally, the article outlines policy
   recommendations for Pakistan's engagement in the Taliban-led
   Afghanistan.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the effects of political change on name
   changes of units within central government ministries. We expect that
   changes regarding the policy position of a government will cause changes
   in the names of ministerial units. To this end we formulate hypotheses
   combining the politics of structural choice and theories of portfolio
   allocation to examine the effects of political changes at the cabinet
   level on the names of intra-ministerial units. We constructed a dataset
   containing more than 17,000 observations on name changes of ministerial
   units between 1980 and 2013 from the central governments of Germany, the
   Netherlands, and France. We regress a series of generalized estimating
   equations (GEE) with population averaging models for binary outcomes.
   Finding variations across the three political-bureaucratic systems, we
   overall report positive effects of governmental change and ideological
   positions on name changes within ministries.},

Abstract = {Purpose Drawing on conservation of resource theory, this study aims to
   examine the impact of work-study conflict (WSC) on workplace outcomes
   (job performance, job satisfaction, burnout and turnover intention). The
   study also investigated whether these relationships were contingent on
   the level of supervisor support at the workplace.
   Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected in two-time lags
   from 752 studying professionals (non-traditional students) through a
   convenient sampling technique. Findings Results showed that WSC enhances
   burnout and turnover intention but has no significant direct
   relationship with job performance and job satisfaction. It was also
   found that the relationships between WSC and workplace outcomes, i.e.
   job performance, job satisfaction and burnout were conditional on the
   level of supervisor support. Originality/value The research contributes
   to WSC literature by being the first to empirically investigate the
   direct and interactive effects of WSC and supervisor support on
   important workplace outcomes of those adults who were primarily working
   and then decided to study further for career development rather than on
   full-time students.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 has created significant uncertainty and disruption among
   governments and people across the globe. Policy studies present various
   theoretical frameworks that allow scholars and practitioners to make
   sense of these developments in a structured and systematic fashion. In
   this paper, we combined the collective learning framework with
   documentary data and process tracing analysis to describe, first, the
   features of the COVID-19 collective learning setting in Ghana. Next, we
   explored the linkages among learning processes, learning products, and
   COVID-19 mitigation. We found that diverse policy actors operated at
   distinct levels of government and performed different functions in
   managing the pandemic. Furthermore, we confirmed all three phases of
   learning (acquisition, translation, and dissemination) in Ghana's
   context. Lastly, policies, such as public gathering management,
   mandatory mask-wearing, partial lockdown, and fiscal and tax reliefs
   enabled the government to mitigate the pandemic's impact on people. We
   conclude by highlighting the implications of these findings for policy
   learning scholarship.},

Abstract = {State aid is one of the financial instruments available to EU member
   states for intervention in domestic markets. On the one hand its use is
   prohibited by Article 107(1) TFEU, but on the other hand there are many
   exemptions, including regional and horizontal state aid. Given the
   centralised system for State aid in the EU, one could expect that the
   volume and structure in terms of forms and purposes of public aid
   granted should be similar from one member state to the next. Considering
   the diversity among what are now 27 member states, both from the
   perspective of experience in managing the economy and the directions of
   its development, the objective of this article is to capture and
   evaluate the similarities and differences in the approach taken to State
   aid as an instrument of intervention in two relatively different
   countries - Poland and Finland. To this end the comparative analysis
   will not only cover Poland and Finland themselves but also their
   respective groups of countries - the Visegrad Group and Scandinavian
   members of the EU. The above analysis permits the conclusion that the
   structure of public aid relative to the main purposes of granting
   differs significantly between Poland and Finland, in favour of Finland,
   from the perspective of the achievement of the EU objectives associated
   with the successive economic strategies.},

Abstract = {Objective/Context: What consequences does intra-party conflict have on
   the redistributive reforms of left-wing governments? This article aims
   to analyze the effects of intra-party conflict on redistributive policy
   reforms, highlighting the character of the factions-their ideology and
   connection with social bases-and their role in negotiating the reforms.
   Methodology: It is a case study, which allows characterizing party
   actors and their performance in four reforms of the governments of the
   Broad Front of Uruguay, a fractionalized party. Conclusion: The internal
   conflict was relevant and had a radicalizing or moderating effect,
   depending on the role played by the left and center-left fractions in
   the reform processes. Tension arose from the imperative to coordinate
   the adoption of policies that would reduce inequality and ensure
   economic dynamism. Originality: It lies in showing that, in certain
   cases, party fractions seek to serve the interests of their social base
   regardless of-and in contradiction to-their ideological position. The
   resulting public policy was not strictly the one preferred by the main
   fraction but includes concessions to the consenting fraction when there
   is a certain balance of power between them.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is an attempt to answer the questions: how
   should Poland's policy towards the crisis on the border with Belarus be
   assessed from the humanitarian and human rights perspective? How should
   a country, in this case Poland, behave towards those crossing the border
   of that country, in a situation of deceitful importation and the
   subsequent use of innocent immigrants/ refugees as tools for hostile
   actions against a neighboring state by the authoritarian regime of
   Belarus?
   The article also attempts to answer a question about the challenges
   faced by non- governmental organisations and the important role they
   play in a situation where state policy is at variance with international
   law and basic ethical principles whereby human rights are violated.
   The analysis of the situation on the Polish-Belarusian border, based on
   the assumption that each state has a duty to protect its border, but at
   the same time it has a duty to protect human life and to make sure that
   the law is respected on that border, allows for the conclusion that
   Polish policy is in conflict with international law and basic ethical
   principles. The article also shows the challenges faced by civic
   organisations and the very important role that civic organisations play
   in this situation.},

Abstract = {Vaccination geopolitics is an effort by the producer countries
   characterized by a struggle for access and influence that accompanies
   the export agreements, setting up of manufacturing plants, and
   donations. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated vaccine nationalism,
   United States-China clashes and inequality of access in Latin America.
   This article offers an in-depth analysis of the geopolitical strategies
   emerging around vaccine transactions in the region. Focusing on the
   precedence of geopolitical concerns over health ones, we use a study of
   transaction distribution to analyze the political preferences of the
   United States and the European countries, China, India and Russia. This
   points to two kinds of influence: the Chinese and Russian strategies are
   dominated by offensive and defensive political preferences combined with
   a ground-up economic diplomacy, while those of the United States, Europe
   and India are also offensive-defensive, but the economic diplomacy is
   top-down.},

Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {80},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-27},
Abstract = {Bilateral diplomacy is not a Scandinavian favourite sport, but it has
   become increasingly important in today's world. A number of cases are
   analysed, in which Scandinavian countries have been ``disciplined{''}
   bilaterally by great powers (Russia, China, India and the US). Compared
   to the first 15 years, roughly, after the Cold War, with American
   unipolarity and EU normative power, the Scandinavians have seen a
   narrowing of their freedom of manoeuvre (action space). It is no longer
   possible, without significant costs, to criticise great powers based on
   universal values. In general, it is crucial for decision makers not to
   overstep their state's freedom of manoeuvre. But on the other hand, they
   should not be docile and desist from occasionally challenging its
   limits, also considering their domestic arena. ``Bastions{''} should be
   credibly construed and defended. The limits of action space are
   difficult to discern, but trial balloons, parallel action with related
   countries, or ``lessons of the past{''} could be helpful.},

Year = {2023},

Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {This article investigates how mothers' and fathers' daily time use
   changed across social classes from 1990 to 2013 in Germany. In the
   2000s, Germany's adherence to the male breadwinner model was eroded by
   labor and family policy reforms typical of the adult worker model, which
   assumes individual self-sufficiency. The implications for gender and
   class inequality have been heatedly discussed. Drawing on the German
   Time Use Survey, I find that gender equality in the division of labor is
   greatest among full-time dual-earner couples with standard schedules.
   The prevalence of this pattern increased among the middle- and
   upper-class in historically conservative western Germany, but declined
   across classes in formerly socialist eastern Germany. In parallel,
   nonstandard work patterns and dual-joblessness gained in importance
   among lower-class couples, particularly in eastern Germany. I conclude
   that the adult worker model benefited mothers with access to standard
   full-time jobs but at the cost of greater class polarization.},

Title = {SASCAT: Natural language processing approach to the study of economic
   sanctions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 21},
Abstract = {Existing datasets of economic sanctions rely primarily on secondary
   sources and do not tend to take full advantage of government documents
   related to economic coercion. Such data may miss sanctions, and do not
   capture important details in how coercive measures are threatened,
   imposed and removed. The latter processes often have much to do with the
   domestic politics in sender countries. Understanding these processes may
   be necessary in order to fully account for sanctions' effectiveness. We
   present a natural language processing (NLP) approach to retrieving
   sanctions-related government documents. We apply our method to the case
   of US sanctions. The United States is the world's pre-eminent user of
   sanctions. Our method can be applied to other cases. We collect all
   sanctions events originating in the office of the US president, and all
   congressional sanctions, for 1988-2016. Our approach has three
   advantages: (1) by design, it captures all sanctions-related documents;
   (2) the resulting data are disaggregated by imposing branch of
   government; (3) the data include the original language of the measures.
   These features directly shed light on interbranch delegation, domestic
   (partisan) conflict, and policy priorities. We show that our data record
   more episodes than most existing sanctions' data, and have features that
   other datasets lack. The availability of the original text opens up new
   avenues for research and analysis.},

Title = {Avoiding fallout from terrorist attacks: The role of local politics and

Abstract = {Even though violent attacks resulting in civilian fatalities can be seen
   as constituting failure on the part of the incumbent party to provide
   security to citizens, governments are not always punished electorally.
   Rather, at times, they appear to gain votes following terrorist attacks.
   Here we argue that political parties that can take advantage of their
   local presence to frame and communicate their narrative in response to
   terrorism, can better manage to avoid blame and even to emerge
   victorious in times of violent conflict. The AKP in Turkey is one such
   important example. Our statistical analyses of municipality-level
   aggregate election results show that the party not only maintained
   national incumbency, but even strengthened its predominance in the
   political system in the face of growing security threats. In
   municipalities where AKP controlled the local government and hence
   municipal resources, the party did not lose votes following terrorist
   attacks. This finding remains even when we consider past voting,
   regional variations, competitive districts, and ethnicity. Our argument
   that incumbents can avoid punishment through their capacity to reach out
   to voters at the local level is also supported by individual-level
   survey data and the comparison with neighboring municipalities. As such,
   we highlight how local government control can be consequential for
   national politics, including periods when security dominates the
   national agenda.},

Abstract = {Public support is a key contributor to successful policy adoption and
   implementation. Given the urgency of climate change mitigation, scholars
   have explored various determinants that affect public support for
   climate change mitigation policy. However, the relative decisiveness of
   these factors in shaping public support is insufficiently examined.
   Therefore, we deploy interpretable machine learning to understand which
   factors, among many previously investigated, are most decisive for
   structuring public support for various climate change mitigation
   policies. In this paper, we particularly look at the decisiveness of
   problem definition for shaping public support among various factors.
   Using U.S national survey data, we find that how individuals define the
   issue of climate change is more decisive for structuring public support
   for promoting renewable energy and regulating pollutants to mitigate the
   risks associated with climate change. However, the results also indicate
   that the most decisive factors associated with public support vary
   depending on the types of mitigation policy. We conclude that different
   strategies should be utilized to increase public support for various
   climate change mitigation policy options. Our findings contribute to a
   scholarly understanding of the specific politics of problem definition
   in the context of environmental and climate change policy.},

Abstract = {National identity remains one of the most potent forces in global
   politics, yet surprisingly little is known about processes of national
   identity formation and change. This article argues that national
   identity preferences are susceptible to fluctuations in group status and
   distance but constrained by conflict experience and socialization.
   Integrating research on conflict socialization with social identity
   theory, we hypothesize that growing up during violent intergroup
   conflict socializes individuals into identities and attitudes which are
   durable to significant changes. Conversely, the identity preferences of
   those who grow up during relative peace are more malleable and likely to
   change due to significant events which affect perception of group
   identities. Exploiting the unique political context in Northern Ireland,
   where individuals can legally choose to identify as Irish, British, or
   both, we use a diff-in-diff approach to estimate national identity
   preferences of individuals before and after the EU referendum. The
   results show that 20\% of Protestants who did not experience conflict
   shifted from British towards Irish identity after the referendum.
   However, for those who experienced violent intergroup conflict, there is
   a `durable distance' between groups which constrains identity change
   irrespective of fluctuations in status. The results have important
   implications for our understanding of national identity, particularly in
   post-conflict societies.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the policy problematic of state-citizen
   relationships, reflecting on renewed calls for citizen collaboration and
   codesign in the provision of public services in `new public governance'.
   Analysing this through recent policy reform in Australian public school
   governance, we examine how existing policy architectures - in this case
   school boards/councils - are being rearticulated in relation to such
   calls. Drawing on in-depth interviews with a range of policy
   stakeholders, we examine the diverse policy translations of citizen
   involvement in school governance. Our analysis highlights the
   contradictions and limitations of a school board/council structure for
   policy aspirations of citizen collaboration. While stakeholders welcomed
   school board member (i.e., parent) involvement in governance, this was
   strongly mediated by distinctions between strategic and operational
   decision-making, questions about the possibilities for meaningful
   participation, and tensions surrounding the need for skilled expert
   board members and community representation - particularly in
   disadvantaged contexts.},

Abstract = {This article presents a theoretical model of conflict between two
   parties in a two-sector economy. In a `contested' sector, they struggle
   to appropriate the maximum possible fraction of a contestable output. In
   an `uncontested' sector, they hold secure property rights over the
   production of some goods. Parties split their resource endowment between
   `butter' and `guns' (in the contested sector) and `ice cream' (in the
   uncontested sector). The model predicts that the optimal level of `guns'
   depends positively on the price of `butter' and negatively on the price
   of `ice cream'. Theoretical results are tested by means of a panel
   analysis of sub-Saharan African countries for the period 1980-2017. The
   results show that international prices of manufactures (interpreted as
   the uncontested ice cream sector) are negatively associated with arms
   imports and military expenditure, so confirming the theoretical
   prediction. In addition, world prices of some commodities are positively
   associated with arms imports and military expenditure.},

Abstract = {The growth and expansion of ``Big Data{''} is fundamentally changing
   public service delivery. Big Data is getting ``bigger,{''} and public
   organizations will have new opportunities to cultivate and challenges to
   address. To understand the effects of the growth of data on public
   organizations, we introduce the Public Data Primacy (PDP) theoretical
   framework, which builds on existing scholarship through four
   propositions about data, technology, and its use in the public sector.
   The framework posits that public sector work will become increasingly
   data-centric as data continues to get ``bigger.{''} Ultimately, the PDP
   leads to two predictions about the public sector. First, we predict that
   the primacy of data in the delivery of public services is inevitable.
   Second, this forthcoming reality will require public servants to adopt
   new models of public service oriented around data. The PDP theoretical
   framework provides a systematic lens in which public administration
   scholarship can evaluate the future of data growth and its impacts upon
   public service delivery.},

Abstract = {In this article, I propose a historically grounded, regionally framed,
   and holistically constructed framework and make three interrelated
   claims about the strengths and vulnerabilities of surviving communist
   regimes in Asia. First, these regimes' resilience today has historical
   origins in the communist revolutions that founded not only the regimes
   but also modern nations and states. This foundation provided these
   regimes with ideological, symbolic, and organizational assets that are
   now deployed to continue their dominance. Second, these regimes have
   been evolving together, have come to each other's assistance at critical
   times, and have continued special relationships today; therefore, their
   strengths and vulnerabilities must be examined historically and
   regionally. Finally, in contrast to much existing scholarship that
   focuses only on resilience, I argue that factors contributing to their
   resilience also contain the very seeds of their vulnerabilities. I
   highlight three such factors, including extensive state control of
   resources, ruling parties' ability to manipulate ideologies, and their
   formidable organizations- these three together carry not only their
   strengths but also their specific vulnerabilities today.},

Abstract = {Apocalyptic discourses continue to be central to environmental
   movements, media representations and even establishment accounts of
   environmental politics. At the same time, ecological thinkers
   increasingly argue that the apocalypse is already here: We are already
   living at the end of the world. My aim is to problematise predominant
   notions of time and space in these discourses and, in doing so, to begin
   to chart the contribution of postcolonial theology to environmental
   political thought. I argue that conceptions of environmental apocalypse
   remain wedded to a particular modern, Western interpretation of the
   Christian apocalyptic tradition that privileges a linear notion of time
   over spatial analysis. Recovering space as the lost dimension of the end
   of the world contests received notions of environmental apocalypse and
   it calls for challenging the social, political, and material relations
   of power that constitute its place, thereby contributing to more equal
   and just environmental politics.},

Abstract = {Canadian environmental governance formally began in the 1970s with an
   ambitious vision critical of the status quo. Until the Justin Trudeau
   government from 2015, this vision had been largely eroded when compared
   to the transformative environmental ideas, ambition, and efforts
   initially put forth. Drawing on elite interviews in Canadian
   environmental politics and an articulation of the dominant system, we
   develop and demonstrate a novel explanation for Canada's systematic
   failure to act more ambitiously on the environment. We argue that this
   failure is the result of progressive selection of Canadian environmental
   governance in relation to the dominant system at key selection moments.
   It is at those moments when the environment is least prioritized and the
   economy most urgently needs attention that environmental governance
   suffers the most. The paper concludes by emphasizing how features of the
   dominant political-economic system not typically thought of as
   environmental can have systematic environmental impacts.},

Abstract = {In autocracies facing widespread corruption, the allocation of the scant
   attention available for fighting corruption strongly affects corruption
   control. Although research has found that authoritarian regimes tend to
   fight corruption selectively, it is unknown whether and how autocracies
   allocate attention across different policy areas to combat corruption.
   We propose that single-party authoritarian regimes can steer
   anticorruption attention to the policy domains prioritized by the
   central authority through the mechanism of cross-organizational policy
   coordination. Using original datasets compiled from Chinese governmental
   and procuratorial policy papers from 1998 to 2016, we demonstrate that
   Chinese prosecutors direct anticorruption attention to the policy
   domains accentuated in the central government's major reforms. Our field
   interviews support this finding and reveal possible disruption of
   anticorruption efforts in policy domains falling off the central
   government's top list. Thus, we extend the research on political
   influence over anticorruption agencies and show that single-party
   regimes can instrumentalize anticorruption to serve the government's
   policy agenda, driving the allocation of limited anticorruption
   attention across policy areas.},

Abstract = {The symposium ``Governance Authority in Business and Human Rights{''}
   explores the authority of non-state actors in the global business and
   human rights (BHR) regime. Our point of departure is that the
   involvement of different public and private actors in the BHR regime
   rests on their authority as governance actors. This alludes most
   obviously to companies, but also includes other actors. In this framing
   paper, we investigate these actors' governance authority in three steps,
   which provides insights into the different ways in which their power in
   the BHR regime is (or is not) legitimated. First, we outline how the
   multiplication of actors in the BHR regime raises questions and
   challenges regarding its governance. In the second step, we introduce a
   concept of governance authority that captures distinctive forms of power
   and legitimacy, and how they connect to human rights. Third, we discuss
   how the concept of governance authority can be used to study particular
   non-state actors in the BHR regime, and how the contributions to this
   symposium do so. In sum, we discuss avenues for research that
   disentangle the different types of governance power and legitimacy of
   multiple actors in the BHR regime to clarify their public and private
   roles as well as their relevance in BHR governance.},

   reconstructing the inner lives of interethnic communities in Eastern
   Europe in times of crisis. Focusing on the Eastern Galician town of
   Buczacz as representative of numerous other such communities, it also
   suggests that the events of the Holocaust must be seen within the larger
   context of coexistence and violence since 1914. After briefly examining
   the relevant historiography, the article turns to a close analysis of
   the diary of a Polish headmaster, written in 1914-1922; the World War II
   diary of a Ukrainian gymnasium teacher, and recollections of the
   Holocaust by a Jewish radio technician, composed in 1947. All three men
   lived in Buczacz; all three wanted their accounts to be read by others,
   but they are only now being made available to the public by the author.
   Each provides a strikingly different perspective: that of a Polish
   nationalist educator whose sons were fighting to create an independent
   Poland; that of a Ukrainian activist who resented Polish rule and Jewish
   influence but felt ambivalent about wartime and genocide profiteering by
   fellow Ukrainians; and that of a young Jew who meticulously recorded
   both collaboration and rescue by his gentile neighbors and ended up
   fighting in a local Polish partisan unit. And yet, seen together, these
   personal narratives shed light on aspects of mass violence in that
   region largely missing from more general or nationally oriented
   histories.},

Abstract = {This article examines trends in Uganda's refugee protection model based
   on self-reliance and economic inclusion. It does this through a lens of
   distribution. While self-reliance and economic inclusion are
   increasingly centralised in the international refugee regime as tools of
   empowerment that benefit both refugees and their hosts, policymakers
   largely fail to consider the distribution and availability of local
   resources in promoting these ideas. Between 2013 and 2018, Uganda
   experienced a steep rise in the number of refugees within the country.
   Notwithstanding the global celebration of the Ugandan refugee policy,
   the empirical data demonstrate an increasingly demanding situation for
   refugees' economic lives and ensuing difficulties in pursuing
   self-reliance. Implementing the Ugandan model without distributive
   thinking risks detrimental effects even for neighbouring host
   populations, who are also resource poor. Based on the perspectives of
   both refugees and host people, the article advances a debate about the
   efficacy of Uganda's self-reliance and inclusion policies and concludes
   by pointing to the risks of framing the current Ugandan model as a
   `success' for Africa's refugee protection.},

Abstract = {Throughout Europe and North America, mainstream political parties have
   ceded electoral support to antiestablishment parties from the far left
   and far right. We investigate the hypothesis that individual differences
   in system justification-the psychological tendency to defend and justify
   the overarching social system-would be negatively associated with
   antiestablishment voting, even among citizens who would otherwise be
   inclined to support radicalism. In three large, nationally
   representative surveys conducted in France (N = 14,432), Germany (N =
   1,168), and the United Kingdom (N = 2,337), we observed that system
   justification was positively associated with voting for establishment
   parties and negatively associated with antiestablishment voting. System
   justification was associated with reduced support for antiestablishment
   parties on the right and left-even among respondents who were high on
   ethnic intolerance, opposition to the European Union, economic distress,
   and support for income redistribution. Thus, all other things being
   equal, system-justification tendencies reinforce political moderation,
   establishment voting, and therefore social stability.},

Abstract = {This article explores the mobility infrastructure that enables and
   facilitates trans-national fighters traveling into conflict zones. The
   research on trans-national fighters focuses largely on the departure and
   arrival stages but rarely addresses how fighters arrange and execute
   their travel routes. The acts of border-crossing pose trans-national
   security threats while constituting the transformative processes in
   which individuals adapt to the identity of militant fighters. Drawing on
   studies of clandestine migration, this article uses primary
   multi-lingual materials collected through multi-sited ethnography in
   China and Syria to illustrate how Uyghur jihadists have traveled from
   Xinjiang to Southeast Asia and then to the Middle East. These circuitous
   routes were not made for the purpose of jihadists but assembled from
   existing commercial, religious, and illicit networks and
   infrastructures, intersecting with multiple layers of state and
   non-state actors.},

Abstract = {In the European Union, non-compliance with EU law and uneven protection
   of rights may be caused by differentiated policy implementation,
   potentially creating a problem of legal certainty. A Norwegian `scandal'
   caused by the misapplication of EU law provides a case in point. To
   analyse the case, this article outlines an instrumental, an advocate and
   a conciliatory mode of incorporation, showing how these give rise to
   different assumptions about how agencies incorporate EU law and why they
   sometimes err. Under conditions of complexity, the instrumental mode of
   incorporation may be unable to ensure legal certainty. The Norwegian
   scandal is explained as the result of undue political influence and the
   fact that differentiated integration gives rise to the illusion of a
   national `room for manoeuvre'. Hence the explanatory value of the
   advocacy mode. The conciliatory mode of incorporation recommends itself
   as a way of ensuring legal certainty in complex orders.},

Abstract = {The Liberal International Order (LIO) is under pressure from various
   angles. To account for this phenomenon, a recent trend is to focus on
   endogenous sources of contestation-institutional properties of the order
   that create negative feedback effects. In this article, we seize on and
   extend an endogenous explanation centring on the LIO's political
   structure and institutional design. While existing research stipulates a
   connection between the rising authority of liberal international
   organisations (IOs) and their increasing politicisation, we still lack a
   clear understanding of the reasons behind the growing rejection of the
   order at the level of mass publics. We argue that the LIO's
   institutional setup contains a widening `democracy gap' denoting a
   disconnect between the participatory legitimation requirements for the
   exercise of political authority and the technocratic legitimation
   rationale characterising IOs. By creating a justification deficit, the
   democracy gap incites growing political dissatisfaction and, by implying
   a responsiveness deficit, it turns policy contestation into outright
   polity contestation. We probe the plausibility of our theoretical
   argument in case studies of the EU and the international regimes on
   trade and human rights, and subsequently discuss the analytical and
   normative implications of our argument.},

Title = {Ceasefire Violations: Why They Occur and How They Relate to Strategic
   Decision-Making Processes},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Almost all ceasefires experience violations, yet we know little about
   how such violations relate to the military and political aspirations of
   conflict parties. This article builds on ceasefire and bargaining
   literature to understand why ceasefire violations occur and how they
   relate to strategic decision-making processes. Building on these
   theoretical insights, it proposes a typology of four main types of
   ceasefire violations: strategic violations serve to strengthen the
   military advantage of a conflict party, retaliatory violations seek to
   ensure ceasefire compliance, spoiling violations aim to undermine the
   efforts of leaders, and localized violations are delinked from strategic
   decision-making processes. A case study of a major ceasefire violation
   in the Bangsamoro peace process illustrates how we may use informal
   Bayesian reasoning to empirically distinguish between these different
   types of violations. Treating ceasefire violations as part of wider
   military and political processes enables us to better understand the
   causal conditions under which ceasefire violations occur and identify
   strategic interests of different actors to carry out these violations.
   This helps explain the varied responses to ceasefire violations and
   sharpens our understanding of how to address them.},

Abstract = {Existing international relations literature on the United Nations
   Security Council (UNSC) paints a picture where the United States
   proactively lobbies other UNSC members using carrots and sticks, whereas
   China is quiet, content with its veto power, and acts only to punish
   other members when its core interests are hurt. We add nuance to the
   picture and present a different perspective where China actively
   promotes its agenda among UNSC members. Using newly collected data from
   2000 to 2020, we show that when Chinese leaders visit Africa, they are
   three times more likely to visit a sitting UNSC member country than a
   nonmember country. We obtain similar results when we replicate our
   models on the seminal work by .},

Abstract = {The extraordinary context of the COVID-19 crisis gave governments around
   the world a freer hand to reshape their socio-economic orders. Political
   economists studying East Central Europe have started a debate in how far
   democratic backsliding in the region has ushered in a more authoritarian
   form of capitalism. Our paper examines responses to COVID-19 of four
   anti-liberal governments in the region: Hungary, Poland, Serbia, and
   Slovenia. Incorporating multiple case studies, it assesses the degree to
   which growing centralisation of political power has entrenched different
   mechanisms of authoritarian capitalism, as well as the limits to their
   use in different national contexts.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {In the field of international relations, it has long been believed that
   nationalism generates adverse foreign policy preferences. This article
   revisits this long-standing assumption by investigating how stimulating
   nationalistic sentiments shapes mass foreign policy preferences in two
   contexts, namely when celebrating national achievements and greatness
   with a focus on the national Self and when invoking negative historical
   memories in relation to a salient Other. Using a survey experiment
   conducted in China, which capitalized on visual stimuli drawn from
   real-world sources to stoke respondents' nationalistic sentiments, this
   article shows that not all rises of nationalism are the same. Adverse
   foreign policy preferences, such as a preference for a hawkish approach,
   an uncompromising attitude, and a dislike for the status quo, emerge
   when nationalistic sentiments are stoked by invoking negative historical
   memories but not by celebrating general national achievements and
   greatness.},

Abstract = {The paper provides a case study on how the Orban regime in Hungary has
   dealt with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2020-2021. Despite
   having led worldwide rankings in pandemic-related death rates since the
   second part of 2020, the government was not politically shaken by
   COVID-19. Institutionally unrestrained, the governing majority
   periodically renewed emergency legal regimes to control public
   discourses and curtail the financial resources of opposition-led local
   governments. The policy conduct of the regime is discussed in the
   context of authoritarian populism, which is conceptualized along a
   strategy-based approach to populism. In this, authoritarian populism is
   seen to generate democratic legitimacy for dismantling the institutional
   foundations of liberal democracy and the rule of law. This had been
   happening in Hungary well before COVID-19 kicked in, but the pandemic
   provided enhanced opportunities for this strategy. Meanwhile, fiscal
   policies became increasingly expansionary, signalling a partial return
   to the practice of preelection overspending.},

Abstract = {Citizens' attitudes concerning aspects of AI such as transparency,
   privacy, and discrimination have received considerable attention.
   However, it is an open question to what extent economic consequences
   affect preferences for public policies governing AI. When does the
   public demand imposing restrictions on - or even prohibiting - emerging
   AI technologies? Do average citizens' preferences depend causally on
   normative and economic concerns or only on one of these causes? If both,
   how might economic risks and opportunities interact with assessments
   based on normative factors? And to what extent does the balance between
   the two kinds of concerns vary by context? I answer these questions
   using a comparative conjoint survey experiment conducted in Germany, the
   United Kingdom, India, Chile, and China. The data analysis suggests
   strong effects regarding AI systems' economic and normative attributes.
   Moreover, I find considerable cross-country variation in normative
   preferences regarding the prohibition of AI systems vis-a-vis economic
   concerns.},

Abstract = {This article illustrates the post-euphoric development of the
   environmental movement in the period since 2010 that was marked by
   democratic backsliding and the consolidation of `illiberalism' in
   Hungary. Embedded from a historical perspective that spans the last
   three decades, we present two case studies of urban environmental
   mobilisation and identify `localization', the reorientation towards
   grassroot activism, as a new trend driven by the closure of political
   opportunity structures. Localization combines with the alienation of
   protesters from institutional channels of influence-seeking and the
   weakening of ties with potential political allies, such as political
   parties or professionalised NGOs, and the increase of mistrust between
   the different actors.},

Abstract = {This article makes the case for integrating informal, social and
   minilateral dynamics in analyses of `differentiated integration' in the
   European Union (EU) context. In EU studies, differentiated integration
   has mainly served as an analytical lens for studying variation in
   states' degree of formalized commitment to the European integration
   project or in organizational decision-making procedures across policy
   areas. While this focus has generated important analytical and empirical
   insights, three dimensions tend to be lost when limiting the study of
   differentiated integration to negotiated outcomes manifest in legal
   documents and decision-making procedures. First, informal processes of
   integration precede and concur with formal ones. Second, European
   integration is an inherently social process, and member states integrate
   with the EU identity-building project in different ways and to different
   degrees. Third, member states enjoy heterogeneous social ties with one
   another, routinely forming informal bi- and minilateral coalitions in
   everyday decision-shaping processes. More knowledge about these informal
   and social dynamics can give us a better understanding of how
   differentiated integration manifests itself in practice and where the
   European integration process is heading. The theoretical argument is
   buttressed by data from the 2020 European Council of Foreign Relations'
   `Coalition Explorer' survey, showing how partner preferences within the
   EU continue to reflect stable social sub-orders.},

Abstract = {Although the Equal Employment and Opportunity Commission (EEOC) requires
   that agency EEO directors serve under the direct supervision of agency
   heads, considerable variation exists on whether agencies adequately
   implement this requirement into practice by adopting a formal mechanism
   termed a coordinated reporting organizational arrangement (CROA). A dual
   exposure-informal resolution strategy is proposed to understand how
   CROAs improve US federal agencies' organizational efforts at managing
   workplace discrimination. This logic is statistically evaluated by
   estimating endogenous treatment effect regression models that analyze
   discrimination caseload data from EEOC Annual Reports between 2010 and
   2014 spanning 131 US federal agencies. Consistent with this dual
   exposure-informal resolution strategy, the statistical evidence reveals
   that CROAs not only encourage agency employees to report incidents of
   workplace discrimination, but also augment agency efforts at successful
   internal resolutions of these reported incidents, thus reducing formal
   complaint filings. Yet, the beneficial effects associated with CROAs are
   most acutely realized for those agencies displaying either low or high
   levels of organizational fairness.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long debated whether international organizations (IO)
   matter in international politics. Skeptics argue that power politics
   determine outcomes while champions see IOs as important, independently
   shaping outcomes and reshaping the structure of politics. Between these
   extremes, scholars have made numerous theoretical and empirical
   contributions to understanding under what conditions IOs make a
   difference. Yet, the fundamental question remains: when IOs identify a
   significant problem, can they solve it? We identify an underutilized
   analytical approach to understanding this broad debate. Specifically, we
   suggest scholars analyze this question by focusing on an IOs response to
   given crises to provide internal validity to claims throughout this
   debate. Furthermore, we encourage scholars to move beyond the oft-cited
   global or European cases to better incorporate insights from IOs in
   various parts of the world. Here, we explore the Southern African
   Development Community's attempt to coordinate member states' maritime
   strategy to solve the emergent piracy problem caused by the Somali civil
   war. In identifying these new directions for research, we demonstrate
   that IOs, even under difficult circumstances, are effective actors in
   international politics.},

Abstract = {How bureaucracies respond publicly to policy inputs received in the
   context of stakeholder participation in policymaking provides important
   insights into their reputation-building strategies. We examine the
   European Commission's public engagement with stakeholders' inputs. We
   argue this is driven by its attempts to simultaneously consolidate its
   core, well-established reputation as a responsible policymaker, and
   cultivate a newer reputation as a responsive to public demands
   institution. This helps navigating the challenges of having to find new
   sources of authority and legitimacy (embedded in participatory
   policymaking) while also maintaining its more established ones (embedded
   in evidence-based policymaking). We analyse a new dataset recording
   stakeholders' inputs received as part of the EC's legislative
   simplification programme. We find the Commission prioritised
   strengthening its core reputation over cultivating its emergent one.
   Evidence-based inputs were significantly more likely to receive an EC
   public response and inform its legislative simplification programme
   relative to opinion-based ones. Citizens' inputs were significantly less
   likely to receive a response and inform the programme. Our findings
   diverge from research indicating bureaucracies prioritise defending
   their emerging reputations, highlight the Commission's commitment to
   maintain its reputational and institutional uniqueness in the EU
   regulatory state, and reveal a reputation-building approach akin to that
   of EU agencies.},

Abstract = {Since the Euromaidan revolution, Ukrainian cinema has been experiencing
   a renaissance, associated with both the wave of civic and creative
   activity and the policy of the post-Maidan authorities supporting the
   film industry. The article analyzes the development of Ukrainian cinema
   from 2014 to 2019, focusing not only on organizational, institutional,
   and legal changes but also on the accompanying controversies. It
   addresses the main socio-political, economic, and cultural factors
   influencing progress in the number of films produced in Ukraine and
   their popularization on the domestic and foreign market. The article
   particularly emphasizes the context of Russian aggression toward Ukraine
   and the ongoing war in Donbas, as it influences not only the topics
   taken up by filmmakers but also the priorities of authorities in the
   field of cultural policy. Cinema has become one of the fronts of the
   conflict. Thus, the post-Maidan authorities' concern was both to block
   Russian content deemed dangerous from the point of view of national
   security and to produce and promote ``Ukrainian-centric{''} narratives.
   The last part of the article will discuss the new Ukrainian ``patriotic
   cinema,{''} supported and subsidized by the state, with a focus on the
   role it plays in a society experiencing conflict.},

Abstract = {Despite attempts to bring the plight of domestic care providers to the
   attention of policymakers, there continues to be inadequate regulatory
   protections for unpaid family caregivers and paid domestic workers. This
   article introduces the Global Care Policy Index (GCPI), an original
   scoring system for care-policy comparisons. The GCPI aims to achieve two
   objectives: first, to systematically assess how states' domestic-care
   provider protections match up to International Labour Organization
   policy benchmarks, and second, to incentivise states to improve their
   policy protections for care providers in the domestic sphere by
   harnessing their competitive instincts to improve their GCPI score. This
   article outlines the design and methodology behind the index's
   construction and reports the findings from the pilot phase of the
   project where 29 countries' care-provider policy protections were
   scored. The pilot highlighted key gaps in policy protections for both
   unpaid family caregivers and paid domestic workers and outlined areas
   where carework scholars and activists can focus their efforts. In this
   manner, the GCPI offers a quantitative assessment of a country's
   care-provider protections, allowing for fast and direct care-policy
   comparisons between countries in the same region or with the same
   developmental status.},

Title = {Sexuality,{*} Gender, and the Colonial Violence of Humanitarian
   Intervention},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Abstract = {Recent discussions of humanitarian intervention in international
   relations (IR) have often focused on the evolution of norms, and the
   development and contestation of the responsibility to protect (R2P)
   framework. While beneficial in tracing this process, most of these
   studies tend not to incorporate an analysis of colonialism, race,
   sexuality, or gender. While postcolonial studies of humanitarian
   intervention have done well to illustrate the relationship between
   humanitarian intervention and colonial violence, they still tend to
   neglect the study of sexuality and gender. Exploring how the sexualized,
   gendered, and racialized dimensions of colonialism can be incorporated
   into the study of humanitarian intervention, this paper proposes a queer
   approach. After exploring the valuable contributions of feminist
   scholarship, it suggests that the queer approaches of Nicola Pratt
   ({''}The Queen Boat Case in Egypt: Sexuality, National Security and
   State Sovereignty,{''} Review of International Studies 33, no. 1
   {[}2007]: 129-44), Cynthia Weber (Queer International Relations:
   Sovereignty, Sexuality and the Will to Knowledge. New York, Oxford
   University Press, 2016), and Laura Shepherd and Laura Sjoberg
   ({''}Trans- Bodies in/of War(s): Cisprivilege and Contemporary Security
   Strategy,{''} Feminist Review 101, no. 1 {[}2012]: 5-23) offer some
   distinct contributions that build upon feminist insights. Applying these
   to the 2015 House of Commons debate on airstrikes against ISIL, the
   paper suggests that queer IR can invigorate the study of humanitarian
   intervention with a framework that unpacks the simultaneously gendered,
   sexual, and racial dimensions of colonial violence.},

Abstract = {The question of whether women are more oriented towards peace has been
   debated in the research literature for several decades but has not been
   systematically tested in conflict-driven areas. The aim of our article
   is twofold: (1) to suggest a conceptual framework regarding gender
   differences in support for peace in intractable conflict and test it in
   a prominent case study; and (2) to examine whether major events leading
   to conflict reescalation have differential effects on women and men.
   Across 145 polls carried out on a monthly basis among nationally
   representative samples of Jewish-Israelis between 1995 and 2006, we
   found only marginally higher levels of support for the Oslo Accords
   among women versus men, while conflict-related worldviews-political
   ideology and religiosity-had a much larger effect. Furthermore, violent
   reescalation in the conflict had a stronger effect on reducing men's
   levels of support for the Oslo Accords than those of women. Robustness
   analysis of 196 monthly surveys from 2002 until 2018 examining the
   effect of gender on support for negotiation provided further support for
   our findings. Overall, our analyses indicate that sex-based differences
   play a minor role in explaining attitudes towards peace in situations of
   protracted violent conflicts at different stages, compared to the
   prominent effects of political ideology and religiosity.},

Abstract = {Advances in gender equality and progressive policies are often stymied
   by cultural sexist systems and individual-level sexist attitudes. These
   attitudes are pervasive but vary in type-from benevolent to hostile and
   implicit to explicit. Understanding the types of sexism and their
   foundations are important for identifying connections to specific social
   and political attitudes and behaviors. The current study examines the
   impact of various manifestations of sexism on attitudes regarding
   policies and public opinion issues that involve gender equality or have
   gendered implications. More specifically, we look at attitudes on
   reproductive rights, support for the \#MeToo Movement, equal pay, and
   paid leave policies. In Study 1 we use data from a high-quality web
   panel (n = 1,400) to look at the relationship between hostile,
   benevolent, and implicit sexism, and reproductive rights attitudes, as
   well as support for the \#MeToo Movement. In Study 2 we use data from
   the American National Election Study (n = 4,270) to examine the
   relationship between hostile and modern sexism and attitudes on
   abortion, equal pay, and paid family leave. Overall, these results
   reveal a complicated relationship between different conceptualizations
   of sexism and gendered attitudes, underscoring the need to consider how
   different forms of sexism shape broader social and political views, from
   both a normative perspective for societal change and a measurement
   approach for research precision.},

Abstract = {This article argues that people locked in extreme conditions involving
   life-and-death risks on a long-term basis, often undergo a process of
   `self-heroization'. Self-heroization includes the adoption of a heroic
   ethos and of an `epic consciousness', i.e. people come to experience
   themselves as heroes living out an epic they themselves `write' through
   their actions. The process will be explored at the hand of modern
   armed-struggle revolutionaries. Four closely entangled mechanisms will
   be explored. First, cognitively, the revolutionaries' heroic
   self-understanding reflects their violent and high-risk (heroic)
   lifestyle. Second, the modern revolutionaries' heroic ethos (a hybrid of
   courage and sacrifice; knowledge; and organization) emotionally endows
   them with a fighting spirit that allows them to perform their violent
   work. Third, self-heroization helps revolutionaries coping with their
   physically and existentially challenged, uprooted lives, by forging a
   sense of a higher, more glorious personality. And fourth, the adoption
   of an epic consciousness helps revolutionaries, who are mostly the
   weaker party in the conflict with the state, in boosting themselves for
   victory.},

Abstract = {This article aims to uncover an important yet underresearched governance
   field during the massive wave of internal migration in China. In
   contrast with abundant studies that explore the governmentality of
   migrant workers in urban China, rare scholar attention is dedicated to
   the group of migrant farmers who only move within rural China. Drawing
   on a detailed analysis of governance dynamics of Lianhua village, Hunan
   province, this study finds that migrant famers could undermine village
   governance in the place of destination from three dimensions: by
   disturbing social orders; overpricing or exploiting farmland; and
   paralyzing operation of village affairs. The critical factor deciding
   whether migrant farmers commit such acts is the degree of their
   spontaneous solidarity. This study also finds that implementing
   collective management among migrant farmers in a neoliberal manner could
   help address village governance challenges brought by them but is not
   conducive to their social integration into the hosting societies.},

Abstract = {It has been widely argued that China has prepared for launching
   cyberwarfare against the United States for long time. There are two
   reasons for this. First, the revolution of cyber technology changed the
   offense-defense balance, which will lead to frequent cyber conflicts.
   Second, with the relative decline of the United States and the rising up
   of China in recent years, there has been growing concerns about a
   Thucydides Trap between the two great powers, and cyberwar is very
   likely to happen. However, except for disputes on cyber espionage, China
   showed restraint on the offensive use of its cyberpower. This paper
   argues that China's strategic thinking on cyber offense, defense, and
   cyberwarfare has been evolving over the past decades. Through content
   analysis of official documents and academic writings, this paper sheds
   light on the recent discussions and development of China's cyber offense
   and defense strategy. With China's gradual access to the global Internet
   and extensive participation in the international economic division of
   labor, maintaining the stability of global cyberspace is of greater
   significance to China, and the cost of launching cyber warfare is higher
   and higher. Such findings help avoid miscalculation and maintain
   strategic stability between China and the United States in cyberspace.},

Abstract = {A two-stage game investigates how counterterrorism measures affect
   within-country competition between two rival terrorist groups. Although
   such competition is commonplace (e.g., al-Nusra Front and Free Syria
   Army; Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation
   Army; and al-Fatah and Hamas), there is no theoretical treatment of how
   proactive and defensive measures influence this interaction. Previous
   studies on rival terrorist groups are solely empirical concerning group
   survival, outbidding, and terrorism level, while ignoring the role that
   government countermeasures exert on the rival groups' terrorism. In a
   theoretical framework, alternative counterterrorism actions have diverse
   impacts on the level of terrorism depending on relative group sizes and
   government-targeting decisions. In the two-stage game, optimal
   counterterrorism policy rules are displayed in terms of how governments
   target symmetric and asymmetric terrorist groups. Comparative statics
   show how parameter changes affect Nash or subgame perfect equilibrium
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Purpose Team autonomy is thought to be important for team innovation
   performance. However, the theoretical basis of the relationship between
   team autonomy and team innovation performance is not well understood,
   and previous studies have found inconsistent relations between them.
   Based on motivated information processing in groups (MIP-G) theory, this
   paper aims to explain how and when team autonomy could influence team
   innovation performance from a new team-level perspective.
   Design/methodology/approach Using a two-wave, time-lagged survey design,
   the authors collected data from 340 members of 86 teams in China.
   PROCESS 3.0 for SPSS was used to test hypothesized relationships.
   Findings The results show that team autonomy is positively related to
   team information exchange. Team information exchange mediates the
   positive relationship between team autonomy and team innovation
   performance. Furthermore, the positive relationship between team
   autonomy and team information exchange is stronger with less task
   conflict, which runs contrary to the hypothesis. Additionally,
   relationship conflict does not adjust the impact of team autonomy on
   team information exchange. Originality/value This study provides a new
   perspective to explain the mechanism between team autonomy and team
   innovation performance at team level from the information processing
   approach, specifically, MIP-G theory. It also incorporates team
   conflicts as important contextual factors to answer the call for a wider
   study of boundary conditions in the team autonomy research.},

Abstract = {In Latin America, deep social inequalities coexist with persistent,
   high-level criminal violence. Facing competing needs and budget
   constraints, citizens in the region have to prioritize among different
   policy choices. We analyze how perceptions of insecurity and crime
   victimization shape attitudes toward budgetary priorities in social and
   security policies. Our analysis relies on original data from Mexico and
   Brazil, two countries exhibiting increased violence at the national
   level, albeit with important regional variation. We find that exposure
   to crime takes its toll on citizens' policy priorities. In both Mexico
   and Brazil, citizens who feel insecure seem to prioritize public
   expenditure on the police over social investment policies. Victims of
   criminal violence are, however, mostly indifferent as to budgetary
   allocations across the security and social policy fields, suggesting
   that their spending priorities might diverge from these two spheres of
   government action or give rise to policy indifference.},

Abstract = {The rise of nationalist populism, its challenge to representative
   democracy and the populist impact on the liberal international order
   have emerged as one of the most significant phenomena in international
   politics in recent years. This special issue brings together a group of
   researchers from a wide range of theoretical, disciplinary and
   epistemological backgrounds, including political science, populism
   studies, foreign policy analysis and critical security studies, to
   examine the international dimension of populism and the practical impact
   of populism on foreign policy and international security. Empirically
   and conceptually, it presents audiences in political science,
   international relations and related disciplines with a timely review of
   the scope of research on populism in international relations. Our
   specific aim is to explore and evaluate what challenges a populist
   mobilisation of anti-elitism and anti-globalism presents to both the
   contemporary study of international politics, and the structure of the
   international system and key actors within it.},

Abstract = {This article considers electoral inter-group dynamics in Quebec, Canada,
   by focusing on what White voters expect from political candidates of
   color. While significant work has been done on the use of political
   heuristics such as race or gender-based framing by the media, we do not
   know as much about the way voters interpret and use these stereotypes in
   a political context. In this article, we consider voters' interpretation
   of race-based cues using qualitative evidence gathered in six focus
   groups. First, we explore the content of stereotypes typically
   associated with politicians of color in the province. Second, this
   article provides an assessment of some of the ways in which race-based
   stereotypes are used to understand politics and evaluate politicians of
   color. We find that race-based stereotypes contribute to defining
   expectations regarding politicians' behavior. While voters may
   consciously choose to favor politicians of color, the perception of
   social distance between a marginalized candidate and them can also lead
   to negative cross-ethnic attitudes.},

Abstract = {How robust is public support for extended nuclear deterrence in patron
   and client states? Recent studies have improved scholarly understanding
   of US public opinion about nuclear weapon use against non-nuclear
   adversaries. Yet, there is limited knowledge of public attitudes
   regarding retaliation for nuclear strikes against US allies. We develop
   a theoretical typology of nuclear crises and investigate this phenomenon
   with a novel survey experiment (n = 6,623). Americans, Japanese, and
   South Koreans viewed realistic emergency alert messages about a
   most-likely case for nuclear retaliation: a North Korean missile attack
   on a US ally protected by the nuclear umbrella. Support for nuclear
   retaliation is low in all three countries, with important cross-national
   differences. Favorability increases with North Korean nuclear first-use,
   but it remains limited nonetheless. Surprisingly, US ``tripwire{''}
   troop casualties do not increase Americans' demands for nuclear
   retaliation. These findings have important implications for the study of
   nuclear crises and practice of extended deterrence.},

Title = {Using Data to Create Change? Interrogating the Role of Data in Ending
   Attacks on Healthcare},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {This article explores the non-straightforward role of data about attacks
   on health in creating policy and normative change to safeguard access to
   healthcare and protect healthcare providers in conflict. Acknowledging
   the importance of data as a key component in the quest to reduce
   instances of attacks, we take this one step further, asking: what is the
   relationship between data, action, and change processes? While scholars
   have examined the efficacy of transnational advocacy, rarely has the
   specific role of data been the focus of analysis. Here we consider two
   pathways for creating change: operational change designed to prevent or
   mitigate the impact of attacks on health at the level of those affected
   by attacks, and normative change that leads to a reduction in the
   frequency of attacks, at the level of those perpetrating attacks.
   Drawing on research investigating the influence of data in humanitarian
   decision-making and security management and research on transnational
   advocacy, we discuss the lessons for responding to the problem of
   attacks on healthcare. We end by broadening the scope of our conclusions
   to highlight the non-straightforward role of data in operational and
   normative change processes more generally.},

Title = {Rediscovering Epistemic Coalitions Twenty Years Later: Using the
   International Olympic Committee to Build toward A Literature on
   Epistemic Institutionalism},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Abstract = {This article aims to help the literature on global governance and
   international professionalism move beyond a myopic focus on epistemic
   communities by unpacking the underutilized term epistemic coalition.
   Epistemic coalitions are an international nonstate actor that employ a
   broadened notion of expertise to incorporate business and political
   advocates alongside technical experts. I differentiate epistemic
   coalitions from epistemic communities by synthesizing the international
   relations, organizational theory, and public policy literatures. These
   organizations differ in the breadth of their policy agendas, dynamics of
   internal cohesion, and capabilities to engage in global policy transfer.
   However, I note that it is still unclear how epistemic coalitions
   coordinate member action along different professions and what are the
   conditions under which epistemic coalitions' membership balances will be
   viewed by national elites as professionally legitimate. I then examine
   the role of the International Olympic Committee in US steroid policy to
   induce two preliminary hypotheses that can potentially address these
   gaps. First, epistemic coalitions use a foundational narrative to
   coordinate action among professions. Second, perceptions of equitable
   membership balance stem from an ideational congruence between national
   and international elites. I conclude with how these hypotheses can be
   tested in the future.},

Abstract = {Political ideology is an increasingly powerful force in support of
   public policy. Historically, nuclear energy has found more support among
   political conservatives. This study updates the literature on political
   ideology and support for nuclear energy by examining how political
   ideology is associated with perceptions of nuclear energy and trust of
   nuclear information sources. After excluding participants with
   incomplete data, and participants within 50 miles of a nuclear reactor,
   the analytical sample size for the analysis examining political ideology
   and perceptions of nuclear energy was 4153. The analytical sample
   includes a total of 1035 participants within a 50-mile radius of INL,
   710 participants from within Idaho who lived further than 50 miles from
   INL, 1899 participants from other states (more than 50 miles from a
   nuclear reactor), and 509 Non-Idaho participants living within 50 miles
   of a nuclear reactor. Logistic regression was used to determine how
   political ideology was associated with perceptions of nuclear energy and
   trust in different sources regarding radioactive waste, after
   controlling for demographics and location. While liberal participants
   near INL were less favorable towards nuclear energy, and more trusting
   in impact scientists to tell the truth about radioactive waste than
   their conservative counterparts, this was not consistent across the US.
   Our findings reveal the complexity of political ideology and the
   perceptions of nuclear issues and how proximity influences perceptions.
   The perceptions of political moderates were particularly important in
   providing a more complex understanding of political ideology and nuclear
   energy issues.},

Abstract = {Emerging technologies provide new opportunities for terrorist
   organizations. Future terrorists may use multiple drones-either en masse
   or coordinated with each other in cruder or more sophisticated ways-to
   cause harm, potentially at scale. This study explores the topic via
   theoretical exploration and threat assessment. The first half explores
   relevant literatures on terrorist innovation; suicide bombing; airpower;
   and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) terrorism.
   The second half builds on the literature review to provide a systematic,
   albeit preliminary, threat assessment, examining the threat as a
   function of motivations and capabilities, and elucidates the
   characteristics of groups that may be drawn to this technology. Policy
   recommendations to ameliorate this emerging threat conclude.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to explore the establishment of diplomatic
   representation as a measure of de facto recognition by other state units
   and to explain its causes in the ``long 19th century{''} (1817-1914) and
   the post-World War II (WWII) era (1950-2000). Drawing on the Correlates
   of War diplomatic exchange data, the article explores the underlying
   drivers of dyadic acts of recognition in two series of logistic
   regression analyses, one for each time period. The results indicate
   that, also when taking alternative explanations into account,
   recognition of other states in the international system was in the 19th
   century at least based on one general principle: that of recognizing
   other de facto states. In the post-WWII era, contrary to expectations,
   this principle was still in effect. De facto statehood can thus be
   argued to constitute a rather stable norm for recognition in the
   international system.},

Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Globalization is facing widespread condemnation at a time when worldwide
   crises ranging from climate change to pandemic policy increasingly
   demand a coordinated response. Rising nationalist, populist, and
   anti-globalization movements in many of the world's richest nations are
   placing great pressure on the international system pioneered by Western
   democracies following World War II. This special issue showcases new
   research on the sources and types of backlash. It also considers the
   consequences of this backlash for democracy, for international
   institutions and foreign policy. We aim to broaden the debate on the
   causes and consequences of rising populism and nationalism and offer
   unique perspectives on how and why the current international order is
   struggling to address the many global challenges in need of large-scale
   cooperative solutions.},

Abstract = {The comparative study of atrocities and atrocity prevention faces
   several obstacles including a lack of consensus on the universe of cases
   and too few cases to statistically test alternative theories. The
   brutality-based (BB) conception is based on the idea that widespread,
   state-led violations of physical integrity rights constitute an assault
   on the personhood and human dignity of the members of society- a mass
   atrocity. Applying this idea to all countries annually systematically
   identifies a larger number of atrocities and facilitates categorization
   into three levels of intensity. The BB methodology for generating annual
   atrocity lists is replicable and transparent. The findings show that,
   between 1981 and 2019, the frequency of atrocities as defined and
   identified by other projects has been decreasing, but BB atrocities have
   been increasing. The sequence of different types of widespread physical
   integrity violations suggests new avenues for research on atrocity
   occurrence, escalation, de-escalation, and cessation.},

Abstract = {The emergence of the novel coronavirus has put societies under
   tremendous pressure to instigate massive and rapid behavior change.
   Throughout history, an effective strategy to facilitate novel behaviors
   has been to morally condemn those who do not behave in an appropriate
   way. Accordingly, here, we investigate if complying with the advice of
   health authorities-for example, to physically distance or vaccinate-has
   emerged as a moralized issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Study 1,
   we rely on data (N = 94K) from quota-sampled rolling cross-sectional
   online surveys from eight countries (Denmark, Sweden, Germany, France,
   Italy, Hungary, the United Kingdom, and the United States). We find that
   large majorities find it justified to condemn those who do not keep a
   distance to others in public and around half of respondents blame
   ordinary citizens for the severity of the pandemic. Furthermore, we
   identify the most important predictors of condemnation to be behavior
   change and personal concern, while institutional trust and social
   distrust also play large but less consistent roles. Study 2 offers a
   registered replication of our findings on a representative sample of
   Britons (N = 1.5K). It shows that both moralization and condemnation of
   both vaccination and general compliance are best predicted by
   self-interested considerations.},

Abstract = {The `international', the `global', the `world' have become different
   ways of characterising what it is IR as a field studies. The semantic
   change signals two dynamics. Firstly, the assumption being that the
   international has to be replaced or `superseded' with another concept
   since either the `international' never did or at present does not
   reflect the `reality' of what exists out there, which presupposes an
   exact relationship between the signifier and the signified. The second
   point following from that is the prescription of a development into the
   `change' in the words whereby a `better' descriptor has to be assigned
   that is presented as being not only larger in scale but also more
   progressive. The article argues that the anxieties with respect to the
   object of study of the field of IR stem from contradictions inherent in
   the concept of the international, which are not specific to it but are
   rooted in the way disciplinary knowledge was established and as such
   cannot be addressed solely through a replacement/superseding. The first
   section of the article will discuss how disciplinary knowledge was
   constructed and organised through Wallerstein's concept of TimeSpace
   which explains the formation of disciplinary knowledge along three axes:
   past/present, West/non-West and autonomous domains. The second section
   will discuss how the three axes of past/present, West/non-West and
   autonomous domains worked in creating the contradictions of the
   international. The third section then focuses specifically on what it
   means to bring in the `global' to overcome contradictions of the
   international and how the global continues to reproduce the
   contradictions of the international.},

Abstract = {Utilizing social media profiles, court documents and media reports, this
   article analyzes the Malaysian foreign fighter networks in Iraq and
   Syria between 2012 and 2019. It is found that the Malaysian foreign
   fighter phenomenon is primarily driven by charismatic personalities,
   i.e. influential figures who were able to attract individuals into the
   Middle East. The attempted movement of fighters into Iraq and Syria can
   be divided into three phases corresponding to three personalities; the
   first led by Al Qaeda linked Yazid Sufaat, the second by Ajnad al-Sham
   linked Lotfi Ariffin and the third by Islamic State (IS) linked Muhammad
   Wanndy Mohd Jedi. Contrary to popular belief, the first wave of
   Malaysian militants had joined Syrian-based rebel groups like Ajnad
   al-Sham instead of IS with the shift occurring after Lotfi Ariffin's
   death in September 2014. The three phases also highlight the shift in
   recruitment strategy from physical recruitment to the purely online
   sphere. A radicalization driver model of Malaysian fighters is proposed
   and it is argued that the two main factors that drove Malaysian fighters
   into the conflict zones are i) External factors: charismatic
   personalities; romanticization of jihad; moral factors and ideological
   factors; and ii) Internal factors: discontent with the government.},

Abstract = {Al-Qaeda's interactions with the Taliban have often been marked by
   mutual suspicion and mistrust, but both groups have adopted robust and
   ultimately successful approaches to manage these tensions. In
   particular, the relationship survived turbulent episodes from 2001 to
   2011, and the two groups coordinated during the run-up to the Doha
   Agreement. This suggests that although al-Qaeda's relationship with the
   Taliban may remain fraught, it will endure. It is unclear whether the
   Taliban will allow the group to use Afghan territory to support
   transnational terrorist operations. But the Taliban will likely be
   unable or unwilling to constrain al-Qaeda's regional and international
   ambitions, and therefore will probably be a highly unreliable partner in
   any effort mounted by outside powers to do so.},

Journal = {SURVIVAL},

Volume = {64},

Pages = {49-66},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {During the 2016 US presidential campaign, candidate Donald Trump
   suggested the United States could benefit from a more unpredictable
   foreign policy. The assassination of Iranian Major-General Qasem
   Soleimani by US forces in 2020 during the Trump administration may be
   the best recent example of this doctrine in action. Other American
   presidents, including John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton,
   have applied it in different ways. Historical comparisons of its use in
   the Cuban Missile Crisis and the conflicts in Vietnam and Kosovo suggest
   that the expected liabilities of the strategy outweigh any likely gains.
   Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to be seeking to establish
   strategic unpredictability by threatening NATO with nuclear escalation
   should it interfere heavily in Russia's war in Ukraine. This threat,
   however, has not deterred NATO from providing effective assistance to
   Ukraine. Policymakers should be deeply sceptical about the benefits of
   strategic unpredictability.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a critical assessment of the Sustainable Governance
   Indicators (SGI) and compares it with other prominent indices that
   address specific components of governance: V-Dem, WGI, and BTI. We offer
   a comparative assessment of content validity of these governance
   measures, their data generation processes, and their convergent
   validity. We conclude that the SGI's most important contribution is the
   conceptualization of policy performance as a discrete index. Other
   relative strengths are the theoretical embeddedness and the exclusion of
   irrelevant meanings of governance, and the conceptualization of three
   governance components (Governance, Policy Performance, and Democracy).
   However, in terms of geographic and temporal coverage, the SGI is
   clearly inferior to WGI and V-Dem. The handling of third-party
   statistical data, the absence of uncertainty scores, and the
   (a-theoretical) aggregation of different indicators are additional
   shortcomings of the SGI. Finally, the SGI's iterative process of expert
   deliberation has merits but is prone to biases.},

Abstract = {Multilateral trust funds have become an increasingly prominent funding
   mechanism in international development. Yet marked differences exist in
   the extent to which donors support trust funds. In this study, we argue
   that differential support for trust funds originates in donor domestic
   politics. Specifically, it results from differences in national
   bureaucratic rulebooks that incentivise aid officials to support trust
   funds more or less. Because trust funds place a high premium on
   performance and results, aid officials from donor countries whose aid
   bureaucracies are set up to promote performance and results are more
   likely to support trust funds than their counterparts from aid
   bureaucracies that are less performance-oriented. We find robust support
   for differential use of trust funds in terms of incidence of usage, type
   of preferred fund and outsourcing behaviour, drawing on a data set of
   World Bank trust funds. Our project contributes to the understanding of
   international development cooperation by mapping donor political
   economies to the rise of trust fund usage. We also contribute to a
   better understanding of the global diffusion of performance-based
   evaluation.},

Abstract = {Sanctions are widely used foreign policy tools in reaction to crises in
   world politics. Accordingly, literature on sanction effectiveness-their
   intended consequences-is abundant. Yet, fewer studies address the
   unintended consequences of restrictive measures. This is remarkable
   given that negative externalities are well documented. Our article
   explores this phenomenon by asking under which conditions sanctions
   yield negative externalities. We develop a theoretical conceptualization
   and explanatory framework for studying the unintended consequences of UN
   sanctions. Empirically, we draw on data from the rich, but scarcely used
   Targeted Sanctions Consortium and apply qualitative comparative analysis
   (QCA) to examine negative externalities of UN sanctions, complemented by
   illustrations from the cases Haiti and North Korea. The results document
   the existence of multiple pathways toward unintended consequences,
   highlighting the negative impact of comprehensive and long-lasting
   sanctions, as well as the ability of autocratic targets with economic
   means to persist unscathed from sanctions.},

Abstract = {Why do exercises in collaborative governance often witness more impasse
   than advantage? This paper suggests putting power at center stage and
   focusing the analysis on the micro level. It is by looking at the daily
   `minutiae' of collaboration, and at the dynamics (here called flows of
   power) that they set off, that we can gain insights into failures of
   collaborative arrangements. To enable a power-sensitive and
   process-oriented analysis of collaborative governance, the paper
   develops an analytical framework for the empirical exploration of
   collaborative governance at the micro level. The framework examines how
   design choices at the outset of collaboration are re-interpreted,
   challenged, and transformed by micro-dynamics taking place over the
   course of the arrangement. The article argues that a process-oriented
   investigation of how collaboration evolves and unfolds over time
   elucidates the subtleties of power, which may be overlooked if we only
   consider outcomes rather than the processes that engender these
   outcomes. The work is based on an abductive research approach and
   illustrates the analytical possibilities of the framework by zooming in
   on an exemplar of a collaborative arrangement for planning the route of
   a high-voltage electricity line in Germany.},

Abstract = {This article develops the concept of racialized burdens as a means of
   examining the role of race in administrative practice. Racialized
   burdens are the experience of learning, compliance and psychological
   costs that serve as inequality reproducing mechanisms. To develop this
   concept, we examine administrative burdens in the US state from the
   theoretical perspective of racialized organizations. Using examples from
   attempts to access citizenship rights-via immigration, voting and the
   social safety net-we illustrate some key points. First, racialized
   burdens combine control of access to resources and ideas about racial
   groups in ways that typically disadvantage racially marginalized groups.
   Second, while still promising fair and equal treatment, racially
   disproportionate burdens can be laundered through facially neutral rules
   and via claims that burdens are necessary for unrelated reasons. Third,
   racialized burdens emerge when more explicit forms of racial bias in
   policies or administrative practices become illegal, politically
   untenable or culturally unacceptable. Racialized burdens neatly carry
   out the ``how{''} in the production of racial inequality while
   concealing, or providing an alibi for, the ``why.{''}},

Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},

Abstract = {This article explores discursive legitimation of intensified
   conditionality in Australian social security policy, by the association
   of responsible consumption with a revised construction of Australian
   identity. Discursive rationalization of the use of cashless debit cards
   to constrain consumption choices by citizens is situated in
   representations of Australian identity and social citizenship. Against
   growing empirical evidence of a lack of conclusive efficacy and emergent
   social harms, political rationalizations for the card's introduction
   assert a normative Australian way of life that frames card users as
   `flawed consumers,' lacking in the characteristics of imagined
   Australian citizenship. The compatibility of this imagined Australian
   identity with the values of market liberalism completes the substitution
   of market citizenship for its antecedent welfare state conception of
   citizenship based on rights. In this substitution, the idea of a right
   to social protection is subordinated to conditional support that
   promotes the sentiment that social welfare is `un-Australian.'},

Abstract = {Four studies show that Democrats overestimate the explicit prejudice
   reported by the American electorate, leading them to perceive
   presidential candidates from disadvantaged groups as less electable.
   Study 1 (MTurk; n = 728) found that Democrats overestimated the
   percentage of Americans who say they would not vote for presidential
   candidates from disadvantaged groups. Study 2 (MTurk; n = 597)
   replicated this finding and demonstrated that Democrats who perceive
   high levels of explicit prejudice toward a group also believe
   presidential candidates from that group are less electable. Moreover,
   Democrats who more frequently interacted with Republicans were more
   accurate in estimating the amount of explicit prejudice reported by
   Republicans, Democrats, and Americans in general. Studies 3A (Prolific;
   n = 930) and 3B (YouGov; n = 747) found that presenting information
   about true levels of reported prejudice made Democrats believe generic
   presidential candidates from disadvantaged groups would be more
   electable. We did not find evidence that information about true levels
   of reported prejudice affected Democrats' beliefs about the electability
   of specific candidates in the 2020 Democratic Primary or their support
   for these candidates.},

Abstract = {Lobbying is considered to be a legitimate feature of democratic systems,
   but a question arises concerning the methods used to influence
   decision-making processes in these systems; the behaviour of lobbyists
   and decision-makers can be non-transparent, and it unfairly influences
   political processes. These accompanying phenomena significantly affect
   institutional quality. In this paper, we define the link between
   transparent decision making and a transparent lobbying environment, we
   provide a new set of indicators for a more precise assessment of the
   transparent lobbying environment in Catalogue of Transparent Lobbying
   Environment and we demonstrate the differences between our approach of
   evaluating transparent lobbying and existing methods for six CEE
   countries empirically. Finally, we address institutional quality and its
   evaluation in connection with transparent lobbying and demonstrates the
   potential of the catalogue. We argue that a transparent lobbying
   environment should be analyzed in the broader context of the
   decision-making process and is essential for institutional quality. In
   this respect, our approach emphasises implementing the so-called
   sunshine principles to improve current methods of evaluation of
   transparent lobbying.},

Abstract = {Accountability in collaborative governance comprises a tangled web of
   vertical and horizontal accountability relationships. Although different
   accountability mechanisms are apparently complementary, they also clash
   with each other, producing serious accountability tensions. This study
   explores how actors in collaborative governance experience and manage
   conflicting accountability demands in the context of a Korean
   interorganizational network. Using qualitative data based on in-depth
   interviews with 32 personnel across 10 organizations and document
   analysis, the study identifies different types of accountability
   tensions and actors' strategic responses to them. The analysis reveals
   that accountability tensions vary across the sources of the demand, and
   they are more likely to emerge when there are gaps in procedural and
   institutional arrangements or differences in collaborators' commitment
   levels. Findings suggest that accountability tensions inherent to
   collaborative networks, when harnessed and actively managed, may be
   viewed as opportunities for advancing the whole network's mission and
   improving network accountability. Based on these findings, the study
   proposes a novel framework for accountability tensions in collaborative
   governance with propositions about the mechanisms through which
   accountability tensions emerge and are managed. The study provides
   insights into the complexities of maintaining accountability in
   cross-sector, multi-actor networks.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explain variation in the EU's influence on
   specific issues negotiated in international environmental forums.
   Analysing twelve issues in the United Nations Environment Assembly, the
   Convention on Biological Diversity as well as the Basel, Rotterdam and
   Stockholm Conventions, the paper identifies combinations of conditions
   that explain the EU's level of influence. Through a qualitative
   comparative analysis, it studies the impact of the EU's ambition,
   flexibility and isolation on the EU's influence. It finds a high
   ambition combined with a low isolation as a key explanation of the EU's
   high influence. For the EU's low level of influence, a variety of causal
   paths are possible, such as a low ambition combined with a low degree of
   flexibility. The paper's primary data source are interviews with EU
   delegates, who were closely involved in the negotiations.},

Title = {``Let Us All Enjoy the Fish{''}: Alternative Pathways and Contingent
   Histories of Collective Action and Governance Among Maritime Societies
   of the Western Peninsular Coast of Florida, USA, 100-1600 CE},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {Ethnographers have ably documented the great extent and diversity of
   social institutions that contemporary fishers and shellfishers employ to
   collectively manage common property resources. However, the collective
   action regimes developed among ancient maritime societies remain
   understudied by archaeologists. We summarize research into the
   development and form of collective action among the maritime societies
   of the western peninsular coast of Florida, USA, drawing on our own
   recent work in the Tampa Bay area and previous work elsewhere in the
   region, especially the Calusa area to the south. Archaeological evidence
   suggests that collective action became more important in Tampa Bay in
   the first centuries CE, probably owing to a marine transgression that
   resulted in more productive estuaries. Groups here staked claims to
   productive estuarine locations through the founding of villages, the
   building of mounds, and the construction of relatively simple marine
   enclosures. Historically, these changes resulted in societies of
   relatively small scale and limited authoritarian government. In
   contrast, collective action developed later in the Calusa area, may have
   begun in relation to resource scarcity than plenty, and may been founded
   in kinship rather than in public ritual. Collective action in the Calusa
   area resulted in projects of greater scale and complexity, providing a
   foundation for more hierarchical and authoritarian social formations.},

Title = {MATCHED SAMPLING METHODOLOGY RECONSIDERED: THE ROLE OF TRUST IN STUDYING
   REMITTANCE TRANSFERS BETWEEN GHANAIAN IMMIGRANTS IN THE UK AND THEIR
   RELATIVES IN GHANA},

Abstract = {Matched sampling methodology (MSM) has been used in remittance studies
   to understand remittance transfers. However, a detailed examination of
   the role of trust as a central element in producing reliable and valid
   research conclusions when a matched sample methodology is used has been
   missing in the literature. This paper fills this lacuna by arguing that
   cultivating trust in matched sampling research on remittance transfers,
   a sensitive subject matter, between African immigrants and their
   relatives presents a more nuanced narrative of remittance transfers.
   This approach shows that not only do African immigrants in the `Global
   North' send remittances back home, but immigrants also receive
   remittances (reverse remittances) from their relatives on the continent.
   Using remittance research conducted among Ghanaian immigrants in the UK
   and their relatives in Ghana, this article identifies three `avenues of
   trust'-'public avenues of trust', `intermediate avenues of trust', and
   `private avenues of trust'-to highlight the processes and challenges
   that researchers encounter while establishing contact with research
   participants and the role that trust plays in gathering accurate
   information. Focusing on the role of trust in MSM is in line with recent
   theoretical paradigms of remittance research that call for soliciting
   information from both origin and destination countries.},

Abstract = {This essay critically assesses the Tianxia Theories, a line of
   indigenous International Relations (IR) theorizing in China organized
   around the concept of Tianxia ('all-under-heaven'). My goal is to tackle
   a seemingly prevalent issue among non-Western IR theories, that is, the
   indigenous scholars' subservience to state cues and often uncritical
   attitude toward their own ethnocentrism. To that end, I strategically
   target a recent contribution to this scholarship that explicitly seeks
   to articulate a non-ethnocentric theory: Xu Jilin's New Tianxia-ism (xin
   tianxia zhuyi). I first examine the main thesis of New Tianxia-ism to
   reveal its internal tensions. Then I examine what enables the
   formulation of New Tianxia-ism from a discursive perspective. I argue
   that a particular subject position, to which I refer as the `Sinocentric
   Subject', plays an instrumental role in enabling contemporary Chinese
   intellectuals to think along the logics of New Tianxia-ism. The result,
   however, undermines the agenda to articulate an alternative theory that
   rectifies the ethnocentrism in IR. In conclusion, I suggest that Chinese
   indigenous scholarship ought to engage more critically the ideological
   inclination and the politics of knowledge within its own epistemic
   community.},

Abstract = {The arrival of large numbers of refugees in Germany since 2015 has led
   to unprecedented levels of civic participation in service delivery. This
   is supported in integration policy, including through local
   coordination. We connect this empirical case with the conceptual debate
   on co-production, adopting an interpretive approach. We explore how
   volunteers and local coordinators interpret encounters between civic and
   state actors in the context of co-producing support received by refugee
   families in gaining access to childcare. Based on 20 interviews, we
   distinguish three types of experiences: collaborating towards common
   aims, where both sides value collaboration based on complementary
   abilities; contesting exclusion, where volunteers confront state actors
   in cases of conflict; replacing services, where volunteers feet obliged
   to perform tasks they interpret as the state's responsibility. Our
   findings illustrate the value and limitations of co-production in
   practice, including in relation to establishing adequate sharing of work
   between civil and state actors.},

Abstract = {Although public discussion about the economic crisis of the late 2000s
   to mid-2010s in Southern Europe often refers to its impact on the
   region's younger citizens, not enough attention has been given to the
   political consequences of the crisis on the young. Focusing on the cases
   of Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, this introduction to the special
   issue on age-related rifts in post-crisis Southern Europe offers an
   overview of the contributions and an initial answer to the question: to
   what extent and in what areas can one talk about an emergent
   generational divide in the region? Findings point to some tangible but
   uneven effects of the crisis across the four countries, mostly in the
   sense of accentuating pre-existing contrasts.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a theory of the relationship between policy
   disasters and political institutions. Policy disasters, defined as
   avoidable, unintended extreme negative policy outcomes, are important
   political, and historical events above that receive relatively little
   attention from political scientists and scholars of public policy. Using
   the predictions of punctuated equilibrium theory, I argue that systems
   with higher error accumulation will experience more policy disasters.
   Systems with more veto players and weaker information flows will
   experience more policy disasters, but information flows will have a
   stronger impact than veto players. I test this theory using data on
   financial crises and natural and technological disasters across 70
   countries over 60 years. I find strong evidence that systems with weaker
   information flows and more veto players tend to have greater policy
   disaster risk.},

Abstract = {As President of the United States, Donald Trump's decision to recognise
   Jerusalem as the capital of Israel served to heighten tensions in the
   Middle East and instantly undermined his stated goal of bringing peace
   to the troubled region. This paper will argue that there are important
   lessons to be gained from the political process in Northern Ireland to
   help bolster a peace process in the Middle East. Through an analysis of
   Unionist politics pre- and post- the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the paper
   will argue that there is a need to not only encourage militants to make
   peace, but also to incentivise regional hegemons into meaningful
   negotiations. The paper will highlight the important role played by
   international hegemonic powers as they seek to create a Strategically
   Benefical Moment for all sides in the conflict as they seek to `ripen'
   the conditions for peace.},

Abstract = {Sexual violence by armed groups is common in civil wars. Qualitative
   studies have shown that victims and their families experience social
   stigmatization. Stigmatization is viewed as a central mechanism to
   social exclusion and disintegration impeding post-conflict social,
   political, and economic recovery. We provide new theory on the social
   conditions under which rape-related stigma intensifies and decreases.
   Drawing on an original population-based survey in eastern Democratic
   Republic of Congo, we find that victims and their families experience
   higher levels of stigma compared to unaffected families and these
   effects are dependent on community attitudes and norms. Furthermore, we
   find that humanitarian support interventions designed to address the
   social nature of stigma can reduce stigma. Our article significantly
   expands prior knowledge on a central mechanism in post-conflict recovery
   by providing a refined theory on wartime rape-related stigma and the
   role of humanitarian aid in mitigating negative effects based on
   representative data.},

Abstract = {Using an original demographically representative survey, we estimate the
   determinants of public support for a set of supportive and punitive
   policies to combat the opioid epidemic among a sample of 2,131
   Americans. Our findings indicate that individuals who attribute blame
   for the epidemic to the personal choices of individuals, conservatives
   and those high in racial resentment are consistently more likely to
   support punitive policies to combat the opioid epidemic and less likely
   to favour policies to support individuals with substance use disorders.
   Individuals who have a personal connection to someone struggling with
   opioid use disorder favour policies to support such individuals but have
   nuanced attitudes towards punitive policies. Importantly, we find
   overwhelming support for all supportive policies except supervised
   injection sites, while roughly 50\% of our sample supported the set of
   punitive policy choices. Our research represents a significant step
   forward toward understanding public opinion about the opioid epidemic
   and policies to combat it.},

Title = {Masculinities and Disengagement from Jihadi Networks: The Case of
   Indonesian Militant Islamists},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 8},
Abstract = {Men who join militant Islamist networks often frame their participation
   in masculine terms, as protectors, warriors or brothers. While the role
   of masculinities in recruitment to jihadi groups has received increasing
   attention, their role in disengaging men from armed groups (and
   particularly men in the global south) have not. This paper explores the
   role of masculinities in shaping men's paths out of jihadi networks.
   Based on life history research with Indonesian former militant Islamist
   we suggest that men's pathways out of armed groups are defined by
   negotiating alternate masculinities, which reposition their gendered
   role in society from those associated with militancy.},

Abstract = {When our democracies are broken, we need to `fix' our societies. There
   are no quick fixes, but the good news is that society is resilient and
   people will make new connections. We need to look better for those
   `small democratic wins' and learn from them to improve our democratic
   systems. This seems to be the core message of the book `Mending
   Democracies', that sits within a critical pragmatist approach and starts
   from the analysis of democratic deficits to offer new language and
   insights to understand societal resilience to repair institutional
   wrong-doings.},

Abstract = {Crises are often viewed as catalysts for change. The coronavirus disease
   crisis is no exception. In many policy sectors, proponents of reform see
   this global crisis both as a justification and an enabler of necessary
   change. Policy scholars have paid ample attention to this crisis-reform
   thesis. Empirical research suggests that these proponents of
   crisis-induced change should not be too optimistic. The question remains
   why some crises give rise to reform whereas so many others do not. This
   paper focuses on one particular factor that crisis researchers have
   identified as important. Crisis research suggests that the outcome of
   the meaning-making process-the efforts to impose a dominant frame on a
   population-shapes the prospects of postcrisis change. The paper offers
   three ideal-typical framing scripts, which researchers can use to study
   postcrisis trajectories.},

Abstract = {Education has been extremely affected by the coronavirus disease crisis,
   with almost all countries temporarily closing their schools in 2020.
   After the first stage of the pandemic, in which national governments
   focused on guaranteeing the academic year's continuity, key
   international organizations emphasized the need to adopt structural
   policy reforms to face the challenges posed by the crisis. Based on
   international and European countries' policy documents, this paper
   analyzes long-term responses articulated in the education sector. The
   analysis has allowed us to identify three preponderant areas of
   response: the digitalization of the educational system, educational
   inequalities, and teachers' development. The agendas and policy
   instruments that international organizations have so far pushed for in
   relation to each of these areas do not differ substantially from the
   agendas and instruments they promoted in the pre-pandemic era. It is
   still early to assess the deepness of the transformations in course, but
   in most cases, prevailing responses represent the intensification of
   change processes initiated before the pandemic. Nonetheless, the type
   and intensity of country responses vary among the European Union member
   states. Although the pandemic represents a common thread, countries have
   experienced the crisis differently according to the characteristics of
   their educational systems and the main problems the crisis has revealed.},

Abstract = {Globalisation has helped to intensify the international flow of people,
   information and policies. Following this process there has been
   increasing global concern regarding problems in areas such as
   immigration, health, poverty, among others. Various agents are
   transnationally engaged in common responses to these issues. The classic
   definition of public policies is related to actions undertaken by
   governments to solve the problems within their jurisdictions. However,
   often problems do not respect national boundaries. Sometimes, policies
   need to involve other nations. This article discusses the main issues,
   concepts and challenges in the study of global public policies. First,
   the article presents a review of the existing literature. Second, it
   introduces the key agents and agendas of global public policy. The
   discussion section focuses on the latest challenges and opportunities
   for research in Global Public Policy studies. Finally, new avenues of
   research are introduced, such as the dimension of power, the impact of
   the far-right and the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to provide insight into how recent changes in
   U.S. nuclear weapon strategy might affect crisis stability between the
   U.S. and Russia and what implications they might have for Norway. In
   brief, the nuclear modernization programs, introduction of new systems
   and changes in declaratory policy may undermine crisis stability because
   they enhance U.S. ``counterforce{''} capabilities. This has implications
   for Norwegian alliance policy: changes in U.S. nuclear strategy might
   lower the threshold for Russia to establish the bastion concept and
   increase Russia's uncertainty about the scope of Norwegian facilitation
   of U.S. policy. Utilizing traditional theories of crisis stability on
   recent policy changes indicates that the current stability is tenuous.
   It seems as if subsequent U.S. administrations do not accept the idea of
   a ``nuclear revolution{''}. Despite this, concerns about a nuclear war
   should not be exaggerated. Military analyses must be translated into
   political action. Even if the chance of a successful first strike
   increases, it is difficult to imagine politicians willing to risk a
   nuclear war. This indicates that deterrence is more robust than what
   pure military analyses suggest.},

Abstract = {The high-water mark of globalization has passed. New competitions
   continue to emerge in a decidedly multipolar international system. As
   the United States views China and Russia as strategic competitors or
   worse, India, the BRICS, and so forth-try to navigate this complex
   system and pursue their national interests. Meanwhile, no matter how
   much the United States and the European Union both believe themselves
   part of a single ``West,{''} divergent interests tend to drive them
   apart, even as tensions within the EU itself have grown sharper. In
   order to describe part of this increasingly competitive environment, an
   analytic distinction between so-called ``civilizational states{''} and
   ``liberal empires{''} seems to provide a framework to analyze
   international political processes in starkly contrasting terms.1 To some
   extent, the two terms repackage the terminology of the Cold War era that
   contrasted closed and open societies, and if we are indeed entering a
   new Cold War, the return of these categories is arguably appropriate.
   Yet more is surely at stake than a repetition of the historical
   competition between Communism and democracy, and the focus on the
   contrast between allegedly civilizational states and liberal empires may
   be missing a key part of the picture. Let's take a closer look at the
   two concepts and then ask whether this binary provides an adequate
   toolkit},
