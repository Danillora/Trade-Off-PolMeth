Abstract = {This article considers the puzzle of Norway and Canada, two countries
   that have adopted ambitious Paris Agreement targets yet are also major
   fossil fuel exporters. To date, both countries have taken full advantage
   of the international convention that assigns responsibility only for
   emissions within a country's borders. However, climate activists, First
   Nations, and green politicians increasingly have challenged fossil fuel
   production via campaigns centered on issues salient to voters in
   nonproducing regions: opposing new exploration licenses in Norway and
   pipelines in Canada. While supply-side campaigns have sometimes
   succeeded in ending expansion, neither country has seriously entertained
   restricting current production. We attribute these outcomes to continued
   public support for fossil fuel-driven prosperity; institutions that
   assign responsibility for production and climate to different government
   agencies; and the success of counternarratives that unilateral supply
   restrictions are futile, prosperity from petroleum exports will fund
   domestic clean-energy transitions, and gas exports advance global
   climate action.},

Abstract = {In the context of growing nationalisms and Euroscepticism, this paper
   develops the original concept of `Everyday Europeanhood' on a
   theoretical level, building on related concepts, such as Skey and
   Antonsich's `Everyday Nationhood', Billig's `Banal Nationalism',
   Anderson's `Imagined Communities' and Beck's `Cosmopolitan Vision'. It
   applies the concept to the European Universities Initiative (EUI), seen
   as a tool to promote European identity, based on a common sense of
   belonging conveyed through everyday practice, among students and staff
   in European University Alliances. It is argued that, in the light of
   previous top-down European initiatives designed to symbolically
   reinforce a sense of shared European identity, the EUI seems more in
   phase with bottom-up `everyday' processes of identity development.
   Taking the European University Alliance `FORTHEM' as an example, core
   features, aspects, actions and outputs achieved so far within this
   alliance are categorised in the light of four dimensions of `Everyday
   Europeanhood': `Talking Europe', `Choosing Europe', `Performing Europe'
   and `Consuming Europe'.},

Title = {Put Gender on the Tender in Australian Public Projects},

Abstract = {Australia's construction industry throughout the last two decades has
   seen an increase in the number of women pursuing careers. The percentage
   it has increased by between 1998 and 2020 is a disappointing 0.2\%
   despite the research, strategies, and initiatives the Australian
   Government has implemented during the interval. The purpose of this
   study is to evaluate and support the legislative notion of required
   gender percentages on tendering documents and how this change could
   increase the number of women in public projects. A systematic literature
   review of scholarly sources from the database Scopus was applied to
   develop a thematic analysis of women in the industry. The results found
   four themes: underrepresentation, barriers to career, education
   pathways, and opportunities for employment. These themes reinforced the
   need to introduce legislation such as gender requirements for public
   projects. Connections made were that gender legislation would increase
   the number of job opportunities, more jobs would encourage all levels of
   education to promote women in construction, more women in construction
   would improve their underrepresentation, and thus make women-centric
   problems in the workforce a more common issue and more likely to
   improve. The paper concludes that to see an increase in the number of
   women in Australia's construction industry, the government must take
   enforceable legislative change. This change must start by creating
   legislation that requires organisations that want to tender with the
   government to have a minimum percentage of women in any proposed public
   works submission before it can be awarded.},

Title = {The Domestic Impact of International Shaming Evidence from Climate
   Change and Human Rights},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},

Volume = {86},

Abstract = {Do international shaming efforts affect citizens' support for government
   policies? While it is a frequent claim in the literature that shaming
   works through domestic politics, we know little about how and when
   international criticism affects domestic public opinion. We address this
   question through an originally designed survey experiment in Sweden,
   which (i) compares the effects of international shaming in two issue
   areas-human rights and climate change, and (ii) tests whether government
   responses to criticism moderate the impact of shaming. Our main findings
   are fourfold. First, we find substantial effects of international
   shaming on domestic public opinion. These effects hold across both issue
   areas and irrespective of whether citizens support government parties or
   not. Second, human rights shaming has a stronger impact on citizens'
   support for government policies than climate shaming. Third, shaming is
   most effective among citizens who are more supportive of climate action,
   human rights, and international cooperation. Finally, our findings are
   mixed with respect to the effect of government responses. While
   government responses do not moderate the effects of human rights
   shaming, they seem to mitigate the effects of climate shaming.},

Abstract = {What shapes social-environmental regulations in the World Bank? To date,
   scholars have emphasized the influence of nongovernmental organization
   activism, donor power, and various elements of the Bank's internal
   culture and incentive system. This article documents a new and important
   source of influence: outside financing options for borrower countries. I
   demonstrate this influence through an in-depth study of the World Bank's
   Safeguards Review and Update, a four-year policy-making process that
   concluded in 2016. As alternative sources of finance carrying less
   stringent safeguard requirements than those of the World Bank
   proliferated in years preceding the Safeguards Review, borrowers gained
   negotiating power over Bank policy, enabling them to successfully push
   for more regulatory autonomy. These findings suggest that understanding
   the future of social-environmental standards in development finance
   institutions will require greater attention to new sources of finance
   and the power shifts they may entail.},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The paper is a case study of ``Port-Petrovsk{''}, a large fishing and
   fish processing company in Makhachkala (Dagestan, Russia) that was
   purposefully driven to bankruptcy in 2007, leading some 5,300 people to
   lose their workplaces as well as access to many social services. The
   factory was bankrupted as there existed a small group willing in get
   rich on its assets. A considerable portion of the company's former
   premises has already been sold and new apartment buildings have been
   erected there. Former workers and shareholders have been trying to
   reclaim their property and save the remaining company premises from
   being sold to developers. The case is presented against the background
   of what has been called elemental urbanization: a dynamic, chaotic and
   informal way of development of urban space in Makhachkala, one of the
   fastest growing cities in Russia. The whole process of conflict and
   negotiations around the company assets shows how property rights in
   Dagestan challenge the Western-set dichotomy of the individual versus
   the collective. Moreover, it presents property rights as a bundle that
   consist of legal, economic, and moral dimensions.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the symbolic construction of the `people' and the
   `homeland' in Spain's left populist party Podemos by exploring the
   gender and class meanings that Podemos leaders evoke in their
   representation of these two key elements of populist rhetoric.
   Distinguishing between the official symbolic presentation of the
   constituency, that purposely selects certain symbols to evoke particular
   meanings about the people and the homeland, and the subtext of gendered
   norms that symbols evoke, allows us understanding the possibilities of
   the Spanish left populist party to contribute to feminist politics.
   Podemos has a role in the process of meaning-making that envisions
   gender and class-aware societal projects through the symbolic
   representation of `the people' and `the homeland'. Yet, ambivalence in
   the egalitarian discourse and a symbolic subtext of unequal informal
   gendered norms in the party culture undermine the feminist commitments
   of the leadership adopted in the official presentation of the
   constituency. By capturing the gap between the official purposeful
   symbolic representation, that conveys a message of inclusive and
   feminist people-homeland, and the symbolic subtext of the party's
   discourse and performance, that reproduces exclusionary gendered norms,
   the article contributes to reflect on the inclusionary potential and
   contradictions of left populism.},

Abstract = {Climate-generated stress has been linked to multiple socio-political
   outcomes, many of which are violent. Scarcity is a key mechanism behind
   these violent outcomes. I argue that climate-induced scarcity creates
   conditions for organized criminal groups to capture the markets of legal
   commodities. Scarcity drives prices up, creating incentives for criminal
   groups to capture the production and distribution of these commodities
   with pernicious consequences. Using qualitative evidence for the abalone
   shellfish market in two South African provinces, I trace the process
   connecting climate-induced scarcity to price changes, to criminal market
   capture. In doing so, I make three contributions: I propose a new theory
   about the climate drivers behind the behavior of organized crime by
   bringing together scholarship on climate and conflict and criminal
   violence; I extend research on organized crime from markets of illicit
   goods into markets for licit ones; and I provide evidence suggestive of
   brokerage as a specific mechanism to illegally control a market.},

Abstract = {This paper compares and contrasts the behavioral tendencies between
   civil servants recruited from regular entrance examinations (REEs) and
   specially selected graduates (SSGs) in grassroots-level governments in
   China as they face a conflict between vertical (hierarchical) and
   horizontal (public) responsiveness. This study draws on a survey from 13
   cities to explore behavioral variations in the two categories of civil
   servants. Two test methods (the OLS and mediation model) are adopted to
   verify the findings. This study finds that both the vertical and
   horizontal responsiveness of civil servants who are SSGs tend to be
   higher than those recruited from the REEs in facing the above-mentioned
   conflict. Four personnel mechanisms are tested to explain this
   variation: (1) the politicized recruitment and selection of SSGs, (2)
   job arrangements for SSGs, (3) triple leadership over SSGs, and (4) a
   fast-track stream for SSGs. Our analysis reveals that only the first two
   can account for this variation. This account can shed new light on the
   impact of the development of a separate corps of elites in China.},

Title = {An adaptation-mitigation game: does adaptation promote participation in

Abstract = {This paper studies how the investment in adaptation can influence the
   participation in an international environmental agreement (IEA) when
   countries decide in adaptation before they choose emissions. Three types
   of agreements are studied, a mitigation agreement for which countries
   coordinate their decisions only on emissions; an adaptation agreement
   for which there is only coordination when countries decide their levels
   of adaptation and a complete agreement when there is coordination in
   both emissions and adaptation levels. In every case, we assume that the
   degree of effectiveness of adaptation is bounded from above, in order
   words, adaptation can alleviate the environmental problem, but it cannot
   solve it by itself leading the vulnerability of the country to almost
   zero. Our first results show that in our symmetric model where
   signatories select the same level of adaptation there are not
   signatory-signatory international externalities and the complete
   agreement coincides with the mitigation agreement, and moreover it does
   not matter when adaptation is chosen with respect to emissions. The main
   contribution of this paper is to show that the grand coalition could be
   stable for all types of agreement, but only for extremely high degrees
   of effectiveness of adaptation. If this condition is not satisfied, the
   model predicts low levels of membership. The standard result of three
   countries is found for the mitigation/complete agreement. For the
   adaptation agreement participation can be higher than three, but not
   higher than six countries. In any case, we can conclude that under
   reasonable values for the degree of effectiveness of adaptation, in our
   model adaptation does not promote participation in an IEA.},

Abstract = {The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, is ushering in a new climate
   regime. Owing to the increasing importance of technology development and
   transfer, a technology subregime became part of the Paris Agreement in
   the form of Article 10, which obligates parties to strengthen their
   cooperative action on technology development and transfer. This
   technology subregime includes the Technology Mechanism as a working
   mechanism, established in 2010 under the United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The effective implementation of
   the technology subregime hinges upon the supporting role of the
   Technology Mechanism, particularly its implementing organization, the
   Climate Technology Centre \& Network (CTCN). Technology subregimes are
   regarded not only as effective means to tackle environmental problems,
   but also as an inducement to extend the participation of developing
   countries in international environmental agreements. However, the means
   to assess them have not been widely explored. A recent UNFCCC discussion
   considered whether the CTCN impacted the enhancement of environmental
   quality in terms of mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.
   Therefore, this study evaluates the institutional effectiveness of the
   technology subregime of the Paris Agreement with the CTCN. This study
   utilizes five evaluation criteria: (1) environmental effectiveness, (2)
   technological effectiveness, (3) economic effectiveness, (4) compliance
   and participation incentives, and (5) administrative feasibility. It
   summarizes analytical results and concludes by proposing policy
   implications regarding the assessment of institutional effectiveness of
   the technology subregime.},

Abstract = {Our paper addresses the representation of territorialized and
   conflicting interests by the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)
   through a case study on the posting of workers. Public debates on the
   reforms to the legal framework for this controversial practice have been
   steadily increasing since the EU's eastward enlargement. Focusing on
   parliamentary questions, our mixed-methods research design analyses why
   and how MEPs take position on this highly divisive issue, beyond their
   nationality and a so-called opposition between Eastern and Western EU
   member states. MEPs' implication depends both on the impact that the
   posting of workers has on employment in their home country and on their
   own political career, including whether they hold national or local
   electoral mandates. These factors also determine which political roles
   are performed by MEPs (moral entrepreneur, policy maker, interest groups
   broker), as the textual analysis of their questions in Parliament
   highlights. These results emphasize the influence of parliamentary
   socialization on the positions taken in the debates about social Europe,
   but also the significance of the territorial dimension of parliamentary
   representation.},

Abstract = {This article critically examines the argument that language testing for
   citizenship is necessary in order to ensure that naturalized citizens
   have sufficient language proficiency to participate in democratic life.
   First, we contend that as they are currently designed, language tests
   are normally unsuitable to assess the ability of would-be citizens to
   participate in the complex linguistic interactions that characterize
   democratic life. We further claim that if language tests were redesigned
   in order to meet this challenge, this would unjustly exclude (or
   exacerbate the exclusion of) many categories of migrants from
   citizenship, especially humanitarian entrants and adults with low-level
   literacy skills. Finally, we argue that language tests and language
   skills may be unnecessary for political participation, if institutions
   and social norms are in place which enable speakers of different
   languages to participate in political life effectively and without fear
   of prejudice.},

Abstract = {Healthcare provision in Denmark reflects some of the key principles of
   the welfare state. By securing relatively easy and equal access for all
   Danish residents regardless of income via general tax financing, the
   Danish healthcare system has strong ethical merits. All residents are
   entitled to comprehensive healthcare services. The Danish healthcare
   system is also relatively efficient. Total healthcare expenditures -
   including public and private - amount to 10\% of GDP, above the OECD
   8.8\% average but well below the costs in the other Nordic countries,
   Germany, Switzerland and the United Stated. Notwithstanding its merits,
   healthcare in Denmark shares key predicaments with other OECD countries,
   primarily how to improve health outcomes while containing care
   expenditures. All of the OECD countries aim to improve population life
   expectancy and health quality. Yet their ageing and increasingly obese
   populations are exacerbating the demands on their respective healthcare
   systems. This chapter examines changes in how Denmark has managed these
   challenges. The main argument is that the healthcare system performance
   on managing health outcomes and costs improved remarkably from the 1990s
   to the early 2020s, although outcome inequalities remain. Notable
   changes in the system were targeted innovations in treatment procedures
   and expansion of municipal rehabilitation and preventive efforts, along
   with strict budget controls.},

Pages = {217-246},
Abstract = {The rise and spread of Jihadist groups, such as al-Qaeda and ISIS, and
   the atrocities they have perpetrated in various Muslim territories and
   Western cities have raised the alarm about the supposed threat Islam
   poses to Europe-and to the West more broadly. In Europe, the resurgence
   of populist, right-wing politics was connected in no small part to the
   wide audience reached by discourses warning against the `threat'
   immigrants-especially Muslims-pose to Western civilization. As
   dramatized threats and fears become a political factor of prime
   importance, the following question cannot but impose itself. Is an
   Abrahamic religion like Islam, with as many as 1.8 billion adherents, an
   existential threat to the West? Put differently, is Islam inherently
   incompatible with liberal Western values? To answer these questions,
   this chapter places Islam within its centuries-old tradition and regards
   it as a general category. It compares and contrasts such a category with
   various interpretations thereof, including Islamism, Jihadism, and
   Sufism. The chapter's historical thrust is the second half of the
   twentieth century and the first two decades of the twentyfirst century-a
   period that has witnessed the rise and flourishing of Islamism,
   Jihadism, and right-wing politics in Europe and other Western locales.
   Departing from the views of various thinkers, this essay argues that,
   while Islamism/Jihadism might pose a concrete threat to Western
   societies, Islam is not inherently antagonistic to the West or to
   freedom.},

Abstract = {In this concluding chapter, the editors provide an overall assessment of
   contemporary Danish public governance based on the main findings in the
   preceding chapters of the edited volume. Surveying the Danish governance
   responses to contemporary mega-challenges, the chapter reflects on
   policy implications and contemplate the future of both research and
   practice related to public administration, politics and governance in
   Denmark. The chapter argues that recent public governance reforms have
   turned the Danish welfare state into a mix of a neo-Weberian state and
   an enabling state, which deploys its considerable resources to create
   economic growth for the benefit of the large majority of Danes, to
   satisfy the needs of citizens and businesses and to develop
   collaborative solutions to complex problems. While the chapter concludes
   that this modified version of the well-known universal welfare state is
   largely apt for meeting the mega-challenges of the twenty-first century,
   recent reforms seeking to enhance job-seeking incentives for the
   unemployed and to integrate immigrants have resulted in new forms of
   marginalisation of weaker societal groups. Moreover, evolving problems
   such as climate change, an ageing population and digital citizen privacy
   will require further public governance reforms in the years to come.},

Abstract = {As an epilogue to this collection, this chapter sketches a few
   reflections on the present and future of Western hegemonies, focusing on
   the material dimension of hegemony. This reflection takes into account
   recent events that had substantial impacts worldwide, the Covid-19
   pandemic and the war in Ukraine. First, I address hegemony in the
   international arena, considering power relations between states and the
   economy to ponder whether US-led Western hegemony is recoiling or even,
   over, especially regarding perceived contenders of the US like China and
   Russia. The chapter then turns to the relations between the Global South
   and the Global North, asking whether they are still under the yoke of
   asymmetrical relations induced by Western actors today (in many cases,
   as a consequence of neocolonialism or informal imperialism) and how they
   are likely to evolve in this respect. In this section, I explore the
   issue of the economic gap and bring into light the influence of China
   and Russia on developing regions, especially Africa, thus identifying
   these regions as areas of global geopolitical contest. The analysis will
   draw from empirical studies and be supported at the theoretical level by
   the work of Immanuel Wallerstein and Samir Amin},

Abstract = {For decades, the object of international climate governance has been
   greenhouse gases. The inadequacy of decarbonization based on this system
   has prompted calls to expand climate governance to include restrictions
   on fossil fuel supply. Such initiatives could rely on accountability
   frameworks based on fossil fuel reserves, production, or infrastructure,
   yet there has been little consideration of the different implications of
   these options. We inform such discussions by undertaking a
   sociotechnical analysis of existing schemes for the monitoring,
   reporting and verification of fossil fuels. We identify serious risks
   from anchoring climate governance in fossil fuel reserves. More
   promising directions for supply-side governance lie in accountability
   frameworks based on a combination of fossil fuel production volumes and
   infrastructure, since these are more transparent to multiple actors.
   This transparency would provide much-needed opportunities for democratic
   oversight of the data underpinning climate governance, opening new
   channels for holding states accountable for their climate performance.},

Abstract = {The emergence, longevity and resilience of contested states have
   redefined the relationship between sovereignty and territoriality. While
   fully-fledged states uphold the monopoly of authority, contested states
   seek to rewrite the sovereignty playbook and gain a seat among sovereign
   equals. This atypical antagonism, propped up by post-Westphalian
   statehood aspirations, has changed the way sovereignty is perceived and
   understood nowadays. Approaching sovereignty as multi-faceted, this
   article discusses contested statehood in the context of the EU's
   engagement overseas. Drawing on the literature of Europeanisation and
   complex sovereignty, it accounts for the influence of contested
   statehood on the EU's role and policies in contested states.
   Specifically, by delving into Kosovo's complex sovereignty
   (internal/external), the analysis measures the fluctuating impact of
   contestedness on the EU's employed policy frameworks and deployed crisis
   management tools unfolding a paradox that has defined the EU's foreign
   policy in Kosovo for years.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the two most recent extended manifestos on Europe
   (2019) of the French populist radical right party Rassemblement National
   (RN), previously known as the Front National (FN), from a narrative
   perspective. The perspective used is based on the Narrative Policy
   Framework's focus on the setting, plot, characters and moral of the
   narrative combined with a generic approach. Rather than the `classical'
   genres of tragedy, comedy, romance and satire, however, this study
   focuses on the narrative elements of the dystopian genre, and argues
   that the RN's narrative on Europe broadly resembles fictional dystopian
   narratives. In dystopian narratives, the inhabitants find their
   ontological security threatened by a dehumanising, authoritarian regime,
   in this case the EU. It is in the `green world', a timeless space
   outside the limits of the dystopian state, here represented by the RN's
   proposed European Alliance of Nations, where the dystopian hero
   recuperates their sense of autonomy and identity. Such narratives,
   through exacerbating an already widespread sense of anxiety and
   ontological insecurity, are potentially powerful attempts to frame
   continued membership in an unreformed EU as a threat to security.},

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between personal experience with
   intimate partner violence (IPV) and political attitudes. I argue that by
   adopting salient legislation on violence against women, the state
   enables survivors to evaluate government performance on the basis of
   their ability to access resources for victims. As such, when survivors
   are unable to reach specialized public services, they might downgrade
   their evaluations of government performance. Focusing on Brazil and
   using survey data and qualitative interviews, this study finds that IPV
   survivors who have not used specialized services hold more negative
   views of government performance compared to nonvictims. Further
   analysis, including a series of placebo tests, lends additional support
   to the main results. This study has an intersectional component, as it
   also examines the relationship between race and access to services.
   These findings have implications for victims' democratic rights and
   access to justice.},

Abstract = {Drawing on ethnographic research in El Oasis, a highly precarious
   self-built settlement in Medellin, Colombia, this article examines the
   illegal practice of autoconstruction as a material expression of hope.
   It focuses on the multilayered, symbolic meaning of self-built housing,
   as it represents the pursuit of dignity, permanence, and agency-as
   opposed to poverty, uncertainty, and lack of agency-and an active and
   material form of hoping for a better future in the city. The state plays
   an ambiguous role in residents' perspectives, who conceive of it,
   simultaneously, as a threat to and a guarantor of their future in the
   city. This ambiguity becomes materialized in the physical form of
   residents' self-built housing, as residents either embrace or refrain
   from making improvements to their houses in response to shifting
   perceptions about the state's intentions regarding the future of the
   settlement.},

Abstract = {Divergent public responses to police brutality incidents demonstrate
   that for some, police violence is an injustice that demands remediation,
   while for others state violence is justice served. We develop a novel
   survey experiment in which we randomize the race and gender of a victim
   of police violence, and then provide respondents with an opportunity to
   establish justice via compensation. We uncover small but consistent
   effects that financial restitution is most supported for a White female
   detainee and least supported for a Black female detainee, and this is
   largely driven by White respondents. Beyond the treatment effects, we
   show that Black respondents are much more likely to perceive detainees
   as deserving of restitution; across all treatments, Black respondents
   are 58 percent more likely than Whites to support a financial
   settlement. We further show that White respondents' perceptions of
   deservingness are highly related to their perceptions of who is at fault
   for the beating-the detainee or the police-and whether the detainee was
   involved in crime. Black respondents remain likely to award a settlement
   even if they think the detainee was at fault and involved in crime. Our
   results provide further evidence that perceptions of who deserves
   restorative justice for state violence are entangled with race in
   targeted ways.},

Abstract = {This article takes a critical view on austerity policy and examines its
   social and economic consequences for the case of Greece. By introducing
   the concept of ``growthless employment{''} it demonstrates that the
   implementation of internal devaluation policies had a substantial impact
   on the Greek society that needs to be addressed. Within a decade,
   household disposable income was reduced to an unprecedented level while
   the labour market was extensively deregulated as several indicators can
   display. The seemingly paradoxical case of employment without
   growth-hence, growthless employment-can be interpreted as the
   consequence of the intensity of the mix of austerity policies that was
   imposed as ``one-size-fits-all{''} without taking the peculiar structure
   of the Greek economy into account. A descriptive examination of this
   idiosyncratic state of affairs is offered, providing new insights on how
   the level of depreciation can be better assessed. It is argued that the
   overall severity of the crisis is better captured by the level of
   disposable income whereas a modified measurement of poverty and income
   depreciation is introduced for the same purpose. Lastly it is maintained
   that Greece has suffered by an enormous outflow of its productive-aged
   population in the aftermath of the crisis. All the above concretise the
   idea of growthless employment in Greece.},

Abstract = {The pursuit of wealth has been a basic occupation of humans; as it turns
   out, wealth increases life expectancy. Analyzing global data, we show
   that money, probably connected with medical care, increase life
   expectancy. However, the base of real wealth is access to the
   Water-Energy-Food nexus, and the access to this also increases life
   expectancy. The first objective of this study was to compare the present
   values of wealth with antiquity, and we showed that about 1.4 billion
   people live in the present under the average lower wages of antiquity.
   As a case study, we analyze the construction of the Hadrianic aqueduct.
   We present a detailed description of the construction and the used
   methods, and we identify the total requirement of labor-time. Then, we
   investigate the wages of various occupations in the first century AD.
   The second objective of this study was the estimation of the total cost
   of daily wages for the construction of the project and the effect of the
   aqueduct on Athenians' quality of life. Finally, we show that, today,
   about two billion people live with less available water than Athenians
   had with the Hadrianic aqueduct in the second century A.D.},

Abstract = {Twelve historians and social scientists reflect on Miroslav Hroch's
   contributions to the field of nationalism studies. There are essays on
   his pioneering comparative historical studies of `small nation' national
   movements and his distinction between nationalism and national
   movements. Other essays focus on concepts such as those of protagonist,
   the three phases of national movements, the small nation and nationally
   relevant conflict of interest. A further set of essays explores how
   Hroch's approach can be extended beyond small nations, beyond Europe and
   into the contemporary period.},

Abstract = {On average, over 1 in 10 women in the United States have difficulty
   getting pregnant and carrying a pregnancy to full term, with women of
   color experiencing infertility at nearly twice the rate of non-Hispanic
   white women. Although infertility rates are significantly higher within
   Black and Latino communities, treatment and success rates are
   significantly lower. We seek to understand whether views of in vitro
   fertilization (IVF, a common reproductive technology), particularly
   within communities of color, are shaped by a broader skepticism about
   new medical technology. Using data from a 2013 national survey conducted
   by the Pew Research Center, we measure medical mistrust across
   racial/ethnic groups and test whether these beliefs are associated with
   views toward IVF.},

Abstract = {In a relatively short time, cybersecurity has risen to become one of the
   EU's security priorities. While the institutionalisation of EU-level
   cybersecurity capacities has been substantial since the first EU
   cybersecurity strategy was published, previous research has also
   identified resistance from member states to allow the EU to have more
   control over their cybersecurity activities. Despite a growing
   literature on EU cybersecurity governance, there are currently extensive
   gaps in the understanding of this tension. This study suggests that an
   explanatory factor can be found in the so-far overlooked dynamic of the
   relative prevalence of risk vs. threat-based security logics in the EU
   cybersecurity approach. By distinguishing between risk and threat-based
   logics in the development of the EU cybersecurity discourse over time,
   this study highlights a shift towards an increasing threat-based
   security logic in the EU cybersecurity approach. The identified
   development highlights securitising moves enacting to a larger extent
   than before objects and subjects of security traditionally associated
   with national security. The study identifies specific areas of member
   state contestation accompanying this shift and concludes with a
   discussion on the findings in relation to the development of the EU as a
   security actor in the wider international cybersecurity landscape.},

Volume = {64},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {21-44},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom among scholars of Latin American politics holds that
   informal workers are less participatory and less left-leaning than
   formal workers. Relevant empirical findings, however, are mixed and in
   need of synthesis. This article provides that synthesis by conducting
   meta-analyses on the universe of previous quantitative studies of
   informality and the vote. It finds that informal workers are indeed less
   likely to vote than formal workers, but the effect of informality is
   small-just four to seven percentage points. It further finds that
   informal workers are more likely to vote for the left, not the right,
   but here the effect size is even smaller. Meta-regression analyses
   reveal that in countries where organized professional activity among
   informal workers is high, gaps in turnout between the two sectors are
   minimal. The article concludes that the conventional wisdom over-states
   the individual-level political consequences of labor informality in
   Latin America.},

Title = {Balance as a Pre-Estimation Test for Time Series Analysis},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},

Abstract = {It is understood that ensuring equation balance is a necessary condition
   for a valid model of times series data. Yet, the definition of balance
   provided so far has been incomplete and there has not been a consistent
   understanding of exactly why balance is important or how it can be
   applied. The discussion to date has focused on the estimates produced by
   the general error correction model (GECM). In this paper, we go beyond
   the GECM and beyond model estimates. We treat equation balance as a
   theoretical matter, not merely an empirical one, and describe how to use
   the concept of balance to test theoretical propositions before
   longitudinal data have been gathered. We explain how equation balance
   can be used to check if your theoretical or empirical model is either
   wrong or incomplete in a way that will prevent a meaningful
   interpretation of the model. We also raise the issue of ``I(0)
   balance{''} and its importance.},

Abstract = {Governments spread strategic narratives via media to influence foreign
   audiences and policy makers. A frequent but understudied feature of
   strategic narratives is the discursive construction of blame. In this
   article, we use the coverage of the adoption of 5G cellular technology
   in Russian state-funded news portals as an example to show how to
   interpret blame narratives about international security issues. We
   combine methods and insights from the discourse-analytic studies of
   blame and the research into the uses of strategic narratives in
   international relations to reveal how various articulations of blame are
   used to (de)legitimise particular actors and actions, sow discord, and
   foster alliances. Our analysis sheds new light on blame discourses that
   are more sophisticated and indirect than straightforward accusations and
   may serve multiple strategic goals at once. It also contributes to
   scholarship on Russia's strategic communication about China as well as
   the United States and its allies.},

Abstract = {International stakeholders working with domestic entities to co-produce
   new institutions of economic governance are common in developing
   settings such as Myanmar. This is exhibited in the case of Myanmar's
   nascent securities exchange regime, the formation and operation of which
   has been dominated by extra-national interests in the form of Japanese
   public, quasi-public, and private entities. Researchers and
   international organisations involved in developing nations argue that
   the creation of effective public institutions, including those that
   comprise national economic governance approaches, is essential to the
   promotion of sustainable development goals and promotion of the
   good/sound governance principles of responsiveness and accountability
   necessary to build effective institutions. The new securities exchange
   regime is an important component of economic governance required to
   promote Myanmar's development objectives and the integration of the
   nation into the international economic community. However, the existing
   international discourse has not applied concepts such as co-production
   from the New Public Governance perspective of public administration to
   consider the implications of external actors guiding the development of
   securities exchange regime in developing settings such as Myanmar. The
   current study considers the influence of Japanese interests as they have
   co-produced Myanmar's securities exchange regime as part of the nation's
   economic governance. To do this, it utilizes a conceptual and analytic
   approach that reveals the good governance consequentiality of multiple
   external organisational interests applied in the co-production and
   operation of new organisational forms such as securities exchange
   regime.},

Abstract = {Although nationalism has been identified as the dominant ideology of the
   modern era, and environmentalism is the 21st century rising star, few
   studies address the relationship between them. The consensus seems to be
   that they are hardly compatible, considering that nationalism is a
   boundary-building phenomenon while environmentalism advocates for the
   safeguarding of the environment beyond national borders. Drawing on
   evidence from fieldwork in the region of Freiburg-im-Breisgau, near the
   French-German border, our study challenges this assumption. Not long ago
   this was a heavily militarised territory and a place of historical
   national friction between France and Germany, yet now it has been
   converted to, and rebranded as, a model of a successful, environmentally
   friendly region. Rather than wearing down nationalist sentiments,
   national pride has been reinvigorated as the vestiges of German
   nationalism have been buried under a thick layer of environmental paint;
   this time national pride is grounded not in the military power of the
   nation but in its defence of the environment. Through this case study,
   framed within the lens of nationalism theories, we argue that
   nationalism has the potential power to adapt to harmful heteronomous
   threats such as environmentalism, leverage on and bond with them and
   finally re-emerge even stronger.},

Abstract = {Why are some electoral authoritarian regimes immune to democratization
   for decades while others not? This article explores the impact of
   executive selection systems on democratic transitions from electoral
   authoritarianism. We argue that under electoral authoritarian regimes,
   Parliament-based systems permit dictators to more effectively deter
   democratization compared to Presidential systems. This is because
   Parliament-based systems indirectly allow electoral manipulation to
   achieve a victory at the ballot box, such as through gerrymandering and
   malapportionment. Parliament-based systems also make it difficult for
   opposition parties to coordinate and incentivize autocrats and ruling
   elites to engage in power-sharing and thus institutionalize ruling
   parties. We test our hypothesis as well as the underlying mechanisms
   employing a dataset of 93 electoral authoritarian countries between 1946
   and 2012. Cross-national statistical analyses with instrumental
   variables estimation provide supporting evidence for our theory.},

Abstract = {What determines support for separatist movements in Africa? The past two
   decades have seen a rise in separatism across Africa, including renewed
   Nigeria's Igbo Biafran nationalism. While a large body of work has
   focused on the behaviour of African separatist movements themselves,
   less work has examined the correlates of popular support for their
   claims and goals. This study does so, focusing on two important factors.
   First, it examines whether exposure to conflict events involving
   neo-Biafran movements increases or decreases support for the claims made
   by the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB). The study uses geo-coded
   data from the Afrobarometer and ACLED datasets to measure proximate
   exposure and finds that more exposure correlates positively with support
   for secession. Second, it argues that the highest levels of support
   should be associated with members of ethnic groups that would dominate
   the proposed state. Drawing again from Afrobarometer, the study finds
   support for this.},

Abstract = {This essay examines how the inhabitants of Putumayo, a department of
   Colombia both divided and held together by licit and illicit authority
   structures and markets, engage with varied political orders as they
   advance individual and collective economic and political projects.
   Putumayo's inhabitants adopt four basic strategies to maintain their
   often illicit livelihoods amid state repression. The first is
   intellectual resistance, wherein they develop explanations for their
   involvement in illicit markets that they can use to alter local and
   national state behavior. The second is protest, through which groups of
   peasants mobilize to support their illicit but socially normalized
   economic endeavors. A third is evasion or malicia, in which peasants
   seek to strategically adhere to state policy to misdirect the state as
   they continue to grow coca. Fourth, some peasants pursue a strategy of
   exit, going deeper into the jungle in search of land where they can
   peacefully grow coca.},

Abstract = {Many scholars stress the role national identities play as an essential
   element that shapes interests and explains political behaviours. Others,
   however, contend that national identities are too amorphic and highlight
   the analytical challenge of employing them as a research variable. We
   propose the use of metanarratives as a theoretical framework that
   captures the essence of national identities and allows the comparative
   study of their similarities and differences. Metanarratives are shared
   dominant stories that guide values, beliefs and behaviours and help
   communities understand who they are. We develop a new systematic method
   for measuring their content and present a three-step process for gauging
   metanarratives. We demonstrate this method on 159 countries, analysing
   constitution preambles to assess each nation's metanarrative and create
   a global identity orientation map. We show how this approach enables the
   classification and comparison of national identities and discuss its
   potential contribution to further empiric study of national identities.},

Abstract = {In the article, we shed light on and problematize the everyday sensing,
   imagining, and doing of Europe in the boundary work of welcome cultures.
   By relating the practices and performances of the welcome cultures to a
   long tradition of thought problematizing European identity around the
   notion of cosmopolitanism, we read welcoming activities as openings for
   imagining and doing an inclusive Europe in a space apart from and beyond
   the institutional violence of exclusive borders. It is our argument that
   through the everyday activities of welcoming, `other Europes' emerge,
   heterotopia, materialized as `elsewheres' articulated in resistance to
   and as well as mirroring and mimicking the EU and state bordering. We
   thereby illuminate how European welcome cultures open for renegotiating
   and reimagining the boundaries and contours of what it means to be
   European, and this is sensed, imagined and performed in the everyday
   practices.},

Abstract = {This study aims to discuss how Chinese-oriented heritage from Ming and
   Qing dynasties has been incorporated in the discourse of `Taiwanese'
   culture to bolster the identity of Taiwan. Drawing upon the
   interconnected theoretical concepts of `imagined communities' and
   `nationalising the past', this study focuses on the `selective'
   presentation of the Chinese-oriented monuments in historic Tainan City,
   where the documented history of Taiwan began. This study concludes that
   these Chinese-oriented monuments are represented as containing a wealth
   of transposable imagery, as one embodiment in the context of Taiwanese
   culture, and the mark of political distinction between `Taiwan' and
   `China', in the process of heritagisation. In the interpretation of
   heritage, this research result also suggests that the state of Republic
   of China (ROC) re-invented `Taiwanese' nationhood and that the state's
   goals of cultural establishment could be reinforced through social
   agents.},

Abstract = {With respect to the relationship between the state and democracy, the
   scholarly research thus far has mainly oscillated between two
   perspectives: `no state, no democracy' versus `no democracy, no state'.
   Using the example of former Yugoslav republics and based on Mill's
   method of difference that is complemented with process tracing, we offer
   an alternative approach. We posit that a democracy can emerge within the
   context of unresolved matters of state and nation but it is unlikely
   that it will flourish. Furthermore, we argue that stateness problem
   creates conditions that facilitate democratic backsliding even if a
   country achieves a considerable level of democratic development: a
   fertile ground for ethno-political entrepreneurship and national
   identity-based political divisions that promote polarization.
   Accordingly, besides facilitating democratization, a resolved stateness
   problem should be regarded as a condition that fosters democratic
   resilience as well. The article contributes to a better understanding of
   the relationship between the state and democracy and reveals the
   mechanisms that are behind a successful subversion of democracy in the
   name of the nation.},

Abstract = {Social cohesion, often operationalized using measures of generalized
   social trust, has received enormous amounts of attention in previous
   scholarly work. However, another dimension of this broad phenomenon,
   norms of social solidarity, has meanwhile largely been overlooked in
   previous research. This study analyzes the association between
   micro-perceptions of corruption and solidarity with the less privileged
   both domestically and beyond, and how this association might vary across
   different societies with different types and forms of corruption. The
   data come from ISSP Citizenship II and include 33 countries, analyzed
   with multilevel regression models. The results show that the link
   between individual corruption perceptions and global solidarity varies
   so that it is comparatively weak and positive in contexts judged as more
   corrupt according to the Corruption Perception Index, while it is strong
   and negative in contexts judged by experts as relatively corruption
   free. For domestic solidarity, in turn, there is some evidence of a
   comparatively weak positive association but no significant contextual
   variations.},

Abstract = {The main thesis of this article is that nationalist political discourses
   emerged in Hungary more suddenly, radically and earlier than previously
   thought. An underlying assumption is that nationalism may be best
   understood through an analysis of political discourses. The sudden
   appeal of these kinds of political discourses demands explanation. How
   did the discourses of nation overwrite earlier discourses? How did they
   gain social, political and cultural legitimacy? How were they related to
   the Enlightenment? In answering these questions, we first point to the
   ambiguity and fluidity of new concepts and terms, such as nation,
   language, fatherland, patriot and foreigner. These key concepts of
   nationalist discourses provided innovative and independent sources of
   political legitimation. They enabled the frameworks of political life
   and thought to be re-established. They made for an easy entry into
   politics because they were rooted in familiar, earlier political
   discourses. However, for the success of nationalism as a political
   paradigm, the new discourses of nation also had to make attractive
   ideological offers and project positive visions of the future. These
   offers, as we will show, were built on an appeal to `public happiness'.
   They bound together Magyarisation and nationalism and grew from an
   ideology into a political programme.},

Abstract = {Local governments' failure to provide proper compensation for rural
   residents' land rights has been one of the main sources of political
   conflict in rural China. Previous literature has focused on why local
   governments use different means to compensate for land-losing rural
   residents. Yet, the question of who local governments prioritize when
   providing compensation for dispossessed land rights has not been fully
   examined. Employing the data from the China Household Income Survey
   (2013), I show that local states are more likely to provide
   compensation, either a cash payment or access to social insurance, to
   land-losing rural residents who stay in the township. Land-losing rural
   residents who live outside the township, to the contrary, are less
   likely to be compensated for their land rights by local states. Drawing
   on the China General Social Survey (2010), I suggest that the
   disadvantage of out-migrants stems from their lowered levels of
   political participation. The findings from this article imply that
   internal migrants in China are discriminated against not only in the
   destination localities but also in their home localities.},

Abstract = {Nationalism is often associated with xenophobia and isolationism in
   academic literature. The negative image of nationalism has been further
   strengthened by the electoral success of far-right political figures
   across the world. However, treating all nationalism as a uniformly
   negative phenomenon risks over-simplification, as nationalism might
   manifest differently given different social context and rhetorical
   resources available. Taking Hong Kong as a case, this paper theorises
   Hong Kong as a stateless nation and examines the alleged negative
   association of nationalism. It moves beyond the traditional `Hong Kong
   vis-a-vis China' framework and explores the relationship between Hong
   Kong nationalists and non-Chinese international actors. Drawing on data
   from major Hong Kong political parties' Facebook page, this paper shows
   that Hong Kong nationalism exhibits a high level of internationalism in
   both inward and outward dimensions, theorised, respectively, as the
   willingness to accept foreign influence and to invite international
   cooperation, and therefore offers a nuanced understanding about the
   relationship between nationalism, xenophobia and isolationism.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions do collaborations between informal workers and the
   state in public service provision lead to socially beneficial synergies,
   and when might they intensify inequalities? This article, based on 14
   months of ethnographic research, addresses this question through a
   comparative case study of two attempts to co-produce recycling services
   in Sao Paulo. The first, a grassroots organizing effort in the 1980s and
   1990s, improved the incomes and conditions of hundreds of waste pickers
   and inspired a national upsurge of waste picker organizing. The second,
   an ambitious overhaul of waste management in the early 2000s, generated
   about 1,500 jobs but functionally excluded the very population of street
   waste pickers it was designed to benefit. The findings suggest that
   co-production is most likely to lead to pro-poor outcomes if concerted
   efforts are made to level inequalities between poor constituents and
   more powerful stakeholders during processes of policy design and
   implementation.},

Abstract = {While there has been a flurry of research on party system
   institutionalisation (PSI) and regionalist parties, very little research
   has been conducted on their imbrication. This study aims to fill this
   gap by analysing the impact of local parties on the party system in
   post-conflict Aceh, Indonesia. It contends that the presence of local
   parties in Aceh has had a hybrid effect on the institutionalisation of
   the party system. Similar to national parties, local parties in
   Indonesia have weak societal roots and party organisations that obstruct
   PSI in Aceh. That notwithstanding, local parties in post-conflict Aceh
   have assisted in solidifying the party system by improving the
   legitimacy of parties and elections and by creating a less fragmented
   party system. This hybrid effect is also strongly influenced by Aceh's
   long wartime history and its post-conflict status.},

Abstract = {This article explores the definitions of Eurasian identity utilising the
   authority-defined, everyday-defined, and national identity concepts by
   Shamsul Amri. The authority-defined explains the influence of authority
   figures such as the British administration during the colonial era and
   the Malaysian government during the postcolonial era via established
   bumiputera-based policies that have impacted the Eurasian community,
   alongside the Eurasian Associations in Malaysia, which acts as an
   authority in preserving and curating Eurasian culture and identity. The
   everyday-defined concept focuses on personal experiences of Eurasians,
   specifically on the hybridity of culture, religion and language that
   shifts as newer generations emerge. Findings show that Eurasians defined
   according to the authority-defined concept is based on the governmental
   documentation such as their birth certificate whereas the
   everyday-defined concept is based on ancestral lineage and peranakan
   heritage that has been established by Malaysian society.},

Abstract = {We provide an introduction of the functioning, implementation, and
   challenges of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify visual
   information in social sciences. This tool can help scholars to make more
   efficient the tedious task of classifying images and extracting
   information from them. We illustrate the implementation and impact of
   this methodology by coding handwritten information from vote tallies.
   Our paper not only demonstrates the contributions of CNNs to both
   scholars and policy practitioners, but also presents the practical
   challenges and limitations of the method, providing advice on how to
   deal with these issues.},

Abstract = {Universities play a crucial role in building the economic development
   capacity for their communities and regions. Their capacity building role
   is typically defined by contributions to the economic bottom line of the
   community and region where a university is located. This kind of
   capacity building may find itself in conflict with the long-term
   sustainable development needs of the region and with the responsibility
   of the university itself. Sustainable capacity building may require
   strategies that focus on the specific social, cultural, environmental,
   and physical context of a university's location beyond purely economic
   capacity goals. To achieve sustainable development outcomes,
   universities must advance an understanding of the context conditions
   within which they are located. At least three context systems are
   relevant to this view of development: the economy, society and culture,
   and the environment with its physical, biological, and ecological
   context conditions. Each of these context systems is characterized by
   distinct time frames, spatial configurations, rules, and success
   measures. A focus on economic development outcomes reflects only one
   subsystem's rules, behaviors, and success measures. By analyzing two
   case study examples from the United States and South Africa, we offer a
   framework for universities to advance sustainability objectives that
   correspond to their broader responsibilities. We argue that in order to
   meet these broader responsibilities, universities must first commit to
   giving expression to their own local context through the voices and
   lived realities of students and residents. Since universities build the
   brain trust of communities and regions around the world, they play an
   essential role in strengthening global sustainability goals by building
   the local capacity of their communities and regions.},

Abstract = {Afghanistan is a vulnerable country, and various challenges have led to
   widespread poverty. This study measured the different dimensions of
   poverty in rural and urban areas to help policymakers with poverty
   alleviation in the Kunduz province of Afghanistan. The data were
   collected from 360 rural and urban households. According to the
   findings, the MPI index in the Kunduz province's rural and urban areas
   was found to be 0.483 and 0.445, respectively. The results indicate that
   Kunduz faces both rural and urban poverty, but that rural poverty is
   more severe than urban poverty. The intensity and headcount ratio of
   poverty in rural areas is more significant than in urban areas. It also
   is clear that all dimensions of poverty in Kunduz are very serious.
   Thus, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive program to reduce all
   aspects of poverty.},

Abstract = {This research examines the causal impact of institutional quality on
   economic development from a novel perspective. At the country level, we
   exploit variation in the natural malaria prevalence in 1900, just before
   vector-control methods were developed, to instrument for institutional
   quality using a two-stage least squares instrumental variables
   framework. Our instrument is a population-weighted average of malaria
   endemicity estimates for the year 1900 developed by the World Health
   Organization scientists in the 1960s. We argue that this measure of
   historical malaria offers more expansive geographic information about
   the disease environment, and our baseline IV estimates reveal that
   greater institutional quality causes greater contemporaneous economic
   growth. Next, we investigate the robustness of these baseline results to
   alternative explanations, including the role of geography and the role
   of early colonizers' experiences, as the causal link between the early
   disease environmental, institutional quality, and contemporary growth.
   As an additional test of the explanatory power of malaria endemicity in
   1900 as an instrumental variable, we replace our instrument for settler
   mortality and replicate the core results from the seminal study on
   colonial origins of comparative development by Acemoglu et al. (2001).
   In summary, we propose that malaria endemicity estimated for 1900
   holistically explains the legacy of early disease on institutional
   quality development and contemporary economic development, thus
   significantly contributing to the resolution of the geography versus
   institutions debate.},

Title = {Forming an anti-imperialist national identity in Republican China: The

Abstract = {This article focuses on Finnish national identities because they
   expressed the shared experiences of newly established Finnish
   communities, and they were crucial in constructing a new nation. It also
   explores created images of the Finnish and Finland, as well as community
   construction in Republican China, especially after Finland gained
   independence in 1917. Another aim is to examine those Finnish political,
   cultural and economic activities that supported their identity
   construction in China. The specific emphasis will be on analysing the
   largest and sometimes cross-functioning Finnish groups in China: the
   governmental officials and the commercial community. By using
   qualitative methods, namely, discourse analysis and historical analysis,
   this study shows how the Finnish community created alternative,
   sometimes imaginative and frequently anti-imperialist national
   identities in the new Republican China. Indeed, by signing the Treaty
   Principles of Reciprocity and Equal Treatment, it was agreed that
   Finland and China `shall enjoy same rights, privileges, favours,
   immunities and exemptions which {[}might] be accorded to similar foreign
   agents in accordance with the principles of international law'. This
   article argues that Finnish aspirations were positively regarded by many
   Chinese, and they respected this quite unique national connection with
   Finland.},

Abstract = {This article disputes recent studies that find no relationship between
   homicides and vigilantism. Using a unique panel dataset that controls
   for time and region, this study shows that the relationship exists. The
   evidence is consistent with the theory of low-capacity states: high
   homicide rates indicate unchecked criminal enclaves that further corrode
   trust in police. The territorial gaps in the central state's presence
   that O'Donnell once called ``brown areas{''} cost people their lives.
   Vigilantes react through defensive movements in which ordinary people
   substitute for the police to fill a security gap. The panel results also
   indicate that wealth inequality matters. Business people reportedly
   finance the vigilante organizations, which helps them to sustain
   collective action over time. Together with income inequality, Mexico's
   low-capacity state facilitated an armed vigilante movement between 2012
   and 2015.},

Abstract = {This article examines five years of legislation and constitutional
   reform under former President Rodrigo R. Duterte. An overview of
   post-1986 republic acts shows administrations being more successful in
   legislating social and economic laws than political laws. President
   Duterte is no exception to this, yet his presidency stands out in both
   legislative productivity and the passage of long-overdue laws. This
   success is due in part to high presidential approval, a supermajority
   coalition in Congress, and a unified Cabinet. These strengthen his
   influence over Congress, raising expectations that charter change can be
   fulfiled. His administration's failed attempt at federalism then raises
   questions on his commitment to the policy in the first place. Despite a
   populist campaign and institutional means at his disposal, Duterte does
   not appear any different from his predecessors who prioritised economic
   laws favoured by the business class over deep political reform with
   broader implications on governance and development.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the construction and role of national memory in
   exile through the intersection of nationalism and memory studies.
   Building on descriptions of the Georgian emigre memory, its comparison
   with the Soviet Georgian identity and its travelling trajectory, this
   study illustrates the potential of subaltern national exilic memory. My
   research data on prominent Georgian emigres are juxtaposed with a recent
   historical study of the internal diaspora of prominent Georgians in the
   Soviet Union. This is a story of postcolonial intellectuals and
   nationalist elites who acted as a carrier group in 1921, advocating
   internationally against the suffering of Soviet Georgians. Exiles
   produced an alternative account, comprised of four counternarratives, to
   that of the Soviet Union. These identified narratives constitute a
   stored memory that became an available past for Georgia. The safeguarded
   emigre memory was negotiated, recovered, used for centennial
   celebrations in 2018 and finally reintegrated into the national body.},

Abstract = {Support for redistribution in developing countries has been found to be
   weakly related to income, meaning the poor are not much likelier than
   the rich to support redistribution. If not economic self-interest, what
   explains support for redistribution? A multilevel regression analysis
   covering a decade of public opinion data from 18 Latin American
   countries finds support for explanations centered on social affinity.
   Specifically, people in more culturally divided countries are less
   supportive of redistribution. This relationship is strongest among
   low-income individuals, who are more likely to support redistribution
   than richer people in countries with low levels of diversity, but no
   more likely and, by some measures, less likely to support redistribution
   where diversity is highest. Economic distance between groups also
   matters. Support for redistribution increases when middle-class incomes
   are closer to those of the poor than the rich. Support declines as the
   middle class pulls ahead of the poor.},

Abstract = {The notion of digital sovereignty, also often referred to as
   technological sovereignty, has been gaining momentum in the European
   Union's (EU) political and policy discourses over recent years. Digital
   sovereignty has come to supplement an already substantial engagement of
   the EU with the digital across various security policy domains. The goal
   of this article arid of the overall Special Issue is to explore how the
   discourse and practices of digital sovereignty redefine European
   security integration. Our core argument is that digital sovereignty has
   both direct and indirect implications for European security as the EU
   attempts to develop and control digital infrastructures (sovereignty
   over the digital), as well as the use of digital tools for European
   security governance (sovereignty through the digital). It is thus
   essential to further explore digital sovereignty both in terms of
   European policies and of a re-articulation of sovereign power and
   digital technologies - what we suggest calling digital/sovereignty.},

Abstract = {Using data based on the national Labour Force Survey, we examine the
   extent to which immigrants coming to Ireland over a twenty-year period
   from 1998 to 2019 have assimilated into the labour market based on
   occupational level, education, employment sector, union membership and
   rates of unemployment. Overall, immigrants enjoyed conditions in the
   labour market in 1998 at least as good, if not better than, nationals
   and appeared to be relatively well assimilated. In contrast, immigrants
   by 2019 were at a disadvantage compared to nationals, indicating reduced
   levels of assimilation. A plausible explanation for these trends is the
   shift away from immigrants mainly from the UK and EU15 in 1998 who had
   similar cultural (and linguistic) and racial/ethnic characteristics, and
   a move towards immigrants originating mainly from Eastern European
   countries and the rest of the world in 2019. However, our results show
   that immigrants from Eastern European countries were the least
   assimilated group despite their European origin and cultural
   compatibility with native Irish.},

Abstract = {This article deals with missing persons in Armenia. So far around 5,000
   people from all sides in the Nagomo-Karabakh conflict have been reported
   as having gone missing. This article contextualises the democratic and
   human rights situation in Armenia and argues that if progress is to
   occur, there needs to be a coordinating mechanism involving all conflict
   parties to search, recover, and identify the missing. One sign of
   progress is that a new Commission - the Inter-Agency Commission on rows,
   Hostages and Missing Persons - was established in Armenia in 2019, and a
   new decree adopted. However, it needs to be reformed to allow it to be
   better suited to achieve the necessary goals. The study examines the law
   on the missing and finds that there is much confusion about the
   legislation, as it is scattered and often vague and unclear. The laws
   are aimed at, and applicable to, criminal cases, and not the
   humanitarian nature of such instances. It therefore argues that a new
   law ought to be adopted. A variety of recommendations are made in the
   article such as the need to enhance information collection, to find
   potential burial sites, and to systematically map and protect possible
   burial sites to ensure that future recovery and identification processes
   are not hindered.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the influence of the French composer and
   musicologist Charles Bordes (1863-1909) on the definition of `Basque
   music' both in the peninsular Basque Country and in Paris. On the one
   hand, it studies Bordes' ideological background, his vision of
   traditional Basque music and the acceptance of his shared musicological
   legacy in Basque regionalist and nationalist circles. On the other hand,
   it pays particular attention to the reception of his ideas in the
   Parisian musical milieu through the analysis of the criticism aroused by
   the premieres of two Basque-themed operas: Ramuntcho (1908) and Chiquito
   (1909). This article frames Bordes' activity within the regionalist
   movement in France. However, it also draws attention to the
   transnational and ambivalent nature of regionalism, especially in
   cross-border spaces, where regionalist discourses could take divergent
   forms according to the different nationalist agendas with which they
   were associated.},

Title = {Emerging Dynamics in Malaysia-Japan Relations under the Second Mahathir
   Administration},
Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Number = {02},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Japan and Malaysia established relations in 1957, the year Malaysia
   obtained independence from the British. Malaysia has largely benefited
   through many Japanese assistance programs, and in return, the country
   has remained one of Japan's closest friends in Southeast Asia. During
   his first premiership, Mahathir introduced the Look East Policy (LEP) as
   a major foreign policy re-direction, moving away from the Western
   approach adopted by his predecessors. Nevertheless, bilateral relations
   plateaued during the reign of the two successive prime ministers
   Abdullah Badawi and Najib Razak primarily as a result of the changing
   regional geopolitical landscape. Malaysia moved closer towards an
   emerging China. However, the May 2018 general election paved the way for
   Mahathir to resume control of the country for the second time after a
   lapse of 15 years. Within less than a year, Japan started to bounce back
   in Malaysia's political and strategic sensors. Japan is set to play a
   greater role in the Malaysian economic landscape, especially with its
   assistance of low-interest samurai bonds to aid the debt-stricken new
   Malaysian government. For Japan, this rekindling of old friendship could
   not have been more timely and may translate into greater support to
   Japan's initiatives for regional peace and for a free and open
   Indo-Pacific region. This paper examines the evolving trends in
   bilateral relations between Japan and Malaysia in the second Mahathir
   administration. More specifically, it explicates the external and
   domestic sources which have affected and recalibrated Malaysia's Japan
   policy in the context of a shifting regional strategic milieu as well as
   an evolving post-election domestic political landscape. This paper
   contends that the emerging dynamics and trajectories in Malaysia's
   relations with Japan under the nascent ``Mahathirism 2.0{''} period have
   been primarily shaped by the country's ruling elite's perceptions of her
   external conditions in the context of East Asia's changing power
   dynamics, tempered by their domestic political considerations and
   leadership traits/idiosyncrasies. It further argues that despite the
   newly-minted Pakatan Harapan (PH) government's visible foreign policy
   adjustments indicating a possible shift of emphasis from China towards
   Japan, such recalibrations are yet to alter the fundamentals of
   Malaysia's Northeast Asia policy generally and its Japan policy
   specifically, an area in which the effects of structural conditions
   (proximity, power asymmetry, rivalries and uncertainties) continue to be
   informed by the Malaysian ruling elite's domestic political
   considerations as they strive as much to optimize the country's external
   interests as to consolidate their domestic legitimation.},

Abstract = {This article examines the outreach activities of the ongoing trials in
   the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). The ECCC
   was designed to hold the leaders of Cambodia's notoriously violent Khmer
   Rouge regime (1975-1979) accountable. Outreach programmes have now
   become part of transitional justice initiatives as means to anchor their
   work in local and national consciousness in target countries. Using
   ethnographic data gathered in 2019-2020, this article explores how
   outreach activities have changed over time as they have become subject
   to new influences. I focus in particular on how some local actors have
   begun appropriating them in ways that represent a `counter-translation'
   of the intentions originally propagated by the architects of the ECCC.},

Abstract = {Since 2011, while the principles of foreign policy ``independent,
   active, and non-aligned{''} under the respective governments under the
   Union Solidarity and Development Party and the National League for
   Democracy have remained the same, the foreign policy approaches -
   including the concept of non-alignment - of the two leaders of these
   governments have been quite different. This article describes the
   survival and foreign policy of the small country of Myanmar beyond the
   great power lens, arguing that the impact of strategic culture on the
   two governments since 2011 has differed because of the different levels
   of legitimacy enjoyed by the two leaders. The cornerstones of Myanmar's
   strategic culture are (1) that it shall never tolerate foreign
   interference, (2) that it shall always pursue self-reliance in its
   diplomacy, and (3) that the very nature of Myanmar is to be independent.},

Abstract = {This paper traces the evolution of the European Union's (EU) and Russian
   Federation's discourse on the Eastern Partnership (EaP) along four
   frames - economic, (geo)political, normative, and security. We discover
   the dynamic of the EaP discourse in Brussels and Moscow, developing from
   an economic and political initiative to an adversarial security
   understanding, underpinned by logics of geopolitical and normative
   competition. With this study, we illuminate the misalignment of the EU
   and Russia's interpretations of neighbourhood policy and show how it
   underpinned mutual mistrust and the clash over the future of the region.},

Abstract = {When do individuals in deeply divided societies participate in political
   activities aimed at increasing ethnic representation in cabinet
   ministries? I develop a cost-benefit framework to explain political
   engagement based on individuals' ethnic group membership and preferences
   for descriptive and substantive representation in cabinet ministries.
   Drawing on an original survey in North Macedonia, I find that ethnic
   Macedonians who value substantive representation are more likely to
   attend public meetings compared to Macedonians who value descriptive
   representation but that the opposite is true for ethnic Albanians. I
   also consider how willingness to attend public meetings changes when
   individuals value both descriptive and substantive representation. The
   results suggest that policy makers cannot assume that all members of the
   public have the same motivations for arguing for increased
   representation.},

Title = {20 Years of global climate change governance research: taking stock and

Abstract = {Research on global climate change governance is no longer primarily
   concerned with the international legal regime, state practice and its
   outcomes, but rather scrutinizes the intricate interactions between the
   public and the private in governing climate change. This broad trend has
   also taken center stage within the pages of INEA. Two decades after its
   establishment, we sketch the main theoretical debates, conceptual
   innovations and empirical findings on global climate change governance
   and survey the new generation of climate governance scholarship. In more
   detail, we sketch how climate governance research has developed into
   three innovative sub-debates, building on important conceptualizations
   and critical inquiries of earlier debates. Our aim is not so much to
   provide an all-encompassing assessment of global climate change
   governance scholarship in 2022, but rather to illustrate in what
   important ways current research is different from research in the early
   phase of INEA, and what we have learned in the process. First, we
   discuss scholarship on the bottom-up nature of climate governance,
   developing from earlier ideas on agency beyond the state and the
   transnationalization of governance arenas. Second, we review
   contributions that have more systematically engaged with the concept of
   governance architectures, resulting in a stimulating new academic debate
   on the characteristics of complex governance systems and the
   consequences of governance complexity and fragmentation. Third, we note
   a distinct normative turn in global environmental scholarship in general
   and global climate governance in particular, associated with question of
   access, accountability, allocation, fairness, justice and legitimacy.
   The assessment of each of these debates is centered around questions of
   effective and legitimate climate governance to counter the climate
   emergency. Finally, as a way of concluding, we critically reflect on our
   own scholarly shortcomings and suggest a modest remedy.},

Abstract = {After five years of pursuing a policy of appeasement towards China, the
   Philippines is incrementally and reluctantly shifting to ``limited hard
   balancing.{''} The goal is to constrain China's revisionist agenda in
   the South China Sea. This strategy entails building up the Philippine
   military's territorial defence capabilities, maintaining its alliance
   with the U.S., and forging security partnerships with other middle power
   like South Korean, Japan, and Australia. During his six-year term, the
   late President Benigno Aquino III stood up to China's expansive claim in
   the South China Sea. When Rodrigo Roa Duterte assumed the presidency in
   June 2016, he unravelled his predecessor's balancing policy towards
   China. Nonetheless, recent developments such as the People's Liberation
   Army Navy's hostile moves against the Armed Forces of the Philippines
   units on Philippine-occupied islands in the South China Sea and the
   delays in the promised Chinese public investments in the country
   prompted the Duterte Administration to review the appeasement approach
   and to mull over on a limited hard balancing policy. In conclusion, this
   article contends that the Duterte Administration is at the crossroads,
   figuring out if it will continue its appeasement stance or adopt a
   limited hard balancing policy towards China.},

Title = {In defence of the Baltic Sea region: (non-)allied policy responses to
   the exogenous shock of the Ukraine crisis},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},

Abstract = {This article analyses changes in national defence policies across the
   Baltic Sea region after the exogenous shock of the Ukraine crisis in
   2014. It draws on Punctuated Equilibrium Theory for theoretical
   guidance, particularly to understand the mechanisms leading to
   large-scale policy change after periods of relative stability. Since the
   outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, defence budgets in the Baltic Sea region
   have increased dramatically. Baltic Sea states invested in neglected
   capability development and redirected policy planning towards
   territorial and collective defence. By contrast, the Russian-Georgian
   conflict in 2008 had a negligible effect on the paradigm guiding defence
   planning processes, delayed and lukewarm policy responses let adaptation
   pressure grow. The empirical findings suggest that policy change
   reinforced post-2014 because a normative consensus emerged on why
   Europe's security order is at risk, a critical threshold of urgency was
   reached, setting off positive feedback cycles, and receptive policy
   venues, such as NATO, as well as capable external policy actors, such as
   the USA and the UK, put Baltic Sea security back on the agenda.},

Abstract = {International migration is a global challenge affecting peoples and
   nations all over the world. In the advanced economies and welfare states
   of Western Europe, integrating migrants presents political, social as
   well as economic challenges. Over the past 50 years, Denmark has made a
   remarkable U-turn on the immigration question. Once the author of one of
   the most liberal immigration policies in Western Europe, Denmark
   presently has one of the strictest. This chapter addresses the causes
   behind the Danish policy U-turn, and how it has affected the social,
   economic and political integration of immigrants in Denmark. The chapter
   shows how Danish immigration politics have turned from low to high
   salience and have undergone radical changes resulting in a tightening of
   both internal and external immigration policies. It has become far more
   difficult to obtain residence and citizenship in Denmark. These measures
   have limited influx although international refugee crises are difficult
   to control at the borders. Moreover, Danish integration policies have
   focused increasingly on obligations and incentives, primarily by cutting
   benefits. The Danish case however shows that reduction of social
   benefits only has a marginal positive short-term effect on employment
   but with some negative side effects. When it comes to education, the
   Danish welfare state has been relatively successful in integrating
   immigrants and descendants in the educational system.},

Abstract = {Sovereignty is at the core of many contemporary political debates in
   Africa. The chapter argues that sovereignty, while often portrayed as
   immutable, fixed, or clearly defined, is in fact a construct dependent
   on historical and geographical context. However, in the case of Africa,
   the Western conception of sovereignty, which the chapter refers to as `
   Wilsonian sovereignty', was hegemonically imposed through the process of
   colonization and decolonization. The chapter analyzes this process and
   how sovereignty as a hegemonic norm has become natural, disembodied, and
   internalized, still shaping post-colonial developments on the continent.
   Good governance discourses, as well as recent migration policies,
   continue to enforce hegemonic sovereignty. Nevertheless, since the end
   of the Cold War, Wilsonian sovereignty has become increasingly
   contested, with alternative imaginaries starting to emerge.},

Abstract = {Studies typically find that supporters of populist parties exhibit low
   political trust. Drawing on research on winner-loser gaps in political
   support and the consequences of political polarization on attitudes, I
   re-examine the association between populism and political trust taking
   into account the supported party's status in or outside of government,
   distinguishing between government leaders and junior coalition partners.
   I analyze data from the European Social Survey Rounds 1-9 from nine
   Central and Southern European countries that experienced populist
   parties as government leaders, combined with party characteristics from
   the Varieties of Party Identity and Organization as well as democracy
   scores from the Varieties of Democracy datasets. Results show that the
   effect of party status on political trust is stronger among supporters
   of populist than non-populist parties. Further, I find that supporters
   of populist governments enjoy greater trust advantages in less
   democratic contexts.},

Title = {Modes of Extraction in Latin America's Lithium Triangle: Explaining

Abstract = {Mitigating climate change requires a global transition from fossil fuels
   to a ``green economy{''} driven by renewable energies. This shift has
   fostered massive investments in mining resources, notably lithium in
   South America, needed to store renewable energies. These mining ventures
   often produce harmful externalities where lithium is located. In
   Argentina, a major producer, striking variation has occurred in the
   fortunes of lithium-mining projects. In some instances, mining companies
   offered concessions that mitigated environmental damage and improved
   local socioeconomic conditions. In others, companies made minimal
   concessions, and in a third set they halted projects in response to
   local resistance. Why do mining ventures result alternatively in
   negotiated, unnegotiated, or aborted extraction? The article proposes a
   new typology of modes of extraction together with a multilevel
   explanatory framework that centers on the strengths and strategies of
   transnational mining companies, subnational governments, and local
   communities in setting the terms for extracting lithium.},

Abstract = {Many large survey courses rely on multiple professors or teaching
   assistants to judge student responses to open-ended questions. Even
   following best practices, students with similar levels of conceptual
   understanding can receive widely varying assessments from different
   graders. We detail how this can occur and argue that it is an example of
   differential item functioning (or interpersonal incomparability), where
   graders interpret the same possible grading range differently. Using
   both actual assessment data from a large survey course in Comparative
   Politics and simulation methods, we show that the bias can be corrected
   by a small number of ``bridging{''} observations across graders. We
   conclude by offering best practices for fair assessment in large survey
   courses.},

Abstract = {Italy had a colonial empire in Africa in the areas of Libya and East
   Africa during the first half of the 20th century. The postage stamps
   issued for these areas served as instruments of propaganda for that
   empire. This paper uses the method of quantitative content analysis to
   determine which themes and ideological messages appear on the postage
   stamps of the Italian African colonies. The results show that, although
   more than half of them have an attitude of respect for the life of the
   indigenous population or the civilizational benefit of the colonial
   government, with the purpose of expressing the benevolence of its power,
   almost a quarter reflect attitudes of domination, especially in East
   Africa. Overall, an image of exoticism emerges that reinforces the idea
   of the Italian nation as a new empire that aimed to show itself to the
   world as such, especially starting in the 1930s.},

Title = {Exploiting and constructing legal ambiguity. UK arms exports to Saudi
   Arabia during the war in Yemen},

Abstract = {While ambiguity is a common feature of international obligations, there
   is a strong theoretical anticipation that ambiguities may be exploited,
   and obligations circumvented, under competing interests. This article
   largely backs this anticipation. The article scrutinises how ambiguous
   arms export control obligations are handled under strong incentives for
   arms export. The empirical case explored is the UK government's arms
   exports to Saudi Arabia during the war in Yemen. Exports continued
   despite evidence that the Saudi-led coalition was violating
   international humanitarian law (IHL) in Yemen, and despite obligations
   not to export if there is a risk that the exported equipment can be used
   in IHL violations. A resulting legal challenge against the UK government
   provides valuable information about the role of ambiguity in the
   implementation of arms export controls. Drawing on primary sources from
   the legal process, this article argues that the UK government has taken
   advantage of linguistic ambiguity. The article also argues that the
   government has engaged in the continuous construction of ambiguity
   around events in Yemen and around the ideal parameters for arms trade
   risk assessment. Together, these strategies have facilitated continued
   arms exports to Saudi Arabia.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the concept of international clientelism and
   discusses how this diplomatic tool was employed by Venezuela under Hugo
   Chavez and Nicolas Maduro as a means to get political support from
   several Latin American and Caribbean countries. We operationalize the
   concept and apply it to assess Venezuelan practices put forth in the
   region. We argue that the reach of Caracas's diplomatic strategy is
   broader and deeper than that of simple vote-buying tactics, as it
   implies the promotion of structural rather than contingent ties,
   shielding the country against unfavorable moves in international fora.
   An empirical test using data for all LAC countries for the years
   1999-2015 confirms that clientelistic linkages produced political
   support for Venezuela at the United Nations General Assembly while also
   moving its partners away from the United States in that institution.},

Title = {Malaysia and Northeast Asia: What Drives Small-State Forward Diplomacy?},
Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Number = {03},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper adopts a two-level model to explain Malaysia's forward
   diplomacy toward the Northeast Asian states, the larger economies beyond
   its immediate neighborhood of Southeast Asia. We contend that while such
   structural conditions as power dynamics drive and constrain the smaller
   state's agency toward the Northeast Asian nations, their effects are
   filtered by domestic politics, specifically the ruling elite's pathways
   of legitimation. The findings highlight that while diplomacy is almost
   always motivated by the imperatives of immediate reality and identity,
   there is a different genre of driver, that of nurtured necessity. This
   paper illustrates how Malaysia's outlook toward the Northeast Asian
   states-and its resulting active and anticipatory diplomacy-has been more
   ``discovered{''} than determined and why such diplomacy has been driven
   more by the elite's domestic political needs than the idiosyncrasies of
   its leaders.},

Abstract = {Since Indian Administered Kashmir's (IAK) `summer of unrest' of 2010,
   greater attention towards the contemporary Kashmir azadi, or freedom,
   movement has led to more active transnational organising by Kashmiris
   studying abroad as well as other young people who sympathise with this
   movement. Indian political elites have predominately framed the azadi
   movement as a separatist movement. However, this perception had not been
   shared by many Kashmiris who argue the territory has never legally been
   a part of India. The perception of being a separatist movement from
   outside of Kashmir has also shifted with a growing body of literature
   documenting human rights abuses alongside raising awareness to an
   international community of activists, which has led to an evolution of
   the azadi movement into a movement for social justice and human rights.
   This has been facilitated by social media spaces and heterogeneous
   activist groups framing their movement as aligned with other social
   justice movements and anti-discrimination campaigns. Framing the Kashmir
   self-determination movement as a human rights issue appeals to a wider
   spectrum of non-Kashmiri activists, especially those already involved in
   campaigns against the marginalisation of certain groups.},

Abstract = {The confinement measures implemented to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2
   disrupted daily life and increased the risk of poor mental and physical
   health. The COVID-19 pandemic also resulted in unprecedented disruptions
   to healthcare access due to both supply and demand factors, creating
   barriers to disease management. Thus, the objective of this study was to
   investigate the factors that influenced views on coping with confinement
   measures. For this study, we used data from the Eurobarometer 93.1. The
   sample consisted of 1016 individuals aged 15 years and over. The sample
   design was multi-staged and random (probability). For the purpose of the
   study, a multinomial logistic regression model was fitted and used views
   on the experience of coping with confinement measures as the outcome
   variable. Several demographic, health-related, and economic factors were
   used as independent variables. According to the results, residents of
   more densely populated areas, females, and individuals who consider
   their personal health an important issue had more negative views of
   their experience during confinement measures. This was also true for
   individuals from financially worse-off households. The study results
   indicate a direct influence of economic and health-related factors on
   the experience of coping with the implemented confinement measures.},

Abstract = {Social-democratic parties face a dilemma between the universalist ethos
   of their socialist tradition and the nationalism that they share with
   the other political actors of the state where they act. In this paper,
   we examine comparatively the position of the Spanish party Partido
   Socialista Obrero Espanol (PSOE) and the Catalan party Esquerra
   Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) on three political debates that pertains
   to the link between welfare and identity in Spain. We show how these
   parties experience opposite tensions between nationalism and the
   universalism of their left-wing ideology. Whereas ERC calls for a
   withdrawal from the Spanish system of social security, the PSOE
   advocates imposing on Catalonia a symmetric form of solidarity with the
   rest of Spain, despite recognising the region's different identity.
   Above all, both parties take identity for granted as a pre-political
   factor that `naturally' justifies differential treatment, according to
   ERC, or equalising federalism, in the case of the PSOE.},

Abstract = {The UK Labour Party, which in government delivered devolution to
   Scotland and Wales, has struggled to adapt to a multilevel and
   increasingly territorialised political space, where demands for
   significant territorial reform grow ever louder. These challenges
   intensified with the Scottish independence referendum and the United
   Kingdom's exit from the European Union. During this prolonged
   constitutional moment, the Labour Party has had to articulate the case
   for a plurinational and multicultural British identity and for the
   Union, and to a large degree, has struggled to do so. Capturing the
   period from 2012 to 2020, this article examines the discursive
   strategies adopted by the Labour Party and individuals within it. It
   identifies a deep discomfort, more pronounced in London and Edinburgh
   than in Cardiff, with the national questions and a reliance on largely
   instrumental arguments, albeit ones rooted in traditional left-wing
   values of welfare and social solidarity between working people.},

Abstract = {Effective pandemic response has become an increasingly important focus
   for research in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. While there are a
   number of variables that may be considered as influencing effective
   response, this paper focuses on the potential impact of an
   ``authoritarian advantage{''} in achieving an effective response in the
   period prior to pharmaceutical interventions being available with China
   as a case study. In essence, this paper explores whether China enjoys an
   authoritarian advantage, and if so, how it functions.
   This study compares China's SARS-CoV-1 (2003) response with its
   SARS-CoV-2 (2019) response by exploring the impact of the authoritarian
   advantage on the state's ability to effectively engage three key
   explanatory variables - centralized decision-making powers, public
   support and media engagement.},

Abstract = {High commodity prices have led to the proliferation of informal gold
   mining in the Andes. Despite their limited financial capacity, informal
   gold miners have proved capable of influencing national-level policy
   outcomes. Why are they able to do so? This study puts forward a
   comparative study of Bolivia, where informal miners have been
   politically incorporated, and Peru, where they have been traditionally
   excluded. It shows how, despite the very different institutional
   contexts, informal miners are similarly capable of leveraging their
   contribution to the local economy and the fracture between the central
   state and its peripheral branches to form pressure groups with local
   authorities. Based on 120 interviews with politicians and leaders from
   the largest gold-mining communities in Bolivia and Peru, this study
   contributes to the scholarship on state-society relations, resource
   politics, and decentralization by outlining the conditions and mechanism
   through which informal groups contest exclusionary resource governance
   in fragmented states.},

Abstract = {This article aims to provide a conceptual framework for exploring the
   relations between liberal nationalism and religion. Combining
   multidimensional analyses of autonomy as well as religion, the article
   aims to provide a framework for considering, with greater precision,
   different potential versions of liberal nationalism, and which kinds of
   prioritisations and trade-offs they would involve. Religion is
   approached in terms of Wittgensteinian family resemblances, referring to
   a host of overlapping narratives, norms, objects and practices. Autonomy
   is analysed in terms of collective and individual autonomy, and the
   latter is divided into four major dimensions: liberty (freedom from
   coercion) opportunity (available options) capacity (for making choices)
   and authenticity (the degree to which choices are genuine). These,
   furthermore, may be distributed differently across space and time: for
   example, liberty may be restricted in the present to preserve it over
   time. Liberal nationalism ultimately has to balance intrinsic and
   instrumental arguments, while respecting human rights.},

Title = {How Much Does the Cardinal Treatment of Ordinal Variables Matter? An

Abstract = {Many researchers use an ordinal scale to quantitatively measure and
   analyze concepts. Theoretically valid empirical estimates are robust in
   sign to any monotonic increasing transformation of the ordinal scale.
   This presents challenges for the point-identification of important
   parameters of interest. I develop a partial identification method for
   testing the robustness of empirical estimates to a range of plausible
   monotonic increasing transformations of the ordinal scale. This method
   allows for the calculation of plausible bounds around effect estimates.
   I illustrate this method by revisiting analysis by Nunn and Wantchekon
   (2011, American Economic Review, 101, 3221-3252) on the slave trade and
   trust in sub-Saharan Africa. Supplemental illustrations examine results
   from (i) Aghion et al. (2016, American Economic Review, 106, 3869-3897)
   on creative destruction and subjective well-being and (ii) Bond and Lang
   (2013, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 95, 1468-1479) on the
   fragility of the black-white test score gap.},

Abstract = {The Central Committee (CC) of the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) is
   widely regarded as Vietnam's most important political institution.
   However, few studies have exclusively examined the development of the CC
   since the beginning of the Doi moi (Renovation) era. Based on a new
   biographical dataset of 626 CC members from the 6th to the 12th National
   Congress of the VCP, as well as Party's internal documents, this article
   examines the institutional self-evolution of the CC in three key
   aspects: (1) its changing structure and composition; (2) its
   decision-making principles; and (3) its norms of elite promotion. In so
   doing, we argue that the CC has moved from the periphery to the centre
   of Vietnamese elite politics, resembling the role of a ``shadow
   parliament{''} where major policies are deliberated and passed and where
   top leaders are chosen. The CC has achieved this position by developing
   and maintaining a considerably high level of intra-party democracy,
   expanding the selectorate by accommodating provincial elites and the
   National Assembly while greatly standardizing the norms of elite
   promotion. We also examine the impact of the CC's rising power on the
   factional dynamics by revisiting three main classifications of
   factionalism in Vietnam in light of the new biographical dataset. We
   argue that the failure to identify solid factional boundaries among
   Vietnamese political elites is the direct consequence of the CC's
   transformation since Doi moi.},

Abstract = {In Ethiopia after 1991, ethnic identities are the fundamental governing
   principles of politics. Not only has the process provided the
   institutional basis, but it has also created ethnic groups in a variety
   of ways. The discursive construction of Amhara identity in Ethiopia is
   the topic of this research. For a long time, the Amhara have identified
   as Ethiopians. The Amhara have been portrayed as the opponent of
   Ethiopia's Nations, Nationalities and Peoples (NNPs) since the second
   part of the 20th century, according to the hegemonic discourse of
   national oppression. Anti-Amhara sentiment, on the other hand, may be
   traced back to the Italian colonial period (1936-1941). Until recently,
   being and becoming Amhara was constructed from the outside and
   challenged from within. As a result, the characteristics of an ethnic
   political system that ushered in the post-1991 era, continued
   demonisation and societal fears all play a role in the formation of
   Amhara identity. As a `cultural security policy', embracing Amharaness
   has become a route out of these predicaments. Amharaness emerges from a
   counter-narrative that resurrects historical and symbolic myths.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted social media platforms to take
   unprecedented steps-ranging from false tags to journalistic
   factchecks-to stanch the flow of misinformation that could pose a health
   risk. However, there is little evidence about the relative efficacy of
   these approaches in this unique context of a pandemic. Using a pair of
   survey experiments, we examine whether false tags and journalistic
   factchecks reduce accuracy misperceptions and sharing propensity on
   social media that can spread false claims. False tags had little effect
   on subjects' accuracy assessments and social media sharing. Journalistic
   factchecks that offer accurate information to counter misinformation
   were more effective in reducing both misperceptions and sharing on
   social media. Further, we find no evidence of partisan backfire effects,
   even in response to interventions against claims with a plausible
   partisan valence. Our results suggest that journalistic factchecks
   provide an effective counternarrative to COVID-19 misinformation even in
   the context of the increasing politicization of America's pandemic
   response and polarization more generally.},

Abstract = {This study discusses the socialisation experiences of young Chinese from
   two different education backgrounds and media environment. Through a
   survey on the attitudes of students from Macau and mainland China
   towards nationalism-related news events using a survey, this study has
   revealed that their education social background and media-use patterns
   have a greater impact on students' attitudes towards political events
   (military parade and Occupy Central) than cultural events (Tu Youyou's
   Nobel Prize and championship of women's volleyball team), and the
   differences of their attitudes vary depending on the events in question.
   Moreover, mainland students are more nationalistic and supportive of the
   official mainland media's discourse on sovereignty issues, but more
   sceptical of its sources on events of conflicts between Chinese
   ethnicities. The findings of this study have revealed how wider media
   exposure impacts the attitudes of individuals; additionally, it responds
   to the debates on whether people are more inclined to recognise their
   existing common identities or influenced by the political regimes
   constructed by the elites; most importantly, it tests the socialising
   experiences of nationalism among young Chinese from different
   educational and media backgrounds.},

Abstract = {While food innovation is heavily influenced by the myriad of policies,
   regulations and other environmental factors within a country,
   globalization means that food innovation is also a matter of
   international competitiveness. This benchmarking exercise uses 24
   variables to compare the different innovation environments across ten
   countries: Canada, the US, Mexico, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, the
   Netherlands, Japan, and Australia. Quantitative and qualitative data was
   collected from publicly available sources only to measure each variable
   and ultimately provide a ranking. Qualitative data was evaluated using
   thematic coding to establish baseline practices and then compare each
   country to the baseline. Quantitative data was evaluated by constructing
   an average to which each country was compared. Countries whose data
   showed they met the average were awarded two points, and those who
   performed above or below average were either awarded an additional point
   or saw a point deducted. A final ranking was established from the scores
   across all four pillars, and the ranking was weighted to account for
   lacking data. The final weighted ranking saw the UK rank first, followed
   by the US, Germany, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Japan, Mexico,
   France and finally, Italy in tenth place.},

Abstract = {The Paris Agreement is increasingly being used as an analogy in global
   environmental politics to discuss issues beyond climate change. This
   Forum article explores the two main ways in which this analogy has been
   discursively employed: as a symbol of diplomatic success to be emulated
   and as a model for institutional treaty design. It illustrates the
   broader meanings associated with the Paris Agreement, reflecting its
   preeminent public and political profile among environmental issues just
   a few years into its history and its potential significance in shaping
   subsequent global environmental negotiations.},

   difference?},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {523-538},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Liberal nationalism has been the subject of increased attention in the
   wake of the 2010s rise in national populism. It has been seen to offer a
   concessionary form of national identity which is compatible with the
   liberal values of inclusivity and egalitarianism. This paper argues that
   recent attempts to delineate the contours of a specifically liberal
   national identity fail to highlight much that is distinctively liberal,
   as opposed to conservative, about its content. The criteria that such
   attempts propose typically apply almost equally to conservative
   accounts, thereby overshooting the target. However, further ideological
   excavation reveals that there is an alternative axis for distinguishing
   between liberal and conservative conceptions of national identity:
   democratic inclusivity. The paper further proposes that shifting the
   emphasis to this dimension, and to liberal and conservative accounts
   differing aims and formation processes, is conducive to both greater
   ideological transparency and bridging the gap between theory and
   practice.},

   of Profile Distribution},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-45},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Conjoint analysis has become popular among social scientists for
   measuring multidimensional preferences. When analyzing such experiments,
   researchers often focus on the average marginal component effect (AMCE),
   which represents the causal effect of a single profile attribute while
   averaging over the remaining attributes. What has been overlooked,
   however, is the fact that the AMCE critically relies upon the
   distribution of the other attributes used for the averaging. Although
   most experiments employ the uniform distribution, which equally weights
   each profile, both the actual distribution of profiles in the real world
   and the distribution of theoretical interest are often far from uniform.
   This mismatch can severely compromise the external validity of conjoint
   analysis. We empirically demonstrate that estimates of the AMCE can be
   substantially different when averaging over the target profile
   distribution instead of uniform. We propose new experimental designs and
   estimation methods that incorporate substantive knowledge about the
   profile distribution. We illustrate our methodology through two
   empirical applications, one using a real-world distribution and the
   other based on a counterfactual distribution motivated by a theoretical
   consideration. The proposed methodology is implemented through an
   open-source software package.},

Abstract = {The most appropriate way of looking into each important political era in
   the modern history of Ethiopia is to carefully study the evolution of
   political debates and contentious issues in order to learn the apposite
   lessons. Such efforts are critical in our articulation of possible
   theoretical foundations and causal explanations, and are also helpful in
   terms of future research undertaking\& Throughout the presentation of
   such historical narratives, however, the political culture embedded in
   the Ethiopian state looms large. In this chapter, therefore, the
   political culture in the Ethiopian context is first investigated; and
   doing so also serves as an approach for looking at democratic failings,
   regardless of the unfair nature of any expectations, given the
   historical realities of the times examined. Most importantly, it is
   worth paying close attention to how the political elite in their
   respective eras were able to survive the challenges coming from voices
   of reform and critics alike.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the concept of platform nations to capture an
   important recent shift in the way nations and nationalism operate in the
   public domain. If the rise of the internet initially led to a weakening
   of state control over public expressions of national belonging, the
   growing monopoly of platforms enables states to reassert control over
   national imagination, while also opening doors for other political and
   corporate actors to interfere in the process. This shift appears to be
   contributing, at least in some parts of the world, to a disciplining of
   national imagination online, partially reversing the trend to greater
   democratisation seen in the early stages of the internet.},

Abstract = {The community plays a significant role in everyday life in rural African
   contexts, particularly in terms of coping and in times of crisis. In the
   East African region, rural communities are diverse and complex, yet most
   share similar vulnerabilities such as widespread poverty, lack of
   infrastructure and basic services, and exclusion from broader economic
   and political developments. They are also highly affected by processes
   of modernization, globalization, and rural-urban migration. Social work
   as a profession that deals with social problems is deemed suitable to
   support rural communities in their struggle for survival. In order to
   understand the link between community-based forms of problem solving and
   social work practice, a qualitative study was conducted in five
   countries (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda). A total of 155
   qualitative interviews and 55 focus group discussions with key
   informants were conducted. The research revealed a variety of indigenous
   knowledge systems and innovative coping mechanisms. For rural social
   work to be relevant and effective, such models should be thoroughly
   analyzed and integrated into its professional concepts and practice. In
   this article, some case examples are presented and critically discussed
   against the background of the African philosophical concept of ubuntu,
   which is regarded as the ethical backbone of communal life.},

Abstract = {This article explores the perceptions of personal (in)security in the
   public space of Tbilisi, Georgia following the Rose Revolution in 2003.
   Based on the concept of vernacular security, I suggest a bottom-up
   approach to the subject, focusing on its culturally and socially
   specific character and observing the production of the discourses of
   (in)security at the intersecting notions of modernisation/backwardness,
   formality/ informality, criminality/lawfulness, and the West/Russia,
   reflecting post-revolutionary political, social, and cultural
   transformations. While the government of the Rose Revolution introduced
   full-scale reforms formalising security in Georgia, the article reveals
   that citizens' perceptions of personal (in)security in the public space
   are often ambiguous and even self-contradicting, as they waver between
   the notions of formality and informality, often interpreting the same
   phenomenon as a source of both their security and insecurity.},

Abstract = {The 2008 economic crisis brought new scholarly attention to Southern
   European radical left parties (SERLPs). Yet, important aspects of these
   parties remain empirically unexplored, such as their programmatic
   development. Using empirical data from party manifestos, this article
   examines the programmatic evolution of SERLPs during the 2010s - a
   decade full of crises (economic, migration, climate). Despite their
   different trajectories on various policy dimensions, the results suggest
   that these parties were able to adapt their programmatic appeals to
   capitalize on poor economic conditions and growing discontent with the
   EU, while showing signs of being attentive to the emergence of new
   issues on the public agenda - such as anti-growth concerns. Moreover,
   they also provide support for a moderating effect of government
   participation (and proximity to power) on RLPs.},

Abstract = {How do state leaders use crisis management to strengthen state
   infrastructural power? What explains the strategic choices of a state's
   selective institutionalization of crisis measures? Crises offer unique
   opportunities for state-building, yet the role of crisis management in
   consolidating state power is underexamined. This paper explores these
   important issues by examining how the Chinese government has deployed
   wartime-like measures in battling the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory
   Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. While authorities in China have adopted
   unconventional measures in managing the crises, they have selectively
   normalized ad hoc practices and institutionalized certain measures to
   strengthen state infrastructural power once they have ended or been
   temporarily contained. Drawing on the frameworks of rational choice and
   historical institutionalism, our analysis suggests that the central
   government normalizes or institutionalizes measures that help to
   consolidate its control of the bureaucracy and enhance regime
   legitimacy.},

Abstract = {Finland has been concerned about the political and security policy
   implications of the UK's withdrawal from the EU, not to mention the
   negative economic impact. The departure of the EU's third-largest member
   state with its significant diplomatic and military assets has been
   described as a loss for EU foreign and security policy and as a rupture
   of European political cohesion. Drawing on the theoretical literature on
   small states and Europeanisation, this article investigates how Finland
   has responded to these challenges and the related risks. It is suggested
   that the post-Brexit political consolidation of the EU was a priority
   for Finnish government(s) as the increasingly turbulent global and
   regional environment yet again highlights the security-policy benefits
   of Finland's EU membership. The analysis also points towards the further
   Europeanisation of Finnish foreign and security policy as a
   Brexit-related hedging strategy. Finland also sought to hedge against
   some of the perceived risks embedded in the changing political dynamics
   of the EU and, relatedly, the loss of a powerful northern political ally
   in major EU economic matters.},

Abstract = {This study identifies how aid has contributed to economic and social
   development in recipient African countries. Spatial panel models were
   employed for the analysis, considering spatial autocorrelation of panel
   data between 42 countries and nine years from 2005 to 2013. Based on the
   regression results, the aid itself had a weak impact on recipients' GDP
   per capita and Human Development Index. On the other hand, according to
   the interaction term, aid promoted economic and social development along
   with affirmative government efficiency. The efficient and centralized
   administrative system and civic accountability also improved the
   aggregated well-being level in Africa.},

Abstract = {Governments played an essential role in mitigating the social,
   political, health and economic impact and outcomes of COVID-19. Most
   literature limits the role of the state at the national level by
   focusing on the pandemic's impact on economic growth, unemployment,
   poverty and state responses. This approach neglects the role played by
   subnational governments in managing the pandemic. In response to this
   predicament, this article explores the territorial socio-economic impact
   of COVID-19 and the responses adopted by subnational governments through
   the case studies of eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality and KwaDukuza
   Local Municipality in South Africa. A territorial understanding of the
   pandemic and responses is important because of the spatial dimensions of
   the pandemic. Methodologically, the article utilises data from a survey
   conducted with informal workers in the two municipalities. The article
   shows the diverging impact and responses from the two municipalities,
   and how pre-existing socio-economic structures reinforced prevailing
   challenges. The article argues that a territorial understanding of the
   pandemic allows governments to adopt targeted interventions to enhance
   the effectiveness of responses to the different spatial dimensions of
   the pandemic.},

Abstract = {Are `white nationalists' really nationalists? This label is one that
   right-wing, white activists themselves have chosen, and as such, compels
   rigorous investigation to avoid simply adopting the preferred
   nomenclature of these activists and their ambitions. The nation and
   nationalism are concepts with rich scholarly histories, and this paper
   seeks to examine the discussion, activities and statements of so-called
   white nationalists in light of this literature. We argue through a
   three-fold concept of the nation-based on territoriality, population and
   symbolic and/or cultural content-that the vision of the political
   community and ambitions of these activists falls short of the standard
   of a nation and that their aspirations do not conform to what the
   literature lays out as nationalism. We argue, therefore, that using the
   language of `white nationalism' to describe these groups obfuscates and
   sanitises their motives and lends undue legitimacy to their standing in
   public discourse.},

Title = {Nationalist identities, preferences and voting for sub-state nationalist
   parties in the Flemish region of Belgium},
Journal = {NATIONS AND NATIONALISM},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},

Pages = {1356-1378},

Abstract = {There is an ongoing academic debate about the question whether sub-state
   nationalist parties should be considered as niche parties, focusing
   almost exclusively on their core issue of centre-periphery relations, or
   whether their electoral appeal can be considered as multidimensional. In
   that case, these other dimensions can vary with regard to the specific
   ideological position, historical circumstances and strategic
   considerations. In this article, we address this theoretical question by
   relying on the case study of the sub-state nationalist parties in the
   Flemish region of Belgium, where they jointly obtained 44\% of the vote
   in the most recent elections. Comparing election surveys from 2009, 2014
   and 2019 suggests that the electoral appeal of these parties rests on a
   mixture of nationalist issues, right-wing economic policies and a
   restrictive attitude towards immigration. These results suggest that
   sub-state nationalist parties are not purely niche parties, but should
   be seen as multiple issue parties, and this broader electoral appeal can
   explain the discrepancy between electoral results and public opinion on
   the core issues of these parties.},

Abstract = {Theories of economic nationalism have shown that identities can be
   constructed around various economic discourses. Yet, much of the
   literature focuses on official discourses while empirical tests on the
   citizen level are short in supply. The debate about the European demos
   exemplifies this shortcoming as EU institutions construct two competing
   visions of a European identity around economic issues. The European
   economy is depicted as a neoliberal competitor or as an economic space
   characterised by a social model. This paper investigates which of these
   two official visions EU citizens subscribe to. Based on 18 focus group
   interviews in France, Germany and Poland, I argue that citizens only
   share a conception of a European social model while a marriage of
   neoliberalism and nationalism can be detected for national economies.
   These findings highlight the importance of studying everyday nationhood,
   as not all official visions can be expected to resonate with citizens.
   Studies of discursive identity formation cannot only focus on official
   discourse, but should be flanked by investigations on the citizen level.},

Abstract = {This article examines the development of teaching and research in
   International Relations (IR) in Cambodia. It argues that IR is a
   relatively nascent academic discipline, but a growing one. The
   discipline started to develop incrementally in the 2000s, partially
   resulting from the internationalization of higher education and growing
   student demand in the country. This preliminary study finds that
   mainstream Western theories dominate the discipline in Cambodia and
   realism is the dominant school of thought within it. Cambodian scholars,
   nevertheless, have a growing interest in exploring and learning Global
   IR, especially Asian IR. National experiences and circumstances are the
   key sources for developing indigenous IR theories, potentially
   contributing to the debates on Global IR. The publications by Cambodian
   IR scholars at home and abroad are highly valued by the local academic
   community. However, the lack of institutional support and research
   funding constrains IR-related research and publishing in Cambodia.},

Abstract = {The EU's revised Cybersecurity Strategy (2020) has been constructed in
   the context of increasing geopolitical tension and within a dynamically
   evolving technological environment. The onset of new technologies has
   brought with it new opportunities but also perceived risks and threats
   in cyberspace, to which the EU has sought to elicit a more comprehensive
   approach underpinned by a move to become more ``technologically
   sovereign{''}. We seek in this article to critically unpack what such
   claims to technological sovereignty mean for the EU in the cyber domain
   and what the practical implications are of the EU taking ownership of
   and performing sovereignty. More specifically, in seeking to
   conceptually unpack technological sovereignty in its internal and
   external manifestations, we show how its articulation, legitimisation
   and operationalisation has implications and consequences for the EU's
   identity and action in the cyber domain.},

Abstract = {Conventional multidimensional statistical models of roll call votes
   assume that legislators' preferences are additively separable over
   dimensions. In this article, we introduce an item response model of roll
   call votes that allows for non-separability over latent dimensions.
   Conceptually, non-separability matters if outcomes over dimensions are
   related rather than independent in legislators' decisions. Monte Carlo
   simulations highlight that separable item response models of roll call
   votes capture non-separability via correlated ideal points and higher
   salience of a primary dimension. We apply our model to the U.S. Senate
   and the European Parliament. In both settings, we find that legislators'
   preferences over two basic dimensions are non-separable. These results
   have general implications for our understanding of legislative
   decision-making, as well as for empirical descriptions of preferences in
   legislatures.},

Year = {2022},

Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {445-472},

Abstract = {Racial reckoning in response to racial injustice has compelled
   individuals, organizations, and institutions to acknowledge and adopt
   policies that actively challenge racial injustice. A central tenet of
   this era of reckoning is that it is no longer acceptable to ignore
   racist behaviors and expressions. To the extent that active opposition
   to racial prejudice is an effective strategy for individuals to pursue,
   we examine individual inclinations to act on matters of racial
   prejudice. We argue that in spite of best intentions, the motivation to
   act against racism, what we call ``antiracism action orientation,{''}
   can be disrupted by system-justifying beliefs that raise questions about
   deservingness, legitimize the status quo, and therefore defend inaction.
   Survey data from the 2020 Congressional Election Study show that
   antiracism action orientation is strongest among African Americans, and
   those with more positive affect toward racial-ethnic minorities, and
   supporters of change. Among Whites, racial resentment dominates the
   motivations for antiracism to the point that typical political allies
   like Democrats, liberals, and those who acknowledge White privilege
   reduce their antiracism action orientation to lower levels than
   Republicans, conservatives, and deniers of White privilege. We conclude
   that most Americans, but especially Whites, have a high bar for change,
   making racism an ongoing American dilemma because of both racial
   attitudes and the costs of change.},

Abstract = {This study investigates whether the rationales for introducing carbon
   border adjustments (CBA) are consistent with theoretical predictions.
   Specifically, it addresses the following questions. When CBA is
   theoretically modelled for a level playing field in international trade,
   does it encourage climate efforts in developing countries, and does it
   improve global climate effectiveness? What are the implications for
   international environmental cooperation? The study highlights how the
   strategic interdependence between countries changes with the
   introduction of CBA by using a model that incorporates CBA into the
   two-stage reciprocal-markets model originated by Brander and Spencer
   (1984). Recognising that CBA is unidirectional, whereby only a country
   with a more stringent climate policy can impose CBA on imports, the
   results demonstrate that introducing CBA creates an incentive
   discrepancy between developed and developing countries; the former (the
   latter) may adopt a more aggressive (defensive) domestic climate policy.},

Abstract = {Contemporary societies are closely interconnected by transnational
   networks and flows (of people, goods, energy, information, money), which
   is a source of both opportunities and vulnerabilities. Connections and
   networks thrive in a liberal, norms-based environment. However, they are
   also imbued with power politics and geopolitical rivalry over who
   controls vital connections. The direction, density and quality of the
   connections of states to their external environment have important
   implications for their international position, security, and welfare. It
   is thus highly relevant that connectivity has been singled out as one of
   the key priorities of the Eastern Partnership (EaP). The article
   explores how the EU has developed connectivity with EaP countries, given
   the growing contestation between liberal and illiberal approaches to
   connectivity in the region. It discusses the linkages of connectivity to
   power, security, and resilience. It looks at examples in particular in
   the case of Ukraine and seeks to assess their implications for Ukraine's
   security and geopolitical position, and hence for European security more
   broadly. It argues that, in order to improve Ukraine's resilience and
   reduce vulnerability, it is important to connect the country better to
   European infrastructure and strengthen physical links such as roads,
   energy connections, and flows of trade.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},

Month = {2022 APR 2},
Abstract = {Conditionality requirements have been applied for decades in the
   Multiannual Financial Frameworks (MFF), and, over the years, these
   mechanisms have been extended and developed. In December 2020, the
   European Union legislature adopted the `Regulation on a general regime
   of conditionality for the protection of the Union budget' which includes
   the new rule of law mechanism. According to the regulation 2020/2092,
   the MFF for the period 2021-2027, as well as the Recovery and Resilience
   Facility and React-EU, should guarantee the link between the rule of law
   and the disbursement of EU funds. Above all, the new regulation will
   have an important impact on EU Cohesion Policy from 2021 to 2027. This
   article will conceptualise both existing and new conditionality
   instruments as included in the EU Cohesion Policy, and compare them with
   previous MFFs in order to assess the new conditionality regulations in
   the context of the debate on the development of the EU budget.},

Abstract = {Southeast Asia is beset by a host of maritime security threats including
   illegal fishing, piracy, smuggling and environmental crimes.
   Institutions responding to these issues have proliferated. This article
   systematically maps and demonstrates this new complexity and
   fragmentation using original empirical data. Focusing on blue crimes
   rather than territorial disputes, it argues that fragmentation, a
   non-hierarchical proliferation of arrangements, is a key driver of
   regional cooperation on maritime security, and that while conflict
   overlap and duplication are present between arrangements, the
   development of trust and collective identification between actors is
   having an overall positive effect on regional cooperation. The article
   further argues that this emerges from fragmentation in two ways. First,
   fragmentation creates more opportunities for sustained interaction,
   which can habituate cooperation due to the expanding web of meetings.
   Second, fragmentation, when well-managed, exposes an expanding set of
   actors to these trust-building processes. The article therefore provides
   new perspectives on regional dynamics and the state of cooperation in
   the field of maritime security.},

Abstract = {This article examines a series of cyber terror attacks in 2019 on
   academics who protested the bill revising Law No. 30/2002, also known as
   the Corruption Eradication Commission (Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi, or
   KPK) Law. Recent research has highlighted a shrinking civic space as one
   prominent sign of Indonesia's democratic regression. However, how and to
   what extent this shrinking has occurred in the digital public sphere is
   still not well understood. Based on interviews with 16 academics who
   were members of the movement and who were subjectedto cyber attacks,
   this article suggests that this amounts to ``cyber terrorism{''}. These
   attacks caused significant psychological distress to the academics
   involved and damaged the communications and coordination capacities of
   the movement, ultimately weakening it. This study argues that corrupt
   oligarchic elites were behind this ``cyber terror{''} campaign, given
   the sophisticated nature of the cyber attacks and the intended goal of
   suppressing the academic anti-corruption movement. These elites would
   benefit from a weakened KPK as it would no longer be able to effectively
   investigate corruption allegations involving some of its members. These
   findings reinforce the latest studies on Indonesia's democratic
   regression.},

Abstract = {This article compares the politics of history and positions in the EU of
   six ruling populist leaders and their parties (Fidesz, PiS, SDS, GERB,
   ANO and OLaNO) from Central and Eastern European (CEE) EU member states.
   Through the comparison of leaders' biographies and longitudinal analysis
   of party electoral manifestos an overlap between two types of CEE
   populism and two types of mnemonic actors in the region is found.
   Radical right- wing populist parties (Fidesz, PiS and SDS) are more
   oriented towards national histories, memory wars against ex-communists
   and critical events for losing or gaining their national sovereignty
   (mnemonic warriors). Centrist populist parties (GERB, ANO and OLaNO)
   largely ignore that kind of narrative and focus on anti-corruption or
   promises of managing the state more effectively (mnemonic abnegators).
   Radical rightwing populist parties are also more likely to challenge the
   Brussels elites by using examples from their national histories.
   Emphasis on national traumas, anti-communism and their leaders' vision
   of politics labelled here as combat tasks politics seems to be
   contributing to their Euroscepticism. Combat tasks politics, i.e. seeing
   politics as a constant battle against political enemies, underpins the
   Eurosceptic narratives of Kaczynski, Orban and Jansa-former dissidents
   who were politically socialised while challenging militarised communist
   regimes.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, political science literature has experienced
   significant growth in the popularity of nonlinear models with
   multiplicative interaction terms. When one or more constitutive
   variables are not binary, most studies report the marginal effect of the
   variable of interest at its sample mean while allowing the other
   constitutive variable/s to vary along its range and holding all other
   covariates constant at their means, modes, or medians. In this article,
   we argue that this conventional approach is not always the most suitable
   since the marginal effect of a variable at its sample mean might not be
   sufficiently representative of its prevalent effect at a specific value
   of the conditioning variable and might produce excessively
   model-dependent predictions. We propose two procedures to help
   researchers gain a better understanding of how the typical effect of the
   variable of interest varies as a function of the conditioning variable:
   (1) computing and plotting the marginal effects at all in-sample
   combinations of the values of the constitutive variables and (2)
   computing and plotting what we call the ``Distribution-Weighted Average
   Marginal Effect{''} over the values of the conditioning variable.},

Abstract = {For decades, combating climate change has been a global challenge, which
   requires jointly coordinated efforts by numerous, international actors.
   However, it has been shown time and again that agreeing on globally
   binding agreements without a global government proves difficult. To this
   end, this paper examines the possibility of a tolerance premium. This
   means a transfer payment in exchange for accepting and complying with
   the associated agreement. The provider of this tolerance premium
   determines the conditions of its payment to set desired incentives.
   Thus, collective decision making can also be self-enforced without a
   higher authority. This scenario is studied analytically based on Dixit's
   conflict model. The study shows that the optimal tolerance premium
   depends only on the value of the prize to the transferee and that this
   can result in a stalling of the conflict. The implications of this model
   shed light on the design of global climate agreements that are
   self-enforcing without the need for a global government. For this
   purpose, the upfront payment of funds and their reimbursement as a
   tolerance premium serve as an incentive to comply with collectively
   agreed rules in climate policy.},

Abstract = {This conceptual and reviewing article elaborates on the ontological
   aspects of EU public diplomacy (EU PD). It argues that conceptual
   clarity is much needed and that a comprehensive definition of EU PD
   would consider the messages (narrative), institutional design and actors
   involved in the design and delivery of EU PD. Future researchers should
   also consider the context of a targeted country or region, meaning its
   social, political, and economic conditions, as well as its past and
   contemporary relations with Europe. Hence, the study of EU PD appears to
   be particularly challenging, requiring a comprehensive and at the same
   time tailor-made approach.},

Abstract = {As Beijing is actively investing in and constructing infrastructure
   overseas within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
   numerous rumours and misconceptions have arisen about the changes China
   can and will bring through its infrastructure diplomacy. By way of an
   analysis of Chinese infrastructure projects and diplomatic activities in
   the Mediterranean, examining government documents, companies' briefings
   and media reports, we found that China's infrastructure diplomacy goals
   are two-fold: 1. to promote infrastructure cooperation and economic ties
   overseas through political means. 2. to enhance political trust between
   China and other countries via collaboration in infrastructure
   development. Despite the preliminary achievements, both China's economic
   gains and political influence through infrastructure diplomacy,
   including in the Mediterranean Region, remain limited. This derives from
   several factors, the most important of which being China's predicament
   in its role-taking, which makes its foreign policies such as the
   infrastructure diplomacy subject to shifts and open to interpretation.},

Abstract = {When considering public support for domestic policies that contribute to
   a global public good, such as climate change mitigation, the behavior of
   other countries is commonly regarded as pivotal. Using survey
   experiments in China and the United States we find that other countries'
   behavior matters for public opinion, but in a contingent manner. When
   citizens learn that other countries decrease their emissions, this leads
   to support for further domestic action. Yet, support for reciprocal
   behavior is not a necessary consequence of other countries increasing
   their emissions. Responding in-kind to emissions increases abroad
   depends upon the home country's past behavior and who the other country
   is. Our results imply that the international context remains important,
   despite global climate policy now relying more on coordinated unilateral
   action and polycentric governance. They also show, however, that we need
   to pay greater attention to contingent effects of countries' positive
   and negative behavior in this area.},

Abstract = {We present a hierarchical Dirichlet regression model with Gaussian
   process priors that enables accurate and well-calibrated forecasts for
   U.S. Senate elections at varying time horizons. This Bayesian model
   provides a balance between predictions based on time-dependent opinion
   polls and those made based on fundamentals. It also provides uncertainty
   estimates that arise naturally from historical data on elections and
   polls. Experiments show that our model is highly accurate and has a well
   calibrated coverage rate for vote share predictions at various
   forecasting horizons. We validate the model with a retrospective
   forecast of the 2018 cycle as well as a true out-of-sample forecast for
   2020. We show that our approach achieves state-of-the art accuracy and
   coverage despite relying on few covariates.},

Abstract = {Some scholars build models to classify documents into chosen categories.
   Others, especially social scientists who tend to focus on population
   characteristics, instead usually estimate the proportion of documents in
   each category-using either parametric ``classify-and-count{''} methods
   or ``direct{''} nonparametric estimation of proportions without
   individual classification. Unfortunately, classify-and-count methods can
   be highly model-dependent or generate more bias in the proportions even
   as the percent of documents correctly classified increases. Direct
   estimation avoids these problems, but can suffer when the meaning of
   language changes between training and test sets or is too similar across
   categories. We develop an improved direct estimation approach without
   these issues by including and optimizing continuous text features, along
   with a form of matching adapted from the causal inference literature.
   Our approach substantially improves performance in a diverse collection
   of 73 datasets. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all
   ideas discussed herein.},

   emphasis on Nigerian Pidgin, a widespread contact language of mixed
   European and African origin. In its theoretical approach, the study is
   informed by Bourdieu's studies of the linguistic marketplace and on
   Mignolo's critique of Western hegemony in education and knowledge
   production. In addition, I will review a few major (socio)linguistic
   studies on Nigerian Pidgin. This study will also be based on language
   biographical interviews with Nigerian informants. These interviews were
   part of the research project ``West African Englishes on the Move: New
   Forms of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) in Germany.{''}
   The analysis will make evident that both Nigerian Pidgin and English are
   unifying languages in the Nigerian context, but that they play their
   unifying roles in very different ways. The economic and educational
   systems inherited from the colonial era have pushed the English language
   to the top of Nigeria's language hierarchy. However, Pidgin's
   progressive normalization challenges this hegemony across a wide range
   of public domains and in all social echelons. Pidgin now assumes a
   significant role, complementary to English in communication. Beyond the
   questioning of a Western language's enduring privilege, this phenomenon
   points to a crisis of Western cultural hegemony.
   While Pidgin is a useful means of communication for people of different
   ethnic and linguistic groups in Nigeria, comparing this language
   unfavorably to English remains current among Nigerians. This negative
   perception is an offshoot of colonialism that propped language hierarchy
   in the colonies and left behind a deep-seated assumption that English
   would be the only legitimate language for official use by the people.
   Promotion of the English language in Nigeria, and its enduring hegemony,
   was part of a process connected to colonial power and to the oversea
   expansion of capitalism, a process Walter Mignolo has referred to as the
   `coloniality of power.' Could the boom in Pidgin facilitate `knowledge
   emancipation' through shaping people's perceptions and actions about
   being Nigerian?},

Abstract = {In the twenty-first century, societies around the world are facing a
   wide range of daunting global mega-challenges: poverty, unemployment,
   income inequality, unequal distribution of political power, ageing
   populations, uncontrolled migration, segregated urbanisation, increasing
   greenhouse gas emissions and a massive decrease in biodiversity. In
   recent years, politicians, journalists and academic observers have
   singled out the Nordic countries, Denmark in particular, as model
   societies of trusting and happy people that have handled many of these
   challenges with remarkable effectiveness. And yet others warn against
   `becoming Denmark,' painting a picture of a dysfunctional, socialist
   nightmare with high taxes, low job motivation and a general lack of
   private initiative. In this introductory chapter, the editors cut
   through the noise of the international debate and set the scene for the
   nuanced analyses presented here of contemporary public governance in
   Demark and its capacity to tackle some of the most pressing problems of
   our time. Specifically, the chapter discusses various conceptualisations
   of the Danish welfare state, delineates some of its most important
   historical and structural traits and outlines the main empirical
   features of contemporary Danish public governance. Finally, it outlines
   the structure of the book and briefly introduces each of its subsequent
   chapters.},

Abstract = {Despite the low mobilization of citizenry, the lack of any strong
   electoral competition and consequently the expected re-election of the
   incumbent, the 2021 Portuguese Presidential elections gained particular
   interest for two main reasons. Firstly, this election took place in
   extraordinary circumstances amid the Covid-19 pandemic. At the time,
   Portugal was experiencing the world's highest number of new cases and
   deaths per million. Secondly, this election was noted for the support
   obtained by the far-right candidate, unprecedented in national elections
   in Portugal. Thus, this article attempts to provide an overview of the
   main features of the presidential elections of 2021 in Portugal, namely
   the measures introduced to mitigate the threat of the pandemic and
   assure voters' safety, the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown in
   the electoral campaign, the electoral results, and the rise of the
   radical right in Portugal and its implications.},

Abstract = {Human mobility has become a major variable of interest during the
   COVID-19 pandemic and central to policy decisions all around the world.
   To measure individual mobility, research relies on a variety of
   indicators that commonly stem from two main data sources: survey
   self-reports and behavioral mobility data from mobile phones. However,
   little is known about how mobility from survey self-reports relates to
   popular mobility estimates using data from the Global System for Mobile
   Communications (GSM) and the Global Positioning System (GPS). Spanning
   March 2020 until April 2021, this study compares self-reported mobility
   from a panel survey in Austria to aggregated mobility estimates
   utilizing (1) GSM data and (2) Google's GPS-based Community Mobility
   Reports. Our analyses show that correlations in mobility changes over
   time are high, both in general and when comparing subgroups by age,
   gender, and mobility category. However, while these trends are similar,
   the size of relative mobility changes over time differs substantially
   between different mobility estimates. Overall, while our findings
   suggest that these mobility estimates manage to capture similar latent
   variables, especially when focusing on changes in mobility over time,
   researchers should be aware of the specific form of mobility different
   data sources capture.},

Abstract = {This article empirically explores how populist actors talk about the
   nation. This is a research area mostly tackled in studies on right-wing
   populism, with other forms of populist politics usually left out of the
   analysis. To fill this academic gap, we focus on the Spanish party
   Podemos and the Italian Five Star Movement (M5S). The former is a
   paradigmatic example of radical left populism, whereas the latter is
   commonly considered as a catch-all populist party with no clear
   ideological connotation. Through a discourse analysis on leaders'
   speeches and official public declarations, we focus on the role that
   national identity plays in the strategies of Podemos and M5S and on the
   type of nation they discursively construct. Whilst Podemos' populist
   strategy purposely aims at contending to the right ideologically loaded
   concepts and signifiers to construct an idea of nation fitting the
   party's leftist values, M5S's strategy mostly aims at appropriating
   valence issues, such as the ``Made in Italy{''} brand and the concept of
   ``national interest{''}. Thus, our analysis contributes to clarify the
   differences between the leftist political culture of Podemos and the
   ``post-ideological{''} one of M5S, as also reflected by survey data
   confirming strong differences in ``nationalist{''} attitudes between
   their respective electorates.},

Abstract = {We live in a new normal of increasing, crosscutting, and shifting
   patterns of disasters fueled by large-scale environmental change, from
   floods to wildfires to pandemics. Our intervention in this forum piece
   makes the case that disasters, and responses to disasters, must be
   understood within the context of the global political-economic system of
   capitalism. We situate disasters, their making, and their politics
   within the Capitalocene and argue that disasters and the physical
   processes that underpin them are not natural: they are unevenly produced
   through, and exacerbated by, processes inherent in the capitalist
   system, with uneven consequences. We suggest that the predominantly
   technomanagerial approaches to disasters pursued within the neoliberal
   state and multilateral governance institution system reveal the tensions
   in addressing the causes of environmental change and the new normal of
   disasters under capitalism. We argue that through an engagement with the
   Capitalocene, environmental politics could further contribute to
   nuanced, critical understandings of disasters and their making in ways
   that foreground their in/justice implications.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed enormous governance deficits globally.
   Several populist strongmen practiced ``medical populism{''} - ignoring
   scientific advice, proffering denials, and blaming others. More
   technocratic leaders recognised its severity, implementing strict
   lockdowns. But some failed to adopt more flexible restrictions once
   testing improved due to local enforcement difficulties, termed ``blunt
   force regulation.{''} Although neither a pandemic denialist nor an
   obtuse technocrat, Philippine president Rodrigo R. Duterte's response
   combined aspects of both approaches with blame shifting and
   one-size-fits-all lockdowns while also securitising the crisis.
   Utilising methods developed during his bloody ``war on drugs,{''}
   Duterte imposed a heavily militarised approach, scapegoated supposedly
   disobedient Filipinos (pasaway) and bullied local politicians. While the
   Philippines has been among the worst pandemic performers globally,
   Duterte's approval ratings remained robust. It is argued ``brute force
   governance{''} undermined the dynamics of accountability, enabling him
   to win public approval despite policy failure.},

Abstract = {The structural elements of global environmental governance are
   notoriously difficult to change and align with the needs of a rapidly
   deteriorating earth system. This, however, only increases the need to
   focus on the role of agency in this context. This paper does so by
   taking stock of what we know about agency in relation to International
   Environmental Agreements (IEAs) and suggests directions for future
   research. We contribute a conceptual framework to enable the mapping of
   research on agency related to IEAs and advance more systematic study of
   agency in this context. The framework differentiates between the
   negotiation of IEAs, their implementation and outcomes, and includes
   agency-related and context-related drivers of agency in these processes.
   We subsequently review articles published between 2003 and 2020 in the
   journal International Environmental Agreements (as one of the few
   journals exclusively focusing on IEAs) dealing with actors' agency and
   analyse how these articles address agency in the context of IEAs. We
   conclude firstly by identifying avenues for how further research can
   fill important gaps, including a need for increased transparency on the
   methods and theories used in articles, and more comparative research
   particularly on agency dynamics in implementation; and secondly by
   highlighting important pointers for policy-makers including the need to
   re-evaluate the role of national sovereignty and address the forces that
   counteract equality and justice. Key lessons include the need to improve
   global south countries' capacity to influence IEA negotiations (input
   legitimacy), the central role of public and peer pressure on countries
   to implement commitments, the impact of multilevel governance dynamics
   and the importance of ensuring that IEAs benefit local communities
   (output legitimacy).},

   Checks},

Abstract = {Participants that complete online surveys and experiments may be
   inattentive, which can hinder researchers' abilityto draw substantive or
   causal inferences. As such, many practitioners include multiple
   factualor instructional closed-ended manipulation checks to identify
   low-attention respondents. However, closed-ended manipulation checks are
   either correct or incorrect, which allows participants to more easily
   guess and it reduces the potential variation in attention between
   respondents. In response to these shortcomings, I develop an automatic
   and standardized methodology to measure attention that relies on the
   text that respondents provide in an open-ended manipulation check. There
   are multiple benefits to this approach. First, it provides a continuous
   measure of attention, which allows for greater variation between
   respondents. Second, it reduces the reliance on subjective, paid humans
   to analyze open-ended responses. Last, I outline how to diagnose the
   impact of inattentive workers on the overall results, including how to
   assess the average treatment effect of those respondents that likely
   received the treatment. I provide easy-to-use software in R to implement
   these suggestions for open-ended manipulation checks.},

Abstract = {Informed by role theory in international relations, this article argues
   that there is a role conflict between the European Union (EU) and China
   over the concept of `Normative Power Europe' (NPE). This conflict has
   triggered a process of compromise in EU-China relations that is
   carefully managed by both parties. China filters the EU's
   role-projecting efforts in the country, whereas the EU attempts to gain
   recognition for its international role by selecting feasible approaches
   and channels to interact with China. As a result, the EU implements its
   public diplomacy (PD) in various channels to engage with Chinese
   society. In addition to conventional PD methods of publicity activities
   and cultural and educational exchanges, the EU targets technical
   professionals, elites, and policymakers in China through its various
   bilateral cooperation programmes with the country. As such, the EU's PD
   in China has become narrowly focused on social and technical elites, and
   it is unable to directly engage the general public in China. Therefore,
   the short-term impacts and implications of the EU's PD in China are
   generally indirect and difficult to measure.},

Abstract = {With Asia's current geopolitical rise, International Relations
   communities in China, Japan and India have attempted to develop
   indigenous theoretical approaches that attract heated scholarly debates.
   Little attention, however, is paid to the state of affairs in weaker
   states. As power today is widely diffused to various actors in the
   international system beyond the big powers, the power-knowledge
   literature should be broadened to respond to the growing multiplexity of
   world order and the call for diversity of International Relations
   knowledge. As a case in point, this study examines how Vietnam's
   emerging middle power status has shaped policy and scholarly discourses
   in the country regarding the trajectory of Vietnam's foreign policy and
   the burgeoning interest of its International Relations community in a
   Vietnamese School of Diplomacy. Such scholarly endeavour will help shed
   light on the heightened agency of middle powers in world politics and
   the prospects for a Southeast Asian contribution to global International
   Relations heritage.},

Abstract = {Relating social inequality and vulnerability to environmental hazards is
   an especially challenging task in regions with a paucity of data.
   Researchers attempting to measure the potential environmental and human
   impacts of past and continuing industrial toxicity in Azerbaijan have
   often either questioned the reliability of environmental indicators
   disclosed by the state's official statistics or found the government's
   environmental and population data partial and incomplete. To contribute
   to a clearer description of the human impacts of toxic waste locations
   and to assist other researchers, we use a novel methodology. By
   overlaying data from Azerbaijan's Toxic Site Identification Program
   (TSIP) onto national census population data - augmented with in-country
   interviews - we can map the inequitable distribution of infant
   mortality, unemployment, and toxic waste sites to better suggest some of
   the places and people in particular need of environmental mitigation and
   health, and economic intervention. This method is transferable to future
   research in the Caucasus, Eurasia, and other data-poor areas.},

Abstract = {This review article addresses the question: What lessons can we learn
   from work published in International Environmental Agreements: Politics,
   Law and Economics regarding the politics of multilateral environmental
   agreements? What are the implications of these lessons for those
   responsible for creating and administering these agreements? Based on an
   analysis of 147 articles published over the past 20 years, the article
   explores issues of institutional design, institutional politics,
   implementation, and effectiveness. It concludes that key conditions for
   success in this realm include: (a) developing a toolkit that is not
   limited to rules-based governance, (b) paying attention to matters of
   implementation, (c) bearing in mind the overall regime complex, (d)
   developing effective leadership based on credibility and accountability,
   and (e) allowing for institutional adaptation.},

Abstract = {Embedding randomized experiments in representative surveys of the
   Catalan population, this article shows that the survey instrument
   commonly used to measure citizens' interest in politics is far from
   gender-neutral. By implicitly associating the political to male-oriented
   issues and male-dominated actors and domains, it artificially amplifies
   the gender gap, particularly by depressing women's reported interest.
   The first experiment captures respondents' interest through both the
   standard question about general political interest and a battery of
   specific political issues, randomizing question order. In the second
   experiment, an additional text helps reformulate the standard question
   by prompting respondents to think about politics in broader terms,
   randomizing the presentation of male-oriented and female-oriented
   political issues to test the effect of cognitive accessibility and
   recency. By expanding the conceptualization of the political, the
   priming applied in our experiments completely closes the gender gap,
   thereby casting doubt on the validity of the traditional survey
   instrument.},

Abstract = {After more than a decade of leftist governments in Latin America, the
   left turn began to reverse course, giving way to the rise of rightist
   political forces. Even moderate right-wing governments undertook reforms
   to reduce public spending. This agenda, however, encountered important
   obstacles. Focusing on the 2017 Argentine pension reform and based on
   extensive qualitative research, including in-depth interviews with key
   players, the findings here uphold previous work on the strength of
   policy legacies in opposition to promarket reforms. This study
   contributes to the existing theory by showing that protests against
   retrenchment favor the formation of opposition coalitions only in places
   where left-leaning governments had established inroads with organized
   popular sectors, maintaining relationships of coordination and
   collaboration. In these cases, the cost of specific reforms can
   jeopardize the broader project of retrenchment.},

Abstract = {This article presents a comparative analysis of how European democracies
   address the paradox of tolerance. States have formulated various
   responses to political radicalism, in particular right-wing radicalism.
   Scholars have explained these variations by the differences in their
   authoritarian pasts. However, a wide array of policy actors with
   different perceptions and interests are involved in the regulation of
   right-wing radicalism. Their impact on implemented policy measures needs
   to be assessed to better understand what drives the politics of
   democratic defense in liberal democracies. Relying on grey literature,
   administrative reports and semi-structured interviews conducted between
   2013 and 2017 in France and Germany among a range of policy actors
   responding to right-wing radicalism, I identify two key factors to
   explain the regulation of right-wing radicalism. This article
   demonstrates that the historical framing of right-wing radicalism and
   the national specificities in policymaking need to be explored if we are
   to understand the regulation dynamics of right-wing radicalism. By
   contrast, the radical right's structure is of secondary importance in
   explaining how liberal democracies address the paradox of tolerance.
   These results advocate for the systematic use of policy tools in
   analyzing the politics of democratic defense.},

Abstract = {We introduce a constrained priority mechanism that combines
   outcome-based matching from machine learning with preference-based
   allocation schemes common in market design. Using real-world data, we
   illustrate how our mechanism could be applied to the assignment of
   refugee families to host country locations, and kindergarteners to
   schools. Our mechanism allows a planner to first specify a threshold g
   for the minimum acceptable average outcome score that should be achieved
   by the assignment. In the refugee matching context, this score
   corresponds to the probability of employment, whereas in the student
   assignment context, it corresponds to standardized test scores. The
   mechanism is a priority mechanism that considers both outcomes and
   preferences by assigning agents (refugee families and students) based on
   their preferences, but subject to meeting the planner's specified
   threshold. The mechanism is both strategy-proof and constrained
   efficient in that it always generates a matching that is not Pareto
   dominated by any other matching that respects the planner's threshold.},

Title = {The present and future of the West's hegemony on democracy. An analysis
   informed by Istvan Meszaros' work},

Series = {Series in Politics},

Abstract = {The ever-worsening democratic erosion we have been witnessing for more
   than two decades is the problem this chapter tackles. It will uncover
   some of the reasons behind this trend by developing a historical
   perspective on the issue and based on empirical data and by drawing from
   the theoretical framework developed by the Marxist political economist
   Istvan Meszaros. Some famous analysts recently expressed their
   conviction that the renewal of democracy in the world heavily depends on
   a renewal of Western international democracy promotion enterprises. The
   chapter argues that this suggestion is misleading. Instead, it holds
   that democracy promotion is-at least partlymotivated by-mainly-Western
   neoimperial and neocolonial agendas, and contributes to resuming or
   supporting former international asymmetrical relations and producing new
   ones. For this reason, democracy promotion is a fertile ground for
   Western hegemony. Leading transatlantic powers, the United States and
   former European colonizers, and affiliated agencies have imposed on
   other communities a set of institutions, mechanisms and norms based on
   their own experiences of democracy, which embody their peculiar
   historical development and societies. Efforts at spreading the
   representative liberal democratic model secured their influence, further
   strengthened by their self-appointed `moral leaders' status, by
   providing them with opportunities to interfere in other nations' affairs
   and secure strategic and material assets. While transitions to democracy
   directly connected to Western influence did not always imply open
   coercion, they often resulted from compulsion.
   As a first step, this chapter will draw a broad empirical picture of the
   so-called third wave of democratization, especially of its post-1989
   phase, in which foreign intervention was an essential factor in
   democratization. It will also consider the autocratization current that
   started shortly after the turn of the twenty-first century, which is
   inseparable from the third wave of democratization. The next section
   will address the concrete conditions in which post-Cold War transitions
   to democracy unfolded and underscore the decisive role of the US, the EU
   and related agencies in their outcome. The third part will interpret
   these observations by drawing from the work of Istvan Meszaros. His
   extensive study of the capital system and its structural crisis provides
   a meaningful and relevant theoretical framework to make sense of the
   relation between democracy promotion and democratic regress and unveil
   the centrality of global asymmetries and neocolonial and informal
   imperial practices in this process. It also allows an understanding of
   why the attempt at exporting the so-called ``Western model{''} gave
   deceptive results, explaining the recent rise of authoritarianism, and
   finally, appreciating the potential of social movements for
   (re)democratization, which will be briefly addressed in this chapter's
   conclusion.},

Abstract = {This chapter looks at Soviet internationalism in the sphere of higher
   education during the Cold War. Higher education in the newly independent
   developing world was a thoroughly Western-dominated field due to the
   colonial past of these areas. Soviet Union was keen to contest this
   hegemony by offering opportunities for foreign students to gain degrees
   in Soviet universities. The education provided was similar to Western
   education in terms of quality, but different in the values it promoted.
   This chapter analyzes the processes of student selection, contents of
   study programs and outcomes of the Soviet educational cooperation
   project in the 1960s and 1970s.},

Abstract = {Current approaches to voting behavior in clientelist contexts either
   predict that clients leave their preferences aside for fear of having
   their benefits cut off or voluntarily support politicians they perceive
   to be reliable patrons. These two approaches cannot account for clients'
   vote choices in the Sertao of Bahia, Brazil, where voters were free to
   choose among competing candidates but supported patrons they knew were
   unreliable. This article argues that clients voluntarily voted for bad
   patrons as a strategy to gain symbolic power in their negotiations with
   politicians. By explaining clients' paradoxical choices in the Sertao,
   this article reveals how clientelism can persist without monitoring
   mechanisms or positive attitudes toward patrons. In addition, this study
   shows the importance of incorporating voters' perspectives and their
   everyday survival strategies to better account for clients' political
   behavior.},

Abstract = {Despite Greece's centrality in Eastern Mediterranean history and
   politics, the evolution, characteristics, and rationale behind the
   country's relations with the Arab world have yet to be identified. This
   article examines post-World War II Greek foreign policy towards the Arab
   world across four key periods (1945-80; 1981-89; 1990-2018; and 2019
   onwards). It builds on a historical institutionalist approach to argue
   that Greece's relationship with the Arab world has remained a pillar of
   the country's diplomatic strategy, albeit instrumentalised in terms of
   Greece's two main foreign policy goals in the post-World War II era:
   maintaining the country's Western orientation and navigating the
   vicissitudes of Greek-Turkish relations. Thus, the Arab world has
   traditionally been approached by Greek policymakers in a profit
   maximization manner that sought to either amplify Greece's relationship
   with Western powers or respond to Turkish initiatives in the region.
   Aiming to provide the first systematic overview of Greek diplomatic
   strategy towards the Arab world, the article highlights the importance
   of path dependence in evaluating Greek foreign policy initiatives
   towards the Middle East. It also seeks to contextualize Greece's current
   attempts to forge a proactive role across the region by providing
   necessary historic nuance and a comparative perspective.},

Abstract = {Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the focus of the United
   Nations climate regime has shifted from forging consensus among national
   governments toward animating implementation activity across multiple
   levels. Based on a case study of the Global Climate Action Portal-an
   online database designed to document nonstate actor climate commitments
   and implementation efforts-we trace, conceptualize, and assess how the
   roles of data, data infrastructures, and actor constellations have
   changed as a result of this shift. We argue that in the pre-COP21
   negotiation phase, the United Nations Climate Secretariat strategically
   used the database to orchestrate and leverage nonstate actor commitments
   to exert pressure on intergovernmental negotiations. By contrast, in the
   post-COP21 implementation phase, the Secretariat, in collaboration with
   climate data specialists, is seeking to develop the portal to track and
   animate implementation activity. Given these developments, we discuss
   the potential and limitations of data-driven climate governance and set
   out avenues for future research.},

Title = {A small state finding its way in the EU: Croatia and its approach to
   Brexit},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {670-686},

Abstract = {As a small and new EU member state Croatia had little to contribute to
   Brexit, which occurred just a few years after the country's accession to
   the EU. Stemming from its size, its pre-existing relations with the UK
   and its drive to learn to operate within the EU, Croatia is no outlier
   in the literature on small states' foreign policy. This paper analyses
   the behaviour of Croatia during Brexit and adds to the literature on
   small states. First, it analyses whether and to what extent Croatia
   opted for one or more of the following strategies: seeking shelter,
   hiding or hedging during the Brexit negotiations. Second, it examines
   the logics underpinning the aforementioned strategies (logic of
   consequences vs. logic of appropriateness). Third, it scrutinizes
   Brexit's impact on the Europeanisation of Croatia's foreign and defence
   policies and possible advancement or undermining of this Europeanisation
   process. We focus on both policy-uploading and policy-downloading
   dimensions of Europeanisation, thus contributing to the literature on
   Europeanisation. Our research is based on existing literature,
   second-hand sources such as official documents and statements, and the
   primary data collected through semi-structured interviews with eight
   persons who either shaped the Croatian foreign and defence policies or
   were well-informed about them.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is one of man's greatest challenges. Its handling requires
   a better understanding of orderliness in the
   demographic-socioeconomic-entrepreneurial domain of human settlements.
   Operating business enterprises are manifestations of successful
   entrepreneurship, which is the characteristic of interest here.
   Non-linear entrepreneurial proportionalities can be detected through the
   use of log-log regressions (power law analyses). Such analyses revealed
   many entrepreneurial proportionalities in datasets of a large number of
   U.S. counties. This enabled the examination of the temporal and
   geographic sensitivities of three entrepreneurial types: total
   entrepreneurship (expressed in total enterprise numbers), new
   entrepreneurship (the ability to successfully start enterprises of types
   not yet present), and existing entrepreneurship (the ability to start
   more enterprises of types already present). Stress testing of the
   entrepreneurial proportionalities during a period of economic growth
   (2000 to 2007) followed by a period of economic decline (the so-called
   Great Recession from 2007 to 2010) enabled the examination of a
   hypothesis that suggested that the entrepreneurial proportionalities are
   not temporally or geographically sensitive. The hypothesis is accepted
   for new and existing entrepreneurship. Total entrepreneurship is
   geographically sensitive, but not temporally. There is apparently no
   lack of entrepreneurship in human settlements. Their total
   entrepreneurship (expressed as total enterprise numbers) appears to be a
   function of their population sizes and prosperity/poverty levels.},

   Evidence from Mexico},

Abstract = {This article studies how public investment and other types of spending
   by municipal governments shape perceptions of corruption in Mexico. We
   argue, drawing on various strands of literature, that investment in
   visible public works projects should lower corruption perceptions, given
   the well-known difficulties in directly observing corrupt acts. Contrary
   to our expectations and common assumptions in studies of public
   investment, we find that more public investment by municipal governments
   is associated, on average, with higher corruption perceptions. However,
   this effect is mediated by individuals' education levels. For
   individuals with less formal education, higher public investment
   correlates with higher perceived corruption, while highly educated
   individuals perceive less corruption when municipal public investment is
   high. The study uses qualitative evidence from municipal audit reports
   to identify a possible mechanism driving this outcome: municipal
   investments may not be targeted to the poorer neighborhoods with greater
   public service deficits.},

Abstract = {Despite an association with claims of Asian exceptionalism, the
   discipline of International Relations (IR) in Singapore tends to reflect
   approaches common to mainstream Anglophone, North American and, to a
   lesser extent, British perspectives on the discipline. Intellectual
   paradigms such as realism and constructivism seem to have a particularly
   enduring hold on teaching, research and knowledge production, even
   though the awareness of Global IR and alternative viewpoints is
   relatively widespread. The reasons for this divergence between
   statements about a focus on Asia and adherence to more conventional
   disciplinary norms are varied. The internationalization of Singapore
   academia, which incentivizes publication in highly-ranked international
   journals and university presses dominated by Anglophone academia, seems
   to be a key reason. Other explanations include a need to conform to the
   preferences of state funders who tend to view the world in policy rather
   than conceptual terms, and the fact that IR scholars in Singapore
   predominantly receive their training from parts of the Anglophone world.
   Limitations on being able to study Singapore in-depth also mean that
   Singapore-based scholars tend to engage intellectually with work that
   examines disparate locations outside of the country-even if they are in
   Asia-rather than systematically consider Singapore's position in the
   world.},

Abstract = {Vietnam's open-door policy and its proactive international integration
   since the 1990s have allowed International Relations (IR) to become a
   popular field of study in Vietnam. Based on the sociology of science
   framework, combined with in-depth surveys of Vietnamese IR scholars and
   personal reflections of the author's experience within Vietnamese IR
   academia, this article examines the state of the IR discipline as well
   as the challenges and prospects for advancing Global IR in Vietnam. It
   argues that while Vietnamese IR scholarship has become more diversified
   and increasingly integrated with evolving trends in the field, the
   country's IR community retains a distinctive and somewhat ambivalent
   view of the non-Western IR movement due to historical, institutional and
   political factors. Nonetheless, with its unique position as a
   postcolonial socialist state that has successfully integrated into
   international society, Vietnam has great potential in making
   contributions towards forging a common heritage in the IR discipline.},

Abstract = {While anecdotal evidence suggests that transnational private rule-making
   organizations (TPROs)-such as eco-certification organizations-lobby
   public policy makers, we know little about the extent of this phenomenon
   or the characteristics of TPROs that lobby. TPRO lobbying is relevant
   given that their rule-making activities directly intersect with public
   policy. We use the interest group and private governance literatures to
   examine TPRO features that distinguish TPROs that lobby from those that
   do not. We developed an original data set of 147 environmental TPROs and
   assessed TPRO lobbying by their registration in the European Union's
   Transparency Register (TR). We find that a quarter of the TPROs in our
   data set are registered in the TR, and that capacity and expertise
   matter. Contrary to expectations, however, we do not find that certain
   key features of TPROs-such as business origins or credibility-are
   correlated with being registered, which implies that these features do
   not create inequalities in the TPRO population in terms of lobbying
   likelihood. By assessing environmental TPROs as interest organizations
   that engage in lobbying, we contribute to research on public-private
   governance interactions and identify TPROs as an interest group
   population in its own right.},

Abstract = {Multiple visions for how urbanism can respond to the climate crisis and
   foster sustainability have emerged on the international agenda,
   including the ecocity, low-carbon city, smart city, and resilient city.
   These competing visions have been joined by one deploying ``nature-based
   solutions.{''} We examine how nature-based solutions are emerging as a
   linchpin holding together the nature and climate agendas and what this
   means for where and by whom nature-based solutions are forming part of
   transnational urban governance. We argue that this field is animated by
   four frames connecting urban nature and climate: nature for resilience,
   nature for mitigation, the integrated benefits of nature, and nature
   first. Diverse actors, from conservation organizations to design firms
   to transnational municipal networks, draw on these frames and adopt new
   governance arrangements such that what it means to govern climate in the
   city is shifting. How this emerging nature-climate governance complex is
   structured will generate new momentum for governing urban nature over
   the coming decade.},

Abstract = {The literature on the Arab world is full of accounts on how
   authoritarian regimes manipulate the secular-Islamist cleavage to remain
   in power. This literature, however, has two gaps. First, there is no
   comparative data on the regional patterns of inclusion and exclusion
   that characterize regime-opposition relations in the Arab world. Second,
   studies usually do not account for the different shades of secular and
   Islamist groups. This research note bridges both gaps by introducing an
   original dataset: the Arab Opposition Power Relations dataset. The
   dataset codes power relations between four secular and Islamist groups
   in 13 Arab countries between 2005 and 2016 to a total of 624 group
   observations. Descriptive analysis of the dataset illustrates the
   changing patterns of inclusion and exclusion within and across countries
   both before and after the 2011 Arab uprisings. In so doing, the dataset
   opens new research frontiers for the vibrant literature on the
   resilience of authoritarianism in the Arab world.},

Abstract = {What explains why vote buying occurs in some elections but not others?
   The phenomenon of vote buying is under-studied in authoritarian,
   single-party-dominant regimes, especially in non-partisan elections in
   which competition is candidate-centered rather than party centered.
   Village elections in China provide a valuable window on the dynamics of
   vote buying in these conditions. Employing both an in-depth case study
   and an original, panel survey to provide new, systematic measures of
   rents and vote buying, we develop and test the following hypothesis: the
   availability of non-competitive rents accessible by winning candidates
   explains the variation in the incidence of vote buying in local
   elections. Our causal identification strategy exploits the timing of
   land takings and the exogenous nature of formal land takings authorized
   in state land-use plans at higher administrative levels to test the
   vote-buying-as-rent-seeking hypothesis. We find that the lure of rents,
   mainly from government takings of village land, is a key driver of vote
   buying by non-partisan candidates for the office of village leader. The
   evidence suggests that vote buying provides information to the
   authoritarian state about which local elites it should recruit into the
   rent-sharing coalition.},
