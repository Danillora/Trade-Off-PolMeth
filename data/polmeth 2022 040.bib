Abstract = {This chapter conducts a cross-sectional comparative analysis of the
   current status, characteristics, and challenges of citizenship education
   in the ASEAN community based on the results of two citizenship surveys
   conducted in the ASEAN countries, following the reports of the ASEAN
   countries in Part II (Chaps. 3-12). The two surveys were designed to be
   conducted in all ten ASEAN member countries. However, we were unable to
   conduct the student and Delphi surveys in Singapore and Delphi survey in
   Myanmar. Summarizing the results of the analysis, it is clear that
   although the ASEAN Community, which was founded in 2015, has made good
   progress and efforts are being made for further development, efforts are
   still needed to achieve its objectives. The remaining challenges for the
   ASEAN Community were how to overcome the diversity of each country, how
   to promote the transformation of students' awareness of ASEAN, and how
   to promote national policymaking and curriculum development. This
   chapter is a partial translation, a compact reorganization, and a final
   summary (Summary and Recommendations) of ``ASEAN Shokoku niokeru
   Shiminsei Kyouiku Chousa no Hikakubunseki (Comparative Analysis on
   Citizenship Education Survey in the ASEAN Countries){''} (Morishita,

Abstract = {This article uses the French Rassemblement National (RN) as a case study
   to examine how the populist radical right (PRR) prepares for a world
   after COVID-19 dominated by climate change concerns. Research suggests
   that certain measures introduced to contain the virus - such as the
   establishment of strict border and travel restrictions - may legitimize
   the PRR's protectionist and anti-immigration agendas, yet few have
   examined whether or how PRR parties have used COVID-19 to promote their
   environmental agenda. If anything, the expectation has been that the
   pandemic would hurt the PRR precisely because its effects, unlike
   climate change, cannot be dismissed as a ``hoax.{''} This view overlooks
   not only the ``environmental turn{''} recently taken by several PRR
   parties but also the possibility that public awareness of the causal
   link between climate change and COVID-19 may work to their advantage.
   The analysis presented in this article highlights this possibility,
   showing that the RN used COVID-19 not only to capitalize on
   anti-immigrant sentiment but also to bolster its self-image as a
   champion of environmental protection.},

Abstract = {This article examines the anti-Lukashenka protest movement in Belarus by
   comparing it to the Solidarity movement in Poland. We organize our
   analysis around the concept of four stages identifiable in the
   development of social movements: emergence, coalescence,
   bureaucratization, and decline. We argue that protests in Belarus
   reached the bureaucratization stage, but their transformation into a
   more durable movement was slowed down by the brutal repressions
   unleashed by the Lukashenka regime propped up by Putin's Russia.
   However, the spectacular changes in people's conceptions of national
   identity built around symbols different from those associated with the
   officialdom may sustain emotional mobilization necessary for formation
   of higher levels of organizations in the oppressive context of today's
   Belarus. The contours of this process are brought into sharp relief when
   compared with the long, cumulative trajectory of the 1956-89
   anti-authoritarian Polish revolts. This opens the way for cautious
   prognostication.},

Abstract = {In 2006, a ``tolerance policy{''} was launched in St. Petersburg to
   address the growing xenophobia and the need to integrate labor migrants.
   Applying a bottom-up perspective, this study finds that this policy was
   symbolic aimed at changing public attitudes, not at providing material
   outcomes. The direct implementers (the street-level bureaucracy),
   operating under governmental constraints, drew on informal mechanisms:
   behind-the-scenes negotiations, unwritten rules and hierarchies,
   personalist power, and ideological cues. Formalized dense reporting,
   often quantitative, was used to keep low-level implementers in check.
   The combination of these features rendered the tolerance policy shallow
   and self-locked. Street-level bureaucracy had to interpret vague policy
   documents, but lacked the necessary discretionary powers. This gave rise
   to the kartinka (picture, or image) coping technique. The term describes
   how all work activities were shaped by the need to demonstrate progress
   with respect to unwritten rules and ideological dynamics. The article
   concludes with a discussion of the applicability of the author's
   findings to the field of nationalities policy in Russia.},

Abstract = {Lack of economic data based on ethnicity makes the study of minority
   economies in linguistically or ethnically mixed regions problematic.
   Yet, there is much to learn from these hard cases of economic
   development in terms of the policies that guarantee ethnic or linguistic
   survival and reproduction. The present article investigates the
   long-term economic development of the Slovenian minority in Italy
   between 1954 and 2020. It does so by applying the theoretical framework
   by new institutional economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James
   Robinson (2005), which looks at the dynamic role of political and
   economic institutions for the generation of economic growth. The parable
   of this community's economy shows that political power and economic
   success can be flimsy and ephemeral. Strategic, long-term economic
   planning and, especially, contingent planning against foreseeable risks,
   both of which require the systematic collection of accurate data and the
   coordination of representative organizations, are key to successful
   reproduction and sustained growth.},

Abstract = {How did Belgian and Dutch mayors experience their own role and that of
   local government during the first few months of the COVID-19 outbreak?
   This question was addressed by drawing on three analytical perspectives
   (functional, territorial, and political) on local government systems and
   using a qualitative case study design. Interestingly, the position and
   leeway of Belgian and Dutch mayors did not differ that much during the
   first crisis months. The type of virus and scope of the outbreak
   necessitated a centralised approach. Consequently, the decisions were
   made at the national level and mayors focused primarily on implementing
   these central measures. Moreover, Belgian and Dutch mayors experienced a
   similar shift in terms of (1) power and authority (respectively to the
   provincial governor and the national level and to the regional mayor and
   the national level); (2) tasks (prioritising crisis management over
   other tasks); and (3) roles (increasing importance of their executive
   role while lamenting the effects of COVID-19 on their social role
   vis-a-vis their citizens).},

Abstract = {Europeanisation situates local governments in a constantly changing
   environment, bringing challenges, opportunities, and constraints. These
   circumstances raise the question, how local authorities adapt to the
   process of European integration, face its challenges, and use its
   diverse opportunity structures. The article explores four dimensions,
   through which Europeanisation hits the ground of local government:
   downloading, uploading, dissemination, and horizontal networking. It
   examines the distribution of different types of Europe-related
   activities at the local level using data from a survey sent to all 396
   independent cities, towns, and municipalities in the German state of
   North Rhine-Westphalia. Our empirical analysis provides an overview of
   the most and least frequent Europe-related activities within the
   different types of local authorities. The findings of our multivariate
   analysis shows that next to the direct affectedness by Europeanisation,
   the municipalities' capacities in terms of financial and institutional
   resources have a major influence on their efforts towards Europe.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to characterize the culturalist theory of the
   nation by Florian Znaniecki. Opposing the sociological theory dominated
   by Western, particularly Anglo-Saxon, thinkers, Znaniecki rejected the
   view of the nation as a state society. He believed that the nation is a
   type of community constituted by a specific culture that is created by
   its intellectual leaders. To derive his findings, he used the knowledge
   gained from the experiences of the nations of Central and Eastern
   Europe. He believed that their specific history required the development
   of a sociological theory that was adequate for such research, not
   dominated by the findings of Western sociology.},

Abstract = {The author studies the 19th-century Slovak National Movement as a
   manifestation of the ethos of plebeian resistance against the ``laws of
   progress{''} of the century in question, according to which small ethnic
   groups and nations were to be assimilated for the sake of the further
   development of more advanced nations and their cultures. A significant
   role in the formation of the ethos of plebeian resistance was played by
   Slovak folk culture, the historical context of Great Moravia, the
   solidarity and support of other Slavic nations living in the Habsburg
   monarchy, and, above all, the moral qualities of Slovak patriots. Among
   the most significant manifestations of this ethos was the codification
   of Slovak, which contributed to the formation of Slovak national
   identity and national ideology, the 1848-1849 Slovak Uprising, and the
   development of the Slovak national movement in the 1860s continuing into
   the mid-1870s. The aim of the 19th-century Slovak national movement was
   to achieve an equal position of the Slovak ethnic group among the other
   nations and ethnic groups living in the Habsburg monarchy, which would
   give rise to the free development of its creative powers and abilities
   as well as to the pursuit of ethical, humanistic ideals in the lives of
   its members.},

Abstract = {Since independence, the national integration policy is the biggest
   challenge for Malaysia which is a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural
   country. Hence, ``Civics{''}, ``Local study{''} and ``History{''} and
   the current ``Civics and Citizenship Education{''} subjects which
   contents target the core that is ``citizen{''} = ``nation{''} and
   ``citizenship = responsibility and rights as the nation{''} aiming to
   finally produce ``Becoming a member of Malaysia{''}, through emphasizing
   the improvement of national consciousness which targeted to nurture the
   citizenship related to ``National{''} through various occasion. The
   priority element for the image of citizen (nation) can be considered as:
   1. Appreciate the responsibility and moral value as the member (citizen)
   of each community.
   2. Understand and respect the characteristic of each ethnic's custom.
   3. Have the responsibility to the participation in politics and society,
   the rights given and obligation as a Malaysian.
   As stressing the ``challenges and success towards globalization{''},
   ``sustainability and development of Malaysia as the world recognition
   country{''}, etc., it is also desired to go beyond ``National{''} to
   achieve multi-layer citizenship in ``Regional{''}, ``Global{''} and
   ``Universal{''}. In a sense, the process of forming a Malaysian society
   that seeks to ``coexist{''} while recognizing diverse ethnic identities
   in a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural complex society can be considered
   as a ``Little ASEAN{''}. Therefore, the experience of Malaysia in
   creating National Integration for a Nation can be useful to be utilized
   by ASEAN to create a Regional Integration in the form of ``ASEANness{''}
   and ``ASEAN citizenship. Therefore, Malaysia is seen as a country which
   can take the leadership in ASEAN to create the curriculum of
   ``experiential and practical learning approach{''} and ``Active
   citizenship{''} by utilizing the common communication language English
   and ICT education.},

Abstract = {This article is based on an ethnographic study carried out during the
   Nezuk-Potaari Peace March in the framework of Srebrenica genocide
   commemoration. A more than 100-kilometer procession, attracting each
   year around 5,000 participants, represents the reverse route of the
   so-called Death March, the local population's way of escape from the
   town of Srebrenica in July 1995. Following theoretical insights from
   both memory studies and cultural geography, this article's aim is to
   analyze mnemonic practices commemorating the Srebrenica genocide in
   Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moreover, it explores the social processes
   through which such memory is produced, performed, and maintained. While
   applying participant observant methodology, I have engaged in
   conversation with residents and main actors taking part in the Peace
   March. Finally, the notion of collective memory is approached from the
   perspective of spatial mobility engagement of people visiting
   commemorative events and monuments dedicated to the 1990s war in Bosnia
   and Herzegovina.},

Title = {Placing the 2020 Belarusian Protests in Historical Context: Political

Abstract = {In the wake of the most recent protests in Belarus following the 2020
   Presidential Election, it is useful to explore patterns of satisfaction
   with the political system, confidence in political institutions, and
   political participation at different points in time during President
   Lukashenko's rule. We utilize Wave 3 of the World Values Study (WVS) and
   Wave 7 of the Joint European Values Study (EVS)/WVS to (1) analyze
   whether citizens' dissatisfaction with the Belarusian government
   differed between 1996 and 2018, and (2) whether there was a change in
   political participation during that period. Responses over time suggest
   that satisfaction with the government and confidence in institutions was
   not lower in 2018 than it had been in 1996. However, as we discuss in
   the article, this may be an artifact of authoritarian consolidation and
   concern/fears about revealing preferences. We also find that the
   willingness to engage in protests remained more or less the same between
   these two time periods, especially among those dissatisfied with the
   political system. These results suggest that once highly dissatisfied
   citizens took to the streets in 2020, a number of internal and external
   factors might have triggered a bandwagon effect that pushed other
   citizens to also join the demonstrations.},

   This article explores the meaning-making process surrounding the
   ``refugee crisis{''} in a Russian context, using discourse theory to
   analyze representations of refugees, Russia, and the West in opinion
   pieces and interview articles in three major Russian newspapers. In
   addition to the humanitarian and security discourses presented in
   existing studies, I identify a geopolitical discourse that represents
   refugees as victims of interventionism and democratization processes
   that the West has promoted in the Middle East and North Africa. More
   generally, this study adds to the literature on discursive construction

Abstract = {This study examines why citizens re-elect corrupt mayors, adopting a
   conceptual framework that considers two mitigating factors in punishing
   corrupt leaders: first, a strong relationship between the mayor and the
   citizens; second, a low level of corruption that may be considered
   negligible by the citizens. Both factors are contingent on local
   contexts. Thus, the study investigates in clustered local contexts, the
   impact of variables related to the mayor-citizen (taking account of the
   duration of the political career, party membership and
   trasformismo/party-switching) and the level of corruption on mayoral
   re-election. The results shows that the relationship between the mayor
   and the citizens is a mitigating factor that works homogeneously across
   contexts, albeit based on different factors. With regard to low levels
   of corruption as a mitigating factor, evidence of this is found only in
   medium and highly developed communities. The theoretical and policy
   implications are examined.},

Abstract = {The article explores the relationship between Orthodox religiosity and
   voting in Russia in 2011-2018. Using the theoretical framework of
   desecularization from above, which claims that church structures play a
   key role in the religious renaissance policy, we argue that the rise of
   the political influence of the ROC (Russian Orthodox Church) may be
   explained by its capacity for dissemination of traditional values that
   ultimately results in votes for United Russia and President Vladimir
   Putin in national elections. This study reveals the emergence of a new
   area on Russia's political map-the belt - into Belt, which combines
   higher levels of Orthodox religiosity and pro-Kremlin voting in national
   elections. Using multiple empirical strategies we construct an index of
   religiosity on the regional level and identify the Orthodox Belt
   regions, test the relationship between Orthodox religiosity and voting
   in the national elections in 2011-2018, and test the differences in
   value orientations and electoral support between the Orthodox Belt
   regions and other ones. Finally, two model regions of the Orthodox
   Belt-Tambov and Lipetsk-are explored. We conclude that non-Orthodox Belt
   regions in Russia with higher Orthodox religiosity, conservatism, and
   loyalty are an emerging trend in Russian political geography.},

Abstract = {In our research, we examined the discursive framing of Trianon and the
   Holocaust in today's Hungarian online media. Our corpus contained 26,519
   articles connected to these two historical events published between
   September 2017 and September 2020. We used a mixed-method approach by
   combining computational text analysis, namely, LDA (Latent Dirichlet
   Allocation) topic models and qualitative methods. Our aim was not only
   to map the latent thematic structure and the discourses about Trianon
   and the Holocaust but also to identify the main differences in the
   rhetoric of the different sides of the political spectrum. Using Bull
   and Hansen's categories, we found that the far-right and government
   media use the antagonistic, while the left-liberal media use the
   cosmopolitan mode of remembering. We identified many discursive
   differences between the rhetoric of the different political sides. Yet,
   the different relationship to emotions has the most far-reaching
   consequences. On the one hand, in antagonistic remembering, thus in the
   far-right and progovernment media, emotions play an essential role. On
   the other hand, cosmopolitan remembering, thus the rhetoric featured in
   the nongovernment media, detaches itself from emotions. This difference
   contributes significantly to the success of antagonistic remembering in
   Hungary. At the same time, the left-liberal side loses the opportunity
   to shape memory and identity politics.},

Abstract = {In this article, I examine early religious literature in the Albanian
   language in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which, in
   combination with ecclesiastical rivalries and a differential opposition
   to Ottoman rule, must have promoted an inherent cultural process of
   differentiation, especially between Greek-speaking and Albanian-speaking
   Orthodox Christians. In particular, I argue that the contradicting
   motivations of political contradistinction, Enlightenment propagation,
   Orthodox evangelism, ecclesiastical confrontation, and missionary
   counteraction lead inadvertently to a boundary work of the social
   reorganization of linguistic and cultural difference.},

Abstract = {Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 is widely framed as an outside-in
   process, not only enabled but also enacted by the Kremlin. Prevailing
   accounts privilege geopolitical analysis and place those developments in
   a broader narrative of tension and competition between the West and
   Russia. Such a narrative downplays the involvement of local actors and
   the importance of the choices they made prior to and during those
   events. This article revisits the period leading up to March 2014
   through a focus on critical junctures, critical antecedents, a near
   miss, and the path not taken. It argues that a full account of Crimea's
   incorporation into Russia - while acknowledging Moscow's role - cannot
   ignore the local contingencies that preceded and shaped it. We
   understand the region's annexation as a key moment of institutional
   change in Ukraine and focus our attention on explaining how that outcome
   was determined, identifying the path to such a political outcome.
   Yanukovych's decision to ``catapult{''} political-economic interest
   groups from Makeevka and Donetsk into the peninsula led to the
   marginalization of the local elite. Regime change in Kyiv and a slow and
   cumbersome response from the new authorities in February-March 2014
   triggered, but did not cause, Crimea's exit option.},

Abstract = {Using the case-study of the Mart Mira, a peace march to commemorate the
   Srebrenica genocide of July 1995, this article explores how practices of
   memorialization of genocide and resistance against denial of genocide
   intersect, in order to gain more insight into the challenges
   post-conflict societies face. The march retraces the steps that the
   Bosniak men and boys took while fleeing the Serb army after the fall of
   the Srebrenica enclave. It is a powerful means of commemorating the
   genocide and, as such, highlights the importance of space within
   memorialization. Simultaneously, walking the march serves as an act of
   resistance to Serb narratives of denial. We argue that resistance
   against genocide denial and memorialization of the genocide are
   intricately interwoven in the incentives of Bosniaks participating in
   the annual Mars Mira, and that they manifest themselves in the use of
   the landscape in which the march takes place. Through an analysis of
   four incentives for walking the Marl Mira, we shed light on the
   challenges that Serb denialism poses to the ability of the Bosniak
   community to deal with the past of the Srebrenica genocide.},

Abstract = {Nationalisation of politics generally decreased the voter participation
   at municipal elections by lowering their salience, but the variation in
   nationalisation has been underestimated. Leveraging variation in two
   dimensions of localisation of municipal political competition - ethnic
   minority concentration and number of non-partisan local lists - this
   paper tests whether increased stakes and salience at `localised'
   municipal elections increase electoral participation in respective
   municipalities. Based on the data from Croatian local elections
   (2001-2017), non-partisan lists drive voter participation, particularly
   in smaller municipalities. The effect of ethnic minority concentration
   depends on the minority status of the ethnic group within a
   municipality.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how local decision-makers influence the impact
   of high-level government meta-governance tools on environmental
   inter-local collaboration when the collective benefits of
   inter-jurisdictional collaboration conflict with the selective benefits
   of decision-makers. We address this issue focusing on empirical cases of
   inter-provincial watershed environmental collaborations in China. Using
   a difference-in-differences model for the analysis, we find that
   meta-governance tools of high-level government can facilitate the
   adoption of environmental inter-local collaboration arrangements.
   However, this facilitation decreases when local decision-makers lack
   progressive ambition or face peer competition. This study demonstrates
   the strategic responses of local decision-makers in environmental
   inter-local collaboration influenced by high-level government.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to analyze the project for the international
   convention on the protection of minority rights, which was proposed by
   Andre Mandelstam at the Institut de Droit International (IDI) in 1928.
   In this project, the author used the concept of non-territorial autonomy
   borrowed from the works of the Austro-Marxists Otto Bauer and Karl
   Renner. A Russian international lawyer in emigration, Andre Mandelstam
   had initially been involved in the implementation of elements of
   non-territorial autonomy to protect the Christian population of the
   Ottoman empire. Mandelstam's proposed convention assumed that personal
   autonomy, reduced to the protection of minorities from cultural and
   linguistic assimilation, would be a compromise between protecting
   minorities and preventing them from undermining the unity of the state.
   However, the demand for international protection of minorities was not
   accompanied by any enforcement mechanism. The project underwent serious
   revisions as it was discussed by a group of international lawyers. In
   its final version, the text retained only those of the original
   articles, which referred to individual human rights. Thus, Mandelstam's
   attempt to make his convention acceptable for all participating states
   resulted in omission of the very concept of personal autonomy in the
   final version of the proposed document.},

Abstract = {Russia's post-1991 nation-building project has been torn between
   competing interpretations of national identity. Whereas the other former
   Soviet republics opted for nation-building centered on the titular
   nation, Russia's approach to national identity was framed by the fact
   that the RSFSR had been defined not as a designated national homeland
   but as a multi-ethnic federation. This, coupled with Russia's definition
   as the legal successor of the Soviet Union, suggesting continuity and a
   history of uninterrupted statehood, has enabled a range of rivaling
   understandings of how to define the ``nation.{''} Focusing on top-down
   official nation-building, this article examines how, against a backdrop
   of shifting political contexts, structural constraints, and popular
   attitudes, the Kremlin has gradually revised its understanding of what
   constitutes the ``Russian nation.{''} Four models for post-Soviet
   Russian nation-building are identified - the ethnic, the multi-national,
   the civic, and the imperial. Over time, the correlation of forces among
   these has shifted. The article concludes that, despite some claims of an
   ethno-nationalist turn after 2014, the Kremlin still employs nationalism
   instrumentally: National identity has undoubtedly become more
   russkii-centered, but, at the same time, the Kremlin keeps the
   definition of ``Russianness{''} intentionally vague, blurring the
   boundaries between ``nation{''} and ``civilization.{''}},

Abstract = {This article examines civilian mobilization amidst the Donbas war,
   Ukraine. It focuses on ordinary residents of the frontline regions who
   voluntarily got together to address the humanitarian and military
   consequences of war in the environment of lacking state support. It
   explores the micro-level dynamics of mobilization, particularly the
   demographic profile of civilian volunteers, their motivations to join,
   and pathways to engagement. In so doing, it provides an account of how
   ordinary residents of seemingly passive regions Southern and Eastern
   Ukraine - become active in times of crisis. Contrary to the mainstream
   accounts that credit civilian mobilization to the rise of patriotism in
   wartime, it demonstrates that local security concerns and affective
   reactions to the heightened precarity of others are crucial factors that
   propel collective action at the rear. In the case of Ukraine, the
   efficiency of wartime mobilization was increased through the structures
   that emerged during the proceeding Maidan protests, as well as
   preexisting private and entrepreneurial networks. By employing
   ethnographic tools of inquiry, the article interrogates the mobilizing
   potential of seemingly latent communities in times of crisis and
   contributes to the literature on wartime collective action at the rear.},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether citizens reward those politicians who
   achieve better results in public management with re-election. It
   analyses the last three electoral processes in Spanish local
   governments, a period that runs from the beginning of the economic
   crisis (2007) to the last municipal elections (2019). For periods of
   financial crisis, the results indicate a higher probability of
   re-election for governments that have better managed public services. In
   periods of economic growth, citizens do not take into account the
   capacity that rulers have shown in public management.},

Abstract = {Public servants in local governments, including policy experts, are
   increasingly expected to facilitate public participation and citizens'
   initiatives. At the same time, critical research points out that their
   dominant or hesitant attitude and emphasis on rules and expert knowledge
   might hamper authentic participation. Based on shadowing and in-depth
   interviews, this article explores what tensions expert public servants
   (planners, lawyers, designers and historians) in Dutch municipalities
   experience when engaging the public, and how they handle these tensions
   in practice. The analysis shows that for expert civil servants,
   facilitating interactive governance means constantly finding a balance
   between their role as a bureaucrat, facilitator and expert. The findings
   show how expertise can both constrain but also enable facilitation, by
   mediating tensions between municipal and citizens' demands. In addition,
   the findings shed new light on the close relationship between knowledge
   and trust in interactive governance.},

Abstract = {This final chapter summarizes citizenship education in the ASEAN
   Community based on the research and professional opinions of the authors
   in the previous chapters and presents general conclusions and
   comprehensive recommendations. This chapter discusses our investigation
   into whether ASEANness was acquired through ASEAN studies and the ASEAN
   Curriculum Sourcebook (2012). It also discusses the results of our
   student survey on citizenship awareness and our Delphi survey of
   education experts on their recommendations for citizenship over the next
   ten years. Overall, we found that the ASEAN Community appeared to
   function smoothly when issues of diversity and commonality in ASEAN were
   successfully balanced and integrated. While each country had citizenship
   education issues that required attention, there were also issues that
   affected ASEAN as a whole. In sum, although the entire ASEAN Community
   showed positive progress, ASEANness had not been sufficiently fostered.
   Therefore, we conclude with recommendations for ASEANness and
   citizenship education over the next ten years, including enhanced
   efforts to foster ASEANness, more rigorous curriculum development, and
   improved teacher development training.},

Title = {Citizenship Education in Singapore: Implementation of Character and
   Citizenship Education and Revised National Education},
Booktitle = {CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION IN THE ASEAN COMMUNITY},
Series = {Governance and Citizenship in Asia},
Year = {2022},
Pages = {203-214},
Abstract = {In Singapore, as an immigrant state and multiethnic society, moral
   education and citizenship education have always been a national issue.
   The government has promoted various moral education programs to
   integrate ethnic groups and develop human resources. Moral education
   from the early days to the 1990s had mainly emphasized state-oriented,
   abstract ideas such as Confucian ethics, and Asian values, and the norms
   of behavior as a good citizen. However, the Character and Citizenship
   Education (CCE), which was introduced to primary and secondary schools
   in 2014, has become more student-centered and has taken effective
   approaches. In moral education, ASEAN topics had been used to emphasize
   the need for Singapore's national integration and its successful
   economic development. In Singapore, as an English-speaking society,
   global citizenship had been recognized as more important than ASEAN
   citizenship. However, a new curriculum plan, announced by the Ministry
   of Education in 2020, would change this trend. The plan consists of the
   following three areas: ``Enhancing CCE,{''} ``Knowing Asia,{''} and
   ``Strengthening Digital Literacy.{''} Under the new curriculum, an
   enhanced humanities curriculum, including social studies, geography,
   history, and economics, will be enhanced for a deeper understanding of
   Asia, including ASEAN at the secondary and pre-university levels. It
   seems to be developed and strengthened the complementary relationship
   between CCE, which is responsible for the education of moral and
   cultural values, and humanities subjects, which are designed to foster
   global awareness through the learning of Asia's growth. Since the author
   could not conduct a questionnaire survey to the students and a Delphi
   survey on Singapore due to the tight school hours, this chapter provides
   an overview of the history and current situation of moral education and
   citizenship education in Singapore.},

Title = {Carbon offset from the Amazon forest to compensate aviation emissions:
   Global solution, local struggles},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The paper focuses on how actors re-signify locally a climate
   international agreement involving carbon offset in terms of their
   differential interests and understanding about the material and symbolic
   meaning of the territory. Approved in 2016, the Carbon Offset and
   Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) defines that part
   of the greenhouse gases emissions from international aviation will need
   to be offset by purchasing carbon credits. Since forest carbon credits
   are accepted under the scheme, it may greatly stimulate forestation
   projects as well as programs for combating deforestation. The paper
   analyzes the Brazilian debate about the eligibility of forest carbon
   credits' implications under CORSIA, as the scheme may impact on land use
   in Brazil. The argument is that, at the global level, CORSIA may be
   about fighting climate change; however, at the local level, it is about
   defining and legitimizing ways of living and using territory and
   forests.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the impact of information digitization on the rise
   of misinformation, and the broader implications that this has for
   democracy. It is based on the Researching Students Information Choices
   (RSIC) project, which looks at how students evaluate scientific
   information on the internet.1 Part of this study looked at container
   collapse.
   In previous decades, information was contained in a physical book,
   newspaper, journal, magazine, or the like. These containers offered
   important contextual information about the origin and validity of the
   information. With information digitized, this context is lost. This can
   facilitate misinformation, as people might make incorrect judgments
   about information credibility because of the lack of context.
   It is vital that citizens have the information literacy skills to
   initially evaluate information correctly. One possibility for
   misinformation being pervasive is that, once encoded, it becomes
   resistant to correction. This underscores the importance of teaching
   students to evaluate the credibility of information prior to the point
   of encoding.
   To combat misinformation, librarians can teach students to evaluate
   containers and the indicators of credibility that they provide.
   Information containers can be evaluated prior to consuming information
   within a resource, while fact-checking only can happen after. Because of
   this, container evaluation can help prevent misinformation from being
   encoded. Our research demonstrates that this requires thoughtful
   engagement with the information resources and critical evaluation of the
   sources that produced them, and that students cannot accurately identify
   containers when they rely on heuristics like the URL and Google snippet.},

Abstract = {This is a troubled age for democracy, but the nature of that trouble and
   why it is a problem for democracy is an open question, not easy to
   answer. Widespread wishing for responsible leaders who respect
   democratic norms and pursue policies to benefit people and protect the
   vulnerable don't help much. The issue goes well beyond library contexts,
   but it is important that those in libraries think through our role in
   democracy as well. Micro-targeting library-centric problems won't be
   effective and don't address the key issue of this volume. The author can
   only address the future if we recover an understanding of the present by
   building up an understanding of actually-existing democracy: (1) the
   scope must be narrowed to accomplish the task; (2) the characteristics
   of the retreat from democracy should be established; (3) core working
   assumptions and values - what libraries are about in this context - must
   be established; (4) actually-existing democracy should then be
   characterized; (5) the role of libraries in actually-existing democracy
   is then explored; (6) the source and character of the threat that is
   driving the retreat from democracy and cutting away at the core of
   library assumptions and values is analyzed; (7) the chapter concludes by
   forming a basis of supporting libraries by unpacking their contribution
   to building and rebuilding democratic culture: libraries are
   simultaneously less and more important than is understood.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to identify which components of peace are most
   associated with environmental sus-tainability. Drawing on the Global
   Peace Index, Positive Peace Index, and Environmental Performance Index,
   our study shows that environmental performance (especially regarding air
   quality, safe sanitation, and safe drinking water) is more closely
   associated with positive peace (particularly concerning equitable
   distribution of resources and high levels of human capital) than
   negative peace (specifically with the degree of militarisation). Our
   integrative analysis of the indicators also reveals that some low-income
   countries score high in both negative peace and environmental
   sustainability, but they often fall short in achieving positive peace
   outcomes. Therefore, we conclude that positive peace is more conducive
   to accommodating environmental considerations and the plurality of
   conditions on which countries achieve and maintain peace and
   sustainability, which supports the need to integrate environmental
   indicators in peace indices.},

Title = {The food water energy nexus in an urban context: Connecting theory and
   practice for nexus governance},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The growing body of literature on the Food-Water-Energy (FWE) nexus
   during the last decade covers a variety of disciplinary perspectives and
   spatial scales. However, to date the urban FWE nexus has received less
   attention. In this paper, we review the FWE nexus literature with the
   focus on urban scale and identify gaps in the scholarly knowledge base
   with regard to practical applications for the FWE nexus governance in
   cities. Our findings suggest that there is still a mismatch between
   theoretical nexus governance and community perceptions. Successful
   governance is an iterative process, necessitating stakeholder input,
   reflection and response. While research developing the body of urban FWE
   governance knowledge has increased rapidly, reflection on those results
   to unpack the nexus complexity and support different governance actors
   is still limited.
   We discuss an approach for making the FWE nexus connections more visible
   and practical by focusing on the urban governance actors and
   illustrating the intersecting interests and concerns of different actors
   within the food, water, and energy systems. Mapping the urban governance
   actors to the sub-elements of the FWE systems highlights common
   connections and overlapping interests, paving the road toward more
   integrated governance and participatory solutions. Identifying the
   tangible and intangible connections among governance actors also helps
   to reduce the ambiguity of the FWE nexus, and facilitates
   multi-stakeholder knowledge, data or resources sharing. The resultant
   approach aims to disaggregate the complexity of the FWE nexus and make
   its governance more attainable in cities.},

Title = {Earth system law: Exploring new frontiers in legal science},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Anthropocene requires of us to rethink global governance challenges
   and effective responses with a more holistic understanding of the earth
   system as a single intertwined social-ecological system. Law, in
   particular, will have to embrace such a holistic earth system
   perspective in order to deal more effectively with the Anthropocene's
   predicaments. While a growing number of scholars have tried to reimagine
   law and legal scholarship in a more holistic way, these attempts remain
   siloed. What is required is a shared epistemic framework to enable and
   enhance collaborative intradisciplinary and interdisciplinary research
   and co-learning that go hand in hand with thorough transdisciplinary
   stakeholder engagement. We argue that the nascent concept of earth
   system law offers such an overarching epistemic framework. This article
   serves as an invitation to fellow explorers from various legal fields,
   other disciplines, and from a wide range of stakeholders to explore new
   frontiers in earth system law. Our aim is to further stimulate the study
   of earth system law, and to encourage collaboration and co-learning in a
   fertile epistemic space that we share.},

Abstract = {The UN Decade of Ocean Science (UNDOS) aims to: ``Generate knowledge,
   support innovation, and develop solutions for equitable and sustainable
   development of the ocean economy under changing environmental, social
   and climate conditions.{''} Changing conditions affect certain groups
   more than others, depending on exposure, sensitivity and adaptive
   capacity. Gendered differentiation has been studied in small scale
   coastal fisheries. However, this approach is often limited to
   male-female gender dichotomies. In contrast, the present analysis takes
   a more expansive approach centered around the concept of
   intersectionality, to demonstrate more nuanced differences in terms of
   individuals' access to resources for adaptation. We build on multiple
   Earth System Governance contextual conditions and research lenses to
   demonstrate that an intersectional approach allows greater understanding
   of gendered adaptation options impacted by various other factors. This
   must include investigations beyond the traditional gender binary, which
   we have sought to achieve in this study by using broader local and
   individualistic context to observe different communities. We compare
   gender intersectionality in case studies from India and Tanzania. The
   evidence demonstrates that intersectional factors vary, impacting
   adaptiveness to changing Anthropocene conditions, depending upon
   cross-cutting context-specific systems of hierarchy and discrimination.
   However, despite variation, we demonstrate there are common factors to
   be investigated across all locations when identifying possible
   intersectional impacts of ocean policy interventions, particularly
   wealth, marriage and family roles, and social networks.},

Title = {Voluntary standards and the SDGs: Mapping public-private
   complementarities for sustainable development},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {To strengthen global sustainability governance, academics and
   policymakers have called for a better integration of private governance
   with public policy instruments. Surprisingly, however, systematic
   research on the state of such public-private complementarities in the
   field of sustainable development is lacking. With a focus on voluntary
   sustainability standards and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for
   Sustainable Development, this article addresses this research gap. It
   uses a novel dataset of 232 voluntary standards to examine how their
   policies and organizational processes interact with the 17 Sustainable
   Development Goals and their targets. We identify significant
   public-private complementarities, but also areas of institutional
   disconnect. We further explore how the creation of institutional
   linkages in this issue area is driven by instrumental, managerial, and
   normative concerns and develop an agenda for future research. This
   includes research on whether and how intensifying public-private
   interactions at the transnational level translate into tangible impacts
   for sustainable development on the ground.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {Rapid societal transformations are required to keep global average
   temperature rise well below 2. C by 2050. An increasingly diverse set of
   initiatives are leveraging digital technologies to transform society.
   Given the rapid pace at which these initiatives emerge and the
   accelerated rate of technological innovation, few connections are made
   as to their common approaches and motivations. To address this, we
   developed a database of such initiatives from around the world. We
   propose a categorization of four types of strategies: data mobilization,
   optimization of existing strategies, incentivizing and automating
   behavioural change, and enhancing participation and empowerment of
   individuals. We analyse connections between types of strategies through
   the lens of the Earth System Governance framework's original 5 A's -
   Architecture, Agency, Adaptiveness, Accountability, and Allocation \&
   Access. This work provides a first step towards understanding how
   digitallyenabled initiatives are contributing to re-imagining climate
   governance.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {This article develops a typology of co-creational leadership for urban
   climate transformation. The typology is constructed from a combination
   of governance theory and empirical observations of co-creational
   leadership in four global, climate-ambitious cities. By applying a
   framework that differentiates between authority (multilevel or
   polycentric) and purpose (policy design or implementation) as key
   dimensions and categories that structure and condition cities'
   performance of co-creational leadership, the typology draws out four
   unique yet interdependent ideal types of leadership. The typology serves
   two aims. First, it allows a more nuanced understanding of the ways in
   which contextual features present distinct types of challenges and
   condition co-creational leadership by cities. Second, it provides a
   framework for investigating what is required by city officials as
   leaders of co-creation. The typology underlines how co-creation is an
   intrinsic element of hybrid city climate governance.},

Title = {Environmental security as a source of non-state legitimacy: An analysis
   of corporate governance},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Environmental security concepts are shaping the contours of global
   environmental governance. Although many scholars have analyzed the
   emergence of environmental security agendas within state agencies and
   intergovernmental organizations, greater understanding of how
   environmental security debates traverse transnational, non-state
   politics is needed to provide a fuller view of environmental security as
   a globally contested concept. Therefore, this paper examines how
   transnational corporations (TNCs) leverage and generate ideas about
   environmental security on a cross-border scale. Specifically, I explore
   the ways three TNCs -BP, Nutrien, and Veolia-turn to environmental
   security as a source of legitimacy in their broader global environmental
   governance agendas. I find that these TNCs rely on particular notions of
   environmental security to validate their roles in filling governance
   gaps, promoting democratic principles, and mitigating planetary crisis,
   particularly to appease a primarily Western, elite audience. Ultimately,
   I reveal how environmental security concepts inform non-state legitimacy
   claims and advocate for a political economic perspective for
   understanding the wider implications of environmental security as a
   power-laden concept.},

Abstract = {This chapter addresses the perceptions versus facts divide as the United
   States experiences an eruption of facts, opinions, and untruths in
   web-facilitated environments. It addresses how traditional and newer
   media undermine social justice and political inclusion in ways lingering
   beyond Donald Trump's presidency. A competitive environment encouraging
   journalists to publicize rumor and gossip is addressed. The reliance of
   individuals on the personal experience of mental models, heuristics, and
   perceptions to separate fact from fiction is examined. Powerful
   influences of self-interest and political allegiance are explored. In
   the context of a deeply divided nation, libraries are seen as having the
   capability of implementing confidence-building measures to bridge the
   rift in their communities and organizations. The roles of information
   educators in advancing democracy through promoting useful theories and
   effective interlanguages are considered. The value of pragmatism, a
   philosophy promoting engagement in reformist projects possibly
   acceptable in conservative and mixed ideological environments is
   addressed. Economically advanced nations committed to equality and
   inclusion may find the US experience to be both a warning of potential
   roadblocks and a guide as to how such obstacles may sometimes be
   positively addressed.},

Title = {Reimagining international environmental law for the Anthropocene: An
   earth system law perspective},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Concerns have been raised regarding the ability of international
   environmental law to respond to potentially irreversible earth system
   transformations in the Anthropocene. We argue that in order for
   international environmental law to have the capacity to respond to the
   socio-ecological challenges of the Anthropocene, it should embrace an
   earth system perspective. Earth system law, which is grounded in an
   earth system perspective, has been proposed as a new epistemic framework
   to facilitate the legal transformations necessary to respond to such
   socio-ecological challenges. With reference to recent developments in
   the international environmental law domain, we discuss the ways in which
   international environmental law currently fails to align with such a
   perspective and the types of considerations that international
   environmental law should reflect in order to be more responsive to a
   transforming earth system and, thus, better fit-for-purpose in the
   Anthropocene.},

Title = {Architecture and agency for equity in areas beyond national jurisdiction},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the UN
   Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (Ocean Decade) bring
   increased attention to various aspects of ocean governance, including
   equity. One of the Ocean Decade's identified challenges is to develop a
   sustainable and equitable ocean economy, but questions arise about how
   to conceptualize the multiple dimensions of equity in an ocean context.
   These questions become more complex as activities move away from coastal
   ecosystems and communities into off-shore Areas Beyond National
   Jurisdiction (ABNJ), where ocean resources are recognized simultaneously
   as unowned/open access and as common heritage. In this paper, we
   mobilize the Earth System Governance analytics of `architecture' and
   `agency', to reflect on the possibilities for equity in ABNJ. Motivated
   by the general attention to equity in UN initiatives like the SDGs and
   the Ocean Decade, we describe current UN architecture for ocean
   governance, including principles that might support equity. Existing UN
   architecture focuses on distributional equity among nation states, with
   less attention to recognitional or procedural equity. State actors have
   most agency, while non-state actors can exercise some via broad UN
   declarations and through mechanisms like `major groups.' We use on-going
   negotiations in the International Seabed Authority on rules for mineral
   exploitation and in the Intergovernmental Conference on an international
   legally binding instrument under UNCLOS on the conservation and
   sustainable use of marine biological diversity of Areas Beyond National
   Jurisdiction to illustrate how existing architecture shapes
   possibilities for equity in ABNJ. As new governance possibilities are
   imagined, attending to existing architecture and agency can help avoid
   further entrenching existing power imbalances and unwittingly
   reproducing or exacerbating inequities.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper challenges Earth System Governance (ESG) scholars to rethink
   the concept of Planetary Justice (PJ) in the era of the Anthropocene so
   it is more attentive to non-Western perspectives and sensitive to the
   experiences of Indigenous peoples. We combine findings from a narrative
   review with those derived from academic collaborations with the Amah
   Mutsun Tribal Band to propose the Indigenous principle of `justice as
   healing' through `recognition' as a crucial element in the emerging PJ
   framework. We argue that healing can be initiated by acknowledging
   colonialism as a driving force behind socio-environmental injustices,
   centering state accountability in environmental governance
   decision-making, and recognizing the value of restoring Indigenous
   knowledges and practices. Ultimately, we argue healing is the
   responsibility of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities. ESG
   scholars have an important role to play in supporting healing and
   enacting recognition within and among Indigenous peoples through their
   engagements with Native communities.},

Abstract = {In an April 2018 webinar, the Freedom to Read Foundation asked the
   question: Do information consumers have the right to be misinformed?
   Fake news is nuanced, prolific, sometimes malicious, often automated,
   and has the added complications of emotion, privacy, and ethics. And
   unfortunately, fake news and its foundational components of
   misinformation and disinformation (mis/dis), aren't quickly fixed by
   learning a few information literacy strategies or media literacy
   concepts. People are inclined to believe what they want to believe
   despite training, awareness of critical thinking, and acknowledgement of
   widely held ``objective facts.{''} Are they less intelligent or
   information poor because they choose to exist in their own information
   worlds and privilege their own confirmation biases?
   Individuals have the right to seek, avoid, and use information for
   themselves as they see fit, regardless of whether or not others deem
   their information deficient, insufficient, or even false. However, this
   is a very black and white perspective on a much more complex and nuanced
   moral issue. Even if it is to their detriment, people ultimately do have
   the right to be misinformed, choosing the information they will and
   won't accept. But information professionals should still be compelled to
   instruct patrons on the importance of seeking, finding, and using
   quality information and sources.},

Title = {Governing spillovers of agricultural land use through voluntary
   sustainability standards: A coverage analysis of sustainability
   requirements},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS) are prominent governance
   instruments that define and verify sus-tainable agricultural land use at
   farm and supply chain levels. However, agricultural production can
   prompt spillover dynamics with implications for sustainability that go
   beyond these scales, e.g., through runoff of chemical inputs or
   long-distance migrant worker flows. Scientific evidence on the
   governance of spillovers through VSS is, however, limited. This study
   investigates the extent to which VSS regulate a set of 21 envi-ronmental
   and socio-economic spillovers of agricultural land use. To this end, we
   assessed the spillover coverage in 100 sustainability standards. We find
   that VSS have a clear tendency to cover environmental spillovers more
   extensively than socio-economic spillovers. Further, we show how
   spillover coverage differs across varying types of standard-setting
   organizations and VSS verification mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the
   role and limitations that VSS can have in addressing the revealed gaps.},

Title = {Architecture, agency and ocean data science initiatives: Data-driven
   transformation of oceans governance},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The oceans are regarded as both relatively under-governed and
   understudied, especially at the global and regional scales. By
   mobilizing data with the express goal of improving oceans governance,
   ocean data science initiatives (ODSIs) are positioned to play a critical
   role in addressing and perhaps collapsing these gaps and to provide the
   ``science we need for the ocean we want.{''} We argue that ODSIs are now
   critical oceans governance actors, to be examined as such. To this end,
   we have compiled a catalog of more than 150 global and regional ODSIs.
   Through a textual analysis of websites and public communications of a
   subset of these, we have created metadata about their practices. We
   examine ODSIs from the lens of three elements of Earth Systems
   Governance: normative frames, architecture and agency. ODSIs emerge from
   and evolve through, a range of institutional frameworks both inside and
   outside of formal policy forums, however, they are also transforming
   those frameworks through norms, institutions and practices which shape
   how data is valued, collected, organized, analyzed, and acted upon. As a
   result, ODSIs and their data products are not just mobilized by actors
   seeking to influence governance but are creating novel forms of agency
   and have become significant ocean governance actors in and of
   themselves. Thus, ODSIs both expand and blur the boundaries of
   architecture and agency. We conclude by considering how we might better
   understand ODSIs as governance actors through Earth Systems Governance,
   their role in shaping architecture and agency in governance relations
   and, in turn, the implications of integrating data and technology in an
   Earth Systems Governance framework.},

Title = {Fostering place-shaped responsibilities for biodiversity: An analytical
   framework with insights from the UK Overseas Territories},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Accelerated human impacts on the earth system bring urgency to the
   question of how responsibility can be appropriately and justly
   distributed across scales and actors. Drawing together theory from
   international re-lations and human geography with empirical analysis on
   responsibilities for biodiversity, this paper has two aims: to develop a
   framework for examining responsibilities for biodiversity that is
   applied to the context of the UK Overseas Territories; and to draw out
   broader lessons for thinking about environmental responsibilities more
   generally. The analysis draws particular attention to the importance of
   place-shaped responsibilities for biodi-versity, which emerge as
   localised narratives of responsibility that take account of the enabling
   and resisting conditions that matter in particular places. Applied in
   the context of biodiversity governance, this suggests a need to join up
   policy issues, embed equity, explore multiple meanings, bridge
   pro-active and retrospective re-sponsibilities, and enhance the role of
   the social sciences in enabling responsibilities.},

Title = {Digitalization between environmental activism and counter-activism: The
   case of satellite data on deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes the uses of digital satellite data on deforestation
   in the Amazon region, drawing on post-structuralist studies of
   scientific knowledge practices and Science and Technology Studies (STS).
   Focusing on changes under the government of President Jair Bolsonaro, we
   argue that populist right-wing rhetoric, policies, and practices towards
   deforestation in the Amazon must be understood in the context of a broad
   and sophisticated effort to discredit and dismantle pre-existing
   knowledge infrastructures and transparency regime. These structures had
   developed over time with the aim of making deforestation visible and
   manageable. The dismantling of these structures is part of the effort to
   establish a competing alethurgy, i.e an assemblage of procedures and
   rituals that claim to manifest the ``truth{''} about the Amazon. This
   new alethurgy depends, crucially, on a regime of hypertransparency which
   enables practices of environmental counter-activism. This new alethurgy
   promotes an extractivist use of the Amazon in which deforestation is an
   acceptable price to pay for economic development.},

Title = {The national development plans after the SDGs: Steering implications of
   the global goals towards national development planning},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article seeks to understand how the nationalization of the SDGs
   exercises affects NDPs. Drawing on theories of norm localization, it
   examines NDPs and visions of five countries to see how the SDGs as
   normative tools shift or steer a pre-existing alignment between global
   and domestic norms. Our study finds that the SDGs offer alternatives to
   traditional normative frameworks, but they have not fundamentally
   changed the state's dominant development paradigm. The SDGs have created
   a flexible space for norm translation through technical communication
   and approaches that appeal to the domestic discourse. Our study shows
   the dynamics of norm localization and flexibility provided by the SDGs
   as they interact with domestic norms and the state's sovereignty in
   creating space for sustainable development. This article contributes to
   the literature on the steering impacts of global goals in shaping
   national development planning and domestic policy choices through the
   identification of norm localization occurrences in NDPs.},

Abstract = {While much discussion of information literacy in librarianship has
   focused on the educational roles that librarians play in promoting
   information literacy among the communities they serve, the information
   literacy education of librarians themselves has not received much
   attention. In response to an article written by the authors of this
   chapter, a surprisingly large number of librarians responded to them to
   try to contradict the assertions of their article using what was clearly
   disinformation. Drawing upon these attempts by librarians to spread
   misinformation in a professional context, this discussion explores the
   ways in which a lack of critical information literacy among information
   professionals can impact the ability of libraries and librarians to
   support their communities. This chapter also considers ways in which the
   librarians and library professional organizations could work to promote
   critical information literacy among current and future members of the
   profession.},

Title = {A preliminary framework for understanding the governance of novel
   environmental technologies: Ambiguity, indeterminateness and drift},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We propose a conceptual framework to explain why some technologies are
   more difficult to govern than others in global environmental governance.
   We start from the observation that some technologies pose transboundary
   environmental risks, some provide capacities for managing such risks,
   and some do both. For ``ambiguous{''} technologies, potential risks and
   risk management capacities are uncertain, unknown or even unknowable.
   Governance systems are indeterminate towards ambiguous technologies, as
   existing norms, rules, scripts and routines do not imply default
   solutions under institutional focal points. Indeterminateness can lead
   to institutional drift, with risks accordingly remaining unmitigated and
   risk management capacities remaining unexploited. We use the cases of
   solar geoengineering, gene drive systems and bioinformatics for
   illustrating this framework. As technological ambiguity may often be
   irresolvable, we conclude that it might force us to confront the limits
   to anticipatory global decision-making on matters of long-term
   environmental sustainability.},

Title = {Building a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty: Key elements},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Amid growing recognition of the need for supply-side policies which set
   limits on the further expansion of fossil fuel extraction and use, in
   this article we consider possible elements of a Fossil Fuel
   Non-Proliferation Treaty (FF NPT), behind which there is growing
   momentum. We elaborate on the possible institutional mechanisms,
   principles, procedures, and other elements of an FF NPT, by drawing on
   relevant precedents and parallels with other treaties and bodies of
   international law on the environment and other policy arenas, and
   proposals circulating in academic and grey literatures. We address in
   turn: the scope, objectives, and principles of an FF NPT; the three
   pillars of commitments under the treaty of (i) ending expansion, (ii)
   phasing out fossil fuels, and (iii) a global just transition; and
   options for implementation, including the review of implementation,
   compliance and effectiveness, a financial mechanism, institutional
   arrangements, and the role of non-state actors.},

Abstract = {Capacity development is a major priority in the United Nations Decade of
   Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (the Decade). Persistent
   disparities in ocean science capacity illustrate the substantial
   challenges to achieving the Decade's stated goal of eradicating
   inequality. We argue that a new conversation about capacity development
   is essential for the success of the Decade and beyond. We question the
   meaning, motivations, pathways and measurement of capacity development
   at this critical juncture. While we do not propose a single answer to
   these context- and situation-specific questions, we do recognize that
   the lack of accepted, or even defined, approaches to capacity
   development, its initiation, leadership, desired outcomes,
   implementation, and evaluation is failing the global ocean community.
   Explicit focus and reflection on the power of discourses, definitions,
   positionality, and perspectives has the potential to greatly improve the
   experience and outcomes of capacity development programs. This
   Perspective seeks to stimulate reflection and action to seize the
   substantial opportunity presented by the Decade to facilitate capacity
   development solutions toward a more equitable world.},

Abstract = {Games offer unique possibilities for imagining and experimenting with
   new systems of governance for more sustainable futures - new rules and
   institutions, new roles, and new dynamic worlds. However, research on
   sustainability games has mostly investigated games as a type of futures
   method, largely divorced from its societal contexts. In this paper, we
   argue that to unlock the potential of gaming for anticipatory governance
   in the service of a more sustainable future, it is important take a
   whole-society perspective, and examine the possibilities and challenges
   offered by contextual factors. Using the Netherlands and Japan as
   examples, we investigate the following questions: 1) How do governance
   cultures allow or restrict opportunities for the participatory
   exploration of futures using games? 2) How does, and can, the game
   sector in a given context support anticipatory gaming? 3) How do
   dominant societal relationships with games limit, and offer
   opportunities for, gaming for anticipatory governance?},

Abstract = {The UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030)
   aims to tackle several challenges on the path towards more sustainable
   ocean futures. Its central objectives are to close knowledge gaps,
   increase the usability of scientific knowledge on the ocean, strengthen
   science-policy interfaces, and make oceanography fit for purpose. The
   quest for a reflexive turn within ocean science itself echoes many
   claims for more inclusive, diverse, and equitable research practices in
   the marine realm and provides an entry point for discussing the
   contribution of the social sciences to the UN Decade. This article
   examines different social science research avenues and proposes a
   research agenda detailing different entry points for unpacking the
   complex web of science-policy interrelations. First, we identify three
   research themes - reflexive ocean science, policy-relevant ocean
   science, and engaged ocean science- and nine research avenues where
   social science expertise is needed to close knowledge gaps. Second, we
   use the case of marine biodiversity to illustrate how to combine
   research into different avenues. Finally, the comprehensive study of
   ocean science's reflexive, political, and societal dimensions is an
   emerging field within ocean governance scholarship and deserves to
   receive increased attention from scholars interested in the conditions
   of transformative change.},

Abstract = {According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the
   world is experiencing the greatest refugee crisis in recorded history
   alongside increasingly restrictive limits on asylum seekers and
   refugees. In 2020, the US administration established a ceiling for
   refugees of 18,000 people, the lowest number on record, and only 11,814
   refugees were admitted to the United States. The Biden administration
   has expressed commitments to building a coherent asylum and refugee
   system and quickly reversing recent detrimental policies. But the
   administration has cautioned how quickly change might occur, given how
   ``agencies and processes.have been so gutted.{''}(1)
   2016 to 2020 included an overwhelming series of changes to laws and
   policies affecting asylum seekers, often with little documented planning
   or communication, wreaking severe effects on conditions for asylum
   seekers at the USMexico border. These changes had significant
   consequences for human rights, most notably the linchpin right of access
   to information. At the US-Mexico border, must the right ``to seek,
   receive and impart information{''} be fulfilled in order to fulfill the
   right to asylum?
   While information professionals are not expected to be experts in law,
   they are experts in understanding the link between access to information
   and the realization of justice and human rights. This chapter
   investigates the role of the information professional in the fulfillment
   of the right to asylum, particularly in the context of contemporary
   asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border, volatile information landscapes,
   and the legal and historical framework in the United States for seeking
   asylum.},

Title = {Environmental governance in globally telecoupled systems: Mapping the
   terrain towards an integrated research agenda},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Environmental governance is increasingly challenged by global flows,
   which connect distant places through trade, investment and movement of
   people. To date, research on this topic has been dispersed across
   multiple fields and diverse theoretical perspectives. We present the
   results of a systematic literature review of 120 journal articles on the
   environmental governance of global flows and their environmental
   impacts, employing the notion of telecoupling as a common analytical
   lens.
   Six themes emerged, which can guide a comparative and policy-relevant
   research agenda on governing global telecoupling: (1) advancement of
   problem-centered research (as opposed to studying existing governance
   arrangements), (2) displacement of environmental burdens from Global
   North to South from a telecoupling perspective, (3) environmental
   governance of telecoupling between Global South countries, (4) policy
   coherence in governing global flows, (5) cross-scalar interactions
   between private and public governance and (6) combinations of governance
   arrangements to effectively address environmental problems in
   telecoupled settings.},

Title = {Recentering the role of marine restoration science to bolster community
   stewardship},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The restoration of marine habitats is becoming a primary strategy for
   managing healthy coastal ecosystems, but initiatives often fail due to
   conflicts with social or industry activities. Confronting the challenge
   of expanding marine restoration for the `Ocean Decade', this paper
   explores the ways that researchers could improve the way Governments and
   practitioners engage stakeholders with restorations of high
   socio-ecological and economic value. We seek to recenter the role of
   scientific knowledge-making in marine restoration by incorporating
   culturally informed socio-economic well-being into restoration practice;
   a process for encouraging greater marine stewardship by an engaged, more
   ocean literate public set to co-benefit from successful restoration
   practices. Using Australia's shellfish reef restoration program as a
   case study, we underscore the value of understanding diverse
   perspectives on marine restoration to foster a more inclusive
   restoration practice, one that nurtures a meaningful knowledge base to
   shift how restoration is viewed, engaged with, and funded.},

Abstract = {While LIS scholarship emphasizes the need to be multi-literate by
   equipping people with critical information literacy, digital literacy,
   and media literacy skills to combat the phenomenon of fake news in the
   contemporary information society, the concept of political information
   literacy is still in its infancy. This chapter addresses this gap by
   developing an understanding of political information literacy and
   challenges the premise that information professionals and information
   organizations should remain neutral in the face of phenomena like
   censorship through noise and disinformation. In this endeavor, it
   reviews contemporary information environments vis-a-vis the growth of
   fake news and misinformation, and current information literacy
   approaches utilized by information organizations. Thereafter, it
   explores several cognitive barriers, such as the role of confirmation
   bias, information avoidance, information groupishness, and information
   overload, which affects people's ability to process information.
   Finally, it encourages information professionals to hold regular
   information sessions on politically charged topics, tackle the cognitive
   factors increasing misinformation, and cultivate multidisciplinary
   approaches to confront fake news.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Oceans governance occurs through overlapping, multi-level institutions
   that often fail to recognize Indigenous sovereignty and
   self-determination. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) provides
   pathways for recognizing Indigenous rights. However, observed power
   asymmetries and cross-level local to international conflicts threatened
   subsistence rights and generated research and advocacy fatigue for
   Chukchi, In similar to upiat, Saint Lawrence Island Yupik, and Siberian
   Yupik com-munities in the USA and Russia. We conduct an institutional
   analysis of Indigenous bowhead whaling governance based upon lived
   experiences of Indigenous authors, primary documents from co-management
   organizations, national agencies, the IWC, and extant literature. We
   explore how Indigenous co-management organizations increased sovereignty
   and self-determination for communities whose culture, identities,
   livelihoods, and origins are intimately connected to marine mammal
   hunting. Our study also provides lessons for the United Nations Decade
   for Ocean Science on the challenges of institutional navigation and the
   role of embodied resurgent practice amongst Indigenous communities
   within Earth system governance.},

Abstract = {This chapter explores ``politic talks{''} (also known as political
   information) on the websites of academic libraries in land-grant state
   universities of the South in the context of a global retreat of
   democracy that emerged during former President Trump's regime as the
   45th President of the United States. The exploratory qualitative
   evaluation applies website content analysis of seven information
   offerings in three categories that include: (1) information sources
   (collections, resources), information policy and planning (assigned
   role, strategic representation), and connections (internal, external,
   news and events). Promising practices and illustrative examples of
   ``politic talks{''} representation on academic library websites show how
   they are serving as significant providers of political information
   during current politically turbulent times. The discussion of these
   findings in relation to each state's voting likelihood based on trends
   since 2000 has significant political implications in enhancing the role
   of academic libraries moving forward.},

Title = {Democratising sustainability transformations: Assessing the
   transformative potential of democratic practices in environmental
   governance},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many democracies find it difficult to act swiftly on problems such as
   climate change and biodiversity loss. This is reflected in long-standing
   debates in research and policy about whether democratic practices are
   capable of fostering timely, large-scale transformations towards
   sustainability. Drawing on an integrative review of scholarly literature
   from 2011 to early 2021 on sustainability transformations and the
   democracy-environment nexus, this article synthesises existing research
   on prospects and pitfalls for democratising sustainability
   transformations. We advance a new typology for understanding various
   combinations of democratic/authoritarian practices and of
   transformations towards/away from sustainability. We then explore the
   role of democratic practices in accelerating or obstructing five key
   dimensions of sustainability transformations: institutional, social,
   economic, technological, and epistemic. Across all dimensions we find
   substantial evidence that democratic practices can foster
   transformations towards sustainability, and we conclude by outlining a
   set of associated policy recommendations.},

Abstract = {This chapter discusses the unique role that public libraries can play to
   (re) build our Republic by centering the lived experiences and voices of
   marginalized communities. As robust sites for out-of-school time
   learning and community-based information spaces, public libraries have
   long played a key role in promoting the health and well-being of our
   nation's democracy. Public libraries' inclusivity efforts, though, have
   not always been evenly balanced, and these efforts have often been
   underdeveloped, poorly articulated, and undervalued by other key civic
   actors. Bringing together a Learning Sciences scholar of youth
   development and civic engagement, Library and Information Sciences
   scholar on free speech, and an Assistant Director of a public library in
   the Southeast, this chapter will offer interdisciplinary
   research-practice insights into both the challenges and opportunities
   that exist for public libraries as they grapple with the serious
   question of how to serve the public in the complex reality that is this
   third decade of the twenty-first century. In particular, this chapter
   explores questions like: how can public libraries balance the
   constraints of the status quo to hear, share, and amplify the voices of
   marginalized communities? And in what ways can library staff encourage
   opportunities that bridge librarians' expertise and libraries' resources
   with the lived realities and needs of marginalized communities? In this
   chapter, the authors expand upon these questions and collectively dream
   about the ways in which public libraries might be reimagined to more
   authentically and equitably serve the many faces of the contemporary
   American public.},

Abstract = {As fake news and other disinformation are spread primarily online and
   erode trust in experts and institutions, they challenge the role of
   librarians as information gatekeepers. Experts have advocated for
   libraries to educate the public to resist misinformation, yet libraries
   cannot assume sole responsibility for information literacy work. In this
   chapter, the authors explore several successful information literacy
   programs in Ukraine, whose fake news problems made global headlines in
   2014, when the Russian annexation of Crimea was accompanied by a flood
   of crude but effective disinformation. The authors look particularly at
   the Learn to Discern programs established by the international
   non-profit organization IREX to foster information literacy using
   techniques grounded in interdisciplinary expertise and carefully
   evaluated through pilot studies and follow-up evaluations. These
   programs train instructors through workshops and provide them with
   materials. In the first program, aimed at the general public, many of
   the instructors were librarians, and library facilities were heavily
   used to deliver the public training. In the second program, information
   literacy was integrated into the public school curriculum and thousands
   of teachers were trained to deliver expertly designed materials for
   particular grade levels and subjects. The authors also consider the
   special challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, both as a source for
   new forms of misinformation and as a disruptor of training previously
   delivered in tightly packed libraries and classrooms. These Ukrainian
   programs demonstrate the potential for fighting fake news and other
   misinformation on a scale far beyond what could be accomplished by
   individual libraries acting alone.},

Abstract = {With a long history, drug trafficking has been a growing problem in
   recent decades that has reached global dimensions. This article studies
   the evolution and current status of the normative strategy of the United
   Nations and the European Union against this problem, currently embedded
   in transnational organized crime networks, especially transatlantic
   networks. It concludes that, despite all the enormous effort in this
   fight, far from combating it effectively, the results are abysmal, both
   in the most affected national contexts and at the global level.},

Abstract = {A BsTRACT . This article longitudinally analyzes the strategic
   interaction between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in
   their four decades of conflict. Using contemporary strategic theory as
   an analytical framework, it analyzes how the parties' strategies -grand
   and military- and political objectives align. It finds that both parties
   have struggled with establishing (aligning policy, strategy, and
   resources) and, in several instances, maintaining a functioning strategy
   bridge. Static approaches that solely worked in a specific context and
   the absence of a strategy bridge have plagued both actors, thus
   perpetuating the ongoing conflict. The authors conclude that the
   conflict will likely continue unless one of the parties can create and
   maintain a working strategy bridge for an extended period.},

   have lasted for millennia on a civilizational, social, or geopolitical
   basis, which are insufficiently studied and analyzed despite their
   duration. This study aims to find an effective way to resolve a conflict

   determine that researchers of this issue must engage both the
   methodological and their political position, presenting a personal view.
   This study states the importance of understanding how best to avoid and,
   at some stage, try to prevent the spread of conflict.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the deforestation phenomenon in Colombia and the
   armed conflict's influence on it, identifying reparation actions that
   State institutions, social organizations, and the affected local
   communities themselves can implement. First, a qualitative documentary
   review methodology is used to analyze the conflict's impacts on
   deforestation, its relationship with illicit economic activities, and
   the involved actors' roles. Then, the relationship between ecosystems
   and communities is addressed, focused primarily on the indigenous and
   peasant populations inhabiting the affected territories and the grave
   consequences experienced. Finally, some environmental reparation actions
   are studied, such as the Army's Operation Artemisa and other initiatives
   developed from the local communities' perspective, knowledge, and
   specific needs.},

Abstract = {a bstRact . The speed and complexity of the transformations in security
   and defense scenarios challenge the stability and reconciliation sought
   by peace agreements that have ended intra- and inter-state conflicts in
   various world regions. By analyzing 34 cases in five continents between
   1989 and 2012, this article identifies common provisions included in
   peace agreements, grouping them by region to provide a tool for future
   analysis. It concludes that provisions such as disarmament,
   verification/monitoring mechanism, and police reform are the most widely
   used globally and, thus, less subject to modification. Meanwhile,
   others, such as minority and children's rights, international
   arbitration, and territorial power-sharing, are the least common and,
   perhaps, the most prone to generating new grievances and episodes of
   violence.},

Abstract = {This research focuses on information security as a social state, its
   aspects and characteristics, information security standards, and its
   impact on improving the information security process. It emphasizes the
   multidisciplinary nature of the issue of information security. Several
   methods are employed in this study, including formal-logical and
   system-structural methods, methods of generalization, and comparative
   law. Documentary analysis is used to examine the regulatory framework
   concerning information security and the main international and national
   information security standards. Three levels of information security are
   identified -personal, social, and state. It concludes that the levels
   differ depending on their degree within the information space.},

   method that simulates artificial societies to substantiate the thesis on
   its feasibility and scientific usefulness in lawmaking and law
   enforcement in Ukraine and research in the legal field. The primary

Abstract = {. This article examines the standing threats to global security in the
   21st century to identify and classify them. A hundred threats and social
   and environmental vulnerabilities were identified through the
   hermeneutic analogical documentary analysis of 25 sources, mainly
   supranational documents. These were organized based on supranational
   theories and theorists, such as Bouthoul, Kaldor, and Hamilton, in a
   four -group structure: traditional threats, new threats, asymmetric
   attacks on the population, and social and environmental vulnerabilities.
   Finally, the article addresses the ethical problem implied by these
   prevailing threats that continue to menace human dignity.},

Abstract = {With their new threats, different intensity levels, and hybridization
   between conventional and irregular conflicts, today's conflicts, imply
   new challenges in the face of which states' strategic intelligence
   sometimes lags behind. This article analyzes the transformations of wars
   in the developing international system through three thematic axes.
   First, it addresses the transformations in the instruments and methods
   of hybrid, unrestricted, and asymmetric wars. Secondly, the conflicts'
   levels of intensity and what this implies in terms of threats and their
   strategic conduct are examined. Finally, lawfare or legal wars and their
   use for the strategic interest of some actors -in a mixture of
   political-military strategy and law in the new world order- are
   analyzed.},

Abstract = {Unrestricted war, defined as a war that exceeds limits, has been
   well-studied since its conceptual origin in 1999. However, in the West,
   it has been used mainly to analyze the balance of power strategies,
   ignoring its potential to study intra-state conflicts. This article
   analyzes how the organized armed group National Liberation Army (ELN)
   employs unrestricted warfare in Colombia. First, the concept of
   unrestricted warfare is developed. Then, the ELN is analyzed from its
   identity, ideology, and interaction with the setting. Finally, eight
   variables of unrestricted warfare are addressed, evaluating whether the
   ELN applies them. It is concluded that this group has changed its
   strategy towards omnidirectionality, and recommendations are made for
   the Colombian State in its fight against this threat.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the Colombian Armed Forces' operations in the
   1932-1933 Colombian-Peruvian border conflict and the negotiations before
   and after the ratification of the Salomon-Lozano Treaty of 1922 between
   the two countries. To this end, a documentary review of press reports at
   the time and other historical sources is carried out to verify to what
   extent this conflict determined the bilateral relations between the two
   countries. The results show that Colombia's diplomatic and military
   strategy in handling the resolution of the conflict enhanced the
   development of the Colombian Armed Forces, positioning the country
   before the international community and the region as a strong nation
   with good diplomatic relations.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the phenomenon of the social stigmatization of
   human rights defenders and social leaders in Colombia and its
   relationship with the persecution, threats, harassment, and homicides
   against this population, especially after the 2016 Peace Agreement. This
   relationship has been particularly ignored even though it explains much
   of the criminality directed against social defenders and leaders in the
   country, which tends to be normalized, even holding the victims
   themselves responsible for the violence they endure on account of their
   activities. The article highlights the responsibility of illegal armed
   groups and their illicit economies and the State's criminal policy
   failures to control this stigmatization and criminality in Colombia.},

Abstract = {This article presents a robust documentary analysis of the concepts of
   human security and multidimensional security, their focus on protecting
   human rights, differences in the state's role for this purpose, and
   their relationship with the Sustainable Development Goals. It also
   explores the recent human rights situation in Colombia and the
   importance of specific indicators to assess and guarantee the protection
   of human rights. It is concluded that the concepts of human security and
   multidimensional security share their emphasis on the comprehensive
   protection of human rights and highlights the contribution of the
   Sustainable Development Goals for this purpose, as well as of the
   specific indicators, both for countries and for international
   organizations that evaluate the guarantee of human rights.},

Abstract = {A BsTRACT . This article analyzes the strategies the Organization for
   Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has employed to increase
   its influence on the dynamics of global economic governance since the
   first decade of the 21st century. The OECD has undertaken three
   strategies: a strategic alliance with the G-20; the inclusion of new
   members, especially states whose membership is strategic; and the
   strengthening of the non-membership partnership to support the
   transitional development of Latin American and Caribbean countries. This
   article uses a qualitative methodology involving a documentary review of
   academic, official, and press texts. It is concluded that these
   strategies have yielded different results for the organization. On the
   one hand, the links with the G-20 are relevant; however, the entry of
   new members' effectiveness is unclear.},

Abstract = {. This article longitudinally analyzes the strategic interaction between
   Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in their four decades of
   conflict. Using contemporary strategic theory as an analytical
   framework, it analyzes how the parties' strategies -grand and military-
   and political objectives align. It finds that both parties have
   struggled with establishing (aligning policy, strategy, and resources)
   and, in several instances, maintaining a functioning strategy bridge.
   Static approaches that solely worked in a specific context and the
   absence of a strategy bridge have plagued both actors, thus perpetuating
   the ongoing conflict. The authors conclude that the conflict will likely
   continue unless one of the parties can create and maintain a working
   strategy bridge for an extended period.},

Abstract = {This article examines the degree of recognition of the military victim
   classification in the Army's regulations and doctrine, analyzing its
   relationship with military honor, central to the members of the Armed
   Forces doctrine. A qualitative methodology based on documentary analysis
   is used to determine the status of the military victim from the legal
   norms that support the category of military victim in Colombia and its
   transformation after the 2016 Peace Agreement. Then, it addresses the
   importance and transformation of the concept of military honor and
   discusses its relationship with military victims. Based on the
   autopoiesis of social systems, it is concluded that institutional
   neglect of military victims can disarticulate the principle of military
   honor.},

   Norena-Chavez et al. (2021), this time with officers from the Escuela
   Superior de Guerra del Ej \& eacute;rcito del Per \& uacute;, involving
   a random sample of 103 middle command officers. The data were evaluated
   by structural equation modeling using partial least squares (PLS-SEM). A
   statistically significant influence of the leadership styles studied on
   the innovative behavior of the officers was found, with a higher
   influence shown by the transformational leadership style than
   transactional leadership. This research contributes to a deeper
   understanding of the relationship between leadership styles and
   innovative behavior in the military.},

Abstract = {A BsTRACT . The importance of natural resources in Colombia is based on
   national interests that determine their State institutional integration
   in favor of their preservation in the face of possible threats. This
   article analyzes water explicitly, understood as a human right and a
   strategic resource for the State, to understand the State's
   hydrostrategy and its articulation with national defense and security.
   To this end, the State's national interests are addressed. The specific
   interest of the integral management of water resources is analyzed, and
   the implications of water as a strategic natural resource in the social
   rule of law. It is concluded that the hydrostrategy provides a
   protection approach to the new threats to this resource, in articulation
   with the military strategy.},

Abstract = {A BsTRAcT . This article analyzes the discussions and regulations
   surrounding military suffrage in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
   Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela and their relationship with the armed
   forces' periods of dictatorship and political intervention in these
   countries. Based on the categories of active suffrage and passive
   suffrage, understood as the act of electing and being elected,
   respectively, the political and constitutional situation of military
   voting in each State is determined through a documentary review. Despite
   the marked differences between these countries in this respect, there is
   a trend of democratic consolidation through the restriction of military
   suffrage, especially passive suffrage, after the experiences of military
   governments. However, the risk of military, political intervention in
   the democracies of the region persists.},

Abstract = {A BsTRACT . The center of gravity concept is one of contemporary
   military science's fundamental yet highly controversial pillars.
   Although, over the past decades, the center of gravity has become the
   modus operandi of the planning and conduct of (major) military
   operations in a number of armed forces, the concept remains
   insufficiently understood and is often poorly applied in practice. In
   this light, we have sought to improve its theoretical comprehension by
   identifying the conceptual dimensions that the most influential authors
   commonly highlight. Using the structural method for the concept
   analysis, we have identified seven entities frequently understood as the
   potential centers of gravity. These are: (1) fielded military, (2)
   leadership, (3) industry, (4) infrastructure, (5) population, (6) public
   opinion, and (7) ideology.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the normative structure of Article 57 of Law 1862
   of 2017, which structures the Military Forces' disciplinary
   non-legality, establishing discipline, probity, and service and state
   purposes as legal goods seemingly incompatibly with the foundations of
   criminal law. To this end, it reviews the differences between the
   normative structures and purposes of the disciplinary regime and
   criminal law. Criminal law seeks to protect legal goods through
   objective assessment standards, while disciplinary law seeks to
   establish a model of conduct in public servants through subjective
   standards of determination. In the end, it advocates interpreting this
   law's interests as personal duties and not legal goods, following the
   disciplinary regime.},

Abstract = {How do criminal agendas affect a peace process with violent non-state
   actors? This article endeavors to resolve this question by presenting a
   qualitative analysis of the gang truce in El Salvador during the
   government of Mauricio Funes, using the Peace Triangle as an analytical
   framework based on three study variables: issues, behavior, and
   attitudes. It aims to make a double contribution to peace studies,
   filling a gap in academic knowledge about the sustainability of peace
   processes and examining the relationship between criminal agendas and
   conflict resolution. The study reveals that the former Salvadoran
   president's inadequate management of criminal agendas transformed the
   peace negotiation into a damage control strategy, as it was not intended
   to modify the scale of gang-committed predatory crimes but rather, to
   shape its behavior.},

   International Court of Justice's (ICJ) case law in interpreting
   international humanitarian law (IHL) and its relationship with public
   international law. It examines how the ICJ has elevated IHL to customary
   law, declaring it ``intransgressible{''} and equating it with jus
   cogens, and identified particular obligations for the parties in
   conflict. The article studies how the Court has clarified the
   relationships between customary IHL with the law of treaties and has
   declared which elements of IHL constitute the most basic principles of
   humanity, applicable whether it is an international or non-international
   armed conflict. Finally, the text analyzes how the Court has discouraged
   counterproductive separations between the application of IHL and
   international human rights law.},

Abstract = {European norms and institutions have consolidated a regulatory framework
   for conflict resolution with a mediation directive; however, its
   national application is heterogeneous. Thus, to unify its use as an
   effective mechanism and incorporate the culture of mediation, it has
   been deemed mandatory in a mitigated way. This article addresses the
   arising tense doctrinal discussion that supports the reflection on
   effective judicial protection and security and freedom and justice,
   essential matters of fundamental rights, democracy, and the rule of law.
   The current dogmatic criteria are addressed, the right to adequate
   judicial protection as a fundamental right is analyzed, and finally,
   European jurisprudence on the subject is discussed, especially the
   solution of Italian law, which is considered exemplary.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to determine future scenarios as an alternative for
   peace-building in Caquet \& aacute;, one of the regions most affected by
   the armed conflict in Colombia and facing enormous challenges in the
   post-conflict period. To this end, it presents a descriptive study with
   a mixed approach based on the phases of the prospective cross-impact
   matrix technique, involving a sample of regional development actors from
   the knowledge, power, productive, and community sectors. The results
   reveal that future events in the dimensions of institutional capacities,
   illicit crops issues, victims of the conflict, and the influence of
   higher education, constitute the most dynamic scenarios for
   peace-building in the region.},

Abstract = {As a response to a new highly structured crime in Spain, the offense of
   criminal organization was drawn from international instruments as a
   suitable criminal category to curb the new and complex organized
   criminal forms. Through a normative, jurisprudential, and scientific
   doctrine analysis of Spanish legislation, this article shows that the
   new penal figure of criminal organization is the most suitable,
   rigorous, and severe penal category for counteracting organized crime.
   Similarly, it evidences shortfalls regarding the crime of criminal
   association, with which it has similarities and some overlapping. The
   study shows that maintaining both figures is unnecessary, and
   suppressing specific aggravating factors will be necessary after the
   independent regulation of the crime of criminal organization.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates Colombia's strengths and weaknesses in facing
   current extra-regional and transnational threats based on a theoretical
   conception of the State power's constitutive variables. To this end,
   extra-regional and transnational threats are analyzed in the present and
   future scenarios. These show diffuse threats, with agile, convergent
   agents leveraging on tools of the globalized world to broaden their
   spectrum of action. Then, the general equation of State power is
   addressed from a smart power approach to establish the current balance
   of the Colombian State in the face of the challenges derived from these
   threats. Finally, weaknesses are identified in the geopolitical power,
   the military capacity to face hybrid warfare, and the lag of
   professionalism in its diplomatic capabilities.},

Abstract = {This article aims to identify the current issues affecting armed
   conflict participants and their prospects within modern medical law in
   pandemic and post-pandemic times. Theoretical foundations, supported by
   the dialectical method, were used to study and outline the current
   international humanitarian law and modern medical law problems
   challenging combatants. The formal legal and comparative methods abetted
   suggesting directions for the combatants' medical and human rights to
   rehabilitation in a context of global changes and social transformations
   in pandemic and post-pandemic times. Ultimately, combatants'
   interrelated challenges and prospects in these times involve financial,
   social, medical, and legal components requiring modernizing the
   rehabilitation system. Thus, an effective policy regarding participants
   in hostilities will ensure a common national policy that protects every
   member of society.},

Abstract = {This article aims to identify the security and defense threats in the
   context of the current criminal and terrorist multi-domain by reviewing
   the evolution of warfare from the beginning of the 20th century to the
   present, examining the emergence of new domains: the air domain and the
   space and cyberspace domains, in addition to the traditional land and
   maritime domains. Then, a documentary analysis identifies the new
   threats and defense and security decisions adopted by multilateral
   organizations in this regard. Finally, it evidences the acceleration of
   vital processes from the air domain, which has encouraged the mutation
   of ever greater threats converging in cyberspace today. The challenge is
   to anticipate, contain, deny, and deter new threats in a complex
   framework of transformations.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes transnational corporate or white-collar crime by
   examining the case of fraud involving prostheses of a French company
   used in breast implants in women, especially in Latin America. It
   succinctly describes the related case and judicial decisions, as well as
   the victims subjected to the fraudulent procedure's cultural context. It
   then presents a theoretical framework for this type of criminality and
   explores the conditions that promote impunity for the perpetrators of
   these crimes. The article demonstrates how, among other causes, the
   shortcomings of international law and the status of those who commit
   these crimes favor impunity and the victims' vulnerability. Finally, it
   offers some conclusions and proposals to address this problem.},

Abstract = {A BsTRACT . The current state of economic crime is characterized by
   stable growth, the structural diversity of new types of encroachments, a
   high latency level, and increased damage, making the topic under
   consideration relevant. This article studies the interaction of
   different states' legal systems in regulating international cooperation
   against transnational economic crimes and outlines the range of public
   relations arising from such activities under international public law.
   It employs a set of general scientific and special methods in the modern
   science of international public law to achieve the scientific
   objectivity of the results. Finally, it outlines the main trends in
   combating transnational economic crime at the international level.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the importance of legislative harmonization in
   government procurement in the Andean Community countries. To this end,
   the relationship between legislative harmonization and state contracts
   is identified. The main reasons that justify the proposals for
   legislative harmonization in this area are presented, and the obstacles
   faced by the consolidation of supranational normativity are analyzed,
   identifying the possible solutions to these obstacles. A qualitative and
   dogmatic research methodology was used, based on Colombian and Andean
   doctrine and laws, to explain the legal nature of the regulations on the
   subject. It is concluded that the Andean integration process, of which
   the proposed legislative harmonization is a part, is an ambitious and
   complex process, but with great benefits for its member countries.},

Abstract = {This article presents an evaluation to classify cybercrime indicator
   awareness in students of three universities in Peru. To this end, it
   applied a twenty-item Likert scale questionnaire using Google Forms to a
   total of 372 students. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to the
   data collected, resulting in four factors: 1) phishing awareness, 2)
   spamming awareness, 3) antivirus software effectiveness, and 4) web
   bullying. The cybercrime awareness scale showed adequate internal
   consistency, presenting .892 in Cronbach's alpha for the overall
   instrument and a range from .782 to .861 in the subscales' alphas, thus,
   making it possible to determine the validity and reliability of the
   proposed scale.},

Abstract = {A BsTRACT . The issue of cyber security has become a key State objective
   in Ukraine. Cyber espionage and cyber-attacks by intelligence agencies
   (predominantly non-democratic countries) have become the most
   significant modern threat to automated systems, surpassing ordinary
   crimes seeking profit. Besides effective protection and immediate
   responses to counter cyber threats, cyber incident investigations are an
   important element that must be conducted by authorized law enforcement
   agencies and intelligence agencies when necessary. This article
   considers key aspects and issues to suggest practical recommendations to
   prepare and appoint forensic expertise in cybercrime investigations.
   Furthermore, it addresses the objects under examination, their removal's
   particularities, and the questions to ask telecommunications and
   technical computer experts.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to understanding how hegemony manifests when a
   power, in pursuit of its security, resorts to different strategies to
   avert threats that erode the security of a peripheral ally. To this end,
   the global, state, and social logic involved in three alliances, at
   three different times, between the United States and Colombia are
   studied. Similarly, the dimensions of hegemony that are put to the test
   in these plans are analyzed using a comparative analysis based on a
   qualitative method favoring documentary sources. Finally, it is
   concluded that the U.S. political elites' decision-making process
   concerning their interventions has taken greater account of systemic
   constraints than the specificity of the contexts intervened.},

   operating in urban areas and its challenges to national security. To

   examines the history of urban warfare, its modern evolution, and its
   deepening in the present and near future. The Colombian case is then
   addressed, with the incursions of guerrillas and other criminal groups

Abstract = {a bstract . Military innovations have historically driven technological
   development and industry innovation. This research focuses on Industry
   4.0 technologies and their relationship with the development of military
   applications in the current context. A literature review and a
   bibliometric study using Bibliometrix evidence the relationship between
   the multidimensional difficulties in implementing technologies and the
   scarce research in these fields. Compared to more developed countries,
   there are wide technological gaps in Latin America, generating a strong
   technological dependence. Thus, it is concluded that research and
   innovation in Industry 4.0 and its military applications is a strategic
   opportunity for Latin America, as it can boost the region's
   technological, economic, and social development.},

Abstract = {Civil-military relations must go beyond civilian control based primarily
   on the risk of a coup d'\& eacute;tat. An important concept in this
   regard is military identity. However, literature explicitly discussing
   how military and civilian identities shape behaviors in civil-military
   relations is scarce. This article addresses the role of military
   identities in the structural challenges involved in these relations in
   Colombia, based on the case study of the 2014 presidential campaign, its
   main political, security, scandals, and public debates. It discusses how
   these identities are both an asset and a liability to strengthening
   civil-military relations and proposes a means of improvement through
   citizen identity.},

Abstract = {A BsTRACT . This research analyzes competency-based management (CNM) in
   Brazilian electoral justice courts' personnel management (PM). This
   qualitative study is based on the integrated multiple case study method
   using data collected from documents and interviews from six courts. It
   applies the thematic content analysis technique, resulting in five CBM
   and main PM-related practices in the courts studied. It contends that
   despite the norms and studies' efforts to make CBM plausible in public
   organizations, its assimilation has been slow and fragmented. Thus, it
   evidences the need to expand research and actions in CBM evaluation
   programs in Public Administration that provide theoretical and practical
   recommendations for the strategic improvement of PM in the Judiciary
   System.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the parameters and principles for using legitimate
   state force in urban scenarios in Colombia in the face of the current
   hybrid threat. First, qualitative research with an empirical approach is
   used to illustrate the nature of Colombia's hybrid threat and examine
   the doctrinal basis for the use of force by security forces in the
   Colombian conflict, then analyze the principles of international
   humanitarian law for hostilities in urban scenarios, observing criminal
   ecosystems. Finally, the principles of necessity and proportionality,
   among others, in other violent situations are developed, concluding that
   key principles exist; however, they are insufficient to guide the use of
   force in urban scenarios in Colombia.},

Abstract = {A BsTRACT . This article analyzes human rights and the environment as
   they relate to human security, starting from the evolution of the
   concept of security to the multidimensional perspective adopted
   internationally. Based on the dimensions of human security, especially
   the dimension of environmental security, it studies its interrelation
   with human rights. To this end, it analyzes the framework principles on
   human rights and the environment set forth by the United Nations in
   2018, which establish the states' main obligations in terms of human
   rights, related to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy, and
   sustainable environment. It concludes that these framework principles
   are key to harmonizing and highlighting the interrelationship of human
   rights and the environment.},

Abstract = {Based on a mixed methodology employing data envelopment analysis, this
   article evaluates the relative efficiency of 19 Colombian National Army
   research groups to create collaborative improvement plans that produce
   synergies and generate better future results based on the indicators and
   characteristics evaluated. The results show a wide margin for
   improvement for the groups evaluated. However, six of these groups have
   a relative efficiency of 100 \%, indicating a higher level of
   maturation. Thus, we propose a sponsorship program by these six groups
   for the group-sets resulting from an allocation model with clear
   purposes. This design would allow significant advances in the Army's
   research system results.},

Abstract = {Female relations in the business world are fundamental to reducing the
   gender gap in the sector. In this study, collaborative work networks
   were created during a mentoring program with businesswomen in Valparaiso
   (Chile), involving recognizing role models to understand the sisterhood
   they promote to benefit their professional and business growth. In this
   qualitative research, participants were interviewed, and a behavioral
   perception analysis was carried out on the concepts of empowerment,
   sorority, role models, and mentoring. It was found that these processes
   allow women entrepreneurs to share experiences and create scenarios of
   trust, solidarity, empathy, and empowerment. Creating networks and links
   helps narrow the gender gaps for women entrepreneurs in the region.},

Journal = {REVISTA CIENTIFICA GENERAL JOSE MARIA CORDOVA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {39},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {A BsTRACT . It has been traditionally established that the relationship
   between armed conflicts and development is inversely proportional; the
   greater the conflict's intensity, the lower the country's development.
   However, the Colombian case shows that this is not necessarily true.
   This article examines the National Rehabilitation Plan's precedent to
   understand how public policies developed in the context of the conflict
   have helped identify territorial characteristics that show a nexus
   between development and conflict in the areas most affected by violence.
   Thus, this precedent of differential development policies in Colombia is
   analyzed to understand their scope, territorial approach, and
   limitations, given the territory's specific economic, social, and
   geographic dynamics.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes popular empowerment and its Latin American
   understanding of the concept. Based on a casuistic and discursive
   analysis of Hugo Ch \& aacute;vez and Chavismo, it examines the
   epistemological and empirical errors in the use of this concept since
   the dawn of the Bolivarian or Chavista revolution to understand how the
   transition towards a model of participatory democracy and, therefore, of
   popular empowerment results in criminal governance. This result derives
   from the classist nature of Chavez's discourse, in which the bourgeois
   condition of middle and upper sectors of Venezuelan society is
   criminalized.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the concept of intelligence failure, its
   features, and its main causes from a psychosocial perspective. From this
   point of view, it argues that errors are inherent to all human activity
   and the nature of intelligence. Therefore, their occurrence is normal
   and inevitable in complex systems, such as intelligence services,
   agencies, and communities. However, it contends that, although they
   cannot be avoided, it is possible to minimize their occurrence as much
   as possible and mitigate the negative impact they could have. In this
   sense, some measures and actions that can contribute to this end are
   proposed.},

Abstract = {Currently, violence is a major issue worldwide; it manifests in
   different ways and finds in homicide an extreme form of expression that
   reflects major social problems. This article compares the proportion of
   homicide deaths and the homicide rate among South American countries
   over the last thirty years through a longitudinal descriptive
   comparative study based on the general linear model. It finds that
   Colombia, Brazil, and Venezuela have the highest homicide statistics for
   this period, concluding that the highest number of cases is found in
   countries where groups outside the law and issues of inequality and
   poverty exist.},

Abstract = {A BsTRACT . The redirection of military strategy towards
   counter-guerrilla warfare in the 1950s and the United States'
   positioning as the dominant power in the Western Hemisphere after World
   War II enriched the Colombian National Army's doctrine. This article
   examines the background that enabled implementing the military concept
   of air mobility -prevalent worldwide in those years- in the Colombian
   Army's military doctrine to complement the troops' ground maneuver
   performance. To this end, the article analyzes the 1962 Lazo Plan and
   the 1969 EJC 3-10 regulation to establish their conceptual advances,
   American influence, and the circumstances that prompted these new
   elements, such as Colombia's participation in the Korean War.},
