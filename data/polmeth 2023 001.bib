Title = {Breakdown by disengagement: Tunisia's transition from representative

Abstract = {On 25 July 2021, Tunisian president Kais Saied suspended parliament,
   lifted the immunity of its members, and dismissed the prime minister and
   the government. Tunisia's post-revolutionary democracy had thus
   succumbed to a populist president within two years from his electoral
   victory in the context of widespread popular disillusionment with the
   entire political class. This article draws on the work of Peter Mair, in
   particular his analysis in Ruling the Void (2013), to understand
   democratic breakdown in Tunisia. I argue that political dynamics in
   Tunisia diverge significantly from the standard model of democratic
   backsliding. Instead, I conceptualize the Tunisian case as breakdown by
   disengagement. The relative success of Tunisian democratization after
   the 2014 elite compromise paradoxically fuelled a crisis of
   representation: The main political camps lost popular support, populist
   challengers were strengthened, and citizens disengaged from conventional
   politics in ever greater numbers. Popular disengagement and elite
   withdrawal into a sphere of competition protected by the elite pact gave
   rise to a void at the heart of Tunisian democracy. While Kais Saied's
   anti-party project proposed to fill this void with an alternative
   political system built from the bottom up, there is growing evidence of
   authoritarian retrenchment instead of democratic renewal.},

Abstract = {State socialist Vietnam formally embraced market reforms in the
   mid-1980s, and since then advancing marketization under the undisrupted
   rule of the Communist party. As marketization deepens, the party state's
   legitimacy continues to rest on socialist practices of governance,
   structures of feeling and visions of a class-free society. This
   political-economic context gives rise to struggles between market and
   socialist logics over the social question in an economy that now powers
   global production with raw material and cheap labour, much of which is
   migrant labour. This article highlights these struggles through an
   analysis of the public debates around the regulation of overtime work
   during the revision of the 1994 Labour Code by Vietnam's National
   Assembly in 2019, which foresees limiting it to ensure workers'
   well-being. While parties to the debate position themselves as
   pro-business or pro-workers, they all evoke socialist narratives of
   nation-building, solidarity and care while emphasizing the market ethos
   of competitiveness and productivity. In arguing for removing the limit,
   the pro-business camp highlights the workers' responsibility to
   contribute to the competitiveness of the country and their employers by
   working overtime to make up for their low productivity. In contrast, the
   pro-worker camp pleads for limiting overtime work on the grounds of
   workers' poor health and difficult family lives, portraying their
   sufferings as deserving compassion. Despite these contrasting
   justifications, both arguments are characterized by the assumption of
   self-responsibility as the mainstay of well-being and failure to
   acknowledge the deeper societal problems posed by the commodification of
   labour.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article argues that rising economic inequality and the decline in
   political trust across Western countries have systematic normative
   implications for Western governments' pursuit of climate justice. The
   article argues that it is an essential but neglected task of nonideal
   political theory to identify political feasibility constraints on the
   pursuit of climate justice and reflect on how to overcome them. The
   article identifies two feasibility constraints in contemporary Western
   countries, the inequality constraint and the legitimation constraint, as
   important elements of a nonideal theory of climate justice. It argues
   that the French Gilets Jaunes (yellow vests) movement arose as a form of
   bottom-up motivational resistance to President Macron's decarbonization
   policies, precisely because those policies did not take sufficient heed
   of the inequality and legitimation constraints. Furthermore, the article
   sketches elements of a roadmap for a feasible pathway for Western
   governments to decarbonize and observe their citizens' duties of climate
   justice and argues that the framework of feasibility constraints offers
   a coherent, novel and urgent rationale for adopting redistributive
   measures such as the Carbon Fee and Dividend and
   participatory-democratic measures such as Citizen Assemblies as
   component parts of a feasible pathway to a decarbonized economy.},

Title = {Support for Gun Reform in the United States: The Interactive
   Relationship Between Partisanship and Trust in the Federal Government},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},

Abstract = {Studies find that trust in the government is statistically related to
   support for gun control laws in the United States. Another finding in
   the literature is that Democratic partisans support gun restrictions at
   a statistically higher percentage than do Republicans-with the reverse
   relationship existing for loosening gun laws. While a recent study did
   find an interactive relationship between trust in government and
   political ideology (Ryan et al. in Polit Behav 44(2):725-748,
   10.1007/s11109-020-09633-2, 2022), no study explores whether the impact
   of trust in government on support for gun reform is, in fact, a function
   of partisanship. In this study, we test whether there is an interactive
   relationship between trust in the government and partisan identification
   in predicting support for gun reform. Using the 2022 Cooperative
   Election Study (CES), we estimate logistic regression models that find
   an interactive effect between trust and partisanship. For Republicans,
   an increase in trust in government leads to a dramatic increase in
   support for gun control proposals, and a substantial decrease in support
   for gun rights expansion. For Democrats, trust in the government has
   almost no impact on support for gun reform. Further, we find that
   political ideology has only a small substantive relationship with
   attitudes on gun reform when interacted with both partisanship and trust
   in the federal government. The practical takeaway is that to increase
   support for gun control among Republicans, advocates must also recognize
   the role of governmental distrust in attitude formation among this
   partisan group.},

Title = {The broad-appeal strategy and policy representation},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 8},
Abstract = {Political parties frequently appeal broadly to different groups of
   voters with diverse preferences. However, the policy implications of
   this strategy are not yet understood. On the one hand, governments that
   appeal broadly may overextend their policy program and be unable to
   deliver on their promises. On the other hand, broad-appealing
   governments may focus on presenting different groups of voters with
   policy packages that are deliverable in order not to be punished by them
   in future elections. This article tests between these possibilities with
   data on social policy outputs, comparative manifesto data, and four
   different measures of government broad-appeals. The empirical analysis
   demonstrates that there is clear correspondence between what governments
   say they will do and what they actually do, regardless of how broadly
   they appeal. This suggests that the broad-appeal strategy does not
   undermine the democratic mandate theory's vision of how democracy should
   work.},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {The success of any constitutional convention can depend on its
   provisions for power sharing. We test three claims about the effects of
   the Great Compromise, a power sharing agreement, on the Constitutional
   Convention of 1787. First, we find that the convention was not more
   likely to pass proposals to strengthen the national government after the
   compromise than before, contrary to claims made by historians. Two small
   states increased their support, but other states did not. Second,
   Southern states (and large states) were more likely to support weakening
   the national government after the compromise. Third, large states were
   more likely to support proposals to strengthen the power of the House
   relative to the Senate after the compromise, and small states were more
   likely to resist. However, the opposite was not true for strengthening
   the Senate. Our results suggest a new narrative about the effects of
   Great Compromise on the Constitutional Convention.},

Title = {A hundred-years legacy of Turkish Democracy: the impact of democracy by
   rationalism in politics under Atatürk and Erdoğan},

Abstract = {The present study aims to trace the political theory of Michael
   Oakeshott, one of the leading critics of rationalism in politics in the
   20th century, both in the founding stage of the Modern Republic and in
   the policies of the AK Party Government, as its final stage. Political
   rationalism, which Oakeshott is skeptical of, is an understanding in
   which the traditional is destroyed and a new political order and society
   is created rather than repaired. Political rationalism, which has an
   understanding of abstraction, universality and perfectionism, especially
   turns into a politics of absolute faith and becomes a unity of
   enterprise in which law and freedom are suspended through the unity of
   powers. From this perspective, the rationalist policies of the Ataturk
   and Erdogan eras are analyzed. In particular, the transformation of the
   concept of unity of powers into the politics of faith, the existence of
   new political orders (Republic, Presidential Government System) and new
   social structures (Asim's generation instead of Kemalist generation)
   reveals the importance of rationalism in politics in order to understand
   the structure of politics in Turkey.
   Die vorliegende Studie zielt darauf ab, die politische Theorie von
   Michael Oakeshott, einem der fuhrenden Kritiker des Rationalismus in der
   Politik des 20. Jahrhunderts, sowohl in der Grundungsphase der Modernen
   Republik als auch in der Politik der AKP-Regierung als deren Endphase
   nachzuzeichnen. Der politische Rationalismus, dem Oakeshott skeptisch
   gegenubersteht, ist ein Verstandnis, in dem das Traditionelle zerstort
   und eine neue politische Ordnung und Gesellschaft geschaffen wird,
   anstatt es zu reparieren. Der politische Rationalismus, der ein
   Verstandnis von Abstraktion, Universalitat und Perfektionismus vertritt,
   verwandelt sich vor allem in eine Politik des absoluten Glaubens und
   wird zu einer Unternehmungseinheit, in der Recht und Freiheit durch die
   Einheit der Gewalten aufgehoben werden. Aus dieser Perspektive wird die
   rationalistische Politik der ara Ataturk und Erdogan analysiert.
   Insbesondere die Umwandlung des Konzepts der Einheit der Gewalten in
   eine Politik des Glaubens, die Existenz neuer politischer Ordnungen
   (Republik, Prasidialregierungssystem) und neuer sozialer Strukturen
   (Asims Generation anstelle der kemalistischen Generation) offenbart die
   Bedeutung des Rationalismus in der Politik, um die Struktur der Politik
   in der Turkei zu verstehen.},

Abstract = {This article identifies the conditions that made parliamentary
   oppositions in democratic countries more or less likely to participate
   in social protests against their government's COVID-19 policies from
   2020 to 2021. To that end, it compares 19 cases, testing the explanatory
   power of causal configurations consisting of four factors. The first is
   the parliamentary opposition's level of power in the policy-making
   process. The second concerns the political-electoral moment in which the
   protests take place. The third and fourth refer, respectively, to the
   representation or non-representation of populist and far-right forces
   amongst the parliamentary opposition. The finding is that the
   parliamentary opposition's involvement in social protests is due to
   different causal configurations. It occurred when some kind of
   non-far-right populism was represented in the parliamentary opposition,
   the parliamentary opposition had a low level of policy-making power and
   the protests could be exploited for electoral gain. Another explanation
   is the representation of populists who are also far right amongst the
   parliamentary ranks, even when the other conditions are not the most
   favourable in terms of the political moment and the level of
   institutional power of the opposition.},

Abstract = {China has reformed the way it nurtures a generation of citizens for the
   new era of the Xi administration. School curricula have been reformed
   and more teachers have been trained to deliver political - ideological
   education. While the central authorities play a crucial role in forging
   a vision of the `ideal' citizen from the top down, the enactment of
   centrally promulgated policies and curricula is complicated. This study
   explores a bottom-up view from the perspective of a group of university
   teachers, the institutional actors who socialise young people into
   `ideal' citizens on the ground. Four themes emerge in the informants'
   narratives: ideological commitment, abilities, developing a global
   outlook, and the influence of traditional culture. The paper concludes
   with a discussion of the interplay between socialist, traditional, and
   neoliberal rationalities in the making of Chinese citizens.},

Abstract = {How do crime and conflict compare in relation to victims' support for
   their political system? Latin American Politics scholarship has
   emphasized the distinct motivations of criminal and political violence.
   However, victims might not distinguish meaningfully between these types
   of insecurity. Scholars have used surveys extensively to understand
   crime victimization's consequences, but we know less about conflict
   victimization's relationship with political attitudes. Analyzing public
   opinion surveys from Colombia (2012-2018), we find that crime and
   conflict victimization share a minimal relationship with system support
   at the national level. In conflict zones, however, victimization from
   political violence corresponds negatively with system support. Decreased
   confidence in security forces may be the explanation. Our findings have
   three implications: scholars risk overemphasizing the crime-conflict
   distinction without micro-level insight; analyzing public opinion in
   areas beyond state control is necessary to build such knowledge; and,
   amidst acute insecurity, attention to victims has systemic importance.},

Abstract = {This article studies the relation between class and electoral
   participation. While the relation between political participation and
   many demographic variables such as caste, gender, age and location has
   been well researched in India, the same is not the case for the relation
   between class and electoral participation. Multiple measures of class
   (income, asset-wealth, occupation and education) are explored and
   conceptualized in this article, following which these measures of class
   are operationalized using the National Election Study datasets covering
   a twenty-three-year period (1996-2019). Each of these measures is used
   to trace the relation of class with two outcomes of electoral
   participation (turnout and party vote share) over time. Disaggregation
   by gender, locality and caste is provided. Finally, regression analysis
   to study the impact of these variables on turnout and vote share reveals
   the complexity of class. We find a complex picture of turnout and party
   choice with variation across different class measures. More
   significantly, variations in results raise questions about the
   usefulness of existing class indices. Further, we find that the type of
   measure being used affects different outcomes differently. For turnout,
   income and wealth seem to be better predictors, and for party vote
   share, subjective class is a better fit, whereas asset-wealth displays
   opposite patterns to income and subjective class in some instances.},

Abstract = {Impartiality has been a core principle of public service broadcasting
   (PSB) in the UK for 100 years. However, it is under growing pressure as
   audiences increasingly rely on more opinion led content on television
   and especially online. The hostility towards PSB has been fuelled by
   politicians and commercial media undermining the value of regulation in
   the twenty-first century. The UK regulator, Ofcom, has offered a
   flexible approach to oversight which the authors argue may have
   contributed to further confusion over what impartiality is, and its
   value in a competitive media environment. Greater independence,
   accountability and transparency-for both broadcasters and regulator-are
   suggested to be vital to maintaining the value of impartiality in PSB.},

Journal = {PARTY POLITICS},

Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {323-334},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The multidimensionality of the Israeli political system is expected
   given Israel's electoral system and cleavage structure. We introduce a
   new dataset and measurement of party positions in Israel and provide
   evidence that Israel's party system is comparable to other multiparty
   systems in Europe (CHES-EU) and Latin America (CHES-LA). We argue and
   provide evidence that the most important dimension in the Israeli party
   system, similar to other multiparty systems, is the general Left-Right
   continuum, which combines both economic and cultural policy issues. Yet,
   unlike other established democracies, parties' positions on the
   Left-Right continuum are closely related to their positions on policies
   related to the Arab-Israeli conflict. We also discuss Israeli-specific
   issues which structure the Israeli party competition. The contribution
   of this paper is two-fold. First, it allows scholars of party
   competition to include Israel as a comparative case in their research.
   Second, it is the first study that provides valid and reliable
   measurement of Israeli parties' positions across multiple issues.},

Abstract = {New parties are a key mechanism behind party system innovation as voters
   are offered new choices. To explain party entry (i.e. participation in a
   lower house election for the first time), the state-of-the-art has
   typically focused on domestic determinants. This, however, assumes that
   party entry takes place in an international vacuum. Building on the
   policy diffusion literature, we explore how party family members abroad
   influence party entry in the focal country. Based on a new dataset on
   the evolution of each party family in 17 Western European party systems
   between 1961 and 2016, including 2191 new parties, our mixed-methods
   approach combining spatial econometric models with pathway case analysis
   demonstrates that party entry is influenced by the entry and electoral
   success of their party family abroad. This has important implications
   for the literature on party entry and the international diffusion of
   policy platforms.},

Abstract = {The UK has a fragmented, partial and weak system of lobbying regulation.
   The system creates a self-reinforcing cycle of `exposure' and worsening
   public attitudes. In order to make the case for reform and indicate
   possible paths, this article reviews the system's faults and weaknesses
   and then analyses how the lack of political will for reform in
   Westminster has contributed to a transparency and integrity regime which
   falls below international standards. Finally, it examines how this cycle
   can be broken. While the UK lobbying law needs reform, we must look
   beyond the letter of regulation, taking into account the levels of use
   and political support, as well as the transparency and ethics ecosystem
   in which lobbying sits. Only by improvements to all of these areas can
   there be the possibility of stronger, more positive feedback loops,
   which can shift behaviour and, ultimately, attitudes.},

Abstract = {With each new report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
   the urgency to address climate change seems to increase. As the pressure
   to act rises, debates are intensifying regarding whether democracies can
   move toward sustainability fast enough. In this introduction to the
   special issue, we argue that current debates about the
   democracy-sustainability nexus revolve around the question of who should
   decide. Much of the recent debate can be structured along three
   opposites: experts versus laypersons, less versus more participation,
   and state versus market/private actor solutions. The first distinction
   asks whether climate change necessitates a shift of decision-making
   powers to scientists and experts rather than politicians or citizens. In
   the second debate, those who favor more participation in environmental
   policymaking face those who demand less. For example, whereas some
   promote new forms of deliberative forums, others doubt that these can be
   effective. Finally, there is a debate on whether markets and private
   actor networks might provide more efficient and effective ways to deal
   with the climate crisis than state regulation. While these perspectives
   are highly diverse and even contradictory, they are united in the belief
   that standard procedures of liberal democracy are insufficient to
   achieve sustainability.
   Mit jedem neuen Bericht des Weltklimarats wird deutlicher, dass der
   Handlungsbedarf angesichts des Klimawandels immer grosser wird. Mit
   wachsendem Druck intensiviert sich die Debatte, ob Demokratien in der
   Lage sein werden, den ubergang zur Nachhaltigkeit schnell genug zu
   bewaltigen. In dieser Einleitung des Special Issue argumentieren wir,
   dass sich die Debatten zur Verbindung von Demokratie und Nachhaltigkeit
   um die Frage drehen, wer entscheiden soll. Insbesondere drei
   Gegensatzpaare werden in den Debatten sichtbar: Expert{*}innen vs.
   Laien, weniger vs. mehr Partizipation sowie Marktlosungen/private
   Akteure vs. Regierungen und Regulierung. Die erste Debatte fragt, ob die
   Klimakrise es notwendig macht, Entscheidungsbefugnisse von der Politik
   und Burger{*}innen auf Fachleute zu ubertragen. In der zweiten Debatte
   stehen sich Befurworter{*}innen und Gegner{*}innen von mehr
   Partizipation durch Burger{*}innen gegenuber. Wahrend die einen sich fur
   neue Beteiligungsformate wie Burgerrate einsetzen, zweifeln die anderen
   an deren Effektivitat. Schliesslich gibt es eine dritte Debatte, in der
   gefragt wird, ob nicht Marktmechanismen und private Akteursnetzwerke
   besser als die Regulierung durch Regierungen in der Lage sind, den
   Klimawandel einzudammen. Obwohl die Positionen in diesen Debatten nicht
   nur sehr unterschiedlich, sondern auch widerspruchlich sind, eint sie
   die uberzeugung, dass die Standardverfahren liberaler Demokratie
   unzureichend sind, Nachhaltigkeit zu erreichen.},

Abstract = {A large body of literature investigates whether increasing the number of
   women in legislative office translates into policies that benefit women
   in society. This research builds upon theories about descriptive and
   substantive representation. However, these theories may not travel well
   to authoritarian contexts, where we see some of the largest gains in
   women legislators in recent years. This article unpacks the link between
   women's descriptive representation, healthcare spending, and health
   outcomes by regime type. Using a sample of 169 countries from 2000 to
   2018, we find that the percentage of women legislators is associated
   with increased healthcare spending across all regimes. However, women's
   health outcomes do not improve with women's descriptive representation
   in closed autocracies. Meanwhile, the results for democracies and
   electoral autocracies are similar, suggesting that even limited vertical
   accountability through semi-competitive elections may facilitate
   substantive representation of women.},

Abstract = {The European Parliament (EP) constitutes a prime site of contemporary
   party politics in Europe. Its seven political groups represent political
   interests and ideologies beyond specific national interests. Within the
   groups, national delegations exert considerable power. The research
   objective of this article is to generate new knowledge about the role of
   national delegations within political groups. The research material
   consists of 140 elite interviews with MEPs and staff. The data allow the
   article to analyse the construction of the role and the importance of
   national delegations and to focus not just on formal institutions, but
   also on informal ones which are often outside the reach of quantitative
   methods and data. The findings suggest that political groups can be
   divided into different categories. The role and influence of national
   delegations are strongly governed by informal institutions, in

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to review the idea of Machiavellianism, as
   presented by Claude Lefort, and to link it to the idea of populism. To
   do so, it takes up Lefort's definition of imaginary, defined as a
   collective representation that produces and masks modern social
   division, and argues that it can be assimilated to the distortion that
   populism provokes on liberal constitutional democracy. The text analyses
   Machiavellianism and populism as imaginaries that imply a mastery of
   one's conduct, that call into question the principle of the ordering of
   community life, and that produce and mask the division of the social.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to systematize two methods of the contemporary
   theoretical scene: narration and speculation. To do so, the article
   begins by exposing the difficulties of narration in contemporary
   sensibility from texts by Amitav Ghosh, Mark Bould and Gabriel Giorgi.
   From this starting point, the first section sets out a definition of
   method as narrative from Anna Tsing's theoretical perspective. The
   second section presents a definition of method as speculation from
   Quentin Meillassoux ` s theoretical perspective. The contrast between
   both methodological proposals allows us to understand some current
   challenges of conceptual work.},

Abstract = {The author starts from Aristophanes' Lysistrata as a paradigmatic
   anti-war text of women's politics of resistance, but reconsiders its
   reading as a feminist critique of war as well as a critique of Athenian
   imperialism. First, the author points out that women's politics of
   resistance through sex-strike and occupation of public space is not
   necessarily connected with anti-war beliefs, but stems from the
   protection of the ``women's world{''} of private relations and the
   household. Second, the ``women's peace{''} that satirizes the Athenian
   leadership has an anti-democratic connotation, namely it is not a
   criticism of Athenian imperialism, but its defense. Finally, in analogy
   with Lysistrata, Russian women's activism is questioned as a reaction to
   Russia's aggressive wars in Chechnya and Ukraine. This activism
   primarily starts from motherhood as a legitimate form of articulating
   the problem of war, but does not question the war itself. The author
   concludes that such women's activism, which stems from the rationality
   of care for the well-being of children and husbands, whether in
   Lysistrata or the one that mostly manifests itself in Russian mothers
   and women, is not politically or value-based, does not articulate
   coherent anti-militaristic or pacifist attitudes, and therefore is not
   truly anti-war. In the context of Russia, by demanding better conditions
   for men in the army, maternal-women's activism is actually a strategy
   for optimizing the war, not significantly opposing or even supporting
   Russia's state-proclaimed war goals.},

Title = {Attitudes and perceptions regarding algorithmic judicial judgement:
   barriers to innovation in the judicial system?},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},

Abstract = {This study aims to be a starting point in the process of studying
   attitudes and perceptions around the use of algorithmic tools in the
   judicial system and explores possible barriers to innovation. The
   results reveal significant differences in acceptance between the general
   population, experts in data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI)
   and legal professionals, with notable variations in the acceptance of
   algorithmic tools for judicial analysis. In addition, participants with
   a legal background showed a negative correlation with acceptance,
   indicating a more cautious stance towards the integration of such tools
   in the criminal justice domain. This suggests a cautious and reserved
   attitude among legal professionals towards the integration of
   algorithmic tools in the justice system, potentially rooted in concerns
   regarding objectivity, fairness and the preservation of legal principles
   in judicial processes. Furthermore, the study reveals that the
   acceptance of algorithmic tools is influenced by the complexity of the
   tasks involved in the automation of the criminal justice system. This
   underlines the importance of considering the level of automation and the
   degree of human intervention in the use of these tools. In short, this
   study highlights the importance of having the choice of society and more
   specifically of legal operators to encourage the adoption and effective
   implementation of algorithmic tools in the judicial sphere.},

Abstract = {The article problematizes gender stereotyping in election campaigns as a
   discourse practice in media coverage, but also the discourse strategies
   used by candidates during elections where they are negotiating between
   gender identity and party positions that they are in. The method used in
   the research is discourse analysis carried out on five Croatian news
   portals that mention party candidates during the campaigns for the local
   mayoral elections in 2021. This research introduces and explains three
   levels of analysis: political campaigns as a social practice, media
   coverage of elections as a form of discourse practice, and the articles
   themselves. The research has shown that female politicians were placed
   in gender-stereotyped frameworks where their political role was reduced
   to trivialization and an exception in the political arena. The
   candidates themselves accept these stereotypes so they could survive in
   the system and represent themselves as caretakers, women devoted to the
   party, and experts.},

Abstract = {The evaluation of relative changes in policy agenda composition using
   dynamic compositional models can offer a useful way to lead future
   studies of policy agenda trade-offs for sustainability. As a specific
   empirical case, this study examines changes in the annual composition of
   legislative attention in the United States congressional hearings on
   energy as a substantive issue domain. Using the description texts of
   hearings, this article assesses the compositional energy topic changes
   of conventional agendas, other general agendas, and unconventional
   agendas, including environmental and social agendas. By focusing on how
   economic contextual shocks, along with political factors, shape the
   energy agenda attention mix, this study discovers that conventional
   agendas related to energy topics in U.S. congressional hearings are
   relatively less likely to be discussed when economic conditions are
   adverse under Democratic legislature controls. It illustrates example
   conditions under which policy agenda subtopics for sustainability are
   more likely to be pursued at the expense of which subtopics.},

Abstract = {The limitations and possibilities of the state in solving societal
   problems are perennial issues in the political and policy sciences and
   increasingly so in studies of environmental politics. With the aim of
   better understanding the role of the state in addressing environmental
   degradation through policy making, this article investigates the nexus
   between the environmental policy outputs and the environmental
   performance. Drawing on three theoretical perspectives on the state and
   market nexus in the environmental dilemma, we identify five distinct
   pathways. We then examine the extent to which these pathways are
   manifested in the real world. Our empirical investigation covers up to
   37 countries for the period 1970-2010. While we see no global pattern of
   linkages between policy outputs and performance, our exploratory
   analysis finds evidence of policy effects, which suggest that the state
   can, under certain circumstances, improve the environment through policy
   making.},

Abstract = {Political parties around the world have made widely publicized efforts
   to improve women's representation in elected office. While many have
   investigated these efforts by focusing on gender dynamics during
   candidate recruitment and selection, party support for women after they
   are nominated remains somewhat under-analysed. We begin addressing this
   gap by asking if central party bodies provide women candidates with
   additional financial support during general election campaigns. Our
   study leverages population data capturing intraparty financial transfers
   within three major parties during the 2008 and 2011 Canadian federal
   elections (n=1845). The results demonstrate that parties, regardless of
   ideology, can and do support women candidates with additional campaign
   funds. However, support from the centre is not always consistent across
   time or competitive contexts. We conclude that if political parties are
   sincere in wanting to reduce representational inequities, then
   consistently providing women candidates with additional financial
   support is another way of doing so.},

Abstract = {What is the impact of democracy/authoritarianism regime change on
   de/centralization in federations? Based on the annual coding of three
   politico-institutional aspects, 22 policy fields, and five fiscal
   categories, this article maps de/centralization in Argentina, Brazil,
   Mexico, Nigeria and Pakistan from the establishment of their respective
   federal orders to 2020. It shows that de/centralization varies greatly
   across its different dimensions as well as between systems, with
   centralization being the dominant long-term trend but with significant
   exceptions, notably Pakistan. Regime change plays a major role in
   de/centralization but not always in line with the usual expectation that
   authoritarian regimes centralize and democratic ones decentralize. Other
   factors that cut across the authoritarianism/democracy divide, notably
   ideological orientations, have substantial impacts on de/centralization.
   By investigating long-run patterns of de/centralization in federations
   that have experienced democracy/authoritarianism regime change, the
   article sheds light on how federalism operates beyond consolidated
   democracies.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The German Federal Election 2021 has the potential to mark a crossroads
   in German olitics. Not only the context, e.g., Angela Merkel's exit from
   politics, but also the election results leading to the formation of the
   first ``traffic light{''} coalition have been remarkable. The
   contributions to this Special Issue analyse the election from various
   angles, focusing on peculiarities as well as general trends of electoral
   behaviour and competition. Thereby, they not only help to understand the
   election and its results better but also address pressing questions of
   electoral research, such as the role of personalization or the
   transformation of cleavage politics. This introduction describes the
   context as well as the main results of the election and provides a brief
   overview of the articles, systematizing their findings.},

Abstract = {Existing studies of policy diffusion rely on quantitative or qualitative
   methods depending on the number of cases and the policy at hand. Studies
   of diffusion in Canada, for instance, almost exclusively use qualitative
   techniques due to the limited number of subnational units. In this
   article, we explore whether machine learning techniques can complement
   qualitative approaches in these contexts. In 2015, the Canadian federal
   government decided to impose the legalization of cannabis and gave the
   provinces and territories a short time frame to develop and implement
   legislation. Previous qualitative research on this case found that
   within-province policy development was more salient than interprovincial
   diffusion. Using a plagiarism detection software, we find limited
   evidence of exact matches between provincial legislation, but a cosine
   score approach reveals significant similarities across provinces. These
   results suggest that computational and qualitative techniques together
   should be used where possible to identify and analyze policy diffusion
   in certain contexts.},

Abstract = {Avia Pasternak argues that intentional citizens who are genuine
   participants of their state should share the liability for state
   wrongdoings. In real-world states, how prevalent is intentional
   citizenship? This commentary concerns the application of the theoretical
   model. I argue that there are two problems with Pasternak's proposal of
   testing intentional citizenship in reality. First, the difficulty of
   distinguishing citizens' ambiguous internal attitudes towards their
   citizenship is underestimated. Second, the objective aspect of citizens'
   status in society, namely, the way they are treated by their state, is
   more important than their subjective attitudes, but this aspect is
   neglected by Pasternak.},

Abstract = {High political trust is often interpreted as a sign of good democratic
   health, and widespread distrust as a sign of democratic ill health.
   However, there is little knowledge about the basis on which people make
   assessments about whether to trust or distrust political actors. This
   article develops and applies a typology for political trust judgement.
   Through a content analysis of 1,105 open-ended survey questions about
   political trust and distrust, the study finds that people tend to assess
   (dis)trust of politicians based on whether they see the politicians as
   predictable, intrinsically committed, competent and responsive.
   Moreover, the study finds that citizens use different judgement bases to
   describe trust and distrust, suggesting that the two concepts are not
   pure negations of each other. While predictability is the most
   frequently reported basis for trusting politicians, a lack of intrinsic
   commitment is the most frequently reported basis for distrusting
   politicians. This article discusses the reasons for and implications of
   the apparently different bases for weighing judgements on trust and
   distrust.},

Abstract = {The term ``deep state{''} has enjoyed political prominence in recent
   years, especially in movements around former President Donald Trump.
   However, the term emerged in the activist milieu after the founding of
   Students for a Democratic Society, which sought to engender political
   realignment in the aftermath of the Kennedy assassination. Those on the
   far right who use the term to level accusations of conspiracy at
   supposed subversives in the administrative state are unwittingly drawing
   on a long-running but little-analyzed intellectual tradition. In that
   tradition, conspiracy theories purport to unmask the real intentions of
   political actors in order to facilitate cooperation and recruitment
   across ideological and partisan divides. From the postwar period to the
   present, conspiracy theories, and the ``deep state{''} vocabulary in
   particular, circulated freely across the left-right political divide.
   Authors and activists were attracted to these tropes and texts not
   merely because they appeared to reveal concrete truths about long-hidden
   elements of American political life, but also because their very
   ambiguity enabled them to be flexibly co-opted. Conspiracy theories
   allowed activists to mobilize around shared gaps in public knowledge
   about traumatic events like the assassination, activating public
   dissatisfaction with official explanations of those events. Their
   ambiguity, coupled with the seeming pervasiveness of conspiracy theorist
   tropes across political divides, appeared to activists seeking
   realignment of both the left and the right as a promising tactical
   opportunity to assert that they and their erstwhile enemies were
   actually engaged in a shared project. Activists thus came to see
   conspiracy theory not as the province of an exclusively left or right
   politics, but as an autonomous and contestable cultural space. This, in
   turn, led to cross-partisan encounters.},

Abstract = {This essay's exploration of the adjective ``vulgar{''} and its function
   in the Marxian field begins with a debate between Abba Lerner (1903-82)
   and Maurice Dobb (1900-76), which foregrounded the vulgar in Marxism as
   a problem of economic method. The signifier thus functions as a portal
   to associated questions: the status of the adjective ``vulgar{''} in
   Marx and Engels's discourse; value theory's role in the constitution of
   division and difference in the economics discipline; analytical
   Marxism's place as a response to the crisis of Marxism in the twentieth
   century; the politics of market socialism or the role of markets (if
   any) in socialism; the necessity of mediation under any form of division
   of labor and the implications for Marx's notion of associated
   production; and the possibility and promise of an affirmative take on
   the vulgar in the context of a postcapitalist pragmatics of
   participatory and democratic planning.},

Abstract = {In mixed-member electoral systems, there is an interaction between the
   single-seat district arena and the proportional representation arena.
   The literature suggests that this interaction (or contamination) raises
   the number of parties in the single-seat district arena above what
   Duverger's Law and the M+1 rule suggest. However, the literature is
   exclusively quantitative and has enough limitations to doubt if what is
   observed is actually contamination, and if contamination is actually
   responsible for the increase in the number of parties. This contribution
   aims to reinforce the literature with evidence from a series of
   interviews with party strategists and coordinators in Mexico. The
   results indicate that, even with other factors at play, contamination
   exists as believed: parties' behaviour in the single-seat district arena
   is based on what they project in the proportional representation arena.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the political thought of Francisco Ayala from his
   return from exile in 1976 until the year 1996, when his production in
   this field drastically decreased. During these two decades, the
   Granada-born author continued to address and delve into the issues that
   had been part of his theoretical corpus since his youth: concern for
   nationalisms, the decline of ideologies, the role of intellectuals, and
   so on. In addition to these recurring themes, during the political
   Transition period, he also addressed other issues relevant to the time,
   ranging from political change to the meaning of dictatorship and the
   future of Spain. To convey these complex and extensive concerns, he
   primarily relied on newspaper articles rather than essays, in order to
   reach a wider audience in an accessible manner.},

   conditions do supposedly weaker conflict actors `outpower' stronger
   actors? This article argues that, throughout human history, those most
   willing to engage in and sustain extreme conflict have not been rational
   actors but `devoted actors' driven by faith in defending or advancing
   their non-negotiable `sacred values', whether religious or secular.
   Bringing into dialogue insights from large group psychology,
   neuroscience, and epigenetics with political science, this article
   demonstrates how two factors can help explain apparently non-rational
   elements of human functioning during armed conflict: first, the
   biological substrate helps elucidate why and how rational actor models
   seem to underestimate the influence of `right and wrong' in people's
   behaviour; second, the complex psychology of large groups often drives
   people to engage in action that may not be in their own individual
   interests.},

Title = {A republican fiscal constitution for the EMU},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 22},
Abstract = {The democratic management of macroeconomic externalities between Members
   of the Economic and Monetary Union requires abandoning the legal
   entrenchment of fiscal rules as well as their technocratic
   administration. The fiscal constitution of the EMU can instead become an
   instrument that guarantees European citizens' and peoples' reciprocal
   non-domination. This republican goal can be attained once a core set of
   fiscal principles are agreed upon and later interpreted in a political
   way by the Council and the European Commission. To be non-dominating the
   interpretations of these executive bodies on the management of
   macroeconomic externalities must be subject to a `dual contestatory
   system'. Citizens should not only control, through their national
   parliaments, what their own governments decide, but also what a
   collective of governments decide at the EU level. This requires stepping
   up of the contestatory powers of the European Parliament. Finally, this
   kind of democratic control should be epistemically supported and
   facilitated by a network of national Independent Fiscal Institutions who
   should allow citizens and parliaments to monitor what executives decide
   both at the national and at the EU level.},

Abstract = {Congressional oversight is a potentially potent tool to affect policy
   making and implementation by executive agencies. However, oversight of
   any agency is dispersed among several committees across the House and
   Senate. How does this decentralization affect the strategic incentives
   for oversight by each committee? And how do the strategic incentives of
   oversight committees align with the collective interest of Congress as a
   whole? We develop a formal, spatial model of decentralized oversight to
   investigate these questions. The model shows that when committees have
   similar interests in affecting agency policy, committees attempt to free
   ride on each other, and oversight levels are inefficiently low. But if
   committees have competing interests in affecting agency policy, they
   engage in ``dueling oversight{''} with little overall effect, and
   oversight levels are inefficiently high. Overall, we contend that
   committee oversight incentives do not generally align with the
   collective interests of Congress, and the problem cannot be easily
   solved by structural changes within a single chamber.},

   question often suffer from a fundamental identification problem in which
   proximity effects may reflect actual behavioral diffusion between
   members or, instead, homophily, in which legislators of a similar
   political feather flock together. We overcome this observational
   equivalence by exploiting a unique random seating lottery for seating
   assignments in the world's oldest existing parliament, Iceland's
   national legislature, Al thorn ingi. Utilizing this naturally occurring
   randomization, we employ spatial analyses of more than 20,000 estimates
   of spatial dependence and find little evidence that seating proximity
   leads to similar voting behavior by members in this legislative context.},

Abstract = {This article offers an underexplored resistance strategy to gender
   norms, based on a feminist and queer reading of the work of French
   thinker Roland Barthes. Building on Barthes's peculiar conception of
   what he calls ``the Neutral{''} and revisiting his work in light of
   feminist and queer scholarship on sexual (in)difference, my main goal is
   to reshape our understanding of what it means to be gender neutral. In
   opposition to classical conceptions of neutrality associated with
   passivity, indifference, and blandness, I show that Barthes's Neutral
   can be conceived as an active gesture, which alters common systems of
   meanings and power, including the gender binary. But this conception of
   the Neutral, I argue, neither refers to a call for an androgynous,
   queer, or nonbinary gender experience. It does not target gender
   embodiments but gender regulations-that is, the social enforcement of
   gender categories (by way, for instance, of administrative forms,
   single-sex bathrooms, or normalizing attitudes toward others). A
   gender-neutral arrangement, therefore, refers to an ethical,
   administrative, social, or spatial relation in which subjects are not
   assigned based on gender categories. This practice of gender suspension,
   I show, has two main transformative effects. First, it opens a space of
   freedom and livability for gender-nonconforming subjects. Second, it
   contributes to lessening the significance of sexual difference in social
   life and therefore alleviating its symbolic and normative weight for
   everyone.},

Abstract = {The glorification of terrorist offenses and the dissemination of radical
   content in digital services pose a serious problem, which requires not
   only technical but also legal measures. It is therefore not surprising
   that legislatures, also in response to public expectations, are
   increasingly eager to implement new laws aimed at the removal of
   terrorist content. The result, however, is also a number of
   controversies concerning the proportionality of the measures taken -
   especially insofar as concerns the ``flip-side{''} aspects of respect
   for freedom of speech and the creation of preventive censorship
   mechanisms. An example of such a measure, introduced by EU Regulation
   2021/784, is the 1-hour data removal order. These orders, issued by
   national authorities, make it possible to oblige a digital service
   provider to delete online content almost immediately. The lack of prior
   judicial review and the short time to comply with the order are features
   that, on the one hand, ensure high effectiveness in removing illegal
   content, but on the other hand increase the risk of abuse of power. The
   aim of this paper is to discuss the doubts concerning the compliance of
   1-hour removal orders with the EU model of fundamental rights
   protection. Against this background, conclusions will also be drawn from
   the analysis of similar German and French provisions. As a result, it
   will be possible to identify areas for improvement in the current
   legislation, which seems necessary to be taken into account in order for
   the EU's actions to support public security objectives without creating
   the risk of a significant breach of fundamental rights.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of the European parliament (EP) in
   providing ideational alternatives to austerity in the context of the
   Eurozone crisis and the COVID-19 crisis. Despite the EP's limited formal
   role in EU economic governance, it is a key site for democratic debate
   and contestation. Analyzing EP debates about austerity allows us to
   understand the possibilities and limitations for ideational change at
   the EU level from the perspective of supranational party politics.
   Through a longitudinal analysis (2012-2021) of EP resolutions on the
   European Commission's Annual Growth Surveys, the article asks how
   ideational battles around austerity have unfolded between the EP's
   political groups and what factors have shaped the EP's positions.
   Theoretically, the article draws on the literature on ideational
   political economy and discoursive institutionalism. The article argues
   that instead of providing alternatives, the EP and its Committee on
   Economic and Monetary Affairs have contributed to the ideational hold of
   austerity due to the weakness of the alternatives of the center-left and
   their compatibility with austerity. Party-political and institutional
   factors, such as broad left/right compromises and a strict division of
   labor between the EP's committees, further constrain ideational change.},

Abstract = {Scholars largely view populism as a democratic game and study it through
   the lens of civilian mass politics, thereby, dismissing the role of the
   military elite. Nevertheless, populist mobilization may introduce new
   dynamics into the political landscape of countries that have a long
   history of politically active militaries. This article scrutinizes the
   degree and type of civilian control of the military in populist
   settings. It primarily contends that incumbent populists tend to limit
   the veto power of the military. However, civilianization in populist
   regimes does not occur through a consistent reform agenda geared towards
   democratic governance of the security sector. Populists instead seek to
   gain personal control of the military through individual, communal, or
   ideological ties to civilian leadership. The personal model does not aim
   to hinder the military's political influence. On the contrary, it
   politicizes the army and seeks to use it under civilian authority
   towards shared goals. However, populism operates on shaky ground due to
   the institutional decay it causes.},

Abstract = {Economic Evaluations, Prime Ministerial Approval and Governing Party
   Support: Rival Models Reconsidered by Harold D. Clarke and Marianne
   Stewart (1995) makes major contributions both substantive and
   methodologi-cal. Substantively, the article contributes to literatures
   on economic voting and the presidentialization of British politics.
   Methodologically, the paper is a model of how to conduct cointegration
   and error correction analyses between closely related political time
   series. In all, the authors established a long-run equilibrium between
   prime ministerial approval and vote intentions for the governing party.
   The two variables may diverge for short periods, but vote intentions
   will always revert back to a level that is in line with the popularity
   of the PM. We extend Clarke and Stewart's data to the present day and
   examine how the PM-vote intention link has endured while the effects of
   the economy on vote intentions have varied. We also show that, while
   time series analysis in political science has undergone several
   revolutions, Clarke and Stewart's process of conducting two-step
   cointegration analysis (Engle and Granger, 1987) stands up 30 years
   later as a blueprint for how to investigate long-run relationships with
   political data.},

Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},

Abstract = {We argue that a reinvention of the plebeian tribunate should play a key
   role in addressing the challenges stemming from increasing
   concentrations of, and inequalities in, social, political, economic, and
   cultural power in liberal democracies. Addressing these challenges,
   which negatively affect parliamentary representation, requires a form of
   institutional innovation that gives voice to non-elites who are ruled
   but do not rule. We propose revisions of the composition and tasks of
   the tribunate that are tailored to these current challenges. Our fully
   randomly selected tribunate emerges as a vehicle not only for contesting
   concentrated power but also for articulating lines of conflict,
   disruptive agenda-setting, and political experimentation. Our proposal
   contributes to developing realist democratic theory. We argue that the
   reinvented tribunate not only meets realist commitments to avoiding
   moralization and idealization but also demonstrates the underexploited
   capacity of realism to inform institutional innovation and thus
   contribute to substantial political analysis.},

Title = {Understanding the disability voting gap in the UK{*}},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {85},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Using nationally representative longitudinal data from Understanding
   Society we explore the relationship between disability and political
   participation in the UK. More specifically, we examine the determinants
   of the `disability voting gap', and assess how it varies by the
   severity, type and chronicity of disability. After accounting for
   demographic characteristics, the disability voting gap across UK General
   Elections between 2010 and 2019 is found to be 6.2 percentage points.
   More than half of this gap is explained by the channels of resources and
   recruitment, with evidence of a residual disability gap consistent with
   additional disability-specific barriers to participation. We find a
   larger disability voting gap for those with more severe disability,
   disabilities relating to mental health and chronic disabilities.
   Applying panel data methods, however, we find no evidence that
   transitions in disability status are related to changes in voter
   turnout.},

Abstract = {Traditional leaders can influence electoral outcomes. We designed an
   experiment to investigate why public endorsements by chiefs affect
   voters-and which types of voters they influence. Chiefs have incentives
   to prefer politicians who will promote local development, and can use
   endorsements to sway elections accordingly. We argue that voters often
   interpret chiefs' endorsements as a signal of candidate quality. To
   assess this argument, we exposed voters to real endorsements made by
   chiefs during Ghana's 2020 presidential election. We show that
   endorsements impact the vote choice of undecided voters. Consistent with
   a signaling mechanism, respondents exposed to chiefs' rationale for
   endorsing a candidate were no more likely to vote for the endorsed
   candidate than those who only heard chiefs' approval of a candidate.
   Further, treated respondents hold higher evaluations of the endorsed
   candidate on multiple dimensions of candidate quality. Our results
   suggest that chiefs influence voters through a non-coercive mechanism,
   which has positive implications for accountability.},

Abstract = {How does historical victimization and its memorialization impact
   present-day outgroup attitudes in conflict-riven societies? This study
   explores this question using a survey experiment with a representative
   sample of 2000 Jewish Israelis-half of whom are direct descendants of
   Holocaust survivors-and a content analysis of 98 state-approved school
   textbooks, examining how histories of victimization become socialized
   and shape political attitudes. We find that, in Israel, family
   victimization during the Holocaust plays surprisingly little role in
   shaping present-day attitudes toward outgroups. Rather, perceived
   historical victimization of the Jewish and Israeli people is broadly
   socialized among the Israeli public and is a stronger predictor of
   outgroup (in)tolerance. These findings shed light on the power of
   societal victimhood narratives-even in the absence of personal family
   histories of victimization-to shape political attitudes in conflict
   contexts, with long-term implications for intergroup cooperation and
   conflict.},

Abstract = {Citizens in multiple crime-ridden countries strongly support the
   militarization of security-that is, placing the military in charge of
   traditional policing duties. Yet, we know little about the determinants
   of such support. Do people approve of militarization even in the face of
   human fatalities? We explore this question in the context of Mexico's
   ``war on drugs.{''} In three experimental studies, we manipulate the
   presence of human costs in a military operation against a drug lord and
   present arguments either justifying or condemning these costs. We
   consistently find that, even in successful operations, support for
   militarization decreases when military operations cause civilian
   casualties, but not when the victims are members of drug cartels. This
   finding holds for both respondents who have been victims of
   cartel-related violence and those who have not. Arguments that justify
   these costs as helping to achieve the end goal of eradicating organized
   crime increase support. These findings shed light on the public opinion
   side of the militarization of security debate, and have important
   implications for security policy reform and democratic politics.},

Abstract = {The C OwD-19 pandemic has created an impetus for action for governments
   and citizens, but these actions can be challenging to understand. As a
   riposte, we use The Populist Divide as a framework for understanding the
   patchwork of populist responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our approach
   brings nuance to how crises are framed dependent on the trust levels
   between actors, thus presenting populist relationships as determined by
   selective trust allocation and not necessarily one of fixed ideological
   paradigms. Additionally, we introduce activities as the response to a
   measure, whether accepting or even protesting, but ultimately consenting
   to the legitimate powers of the leaders imposing these measures. On the
   other hand, counterstrategies emerging as challenges to the legitimacy
   of the leaders themselves.},

Abstract = {Policies focusing on strategic energy resources play a key role in
   achieving certain goals of states by integrating them with other areas.
   Considering the opportunities and threats associated with energy
   resources, the energy problem may be perceived as a chronic ailment that
   is difficult to solve for some states. It is also a fact that these
   resources increase the dependence of states. Energy is seen as a factor
   that forms the basis of interdependence in Turkish-Russian relations.
   With the increase in Turkiye's energy needs, its energy relations with
   Russia have gained great importance in the 21st century. Russia, with
   its rich energy resources, plays an important role in Turkiye's energy
   supply, and Turkiye is an important market for Russia's energy exports.
   This study analyses the energy relations between Turkiye and Russia
   within the framework of interdependence theory. Despite the tensions in
   the political arena, energy relations have been and continue to be
   conducted according to the principle of interdependence. The study
   introduces the interdependence theory and analyses the energy policies
   and energy situation of Turkiye and Russia in detail.},

Abstract = {Ideology is an important though not dominant factor driving the US
   foreign policy. Amid intensifying great-power rivalry, Washington in
   recent years has increasingly stepped up its ideological offensive
   against Beijing. Latest US efforts in this regard include exporting core
   values associated with the American Dream, e.g., individual freedoms,
   liberal ideals, and democratic institutions. The three consecutive
   administrations of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump had
   all incorporated ideological components into their policy toward Beijing
   despite their differences of policy priority vis-a-vis China. Long
   vigilant about the West's ideological offensive, Beijing had been
   pushing back against Washington's efforts by promoting a rival
   narrative, the Chinese Dream. Even though Beijing has roundly rejected
   Washington's framing of US-China relations in years to come as democracy
   versus autocracy rivalry and tried hard to insulate China's relations
   with the rest of the world from rising geopolitical tensions with the
   United States, the great and growing ideological rift between the two
   major powers and their divergent perspectives on and approaches to the
   big issues of the day may herald an era in which an increasing number of
   global challenges as well as bilateral disputes and crises defy easy and
   quick solutions.},

Abstract = {This article clarifies the intellectual origins of Canadian
   parliamentary government by situating Confederation within a specific
   strand of liberal political thought. My argument is that the Fathers of
   Confederation adhered to the political theory of parliamentarianism.
   Though liberal constitutionalists, the Fathers of Confederation
   expressly defended a parliamentary political framework that they
   considered superior to the American system of checks and balances-one
   characterized by a powerful elected assembly restrained by an unelected
   upper house, responsible ministers serving in Parliament, and a
   constitutional monarch. In elucidating the theory of parliamentarianism
   that underlies the political project of Confederation, my goal is not
   only to examine a problem in nineteenth-century Canadian political
   thought but to ground our current political situation within a larger
   historical perspective.
   Resume Cet article vise a eclaircir les origines intellectuelles du
   gouvernement parlementaire canadien en situant la Confederation dans un
   courant specifique de la pensee politique liberale. Mon argument est que
   les Peres de la Confederation ont adhere a la theorie politique du
   parlementarisme. Constitutionnalistes liberaux, les Peres de la
   Confederation ont expressement defendu un cadre politique parlementaire
   qu'ils consideraient superieur au systeme americain de freins et de
   contrepoids. Ce cadre se caracterise par une assemblee elue puissante
   limitee par une chambre haute non elue, des ministres responsables
   siegeant au parlement et un monarque constitutionnel. En elucidant la
   theorie du parlementarisme qui sous-tend le projet politique de la
   Confederation, mon objectif n'est pas seulement d'examiner un probleme
   de la pensee politique canadienne du XIXe siecle, mais aussi d'inscrire
   notre situation politique actuelle dans une perspective historique plus
   large.},

Abstract = {How do democratization processes affect voter turnout in new
   democracies? Existing work points to an expected boost in electoral
   turnout after democratization as newly democratic citizens are euphoric
   to exert newly democratic freedoms or because they developed new
   political attitudes and behaviours by mobilizing for democracy. While
   intuitive and normatively appealing, these explanations have not been
   theoretically nor empirically scrutinized within the literature. This
   paper develops and tests novel theoretical expectations on the processes
   and legacies of democratization that impact voter turnout in new
   democracies. Using electoral turnout data from 1086 national elections
   between 1946 and 2015, and turnout survey data of over 1 million
   respondents between 1982 and 2015, we find that the boost in voter
   turnout (1) exists only for the first election after transition, (2) its
   effect depends on the life cycle during which individuals experienced
   the transition and (3) it is less dependent on transition type.},

Abstract = {Political leaders around the world increasingly rely on personalist
   parties to win elections and govern. While existing scholarship assumes
   that personalist parties do not build territorial organization, in fact
   they vary substantially in terms of organizational strength. In this
   paper, we move beyond existing structural explanations of party-building
   and focus on the role of party elites' preferences to explain the source
   of this variation. Through a mixed-method approach combining
   process-tracing of the case studies of Venezuela's MVR/PSUV and
   Ecuador's Alianza PAIS and statistical analysis of Latin American
   parties, we find that party elites' past political experiences shape
   whether personalist parties successfully invest in party organization.
   Party officials who were socialized in radical-left parties are more
   likely to advocate for party-building and their presence within party
   cadres is associated with stronger party organization.},

Abstract = {We add new insights to the party theory of parliamentary debate proposed
   in Proksch and Slapin's The Politics of Parliamentary Debate by
   combining a quantitative replication analysis of floor speeches with a
   qualitative explanation of the endogenous transformation of two
   institutions mediating elections and parliamentary speech in the
   Japanese Diet. Although the House of Representatives in Japan used a
   single non-transferable vote system with particularly strong personal
   vote-seeking incentives, our analysis based on a new dataset shows that,
   contrary to the theory's predictions, the pattern of speech activities
   among party leaders and backbenchers is close to that of Germany, which
   has a party-centered proportional representation system. Such seemingly
   contradictory results, however, can be consistently understood within
   the scope of the theory if we consider the patterns of endogenous change
   in the parliamentary system and party organization. These results
   highlight the potential for further development of the theory.},

Title = {Judicial resistance during electoral disputes: Evidence from Kenya},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {85},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Over the last decade, African courts have played an important role in
   the conduct of free and fair elections. In Kenya, the Supreme Court
   nullified the presidential election of the incumbent. These rulings
   challenge the conventional wisdom that courts in hybrid regimes always
   support power holders despite blatant evidence of electoral fraud.
   Furthermore, these sparks of judicial resistance deserve our scholarly
   attention as they have the power to start the democratization process or
   limit further autocratization. Hence, this paper seeks to understand the
   conditions under which courts are able to resist incumbents' pressure to
   legitimize electoral malpractice and side with the opposition. I argue
   that institutional reforms incentivize courts to resist the incumbent's
   pressure and to rule in favor of the opposition during electoral
   disputes under two conditions. First, institutional reforms must
   reinforce de jure independence by enacting effective legal and
   constitutional mechanisms that prevent the executive branch from
   undermining the separation of power. Second, institutional reforms must
   mobilize judicial support networks by granting them the tools to engage
   in strategic and repeated litigation. I test this novel theory by
   leveraging original qualitative and quantitative data from Kenya. Using
   process tracing, I show how the 2010 constitution created an environment
   where the courts had no other choice than to annul the election of the
   incumbent - President Kenyatta - in 2017.},

Abstract = {In this article, we assess the effects of and responses to the Covid-19
   pandemic in the Brazilian peripheries by relying on resilience theory
   and the experiences of peripheral actors during the first year of the
   pandemic. We consider these experiences to examine whether the initial
   responses to the crisis had the potential to bring about long-term
   positive change. We rely on thematic analysis of 80 interviews with
   leaders of grassroots organizations of different nature all over the
   country between October 2020 and January 2021. We argue that we cannot
   speak of resilience and system change unless we engage with the voices
   of those most affected by adversity. While in its first year the
   pandemic brought important traces of structural violence to the surface,
   providing an opportunity for structural change, peripheral views at that
   moment cast doubts about the extent to which those changes could lead to
   long-term structural changes.},

Abstract = {On 14 August 2013, Egyptian security forces killed hundreds of
   supporters and sympathizers of the Muslim Brotherhood in two squares of
   Egypt's capital Cairo: Rab'a al-'Adawiyya and al-Nahda. Those killed had
   protested against the military coup that ousted President Mohamed Morsi.
   The state's propaganda machine and the media connected to Egypt's
   influential business people designated those killed as terrorists. Human
   rights organizations paint a grim picture of the decade of authoritarian
   rule. In the regime's rhetoric, the fight against terrorism justifies
   the continued crackdown on Egyptian civil society movements and
   opposition. Again this year, the anniversary of the Rab'a al-'Adawiyya
   and al-Nahda massacres is likely to receive little coverage in the
   country's mainstream media. While the voices of those opposing the
   military coup in 2013 in Egypt are long silenced, on the massacre's
   tenth anniversary, it is time to recall an alternative to the narrative
   of the Egyptian state. Participants of a women's Quran reading group in
   one of Cairo's impoverished neighborhoods questioned the military coup
   in 2013 and anticipated what was to come.},

   beliefs? Evangelical support for bigoted and xenophobic policies is not
   a new phenomenon. Yet, despite the abundant scholarship on religiosity
   and race, we know little about the mechanisms through which scholars
   posit we are observing these negative outcomes. Namely, does religiosity
   affect support for bigoted and xenophobic attitudes? Alternatively, are
   demographics and belief systems more important predictors of bigoted and
   xenophobic attitudes? This paper is not an assessment of if religion
   affects politics or if politics affects religion. My contributions to
   the literature on race and politics include finding that religiosity has
   significant direct and indirect effects on attitudes toward racial
   minorities. I find that 10\% of the negative effect on attitudes toward
   African Americans and 30\% of the negative effect on attitudes toward
   Hispanics, immigrants, and the undocumented is an indirect effect of
   religiosity mediated through demographics and belief systems.},

Abstract = {Hans Kelsen was one of the most important legal thinkers of the 20th
   century, and he is known for mounting an elaborate defense of liberal
   party democracy at a time when the latter was hardly the most popular
   form of regime. This article examines how Kelsen responded to two major
   political movements he experienced in his intellectual prime: political
   Catholicism, which he was confronted with in interwar Austria, and
   Christian Democracy, which became a hegemonic political force in Western
   Europe after World War II, when Kelsen was already in exile. The article
   reconstructs Kelsen's complex critique of these two religious movements
   and ends by reflecting on what we can learn from his arguments about
   current attempts to revive Christian political thought.},

Abstract = {The object of study was the study of the theory and practiceof the
   influence caused by the criminal subculture on criminalityin the
   penitentiary environment. In the main content of theresearch, two
   directions are highlighted: first, the influence ofcriminal subculture
   among convicts in places of detention ofthe State Criminal Executive
   Service of Ukraine and; the second directionof influence, this caused by
   criminal subculture among convicts whoare registered with parole of the
   State Institution \& DLANGBRAC;Parole Center \& drangbrac;.
   Themethodological basis of the research was presented as
   comparative-legaland systematic analysis, formal-legal method, method of
   interpretation,hermeneutic method, as well as methods of analysis and
   synthesis. Amongthe contributions of the research, the definition of the
   influence that thecriminal subculture exerts on delinquency in the

Abstract = {This article addresses the textual subjectivities referring to the
   Chilean dictatorship in the work La Ciudad by Gonzalo Millan. The
   research questions are as follows: How are subjectivities represented in
   the work? How do they reconfigure violent events as memories of
   catastrophes? The proposed hypothesis is that the subjectivities are
   represented from the textual subject as a citizen who personally and
   collectively reconfigures the spatial and temporal breaks implied by the
   catastrophe of dictatorship and exile through the narrative of memory.
   The subjectivities are represented from the lyrical speaker, who gives
   space through his word to other subjectivities with which the
   catastrophe of the dictatorship and exile coexist. Other citizens,
   co-inhabitants of the city, are as oppressed as those who exercise
   power. Thanks to the narrative, all these subjectivities manage to build
   a textual city that is constituted as a memory space from which the
   catastrophe is faced. Additionally, a link with the past and the lost
   homeland, product of exile by dictatorship, is maintained. The objective
   is to analyze the work from the research questions and,
   methodologically, a semiotic study is carried out from cultural,
   literary, memory and recent history studies. The hypothesis is
   corroborated, identifying the present, individual and collective,
   aggressor and attacked subjectivities. The work also sustains that the
   subjectivities inhabit a textual city that, as a symbolic space of
   memory, allows to reconfigure the ruptures produced by the catastrophe.},

Year = {2023},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To what extent can democratic leaders mitigate the costs of reneging on
   alliance agreements? Previous research suggests that democratic leaders
   suffer from domestic backlash if they decide to renege on alliance
   treaties. However, less is known about whether and to what extent
   leaders can mitigate the domestic costs of reneging on alliance
   commitments. We study strategies leaders use to mitigate these costs.
   Specifically, we experimentally investigate whether and how much the
   costs of reneging are affected by different sidestepping strategies and
   the costs of fulfilling an alliance commitment. Results show that the
   potential costs of fulfilling commitments can dilute the domestic
   backlash for reneging on alliances, but various sidestepping strategies
   that work in the standard audience-cost context of reneging on a public
   threat do not work for reneging on a formal alliance. These findings
   expand our understanding of the reliability of democratic alliances and
   show that reneging costs are contingent on the context.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 22},
Abstract = {Recent political theory has seen a wave of interest in the topic of
   compromise. Its conceptualizations tend to be unstable, however,
   resulting in varying and shifting appreciations of compromise, not least
   in debates between political realists and liberal moralists. This
   article presents a new and integrated theoretical framework of
   compromise to facilitate theoretical and empirical enquiry. In this
   framework, every compromise has two underlying dimensions (inter-actor
   and intra-actor), four necessary and sufficient elements (conflict,
   consensus, concessions, and consent), and four corresponding conceptual
   boundaries (stalemate, synthesis, surrender, and shift-of-position). The
   framework is used to show how compromise can clarify and mitigate the
   Rawlsian contrast between modus vivendi and overlapping consensus and
   thus between realism and moralism. Ultimately, the framework not only
   serves to transcend established distinctions in the theoretical
   literature, but also to develop counterintuitive hypotheses for
   empirical research and stimulate the phenomenological enquiry of
   political compromise making.},

Title = {Under Threat We Unite: How Shared Marginalization Shapes Cohesion and
   Political Cooperation Among Asian Americans},

Abstract = {Political scientists have shown increased research interests in Asian
   Americans' political behavior. Nevertheless, considerable skepticism
   remains over more fundamental questions about Asians, such as the
   capacity for pan-Asian cooperation and political solidarity in the US.
   To advance research in this area, the current study examines how a
   diverse, ``pan-ethnic{''} Asian group can function as a cohesive
   collective using evidence from a behavioral game, an innovation in this
   area of research. I show that an inclusive common ingroup can be forged
   and cohesion attained when shared threats of exclusion that cut across
   subgroup distinctions are made salient. I demonstrate this using
   original experimental data that allow me to examine behavioral measures
   of group cohesion, as well as policy support for different subgroups.
   Results show the existence of co-ethnic bias among Asians in the US
   towards those who share their ethnic background. They also show the
   power of salient shared exclusionary discrimination to overcome this
   bias by increasing ingroup cohesion in a one-shot economic game and
   enhancing support for policies that benefit Asians as a group. Taken
   together, this study highlights unique conditions of group-based threats
   under which Asians in the US achieve political cooperation-particularly
   across South and East Asian lines-due to substantial heterogeneity
   within the group category.},

   Indonesia's constabulary forces and tensions in the North Natuna Seas},

Abstract = {The use of maritime constabulary forces and coast guards as diplomatic
   instruments in disputed waters has been a growing occurrence in the
   Indo-Pacific region. The challenges presented to Indonesia amid the rise
   of foreign vessel intrusions pose great obstacles to Jokowi's decisive
   and non-negotiable stance on Indonesia's sovereignty in the North Natuna
   Seas. Challenged by Vietnam and China due to overlapping EEZ and
   continental shelf zones, the North Natuna Seas continues to be filled
   with the presence of maritime paramilitary agencies, foreign fishing
   fleets, and other sea intrusions to Indonesia's maritime boundaries.
   This article argues that as an attempt to respond to contemporary
   challenges in the Natuna Seas, Jokowi has empowered Indonesian coast
   guards as a paragunboat diplomatic strategy to respond to coercion at
   sea. By evaluating the development and mandates given to the Indonesian
   Maritime Security Agency since 2014, this article further justifies
   Indonesia's turn to paragunboat diplomacy due to the need for a
   non-confrontational and non-coercive maritime diplomacy strategy, and as
   a posturing strategy to compel adversaries away from Indonesian waters
   due to the promising tactical flexibility of using non-military maritime
   constabulary forces.},

Abstract = {The focus of this paper is on how much the participants in right-wing
   populist protests differ in anomia and locus of control from the general
   population, and to what extent anomic feelings and subjective locus of
   control exert an impact on ``law-and-order{''} attitudes and attitudes
   towards foreigners on ethnocentrism and ``law-and-order{''} attitudes.
   The empirical basis consists of surveys of participants in the PEGIDA
   protest in Dresden (2015/2016) and the general population in Dresden and
   Dusseldorf (2014). Whereas the PEGIDA respondents were found to differ
   from the general population in anomic feelings, they did not differ
   regarding subjective locus of control. Among the PEGIDA respondents and
   the general population, anomie and internal locus of control promote
   ethnocentrism and law-and-order attitudes.},

Title = {Governing Europe's Recovery and Resilience Facility: Between Discipline
   and Discretion},
Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 14},
Abstract = {The EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) represents a bold
   integrationist step in European economic governance. Besides the size of
   the fiscal envelope, the novelty also lies in the new governance. Member
   states prepare integrated investment and reform plans and need to fulfil
   milestones and targets to access funding. This article assesses the
   balance of power in negotiating the plans and the effect on domestic
   policymaking. Based on five case studies, we show that the RRF has
   enhanced the steering capacity of the European Commission on reforms and
   investments, while member states remain ultimately in charge of the
   plans. Second, we argue that, while the RRF enhances the efficiency of
   the policymaking process and allows the fast-forwarding of reforms, it
   has also led to a contractualization of the relationship with the EU and
   a centralization of decision-making processes within member states. This
   latter aspect may hamper ownership and legitimacy in policy
   implementation.},

Abstract = {We reexamine the concept of individualism and its political
   implications. While both political scientists and social psychologists
   agree that individualism is a core value for many Americans, political
   science has primarily associated the concept with views about economic
   mobility. Building upon insights from political theory, we argue that a
   narrow focus on economics overlooks key elements of individualism and
   its relation to political life. With the help of five distinct datasets
   collected between 2018 and 2022 (combined N = 12,169), we develop a new
   index that emphasizes autonomy from authority, which we label moral
   individualism. We show how it and other dimensions of individualism
   explain interactions with the political world, including responses to
   the COVID-19 pandemic. Across multiple indicators, moral individualists
   were far less likely to engage in collective action or pursue other
   behaviors meant to assist the community. For example, even after
   controlling for the effects of ideology and partisanship, moral
   individualism reduced the probability of wearing a mask during the first
   year of the pandemic by approximately 30 percentage points.},

Abstract = {China-Africa cooperation in recent years has been marked by two distinct
   trends, localization and internationalization, which have allowed a
   variety of actors and stakeholders to be part of Africa's development
   story. But even as African development takes on more nongovernmental and
   multilateral characteristics, inadequate social participation and lack
   of coordination between major donor countries still pose significant
   challenges that must be addressed before localization and
   internationalization can help further boost aid effectiveness on the
   continent. The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) as the premium
   platform for China-Africa cooperation holds great promise for advancing
   Africa's economic, social, and human development, on the one hand, and
   forging closer multilateral coordination, on the other. In addition, a
   more complex geopolitical landscape has also underscored the forum's
   strategic and practical value for top Chinese policymakers and their
   African counterparts, as both seek more predictable and productive
   relations to meet an increasing number of common challenges and are
   making new efforts to build a more open and inclusive FOCAC in order to
   advance the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and fulfill Beijing's
   commitment to multilateralism and international cooperation.},

Abstract = {The Roberts Court has been called the most ``\_\_\_{''} Court in
   history, with many different adjectives being offered. Surprisingly, our
   study of voting data from Supreme Court terms 1937-2021 shows that the
   Roberts Court is the most ``anti-president{''} Court in that period: It
   has ruled against the president at a greater rate than any other Court.
   Should we take this to mean that the Court will be there to protect
   democracy if an overreaching president tries to trample constitutional
   limits? Not necessarily. Additional analysis and a deep dive into the
   cases and reasoning reveal a more complicated picture, of a Court
   exhibiting historic levels of partisan and loyalty bias as well as a
   strong penchant for judicial supremacy.},

Title = {`The Wind of Change': a rhetorical political analysis of Harold
   Macmillan's 1960 `decolonization' speech},
Journal = {BRITISH POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the literature on Conservative Party
   politics through an exploration of the political rhetoric of former
   Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader, Harold Macmillan in
   relation to decolonization and the end of empire. Macmillan's Wind of
   Change speech has been analysed in the existing literature as purely a
   historical moment in relation to imperial decline. This article contends
   that Macmillan's arguments for and defence of decolonisation in fact
   remain relevant for modern understandings of contemporary Conservative
   Party politics because residual affections for imperialism remain within
   some conservative audiences, as well as the ongoing processes of
   decolonisation. He sought to address such sentiments at the time of
   delivery, yet they remain today amongst similar audiences who remain
   committed to imperial notions. As such, simply considering the speech as
   a historic moment is inadequate given its value as an enduring argument
   relevant to contemporary conservative debates. Because of the language
   and justification used, I re-evaluate the speech through the process of
   `Rhetorical Political Analysis' (ethos, pathos, logos). By doing so, I
   will demonstrate how Macmillan's historical speech remains relevant as a
   living argument for scholars and practitioners of Conservative Party
   politics, which is a perspective presently absent in the scholarship.
   This methodological approach is also augmented by an analysis of
   archival materials helping to shed light on the embeddedness of the
   speech within the broader context of the tumultuous South African
   politics of the time, and by doing so show why a speech delivered in the
   1960s remains relevant to UK domestic policy, foreign policy, and
   conservative studies in the 2020s.},

Abstract = {What shapes attitudes about Native American policy issues and inherent
   rights? Race and ethnicity are important in shaping US public opinion,
   but Native Americans have been almost entirely excluded from this
   research. We use data from an original survey and focus groups collected
   from the Reclaiming Native Truth project to examine the factors that
   shape attitudes toward Native American inherent rights and broader race
   conscious policy issues. We find high levels of support overall, but
   several factors influence lower levels of support. Many people have very
   low factual knowledge about Native American issues and rely heavily on
   partisan shortcuts in forming opinions, especially for policy issues.
   Overall, attitudes about inherent rights are less consistent as many
   people have very little knowledge about them. People of color tend to be
   more supportive than white people and white people tend to rely more on
   partisan shortcuts. Specifically, conservative whites are the least
   supportive across most issues. We also explore the effect of Native
   American resentment, finding there are people who hold overtly hostile
   views of Native Americans and are unsupportive of their rights and
   policies. Our findings contribute to growing literature on Indigenous
   resentment, settler colonialism and public attitudes toward Indigenous
   peoples.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the research findings of the survey and a review of the
   scientific and professional literature, this paper seeks to indicate a
   correlation between vaccine hesitancy and national security. On the one
   hand, the paper argues that health is of particular concern to the
   modern sovereign state and its security, and that the vaccine as a
   civilizational achievement is one of the most vital mechanisms for
   safeguarding public health and, by extension, national secu-rity. On the
   other hand, the paper contends that vaccine hesitancy should also be
   considered a threat to national security. What vaccine hesitancy means
   and what factors contribute to it is something of a blind spot in
   Serbia's public and academic discourse. The survey findings have shown
   that vaccine hesitancy is influenced by various factors and conclude
   that Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy in Serbia can be considered a threat to
   national security.},

Abstract = {Although research has questioned the stability of identities, we know
   little about identity change. I examine a political event as a driver of
   identity change, namely the Brexit vote. I contend that the act of
   voting, choosing between two options, boosts the European and British
   identity underlying the vote choice. I test whether the increased
   identification with Europe or Britain comes with a reduction in the
   other identity. Using British Election Study panel data in a two-way
   fixed-effects design, I show that voting to remain increases
   identification with Europe but voting to leave does not increase British
   identification for Leavers. However, voting has no impact on how
   Remainers identify with Britain or Leavers identify with Europe. The
   results contribute to the growing literature on the link between
   politics and identities.},

Abstract = {Iversen and Soskice's notion that electoral rules affect democracies'
   propensity for income redistribution is one of the political economy's
   most discussed concepts. Yet, it comes with a number of caveats. Most
   importantly, it is not clear whether electoral rules indeed affect
   states' propensity for redistribution or vice versa and thus whether or
   not Iversen and Soskice's findings are spurious. In this article, we
   focus on the critical case of New Zealand's electoral reform of the
   1990s and offer a comprehensive test of Iversen and Soskice's concept.
   We employ the recently developed Bayesian alternative to the synthetic
   control method and compare the relevant dynamics for New Zealand to
   those of six majoritarian democracies. Our results largely supports
   Iversen and Soskice's claims; due to the lower prevalence of right
   (center-right) governments, proportional representation democracies tend
   to redistribute more than majoritarian ones.},

Abstract = {The openness of the political system for the representation of social or
   economic groups through their parties is mired in complexities. Extant
   scholarship has identified multiple electoral system hurdles that
   jointly determine the institutional opportunities for group
   representation: This article offers a simple metric to the institutional
   parts of the political opportunity structure for the electoral
   representation of social groups. A single variable summarizes the
   institutional opportunities for group representation, as determined
   jointly by electoral rules, the demographic structure of ethnic minority
   groups and their electoral geography. This new Index of Electability
   considers recent innovations in electoral rules, such as mixed electoral
   systems, legal thresholds or quotas, which occur in most contemporary
   democracies. Empirically, the index is applied to ethnic minority
   parties in 57 plural democracies worldwide. It shows that our index
   highlights the necessary conditions for parliamentary representation of
   minorities through their own parties. Contrary to widespread belief that
   many minority groups form ethnic parties, only one out of three ethnic
   minority groups worldwide which could, in principle, do so, actually
   form such a party.},

Abstract = {Districted proportional systems give an edge to right-wing parties that
   are more popular in rural areas where district magnitude is small and
   large parties are mechanically advantaged. In this paper, we explore the
   role played by voters in this bias by looking at how ideology correlates
   with strategic voting. We analyze survey data from 44 elections in
   Western Europe and find that left-wing voters are more likely to support
   a party that is not viable (p < 0.01), but once in this position they
   seem less likely to desert this party for one that is viable (p < 0.1).
   Further, we find that this pattern is likely driven by the intensity of
   partisan preferences as left-wing voters are on average more attached to
   their favorite party and thus more reluctant to desert it (p < 0.01).
   Our study thus demonstrates that the psychological effect of districted
   proportional systems amplifies the mechanical one in advanced industrial
   democracies.},

Abstract = {Little research has focused on how legislative candidates' personal
   electoral support develops over time and why. This study examines the
   vote trajectories of individual candidates and how they vary according
   to candidates' personal vote-earning attributes. Longitudinal data on
   over 1700 candidates who between 1999 and 2019 participated in two or
   more parliamentary elections in the Finnish open-list proportional
   representation system are analysed. The findings show that the average
   legislative candidate's personal support increases more rapidly in the
   beginning of his or her electoral career and then slows down gradually
   over time. However, there is large heterogeneity in vote trajectories
   depending on candidates' socio-demographic characteristics and personal
   vote-earning attributes. Some candidates enjoy instant success (local
   councillors and celebrity candidates), others do not win more votes
   initially but manage to build loyal personal followings in their
   district and receive positive returns from repeated candidacy (young,
   women, and locally rooted candidates).},

Abstract = {Recent studies take increasingly refined views of how socioeconomic
   conditions influence political behaviour. We add to this literature by
   exploring how voters' prospective evaluations of long-term economic and
   social opportunities relate to electoral contestation versus the
   stabilization of the political-economic system underpinning the
   knowledge society. Using survey data from eight West European countries,
   we show that positive prospects are associated with higher support for
   mainstream parties (incumbents and opposition) and lower support for
   radical parties on all levels of material well-being. Our results
   support the idea that `aspirational voters' with positive evaluations of
   opportunities (for themselves or their children) represent an important
   stabilizing force in advanced democratic capitalism. However, we also
   highlight the importance of radical party support among `apprehensive
   voters', who are economically secure but perceive a lack of long-term
   opportunities. To assess the implications of these findings, we discuss
   the relative importance of these groups across different countries.},

Number = {1},

Abstract = {We examine the existence and strength of organizational ties between
   parties and interest groups by innovating on classic resource exchange
   theory. First, we propose that the nature of interest groups' policy
   orientation and their general organizational capacity primarily explain
   the presence of ties, that is, ties are less likely to materialize when
   groups lack ideological policy goals and have limited organizational
   capacity. Second, the size and types of resources on offer from both
   sides are what principally account for the strength of existing ties. We
   hypothesize that resources from both parties and interest groups are
   positively associated with institutionalized relationships, but also
   that resources are hierarchically ordered, that is, resources that are
   exclusive for the transaction are particularly important for ties at
   higher levels of institutionalization. Using data from a novel
   organizational survey of parties and interest groups in seven Western
   democracies, we find support for the hypotheses using an integrated
   design of analysis.},

Abstract = {The Supreme Court, some commentators argue, is at its most undemocratic
   since the Lochner Era in the 1930s. They point to the Supreme Court's
   majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which
   departs from public opinion on abortion and longstanding constitutional
   precedence. Dobbs, however, is not an outlier. The Supreme Court made a
   similar move in Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta. The majority opinion
   questioned almost 200 years of constitutional interpretation and several
   decades of congressional policy to enable state governments to exercise
   criminal authority over non-Indians in Indian Country. This article
   compares the majority opinion in Castro-Huerta to congressional policy
   to explore the democratic and constitutional difficulties that can arise
   when the Supreme Court refuses to defer to Congress-the democratically
   elected and constitutionally appointed institution for making federal
   Indian policy. It reveals how the Court's undemocratic turn extends
   beyond cases involving individual rights.},

Title = {Mixed evidence for a relationship of cognitive fatigue to political
   engagement},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {83},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Daily cognitive fatigue is widespread, yet we are still learning about
   its influence on political behavior. Existing research suggests fatigue
   will reduce consumption of politics at the margin. Moreover, when
   fatigued individuals do engage with political material, they should be
   more likely to choose content and decision rules that require minimal
   effort. We find mixed empirical evidence for these claims. In
   observational data, we find a negative relationship between fatigue and
   engagement, on average, but the coefficients are typically small and
   statistically insignificant and we find substantial variation across
   different measures of fatigue. In three experiments, we find mixed
   evidence that manipulated fatigue reduces the demand for political
   content over sports and other non-political entertainment. In a fourth
   experiment, we find no evidence that manipulated fatigue shapes
   heuristic versus systematic processing. We discuss the limitations of
   our study, its relationship to existing work, and av-enues for future
   research.},

   federal district court judges. Focusing on search and seizure cases, we
   analyze nearly 1500 motions to suppress evidence from 2000 to 2022. In
   addition to controlling for judicial ideology and a judge's prior
   experience as a prosecutor or public defender, we utilize matching to
   address endogeneity concerns related to one's ability to self-select
   into one of these positions-which may itself be influenced by that
   individual's ideological predispositions. We find that having been a
   former prosecutor, as well as the length of time that service spans,
   makes a judge significantly more likely to rule against a motion to
   suppress. Former public defenders are significantly more likely to grant
   that suppression motion, though their propensity to do so is not
   affected by the length of time served in that capacity.},

Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},

Month = {2023 MAY 3},
Abstract = {The paper aims at giving an overview of the debate on nuclear energy in
   France during the last Presidential campaign (spring 2022) while
   offering a methodological contribution. It does so by employing
   Discourse Network Analysis to show which policy actors partake in the
   debate and how they are related at the discursive level. Statements have
   been collected from both Twitter and the newspapers about the role of
   nuclear energy in France's energy mix, which has been a key element in
   the energy debate. Methodologically, a comparison of the discourse-actor
   networks emerging from the two methods of collection-Twitter and the
   newspapers-is provided. The results reveal the existence of two
   well-defined coalitions of pro- and anti-nuclear actors; few
   convergences between the two coalitions and minor differences between
   the two media concerning the actors in the pro-and anti-nuclear
   coalitions and the discourses. However, the network based on Twitter is
   more discursively rich and more populated by lower-ranking politicians
   compared to the network based on newspapers.},

Abstract = {We examine how institutional selection procedures affect the ideology of
   state supreme court chief justices. We argue that institutional
   selection methods empower those charged with choosing chief justices to
   select court leaders who reflect their own preferences, and we test this
   theory using data from all 50 American states from 1970 to 2017. Our
   results show that states that use popular elections to select chief
   justices tend to produce court leaders whose preferences reflect the
   electorate, and states that use commission-assisted elite appointment
   tend to produce chief justices whose preferences mirror those of
   political elites. While we find that peer election systems produce
   leaders with preferences similar to median court preferences, court
   preferences are also associated with other methods of chief justice
   selection.},

Abstract = {The aim of this work is to recover some central aspects of Richard
   Rorty's political philosophy, such as his anti-foundationalism and his
   proposal to strengthen ethnocentric conversational communities in order
   to consolidate democracy, and to contrast it with Plato's conception of
   politics, which is also ethnocentric, but it tends towards aristocratic
   forms of government. If the first one thinks about the strengthening of
   opinion (doxa) and its contingent justification with the purpose of
   expanding to democratic audiences, the second one understands politics
   as an area of knowledge (episteme) and the essential truth, therefore,
   as a space reserved for the wise. While in Rorty's work it is considered
   that trust and dialogue between equals is the main objective of
   democratic politics, we understand that in Plato's work there is an
   exchange between unequals that conducts to lies and to the deception of
   the people by the rulers.. For this reason, we will begin with a
   hermeneutical exegesis of some central aspects of the political thought
   of the Athenian philosopher, which will be opposed to a conceptual
   reconstruction of the political thought of the American philosopher.
   Finally, in the last section we will explain the most outstanding
   differences, as well as the similarities that exist between both
   thinkers.},

Abstract = {The decades between 1948 and 1980 are often remembered as a time of mass
   immigration, yet almost 2 million more people left Britain than arrived
   in those years. Mass emigration has been an enduring part of Britain's
   modern history and this article explores its effects on British
   politics. The two world wars, the turn to tariffs, joining the EEC and
   leaving the EU: at these critical junctures, Britain's overseas diaspora
   was mobilised to reshape domestic politics and to transform the UK's
   global political economy. Charting the rise, fall and afterlife of
   Britain's `emigration state' can contribute to our understanding of
   these events and help researchers analyse the effects of racism and
   empire on modern British politics.},

Abstract = {It has been widely acknowledged that Japan is a full and equal member of
   the international legal order as it stands, asserting its postwar
   identity as a responsible and law-abiding member of the international
   community. However, this essay argues that Japan's external compliance
   with a rules-based order and international legal norms is not reflected
   in corresponding domestic practices. The article provides a social
   constructivist grounded in-depth analysis of the various interests and
   constraints that have shaped Japan's domestic response to international
   legal norms. The selected five comparative case
   studies-Non-proliferation Treaty obligations, whaling policies, the
   detention and deportation of asylum seekers, the dumping of radioactive
   waters into the high seas off Fukushima and sovereignty claims over the
   Senkaku/Diaoyu islands-suggest that pragmatic nationalism and cultural
   norms undermine Japan's commitment to the rules-based order.},

Abstract = {Differential police conduct may be attributed both to residential racial
   segregation and more general discriminatory attitudes and policies. We
   draw upon ethnographic and other studies of everyday policing to propose
   that police, in the context of racially segregated neighborhoods,
   intensively surveil individuals who are ``out of place{''} in terms of
   their race and the local geographical context in which they are found.
   We then use statistical evidence from the New York City Police
   Department to compare stops in different neighborhoods. We find that the
   NYPD indeed carries out ``stops{''} that differentially target African
   Americans and Hispanics present in predominantly white precincts, with
   the degree of surveillance increasing as precincts become more white,
   and as stops become more generic and less about specific, identifiable
   crimes.},

Abstract = {The article uncovers the connection between Article II(e) of the
   Genocide Convention and the Greek Civil War (1946-49). Through archival
   research and secondary sources, it reconstructs the Greek legal
   arguments that framed the transfer of children conducted by the
   communist guerrillas in Northern Greece as an act of genocide and led to
   the inclusion of this action in the legal definition of genocide. By
   analyzing the arguments of the Greek government, it presents a new
   interpretation of Article II(e) of the Convention. It is contended that
   the historical antecedent of the provision supports a biopolitical
   understanding of the genocidal act in question. The article concludes
   with a more general discussion of the continuing importance of Article
   II(e).},

Abstract = {We investigated both the direct and indirect political dividends of
   public policies by examining Minha Casa, Minha Vida, a housing programme
   in Brazil that selects its beneficiaries by lottery. We surveyed the
   lottery participants and found that the winners were not more likely to
   support the incumbent politicians. Non-beneficiaries, a much larger
   group, were aware of the programme and thought well of it while the
   beneficiaries' responses to the programme were sometimes underwhelming.
   However, politicians considered the programme to be an electoral asset,
   and a difference-in-differences analysis of electoral results leveraging
   the roll-out of the programme across municipalities found that
   presidential and mayoral incumbent candidates performed better in
   localities that had implemented MCMV. Overall, when the beneficiaries
   formed a relatively small group, the benefits were conspicuous and the
   programme's objectives were widely supported. Government programmes can
   create electoral payoffs independently of how programmes are perceived
   or experienced by beneficiaries.},

Abstract = {Who is deemed vulnerable and in need of protection has a bearing on
   important policy decisions, such as refugee acceptance or provision of
   aid. In war, dominant narratives construe women as paradigmatic victims,
   even while civilian men are disproportionately targeted in the most
   lethal forms of violence. How are such gender-essentialist notions
   reflected in public opinion? Do regular citizens have inaccurate
   perceptions of male victimization in war, and with what consequences for
   their policy preferences? We carried out survey experiments among U.S.
   and U.K. respondents on both real and hypothetical conflicts, where we
   emphasized or varied the gender of the victims. In support of our
   expectations, respondents consistently underestimate the victimization
   of men, perceive civilian male victims as less innocent, and hold
   anti-male biases when it comes to accepting refugees and providing aid.
   However, informing respondents of the vulnerability of male civilians to
   targeted assassinations and massacres mitigates these effects.},

Abstract = {Contrary to conventional wisdom, globalization strengthens the linkage
   between the economy (across-border benchmarked measures) and vote
   choice, thereby facilitating electoral accountability by enriching the
   information available to the public. In the pre-globalization era,
   ordinary citizens had difficulty assessing domestic economic conditions
   in a comparative setting, in part because they were less exposed to
   information concerning other countries' economic performance. However,
   globalization has provided citizens with excellent sources for
   comparisons in the form of media coverage. Moreover, openness results in
   a reduction in relative variance of exogenous rather than competence
   shocks. Using media-guided comparisons from 29 countries since the
   1980s, this study finds that relative economic performance significantly
   affects citizens' vote choices when their economy is highly integrated
   into the world market.},

Abstract = {This article engages the question how police departments internally
   delegitimize the use of private sector technology vis-a-vis democratic
   considerations. Specifically, it retraces argumentation around the
   discontinuation of commercial predictive policing software and the
   alternative development of in-house tools. Conceptually, the analysis
   builds on the notion of digital sovereignty that has more recently
   become a popular analytical trope vis-a-vis public-private
   partnerships/public sector procurement and the question which
   technologies and services state agencies should keep under their own
   control in order to avoid dependencies on external suppliers and ensure
   functionality even in times of crisis and/or breakdown. Importantly,
   digital sovereignty allows us to study the complex and multi-faceted
   power relations between the police, private sector technology suppliers,
   and the public. The analysis identifies three key facets of digital
   sovereignty around which police concerns regarding the use of private
   sector technology revolve: (1) the control over data; (2) skepticism
   towards black boxes; and (3) accountability requirements towards the
   general public.},

Title = {The Winds of Winter: COVID-19 and Punctuations Without Policy Change in
   German Health Care Policy},

Abstract = {In the second half of the 19th legislative period, COVID-19 brought the
   issue of health policy firmly into the public limelight. Given that it
   amplified already existing challenges, this crisis can be conceptualised
   as a case of positive feedback in the understanding of punctuated
   equilibrium theory (PET). One would have expected this crisis to provide
   a push for reforms in the areas of digitalisation, hospital and care
   policy, as these represent both the policy path taken by the Minister of
   Health at the beginning of the legislative period and a response to the
   problems caused by the pandemic. However, none of these areas were
   addressed in any significant way by health policymakers after the
   COVID-19 outbreak, leaving us to wonder why a shift in attention and
   positive feedback did not lead to major reforms. To answer this
   question, we link PET to the multiple streams framework (MSF) to explain
   why positive feedback has not led to major reforms in German health
   policy. We show that the policy stream - with a lack of measures ready
   for adoption - and the politics stream, with power struggles within
   parties and between levels of government, explain why major reforms have
   not been adopted.},

Abstract = {Much of the literature on research-oriented teaching relies on the
   impressions of instructors who have experimented with such practices.
   Often authors are enthusiastic. This article shifts the focus to assess
   student satisfaction with such methods. We hypothesize that a student
   preference for research-based learning in Political Science would grow
   out of having a positive research experience during their studies, and
   that on average this retrospective satisfaction will depend on the
   nature of the collaboration. Using multicountry survey data spanning
   eleven institutions, we offer a series of linear models that distinguish
   three different research experiences: research with their professors,
   research with their peers, and solo research. Our results indicate that
   research experience does predicts student preference for research-based
   learning, but the direction of that pattern depends on whether they
   performed the research with their professors or other students. Whereas
   research experiences with other students positively predict a preference
   for research-oriented teaching, past research collaboration with
   professors generated a negative assessment, especially among students
   with no methodological training, and who did not use their involvement
   in such research projects to improve their methods skills.},

Abstract = {This introduction to the Italian Politics 2023 special issue gives an
   overview of the main events characterizing Italian politics during a
   year of large-scale policy reforms, presidential and parliamentary
   elections, and the unexpected Russian invasion of Ukraine. The authors
   pose three questions concerning Italian politics during the year gone
   by. First, from an institutional viewpoint, they ask whether the revival
   of majoritarianism as a principle of government formation represents the
   prelude to a return to enduring party-system bipolarity. Second, from an
   electoral and public policy perspective, they ask whether the formation
   of a government led by what many perceive as a radical right party
   betokens the start of a correspondingly radical shift in Italian public
   policy. Third, from an international relations perspective, they ask
   about the extent to which the Meloni government's attitude to the
   Russian invasion of Ukraine, and more generally to Italy's position on
   the world stage and in international affairs, is likely to differ from
   that adopted by Draghi. The chapter elaborates on the three questions by
   tracing how the events of 2022 generated much more continuity than
   expected.},

Abstract = {In recent years, fully automated content analysis based on probabilistic
   topic models has become popular among social scientists because of their
   scalability. However, researchers find that these models often fail to
   measure specific concepts of substantive interest by inadvertently
   creating multiple topics with similar content and combining distinct
   themes into a single topic. In this article, we empirically demonstrate
   that providing a small number of keywords can substantially enhance the
   measurement performance of topic models. An important advantage of the
   proposed keyword-assisted topic model (keyATM) is that the specification
   of keywords requires researchers to label topics prior to fitting a
   model to the data. This contrasts with a widespread practice of post hoc
   topic interpretation and adjustments that compromises the objectivity of
   empirical findings. In our application, we find that keyATM provides
   more interpretable results, has better document classification
   performance, and is less sensitive to the number of topics.},

Abstract = {The recent successes of populist radical right (PRR) parties have caused
   major upheavals across European political landscapes. Yet, the roots of
   their rising popularity continue to be widely debated. We contribute to
   these debates by advancing a thus far underexplored argument of rising
   rent burden as key to understanding contemporary PRR vote and nativist
   attitudes. Rising rents lie at the heart of growing concerns related to
   housing (un)affordability and (over)burden across Western democracies,
   directly affecting the economic and social well-being of substantial
   numbers of citizens. PRR parties, we argue, stand to gain from
   politicizing such concerns in distinct economic and nativist terms,
   especially amidst challenges like the European refugee crisis, which
   provoked an urgent need to house unprecedented inflows of refugees.
   Drawing on individual-level panel data from Germany, we uncover a strong
   relationship between rising rents, PRR vote, and hostile attitudes
   toward refugees. In calling attention to rising rents, our study adds
   important insights into scholarship on the politics of housing markets
   not only from the perspective of home ownership and housing assets, but
   also rents. In so doing, we also refine understandings of the conditions
   under which economic factors shape PRR support},

Abstract = {There has been a close relationship between conflict, peace, development
   and sport. The use of sports for international and intra-state conflict
   analysis and peacebuilding proposes has become an important study
   subject in the 21st century. Sport can be associated with intolerance,
   nationalistic sentiments, and, most of time, violence. It is also true
   that international sport events may cause conflicts, violence,
   aggression and controversies (Ogretir-Ozcelik, 2017). According to sport
   and olympic ideology, the main function of international sport is to
   promote international peace and development. It can be also used for a
   tool for societal change and social transformation. Since the ancient
   time, sport activities has related to the simulation of struggle between
   two conflicting parties and the civilized war. This study aims to
   analyze the link between international and intra-state conflicts, peace
   and sports. The objective of this paper is to examine the role of sports
   both conceptually and practically in conflict analysis and peace
   building. The first part is to present a conceptual framework in the
   study of sports, conflict resolution, and peace building. Second, it
   highlights some case studies where sports have an important role in
   international conflict and a tool for peace and reconciliation. Third,
   it focuses on the international use of sport and physical activity to
   attain the culture of peace and development objectives such as the
   Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).},

Abstract = {In new democracies, political parties often use clientelist strategies
   to mobilize voters during elections. In this article, we show that
   political machines systematically use vote buying to target voters with
   low costs of voting. We employ a geocoded survey of 3,192 respondents
   collected immediately after the municipal elections of 2016 in South
   Africa. We combine the survey data with administrative data on the
   geographical location of more than 22,600 polling stations. Our
   identification strategy exploits discontinuities in distances to vote
   generated by voting district boundaries in South Africa. This allows us
   to proxy the cost of voting with distance to the polling station and
   estimate the causal effect of the cost of voting on parties' use of vote
   buying. The results have important implications for core assumptions
   concerning parties' targeting strategies and for how electoral
   institutions shape the linkage strategies parties use to mobilize
   political support.},

Abstract = {Truck platooning is a technology that allows trucks to drive in a convoy
   one behind the other, communicating with one another and adapting
   themselves to the convoy. There are various configurations with
   differing degrees of autonomy but, in most cases, there is still a
   driver on board, which distinguishes the concept from fully autonomous
   vehicles. In this article, Dominik Juling examines the advantages,
   hurdles and limits of military truck platooning in Europe, and provides
   examples of projects and technologies that are already operational. The
   benefits include fewer drivers, increased safety for the crew and
   reduced resource consumption.},

Title = {Effects of Territorial Party Politics on Horizontal Coordination among
   the German Lander - An Analysis of the COVID-19 Pandemic Management in
   Germany},
Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2, SI},

Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 not only put the
   public health system under considerable pressure, but it also posed a
   huge challenge for established routines of intergovernmental
   coordination in Germany. As the Lander are responsible for implementing
   infection prevention measures, the most senior intergovernmental
   council, the minister presidents' conference (MPK), became the central
   body for pandemic crisis management. In light of high uncertainty, time
   pressure and public attention, drastic actions were taken to contain the
   dissemination of the corona virus. Against this background, our paper
   investigates how party politics impacted on horizontal coordination in
   times of crisis. The analysis shows that indeed territorial party
   politics interferes with routines of intergovernmental coordination.
   While congruence between the federal and Lander governments promotes
   homogenous implementation of joint MPK resolutions, increasing coalition
   size and intense party competition make deviations more likely. Finally,
   partisan ideology plays a key role as parties pursue clearly distinct
   pandemic management strategies.},

Title = {Generational replacement and Green party support in Western Europe},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {83},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Over the past decades, electoral support for Green parties has gradually
   increased in Western Europe, especially among young people. This begs
   the question whether there are systematic differences between
   generations in support for Green parties, and whether there are also
   life-cycle effects. We answer this question by separating age, period
   and cohort effects on Green party support using CSES data covering 40
   elections in 11 Western European countries. We find that when
   controlling for period and age, each new generation is more supportive
   of the Greens than the generation before. We also find negative age
   effects. While Green parties can expect to benefit in the future from
   generational replacement, the consequences of aging societies are to
   their disadvantage.},

Abstract = {Survey data from the Austrian Corona Panel Project show that in November
   2021 about 17\% of Austrians support the demonstrations against the
   measures to contain the Corona pandemic. At the same time, the
   proportion of people who think that demonstrations against the measures
   should be allowed has decreased by 5 percentage points. This suggests a
   broad approval of the measures within the population and a rejection of
   those who demonstrate against them. However, according to the impression
   in media coverage, the protesters themselves are not influenced by this.
   While there are already well-established findings on the attitudes
   shared by people who participate in the Corona protests, only little is
   known about the impact of the protests on citizens who do not take part
   in them. This question is relevant insofar as research has shown that
   establishing new norms, such as those produced by the pandemic, depends
   to a decisive degree on the (perceived) norm compliance of fellow
   citizens. Public protest can be understood as a signal of
   non-compliance, which could lead to a dwindling acceptance of the
   measures. At the same time, it can negatively influence the satisfaction
   with the democracy of those who comply with the measures. Our study
   contributes to a better understanding of the influence of protests on
   democracy satisfaction, perceptions of protests, one's own democratic
   attitudes and solidarity with others, and sheds light on what
   non-intended effects protest can have. The analysis reveals that trust,
   positive government evaluation, and societal cohesion result in higher
   satisfaction with democracy.},

Abstract = {This research explores the protest voting phenomenon in the Surakarta,
   Indonesia, mayoral election in response to political oligarchy. It uses
   a qualitative method, and the data analysis uses NVivo 12 Plus software.
   The findings reveal that the protest voting movement in the Surakarta
   mayoral election occurred as an effort to resist political parties. The
   protest vote made ballots invalid, showing no trust in candidates.
   Political parties practiced oligarchy by jointly endorsing the
   president's active son as a candidate. The parties had no initiative in
   bringing up alternative candidates due to the pragmatism of powers.
   Then, this political oligarchy became headline news. This research
   implies that public trust in political parties as instruments of
   democracy has increasingly degraded due to the parties' pragmatic
   behavior. Moreover, voters have understood that oligarchic practices
   must be resisted in order to select ideal leaders.},

Abstract = {A key Eurosceptic argument is that countries can selectively retain only
   those aspects of European integration from which they benefit, while
   opting out of those aspects they dislike. How convincing is this ``have
   your cake and eat it, too{''} argument to voters? This article argues
   that voters can learn about the feasibility of such a strategy by
   looking at the experience of countries that pursued a similar path.
   Positive experiences can strengthen voters' support for a similar
   strategy, while negative experiences can deter them. This argument is
   tested in a study of the effects of the Brexit negotiations on public
   opinion in Switzerland. Drawing on a panel survey fielded between 2019
   and 2021, the article shows that Brexit had a small but non-negligible
   impact on Swiss voters' expectations about the EU's resolve, as well as
   on vote intentions on two EU-related policy proposals. These findings
   confirm that voters learn from foreign political developments about the
   costs of non-cooperation.},

Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 8},
Abstract = {The category of `inter-communal violence' has been increasingly
   mobilised to interpret subnational violence in contemporary Africa. The
   paper contends this is an unwelcome trend that risks leaving violence
   unmoored from political and military systems it is enmeshed within. The
   paper advances an alternative framework for approaching such violence,
   using the cases of South Sudan and Nigeria to illustrate this framework.
   In purposefully weakened or deinstitutionalised systems, the paper
   argues, regimes tolerate, incite, or exploit forms of subnational
   violence to enhance their power or marginalise rivals, with such
   violence being closely (albeit unevenly and sometimes unsustainably)
   entwined with elite agendas.},

Abstract = {Political candidates use Spanish-language appeals in efforts to increase
   their support among Hispanic voters. We argue that candidates, Hispanic
   or not, can use Spanish to signal closeness to Hispanics and posit that
   the effectiveness of these appeals is conditional on proficiency. To
   test this, we run two experiments where participants listen to an audio
   clip of a hypothetical candidate's stump speech. We vary the ethnicity
   of the candidate (Anglo or Hispanic) and the language of the speech
   (English, non-native Spanish, and native-like Spanish). We find that
   Hispanic support for the Anglo and Hispanic candidates is higher in the
   native-like Spanish condition compared with the English-only condition.
   Relative to the English condition, non-native Spanish does not increase
   support for the Anglo candidate, but it decreases support for the
   Hispanic candidate. We find mixed effects for Anglo participants. Our
   results suggest that candidates can effectively appeal to Hispanic
   voters using Spanish-language messages.},

Abstract = {When choosing what cases to investigate, do the police discriminate on
   the basis of caste and class? We employ a conjoint design to evaluate
   biases in police officers' preferences for investigation based on
   perpetrator attributes. Conducting a survey of law enforcement officers
   in Nepal, we find evidence of discriminatory investigation practices.
   Absent constraining protocols that reduce officer discretion, police
   officers are more likely to target offenders who are from caste-class
   subjugated communities. Additionally, police officers' assessments of
   institutional investigatory preferences reveal caste-based
   considerations: officers believe the police, in general, prefer to
   investigate low-caste offenders over high-caste offenders. They do not,
   however, perceive their institution as having class-based biases. These
   findings add to the body of evidence on whether police discriminate,
   which has previously focused on use of lethal force and police stops,
   and further demonstrate that concerns over systemic bias in policing are
   warranted.},

Abstract = {This study examines how immigration policy impacts citizens' trust in
   politicians and political institutions. The article argues that
   immigration policy affects political trust through policy congruence.
   More specifically, it claims that the level of restrictiveness of
   immigration policy impacts political trust heterogeneously, conditional
   on whether citizens are anti- or pro-immigration and additionally on how
   strongly citizens are seeking information about political issues, the
   latter making it potentially easier for them to identify policy
   (in-)congruencies. Combining country-level data on immigration policy
   outputs in European countries with individual-level data to complex
   multilevel models, the findings reveal that the level of congruence of
   immigration policy to citizens' immigration preferences alone does not
   impact political trust. But they show that immigration policy impacts
   the political trust of citizens who are highly anti-immigration and at
   the same time very strongly seeking political information. Overall,
   however, the article concludes that the impact of immigration policy
   congruence on political trust is moderate at best.},

Abstract = {There has been a notable link/correlation between the rise of China and
   U.S.-Iran standoff in recent years. The year 2012 marks a watershed
   moment in U.S. strategic calculation on its relations with China and
   Iran. Before that year, China was not a peer competitor capable of
   challenging U.S. preeminence on the world stage and Iran was merely a
   regional adversary. After 2012, U.S. intelligence reports have
   consistently assess that China is the only great power with the intent
   and ability to undermine the liberal world order and its growing ties
   with U.S. adversaries, Iran included, will pose the biggest threat to
   U.S. and Western interests. The China factor has become an independent
   variable in U.S.-Iran relation, and as Beijing continues to grow its
   economic and military power, the United States will resort to more
   hawkish policy toward China and Iran, further escalating the U.S.-Iran
   standoff. Tehran will continue to play a crucial role in its
   asymmetrical relationships with Beijing and Washington as the two
   superpowers seek their respective leverage in the triangular
   relationship to outcompete the other party.},

Abstract = {Do all PhD students aspire to an academic career? Do PhD programs
   appropriately prepare students for the realities of the job market?
   There is a well-established gap between political science PhD graduates
   and tenure-track academic postings. The mismatch between PhD graduates
   and academic positions may point to alternative models of doctoral
   education as a possible solution. However, the survey of Canadian and
   Australian PhD students described in this article suggests that issues
   and challenges are common regardless of the model of doctoral education.
   Canadian PhDs report more mentoring activity, but they also are more
   fixated on securing academic positions. However, we find important
   gender differences across countries: men are more interested in an
   academic career and only a (disproportionately male) minority is
   confident that they will succeed in securing a faculty career. This
   raises questions about diversity in the future of the profession. This
   research suggests that although students have different experiences
   under different doctoral models, issues of academic jobs and a mismatch
   are common in both systems.},

Abstract = {Conventional peacebuilding literature posits strong state capacity or
   empowerment of local knowledge as potential mechanisms for conflict
   resolution. Using process-tracing and ethnography, I show that an
   alternate pathway to peace lies in a dialectical approach by examining
   the armed conflict between indigenous Igorot communities against the
   Philippine state. When indigenous peoples strategically modernise by
   `cherry-picking' and adapting traditions, they create opportunities to
   manoeuvre around and access state power. Exploiting the state's own
   preconceived notions of indigeneity, Igorot communities defined the
   terms of their autonomy. This study introduces the understanding that
   statebuilding and indigenisation as hybrid processes for peacebuilding.},

Title = {The local party voter: A localist anti-establishment voter?},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {82},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In several countries, local parties have increased their share of votes
   in local elections. This development has received limited scholarly
   attention compared to the immense interest paid to the fates of national
   level anti-establishment parties. Against this backdrop, we ask if
   something distinct characterizes those who choose to vote for genuinely
   local alternatives compared to other anti-establishment voters. Sweden
   is taken as the case in focus, a country where local parties have grown
   in numbers and strength throughout the past three decades. We view local
   parties as a part of a broader `anti-establishment' family, and we
   explore if their voters a) are similar to those who vote for the most
   pronounced anti-establishment party in Sweden (Sweden Democrats), or b)
   if local party voters are a distinct anti-establishment category in
   their own right. Drawing on a survey data from 49 Swedish
   municipalities, we find that local party voters indeed distinguish
   themselves from both Sweden Dem-ocrat's voters and voters for the old
   and established parties, thus making them a distinct anti-establishment
   voter category of their own. These voters distrust their local
   politicians but at the same time are civically engaged.},

Title = {Are leftist or rightist voters better substantively represented? The
   effects of variance in district magnitude on party-voter ideological
   congruence},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {82},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {How does the variation in district magnitude in districted proportional
   representation systems affect congruence between a voter and their party
   of choice? I argue that voters in large-magnitude districts will have
   higher levels of party-voter congruence than voters in small-magnitude
   districts, due to stronger strategic incentives and reduced party
   options in small-magnitude districts. Furthermore, I argue that this
   relationship will be stronger among leftist voters compared to rightist
   voters, due to the concentration of rightist voters in rural,
   small-magnitude districts and leftist voters in urban, high-magnitude
   districts. These expectations are tested using data that from 45
   elections in 12 districted proportional representation systems included
   in the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES). The results
   support the expectation that party-voter ideological congruence will be
   higher for voters in larger electoral districts, and lower for voters
   located within smaller districts. Leftist voters do appear to suffer a
   congruence penalty in smaller districts, whereas the congruence of
   rightist voters is less affected by district magnitude. An ex-amination
   of the mechanisms behind this finding suggests that leftist-voters in
   small-magnitude districts are faced with a smaller and more
   right-leaning set of party options.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I seek to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
   voter behaviour in the 2020 general elections in Ghana using survey data
   compiled in Greater Accra between July and August 2020. The COVID-19
   pandemic became a major campaign issue in last year's election prompting
   varied responses and support from both the government and the main
   opposition parties. Though a majority of the electorate were satisfied
   (83.5\%) and grateful (82\%) for the relief items they received, only 3
   out of every 10 of the respondents think the intervention had an effect
   on the way they voted. Using the rally-effect theory, the paper finds
   that the political leadership and incumbent government were able to
   rally support for their campaign as a result of the social intervention
   policies implemented in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, yet were
   unable to sustain and translate that support into electoral victory in
   the Greater Accra Region, a major swing region with the highest number
   of Covid-19 cases and one of the only two regions that witnessed a
   lockdown during the height of the pandemic.},

Abstract = {Wedged between Spain and France, the stateless nation of the Basques has
   a keen sense of national identity. The construction and maintenance of
   national identities has taken place in both the social and political
   terrains. At the heart of these constructions lies a deep sense of
   origins and difference. Basque sport, particularly football, is yet
   another terrain to situate Basque national identity in alterity. The
   first division Athletic Bilbao has earned its reputation due to a
   recruitment strategy they call la filosofia: since the early twentieth
   century, they have fielded Basque players only. Through constant
   discussions and decisions about whether a player is `Basque' or `Basque
   enough,' and what that means, football has greatly contributed to the
   construction of a national imagery that has revolved around place,
   political ideology, race and ethnicity, and transnational culture.},

Abstract = {In this research note, we document the extent to which negative beliefs
   about women's capacity to hold public office are widespread in Canada.
   Using a list experiment, our results demonstrate that many Canadians
   believe that men are ``naturally better{''} leaders than are women and
   that women are ``too emotional{''} and ``too nice{''} for politics.
   While some groups are willing to explicitly own these views when asked
   directly about them (for example, older people, men, those who are more
   conservative and religious), others are unwilling to do so unless social
   desirability is mitigated (for example, younger people, left-leaning).
   By overcoming concerns with social desirability, we show that women
   still face explicit, often sexist, barriers in political work.},

Abstract = {While a number of high-level figures around the world have been
   prosecuted and even jailed for corruption in recent years, we know
   little about how such anticorruption efforts shape public opinion and
   patterns of political engagement. To address this question, we examine
   evidence from Argentina and Costa Rica involving the unprecedented
   sentencing of two former Presidents on corruption charges. Exploiting
   the coincidence in timing between these cases and fieldwork on
   nationally representative surveys, we find that citizens interviewed in
   the aftermath of these events expressed lower trust in institutions and
   were less willing to vote or join in collective demonstrations. Overall,
   these findings suggest that high-profile efforts to punish corrupt
   actors may have similar effects as political scandals in shaping
   citizens' relationship to the political system.},

Abstract = {During the Great Recession, European democracies underwent major
   political changes, from the spread of institutional discontent to the
   rise of radical populist parties. The erosion of democratic satisfaction
   in EU member states after the exogenous shock of the economic crisis is
   a significant phenomenon that requires innovative analysis and
   explanation. This article develops a new conceptual and empirical
   framework that examines how democracies are affected by exogenous shocks
   and the determinants of resilient democracies. The study explores the
   notion of democratic resilience, conceptualized as democratic resilience
   as the system characteristics which successfully adapt to or overcome
   democratic delegitimization processes after a shock. The analysis
   provides a classification of democracies by trajectory, distinguishing
   between preventive, recovered, and damaged democracies, and identifies
   which political characteristics have successfully increased or decreased
   democratic resilience. External political efficacy and economic
   satisfaction are highlighted as indispensable components and mediators
   of political and economic contextual features for a more resilient and
   stable political system during economic crises.},

Abstract = {This article explores the neglect of race and racism in the discipline
   of British politics. I outline why this has happened, the consequences
   of such neglect and how it might be remedied. The article proceeds in
   four stages: First, it makes the case that British politics has
   neglected race and racism. I do this by showing that race does not
   feature within the core concerns of the discipline, and that despite the
   fact that race may be noted in the relationship between demography and
   representation, its status as a social construct is not addressed.
   Second, the article explores the question of disciplinary reflexivity.
   Drawing on Emirbayer and Desmond's (2012) racial reflexivity framework,
   I delineate the disciplinary and scholastic unconscious of British
   politics, showing that the reliance on the Westminster Model obscures
   questions of race. Next, the article discusses the Sewell Report (2021),
   explicating its post-racism narrative, and draws parallels between the
   findings of the report and the study of British politics. The final
   section of the article outlines a framework for a British politics of
   race. The framework draws on critical race theory, and Britain's
   imperial history of colonialism and empire-building and thus puts the
   study of race at the centre of the discipline.},

Abstract = {Whether democratic governance breeds corruption, especially in
   developing countries that practice democracy, is highly debatable. Using
   primary data from interviews and relevant secondary data from media
   reports and scholarly work, this article aims to address a fundamental
   question: Does democracy fuel corruption in Ghana's Fourth Republic?
   Although 20\% of participants believed that democracy breeds corruption,
   about 80\% disagreed. The study indicates that democracy does not
   necessarily bring about corruption; rather, what fuels corruption is how
   democracy is practiced. Based on the stage/age of democracy thesis, this
   study does not suggest less corruption in a dictatorship compared to
   democracy. Instead, the study indicates that despite its democracy being
   over 29 years old, corruption is still prevalent because Ghana has a
   flawed democracy that has failed to establish and implement robust
   accountability mechanisms to control corruption effectively. The
   theoretical and policy implication is to avoid a lengthy period of the
   flawed/electoral democracy phase and move to the mature democracy phase
   by, for example, ensuring a sustained political commitment to combatting
   corruption and strengthening the rule of law and accountability
   institutions such as the judiciary. This study extends the theoretical
   and empirical understanding of the relationship between democracy and
   corruption.},

Abstract = {Participatory Budgeting (PB) is a welcome democratic innovation because
   it promises to empower traditionally marginalized groups and create more
   equitable public spending. PB delegates public authority to neighborhood
   residents to propose and decide on projects to fund with tax dollars.
   Does PB achieve a form of empowered participatory governance? This
   article examines this question by focusing on the degree to which PB
   engages marginalized groups in two Bay Area cities, using survey and
   interview data. We find that marginalized groups do participate,
   periodically at rates equal to their proportion of the population, and
   such groups appear to occasionally benefit materially from winning
   projects, though to a lesser extent. Effective outreach methods that
   contribute to these outcomes are highlighted. However, overall findings
   show that white middle-aged, middle-class groups participate most.
   Moreover, PB funds have been scaled back in both cities, limiting
   benefits and their potential to achieve PB's equity goals. These results
   mirror outcomes in other jurisdictions. We conclude, nevertheless, with
   discussion of how PB's institutional design, which if expanded and
   deepened, provides concrete pathways to achieve a promising form of
   empowered participatory governance with redistributive potential at the
   local level.},

Abstract = {In much of the world, public transportation infrastructure is sorely
   needed. Political economy models suggest that provision lags because
   uneven access and use of public transit fragments political coalitions.
   Yet, traditional survey techniques tell us little about who supports
   valence issues, such as mass transit. I instead adopt a novel survey
   approach from economics designed to elicit preference intensity. I then
   sample households at different distances from a subway project in
   Bogota, Colombia. Contra conventional expectations, I find little
   evidence that local geography shapes preferences. Those who use public
   transit the least and pay the most for its construction-the upper
   class-are its strongest supporters. An experiment and focus groups
   suggest that middle- and upper-class groups want others to take public
   transportation to reduce congestion and shorten their commutes. One
   implication is that a growing middle class might help to strengthen
   urban public goods provision.},

Abstract = {Existing research largely ignores Black support for punitive policies
   that target group members, even as this support challenges expectations
   of in-group favoritism and group solidarity. The current research fills
   this gap by leveraging a familiar concept: ``the politics of
   respectability.{''} Building on historical and qualitative accounts of
   this worldview, which focuses on the behavior of group members, I
   develop a social psychological framework to understand how
   identity-based concerns motivate Black support for punishment that
   targets members of their racial group. I also develop a novel measure of
   respectability-the Respectability Politics Scale. Findings demonstrate
   that adherents of respectability feel more ashamed about the public view
   of their racial group, endorse more negative racial stereotypes, and
   feel relatively less close to other Black people. They are also more
   likely to support a range of punitive policies that target group
   members, including restrictive dress code policies, tough-on-crime
   policies, and paternalistic welfare policies.},

Abstract = {The cultural salience of generational categories is on the rise: the
   large and powerful Baby-Boom generation continues to dominate electoral
   politics while younger Millennials' and Gen Zers' fluency in digital
   communication technology lets them voice their frustrations. We
   demonstrate that these three generational groups show many signs of
   being-or becoming-collective political actors. Majorities identify with
   their generation, they find these identities salient in their everyday
   lives, and younger generations especially demonstrate high levels of
   generational linked fate. Generations have distinct political agendas,
   and many express a willingness to support candidates who prioritize the
   interests of their generation. These findings force us to reconsider the
   treatment of generations as only ascriptive groups and instead see them
   as composed of self-conscious members, capable of acting as collective
   actors on the political stage. If the patterns we show sharpen further,
   generations may become defining points of cultural and political
   cleavage.},

Abstract = {Hannah Arendt famously argued that acts of violence are corrosive to a
   free and plural politics. However, the broader implications of her
   critique of violence are less well known. Reading her concept of
   violence comprehensively, with regard to (ostensibly non-political)
   labor and work as well as action, this article reveals its broader
   relevance for contemporary political thought: the political question of
   violence lies at the heart of our ecological crisis and is crucial for
   the social structure of labor domination. While Arendtian politics is
   without normative guarantees, the conceptual distinction between
   instrumental violence and free politics is crucial, because it renders
   the political judgment of violence possible. In every realm of human
   activity, the refusal to acknowledge violence stunts our capacity to
   care for the world.},

Abstract = {While affective polarization has been shown to have serious social
   consequences, there is little evidence regarding its effects on
   political attitudes and behavior such as policy preferences, voting, or
   political information accrual. This paper provides evidence that
   affective polarization impacts misinformation belief, arguing that
   citizens with higher levels of affective polarization are more likely to
   believe in-party-congruent misinformation and less likely to believe
   out-party-congruent misinformation. The argument is supported by data
   from the ANES 2020 Social Media Study and the ANES 2020 Time Series
   Study, which speaks to the generalizability of the relationship.
   Additionally, a survey experiment provides evidence that the
   relationship is causal. The results hold among Democrats and Republicans
   and are independent of the effects of partisan strength and ideological
   extremity. Furthermore, the relationship between affective polarization
   and misinformation belief is exacerbated by political sophistication
   rather than tempered by it, implying that education will not solve the
   issue. The results speak to the need for work on reducing affective
   polarization.},

Abstract = {Why do criminal actors publicly display threatening messages? Studies of
   organized crime emphasize that criminal actors rely on clandestine
   networks of influence. Subtle or coded threats are an effective means of
   extending that influence, but publicizing these threats appears to
   undermine their chief advantage. We argue that publicized threats
   broadcast an imagined order, delineating who has a place in society
   under criminal control, and who does not. To demonstrate this argument,
   we construct a ``grammar of threat{''} and use this to analyze public
   threats broadcast by four criminal actors: two groups in Colombia and
   two in Mexico. The analysis demonstrates that every group projects an
   order through their threats, but that the order imagined varies by
   group. Some orders are more clearly ideological; some are more localized
   or more expansive. These findings highlight the important role of
   communication-distinct from but often combined with violence-in criminal
   governance.},

Abstract = {Within-semester shifts in course modality in response to pandemics,
   weather, or accommodation for travel and health are increasingly common
   and can interrupt student learning. We tracked temporary modality
   changes across 10 sections of ``Introduction to American Government{''}
   to examine the extent to which instructors have tools to help students
   successfully navigate such changes and mitigate learning loss. We find
   that students rated instructors' handling of shifts well if they made
   course material engaging, communicated clearly, and effectively used
   technology. The analysis suggests that instructors can mitigate the
   impact of unplanned changes to modality on students' learning when there
   are three or fewer shifts during a semester.},

Abstract = {How should the `liberal democratic mainstream' be fortified (or
   recovered) so that its members can consolidate to defeat anti-democrats?
   I argue for a value-pluralistic orientation to liberal democratic
   politics that accomodates not just the good of conflict (championed by
   `democratic agonists'), but also the good of unity. This approach, I
   show, accommodates various forms of contestation, but also recognizes
   the need to purposefully cultivate unity, and thus can be said to
   balance a `tragic ethos' with a `progressive patriotic ethos': the
   former encourages citizens to become more vigilant in the struggle
   against oppression, and the latter, to share in a sense of unity and to
   honour liberal democracy's vital role in preventing tyranny. Such an
   approach would surely not be free of tension. However, I argue that it
   can help liberal democrats indeed consolidate and practice `fugitive
   antagonism' against the enemies of liberal democracy when necessary. I
   advance my thesis by engaging in a critical conversation with the

Abstract = {The emergence of COVID-19 spurred the fastest development of a vaccine
   in history. Yet, a large proportion of Americans remain hesitant to
   receive it. Our paper investigates how the social networks we inhabit
   might explain persistent vaccine hesitancy. We argue that the COVID-19
   vaccination status of respondents' closest associates inhibits or
   motivates their decision to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. To test our
   argument, we conduct an original survey asking respondents a battery of
   questions about the people with whom individuals most frequently discuss
   vaccines and COVID-19. Our survey reports that individuals' discussion
   networks are polarized by vaccination status. Concurrently, there is a
   strong association between the social network's vaccination status and
   the respondent's vaccination status. This association is so robust that
   partisanship does not moderate the association between discussants'
   vaccination status and respondents' vaccination status. Together, our
   results imply that unvaccinated individuals remain hesitant because they
   face reinforcing social pressure from their closest associates. The
   unique timing of our survey, during an unprecedented vaccination
   campaign against a novel disease, offers a snapshot of how relationships
   may affect attitudes.},

   collection, analysis, and interpretation of findings in American and
   British terrorism research. We suggest seven directions that we see as
   promising. These include: 1) interview methods and reporting, 2) source
   reporting in database studies, prioritizing available court records, 3)
   more comparison groups, including non-offender activists for the same
   cause and non-political offenders, 4) comparison of cases with and
   without confidential informants, 5) extremist ideas and extremist
   violence studied as separate problems, 6) more attention to grievances,
   avoiding controversies over defining ideology and narrative, and 7) more
   attention to emotions of terrorists, their supporters, and their
   victims.},

Abstract = {The world is experiencing the worst immigrant crisis since the Second
   World War; millions of people have been displaced and forced to migrate.
   The immigrant problem, one of the most important consequences of forced
   migration, is one of the most important issues in the international
   arena. One of the countries most affected by this problem is undoubtedly
   Turkiye. The aim of the article is to investigate the phenomenon of
   migration, which is one of the issues that affect Turkiye the most in
   the national and international arena, in the context of social
   acceptance. It is obvious that harsh solutions to the immigrant problem
   with strict rules are not only inappropriate for humanity but will also
   deepen the problem rather than solve it, and damage the image of Turkiye
   in the international arena. Therefore, the most fundamental solution to
   be developed is to ensure social acceptance through suggestions to be
   developed on soft ground. This is only possible if immigrants are
   recognized and their perceptions and efforts are known. In the study,
   The Perceptions of Afghan Immigrants living in TRA1 Level 2 (Erzurum,
   Erzincan, Bayburt) region about the Region were investigated. The study
   was conducted using the grounded theory method. In this method, the
   problem is heard directly from the interlocutors and the hypothesis is
   obtained by analyzing the data obtained. In this study, a data pool was
   created through in-depth interviews and semi-structured questionnaires
   with immigrants from Afghanistan living in the TRA1 region, and then
   these data were analyzed in accordance with the grounded theory method.
   With the results obtained, it is aimed to make an academic contribution
   to integration studies by revealing the perceptions of immigrants about
   the region.},

Abstract = {The sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines in October 2022 has magnified
   the vulnerability and critical importance of subsea infrastructure. It
   has also highlighted the lack of understanding of how subsea networks
   work, how they are regulated, who controls them and how they are
   protected. The conflict in Ukraine has amplified tensions in this
   context in terms of the growing threat of hybrid warfare/grey zone
   activity. This article will analyse the context and bodies involved in
   the governance of submarine cables and identify gaps in this protection,
   with a focus on the actions of cable actors such as the European Union
   and other initiatives within the framework of China's Silk Road.},

Title = {Accountability Issues, Online Covert Hate Speech, and the Efficacy of
   Counter-Speech},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {249-260},
Abstract = {Concerning individual or institutional accountability for online hate
   speech, research has revealed that most such speech is covert (veiled or
   camouflaged expressions of hate) and cannot be addressed with existing
   measures (e.g., deletion of messages, prosecution of the perpetrator).
   Therefore, in this article, we examine another way to respond to and
   possibly deflect hate speech: counter-speech. Counter-narratives aim to
   influence those who write hate speech, to encourage them to rethink
   their message, and to offer to all who read hate speech a critical
   deconstruction of it. We created a unique set of parameters to analise
   the strategies used in counter-speech and their impact. Upon analysis of
   our database (manual annotations of 15,000 Twitter and YouTube
   comments), we identified the rhetoric most used in counter-speech, the
   general impact of the various counter-narrative strategies, and their
   specific impact concerning several topics. The impact was defined by
   noting the number of answers triggered by the comment and the tone of
   the answers (negative, positive, or neutral). Our data reveal an
   overwhelming use of argumentative strategies in counter-speech, most
   involving reasoning, history, statistics, and examples. However, most of
   these argumentative strategies are written in a hostile tone and most
   dialogues triggered are negative. We also found that affective
   strategies (based on displaying positive emotions, for instance) led to
   a positive outcome, although in most cases these narratives do not
   receive responses. We recommend that education or training-even machine
   learning such as empathetic bots-should focus on strategies that are
   positive in tone, acknowledging grievances especially.},

   Negro, Argentina (2017-2019) case study},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {60},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The impact of environmental conflicts on Argentina's subnational party
   systems was addressed through a case study: the rejection of the policy
   of installing a nuclear plant in Rio Negro and its political effects
   (2017-2019). A heterogeneous variety of social, political and state
   actors with capacity for representation and circumstantial collectives
   positioned themselves antagonistically in the public sphere in the
   dispute over the thematization of nuclear policy as an environmental
   problem. The process led to the emergence of a new contentious actor,
   the Movimiento Antinuclear Argentino (MAR) with veto capacity over
   nuclear policy and a provincial party with an environmentalist slogan,
   Rionegrinos por la Igualdad (RIO) with members of the former. Around the
   public theming, a process of identification and differentiation was
   deployed between those who assumed themselves as injured parties of the
   project and those who promoted it. This was expressed in environmental
   terms and took the form of a sociotechnical controversy shaped by
   discursive coalitions (one pro-nuclear and one anti-nuclear). The
   publicity of the rejection of the policy of installing a nuclear plant
   as an issue that affected the environmental and political rights of
   citizens operated as an element for a democratizing moment. The
   environmental conflict that arose had multilevel effects in arenas of
   public deliberation, both civil and social, as well as
   political-institutional. The effects on this last plane can be
   synthesized in three dimensions: normative, partisan and electoral. I
   conclude that: the environmental conflict affected the
   territorialization of intraparty and interparty competition and the
   structure of social conflicts on which the provincial party system
   develops. This dynamic was the product of the expanded political
   participation of citizens and the stabilization of the environmental
   issue as an element of public culture within the framework of the cycle
   of environmental conflict in Argentina in the twenty-first century.},

   Equilibrium},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {112-121},
Abstract = {The article investigates the political determinants of fiscal governance
   in the EU. Since the outset of the Economic and Monetary Union, the EU
   adopted a model of fiscal regulation which attempted to keep government
   debt and deficit in check to avoid ``fiscal dominance.{''} With the 2020
   pandemic, the EU suspended the fiscal rules and adopted a program, Next
   Generation EU, having some features of a central fiscal capacity. On the
   bases of comparative federal analysis, the article discusses the
   political conditions that preside over the formation of a stable central
   fiscal capacity, here conceptualized as the ``triple-T model.{''} We
   argue that, in unions of states, the determinants of a central fiscal
   capacity consist in the appearance of an existential threat, in the
   reciprocal trust among national governments for answering the threat
   with central resources, and an adequately long time planning horizon of
   national policymakers to apprehend the benefits of those common
   resources for all member states. On these bases, the article outlines
   the contour of a new EU fiscal set up which encompasses an EU central
   fiscal capacity and robust budget rules framing the fiscal choices of
   national authorities.},

Abstract = {While some world regions have seen women opposition leaders with no ties
   to political families rise to national leadership, in East Asia, women
   opposition leaders who ascend to national executive positions have been
   largely limited to the wives, daughters, or sisters of prominent male
   politicians. Locally, however, there have been some broadening and
   diversification of women who seek and win executive office through
   oppositional politics. Given the small number of women opposition
   leaders who have gained leadership positions in the government, this
   article develops an interpretive study of the rela-tionship between
   becoming ``critical actors{''} and doing ``critical acts{''} as women
   opposition leaders. Using four illustrative cases of women who have
   pursued executive power through oppositional politics, this article
   questions whether and how the variation in women's pathways affects
   their exercise of power in Indonesia and South Korea, two young though
   consol-idating democracies in East Asia. Drawing on the biographies and
   policies of two presidents (Megawati Soekarnoputri and Park Geun-hye)
   and two mayors (Tri Rismaharini and Kim Soo-young) it shows that local
   women opposition leaders use their executive leadership to initiate and
   implement public policies, unlike their national counterparts whose
   pathways and performance are intertwined with family background. By
   doing so, the article sheds light on the complex nexus between political
   pathways and performance of women opposition leaders.},

Abstract = {The relationship between Germany and Poland was long considered one of
   centre and periphery. Bilateral reconciliation, the transformation of
   the Polish economy and politics, as well as embedment in European
   integration were supposed to lead successively to overcoming
   developmental differences and enabling the convergence of both
   countries. This model is obsolete. In economic, European, and security
   policy, Poland is now pursuing its own interests, and these collide with
   those of Germany. German-Polish relations are characterized by
   ``strategic asymmetries{''}. Russia's war against Ukraine is reminding
   both ``central European powers{''} what is at stake: the security of
   Europe.},

   types of content and moderation they prioritise and the frequency of
   (self-reported) interventions taken in the fight against

   online political campaigning and compare these approaches against the
   goals set out in the renewed EU Code of Practice on Disinformation and
   the proposed EU Regulation on the Transparency and Targeting of
   Political Advertising. We argue that platform policies and practices
   merit analytical scrutiny as they determine the boundaries of acceptable
   speech online, and that measures to regulate political speech should be
   understood as more than addressing political advertising alone, but also
   should include policies regarding political accounts and
   mis/disinformation.},

Abstract = {Police violence is a problem scarcely addressed by the Argentine
   reference media and, frequently, by com-munication studies in the
   country. This article aims to analyze the ways in which a sector of the
   Argentine hegemonic press produces news about the subject, placing
   special emphasis on the meanings built on the victim-victimizer pair.
   From a qualitative approach based on content analysis, e a group of news
   regard-ing violent police interventions between 2020 and 2021 is
   analyzed. Two types of frames present in the information are found:
   ``insecurity{''} and ``victims in focus{''}. Both frameworks allow
   observing how a logic of differential victimization or selectivity of
   the victims operates discursively, because of particular modes of
   construction and interpretation of the facts in the media, as well as
   trace possible effects of the sense of legitimation or discursive
   delegitimization of the violent actions of the Police.},

Title = {Political Controversies on a Network: The Use of Social Media by
   Brazilian Federal Deputies to Participate in Controversial Debates},
Journal = {REVISTA ANDINA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {This paper aims to analyze the motivations of Brazilian federal deputies
   in expressing polemical opinions and participating in political de-bates
   on controversial topics in social media. The study is based on data
   obtained through an electronic questionnaire with parliamentarians'
   advisors; this questionnaire included open and closed questions. The
   sample consists of 155 informants that corresponds to 30.21\% of the
   total 513 parliamentary officers of the 56th Legislature (2019-2022).
   The conclusions show that only 19.6\% of the deputies act systematically
   and continuously to take a position regarding controversial issues; most
   of them (80.4\%) prefer not to get involved in controversies. For those
   deputies in the first group, the main motivation is to make
   counter-points with their opponents; while in the second group
   predominates caution and fear of negative repercussions to
   parliamentarians' image. In addition to the data description, the open
   answers are used for a deepening qualitative analysis of the data.},

Abstract = {This article affirms that the different management forms of State-owned
   enterprises do not correspond to different epochs but can coexist, on
   the contrary, not only in the same historical period, but also under the
   same government. Indeed, the State can be the total owner, a majority
   shareholder and a minority shareholder in different companies during the
   same government, having in each case more or less resources to intervene
   in markets and to exclude private actors from business decision making
   processes. I will analyze three cases of State-owned enterprise
   management during Kirchnerist governments in Argentina: AySA in 2006
   (State as full owner), YPF in 2012 (State as majority shareholder) and
   Siderar in 2011 (State as minority shareholder) following the hypothesis
   that each of these management forms was selected by the government
   depending on the circumstantial objectives that it had to face: rates
   freezing in the case of AySA, curbing the outflow of foreign currency in
   the case of YPF, and rent-seeking in the case of Siderar. This analysis
   will be carried out with a comparative political economy approach and
   following the theory-building process tracing method.},

Title = {Explaining Canada's Unsurprising Response to Russia's Invasion of
   Ukraine, 2022-2023},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Number = {SI},
Abstract = {This study argues that Canada's foreign policy behavior has remained
   predictably unchanged in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in
   2022. Historically, Canada's foreign policy has been directed by
   external considerations, specifically a liberal international order,
   multilateralism, key allies, and the United States. These orientations
   have determined Canadian foreign policy for generations. They guide
   Canada's foreign policy decision-making but are sometimes contradictory.
   In the case of Ukraine in 2022, however, these orientations aligned
   perfectly, allowing the Justin Trudeau government to participate in
   international efforts to support Ukraine without controversy. This paper
   surveys four major external orientations and one domestic orientation
   before describing the country's contributions to international efforts
   to support Ukraine. It concludes with a discussion about the troubling
   implications of a foreign policy that is tightly linked to external
   consideration: the costs of exit and the fundamental purpose of Canada's
   foreign policy in the first place.},

Abstract = {The unstoppable development of new technologies operated by Artificial
   Intelligence poses a regulatory challenge of considerable significance
   for the rule of law. Beyond the potential benefits that new digital
   tools can bring for social progress and economic development, opaque and
   uncontrolled uses of AIs can constitute a threat to the rights and
   values that underpin our society and, in particular, to equality between
   women and men. This paper analyzes the causes and consequences of
   algorithmic gender biases and the regulatory proposals that have been

Abstract = {The consecutive crises of the last decade have eroded public support for
   the EU, especially so among Southern European member states. A
   long-standing scholarly debate centers around whether it is economic or
   cultural considerations that drive public support for the EU. However,
   it is still unclear whether public attitudes toward European integration
   are driven primarily by economic evaluations or concerns associated with
   growing immigration flows. To explore this question, we draw on data
   from the Eurobarometer in Greece and Italy between 2015 and 2020. We
   find consistent evidence that diffuses public support for the EU and
   specific support for EU institutions are associated positively with
   economic evaluations of the European economy and household finances and
   negatively with opposition to immigration. Our study provides further
   insights into the dynamics of public support for the EU in the European
   periphery during critical times.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyze the current international
   agreements, the Ukrainian legislation on ensuring the educational needs
   of its national minorities, the observance of their educational rights
   and their compliance with international standards. The study is
   conducted on the example of the educational needs of Gypsies, Poles and
   Hungarians. The materials and methods used made it possible to carry out
   analytical and research work, identify shortcomings and offer clear
   proposals for the legal regulation of the educational provision of
   national minorities. Also, a questionnaire survey was conducted among
   representatives of national minorities studying in educational
   institutions in Ukraine. The system of general philosophical and
   scientific methods was chosen as a methodological basis. It is concluded
   that, in general, Ukrainian legislation complies with international and
   European standards of minority education, because it contains rules and
   guarantees to ensure full understanding of the native language of the
   national minority and, in the broadest sense, the legislator managed to
   find a balance between national, moral and cultural interests of these
   groups of Ukrainian citizens.},

   Russian Studies sees itself and how it conducts its work. Similar to
   what happened after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the field faces a
   need to reformulate key assumptions and develop new methods. Back then
   Russian Studies reacted with new paradigms and gained recognition in the
   mother disciplines of the social sciences thanks to broad-based field
   research, high standards, pertinent methods, and substantive findings.
   Under conditions of isolation and repression in Russia, as well as the
   war against Ukraine, these achievements are in danger of being wiped
   out.},

Pages = {21+},
Abstract = {The Middle Ages experienced a ``globalisation{''} of its own. From the
   9th to the 12th century, the Eurasian expanse was crisscrossed by a
   network of trade routes, warehouses, and transshipment points through
   which long-distance trade was conducted. The Silk Road stretched from
   what is now China through Central Asia, Russia, Ukraine, and East
   Central Europe to Western Europe and the Levant. The passage of time and
   the type of goods trafficked determined the choice of routes. Goods of
   all kinds as well as slaves were transported overland, on inland waters,
   and across the sea. At its greatest extent, the Silk Road system
   stretched over more than 8,000 km. The merchants, among whom Jews played
   an important role, spoke numerous languages. Cashless trade was already
   known in the Khazar Empire. The Silk Road's system of trade and
   communication had a significant impact on the modernisation and
   transformation of the old world.},

Abstract = {Mortier v. Belgium, of October 4, 2022 (ECHR) has come to illuminate the
   acute question of whether or not the decriminalization of euthanasia and
   assisted suicide is compatible with the human rights protection system
   of the Council of Europe, concluding that it is. Naturally, his doctrine
   has a direct impact on the resolution of the unconstitutionality appeal
   filed and pending examination by the Constitutional Court against the
   Spanish Organic Law 3/2021, of March 24, regulating euthanasia.
   This article describes the facts and arguments of the Mortier case,
   specifying below the most permanent doctrine of the European Court on
   any state decriminalization of euthanasia, to then go on to contrast
   this doctrine with some contested aspects of the Spanish regulation,
   anticipating, thus, the criteria to be taken into account by our
   Constitutional Court when deciding the appeal.},

   CONCRETE CASE STUDY OF STATE JUSTICE IN THE CITY OF TEFE/AM},
Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {27},
Pages = {42-59},
Abstract = {The main objective of this research was to analyze access to justice in
   the interior of the state of Amazonas through a concrete case study of
   the State Judiciary in the city of Tefe/AM, in a way that can contribute
   to fulfilling this constitutional mandate and consequently ensure the
   full exercise of citizenship by the entire population, especially those
   who reside in communities far from the municipal headquarters. The
   methodology used was deductive, with a qualitative approach,
   complemented by the bibliographic analysis of doctrines and legislation,
   documentary research, case study, and other relevant sources of
   information. It was concluded that, despite the logistical, ecological,
   and climatic challenges faced in Tefe/AM, it is possible to promote and
   improve access to justice in the region through inter-institutional
   agreements, consensual conflict resolution, involvement of community
   leaders, and the creation of advanced justice system poles in strategic
   locations, which guarantee both comprehensive service by the system's
   agencies and participation in legal proceedings through the internet,
   providing a more effective and inclusive service for all.},

Abstract = {Unequal access to vaccines for the Covid-19 pandemic, also referred to
   as ``vaccine apartheid,{''} has marginalized low-income countries again.
   In October 2020, India and South Africa proposed a temporary waiver from
   certain provisions of the TRIPS Agreement for the prevention of Covid-19
   at the World Trade Organization (WTO). An agreement was later reached in
   Geneva on June 17, 2022. The objective of this article is to analyze the
   negotiation and agreement reached at the WTO. This article explores the
   difficulties of creating international public good in the field of
   public health within the milieu of powerful actors, namely big
   pharmaceutical companies with vested interests. The central argument of
   this article is that this agreement alone will not solve the vaccine
   access problem for low-income countries. It is too restrictive, does not
   cover trade secrets and know-how, production capacity, availability of
   raw materials, and even adds new limitations that did not exist before.
   The best option to promote the production of quality vaccines in
   low-income countries is to share technology and know-how on a voluntary
   basis through production agreements. One way to facilitate the
   cooperation of large pharmaceutical corporation is to make it easier for
   low-income countries to use compulsory licenses. Simplifying the use of
   this mechanism could help encourage pharmaceutical companies to enter
   into voluntary licensing agreements.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the transnational turn in the research of
   collective and cultural memory in the 21st century, reflecting the
   desire of scientists working within Memory studies to go beyond
   ``methodological nationalism{''} and explore the formation and
   circulation of historical memory across borders. Based on the
   English-language literature of the 2000s-2020s, the author analyzes the
   emerging field of Transnational Memory studies from the point of view of
   the categorical apparatus, disciplinary features and research
   approaches.Having documented that discussions about the transcultural
   dimension of collective memory are present even in the works of the
   classics of Memory studies, the author shows that the efforts of their
   modern critics are driven by the attempts to conceptualize the memory of
   the Holocaust, World War II, colonialism and other events of the
   ``difficult past{''}. The abundance of closely related concepts
   elaborated in recent years creates an illusion of competition in this
   field, but these concepts are often based on fundamentally different
   ideological and methodological settings, and if some of the concepts
   possess a certain empirical potential, others are completely
   normative.The author identifies six main research lenses within the
   current state of Transnational Memory studies - international,
   supranational, diasporic, mediatized, digital and, finally, global,
   associated with the problem of memory synchrony/simultaneity. At the
   same time, according to his conclusion, getting rid of the national
   perspective in understanding transnational memory is still far from
   complete, and the very fact that scientists look beyond borders
   indicates that such borders still exist.},

Abstract = {Created in the 1950s, the Kachovka Reservoir in south-eastern Ukraine is
   of considerable importance for the country's energy and agricultural
   sectors. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is cooled with
   water from the lake, along with a nearby coal-fired power plant produced
   almost 30 percent of the electricity generated in Ukraine before
   Russia's attack on the country. Since the 1960s, the reservoir has also
   enabled the construction of an extensive canal system that supplies
   millions of people with water and irrigates vast agricultural areas.
   Immediately after its February 2022 invasion, Russia reopened the North
   Crimean Canal, which was closed by Ukraine after the 2014 annexation of
   Crimea. Now, however, the occupying forces are draining water from the
   Kachovka reservoir in huge quantities. It is to be feared that, if
   forced to retreat, Russian troops will blow up the dam at Nova Kachovka.},

Abstract = {This text presents a contribution to the analysis of the possible rise
   of authoritarian regimes in the contemporary world. From the examination
   of Franz L. Neumanns book, ``Behemoth{''}, in dialogue with texts by
   Karl Lowenstein and Bruce Ackerman, all jurists, the text shows that the
   implementation of totalitarian regimes implies the collapse of the
   separation of powers by a concentration of power in the Executive. The
   implementation of totalitarian regimes therefore has a necessary
   legal-institutional component, in addition to economic, political,
   social, and psychological factors.},

Abstract = {The lives and struggles of political prisoners such as Chippewa Leonard
   Peltier and Palestinian-Arab Walid Duqqa accentuate the contradictions
   of how the very sovereignty and governance of settler-colonial nations
   rely on killability and carcerality as a state logic. Imprisoned by
   American and Israeli settler legal systems for expressed political
   resistance against their respective colonial regimes, the inhumane
   detention, medical malfeasance, legal improprieties, and basic violation
   of human rights of these two liberation militants illustrate important
   legal lessons that Natsu Saito and Noura Erakat teach us. If the
   imprisonment of Gaza itself since 2007 and the Apartheid system that
   divide Jerusalem and the West Bank into an archipelago of encircled
   enclaves shows us anything, it teaches us that carcerality and
   erasability (embedded in the logic of elimination) in the settler state
   extends beyond the prison system, to include other racialized and
   gendered systems of tions to this special issue indicate. The
   coloniality of power operationalized by the state's ideological
   structure and legal system, and the racialization of the colonized
   subject should always be questioned, as Angela Davis and her colleagues
   suggest in this special issue. Settler-colonial states do not only
   criminalize the repression of indigenous resistance to settler
   sovereignty. Rather, their own juridical systems formalize legal
   structures, processes and procedures (a whole system of governance that
   naturalizes settler sovereignty over indigenous peoples) that themselves
   violate international laws and conventions to which these states are
   signatories (Saito 2020; Erakat 2019). This special issue grew out of
   this},

Title = {INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE OF THE FIRST WAVE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND
   POLITICAL SUPPORT IN RUSSIA: EVIDENCE FROM THE VALUES IN CRISIS SURVEY},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2023},
Number = {4},
Pages = {152-167},
Abstract = {The article explores how the individual experience of the first wave of
   the COVID-19 pandemic affected the attitudes of Russians towards the
   country's political system. Specifically, we use data from an online
   survey conducted in mid-June 2020 as part of the international research
   project `Values in Crisis'. The sample size is 1,527 respondents. The
   sample is representative in terms of gender and, to a somewhat lesser
   extent, age (as per the Russian census of 2010), although low-educated
   respondents and rural residents are somewhat undersampled. The dependent
   variable of interest is a composite index of political support that
   consists of four indicators: individual confidence in (1) government,
   (2) healthcare sector, and (3) institutions in general, as well as (4)
   evaluation of the efficiency of governmental efforts in handling the
   coronacrisis. Regression analysis demonstrates that the negative
   economic experience (job loss, transition to part-time job, or
   bankruptcy) during the initial stages of the pandemic, as well as the
   direct experience of the disease, are very weakly, if at all, connected
   to the confidence in national institutions and approval of anti-pandemic
   policies. The fear to contract the virus, or that respondents' close
   ones would contract the virus, positively correlates with the level of
   political support. In its turn, anxiety about potential material losses
   is negatively associated with the index of support. Interestingly,
   COVID-19 sceptics, i.e. persons who do not view the coronavirus as a
   real threat or doubt its very existence, demonstrate systematically
   lower levels of political support. Yet, it remains unclear whether
   covid-skepticism causes institutional distrust or whether both variables
   simply reflect deeper hidden disappointment with the existing
   socio-political order.},

Abstract = {The scope of tax evasion is significant in Iceland. By reducing such
   economic crime, it is possible to increase public income considerably.
   The aim of the study was twofold. Firstly, to shed light on what might
   explain why some mem- bers of society are more likely to evade taxes
   than others. In that regard, a focus was put on both tax morale and
   personality traits. Secondly, the study seeks to answer which groups of
   taxpayers should be targeted to reduce tax evasion. With an electronic
   convenience sample, responses were obtained from 593 in- dividuals who
   answered a questionnaire measuring tax evasion, tax morale, and
   personality. The results revealed that tax morale has the strongest
   predictive value on whether people are likely to evade taxes.
   Furthermore, the personality traits of humility and honesty along with
   psychopathy are of considerable im- portance in this regard. The results
   of a cluster analysis showed that it is most optimal to divide taxpayers
   into three groups which were named the honorable citizens, the fickle
   citizens, and the cunning citizens. The honorable citizens are very
   unlikely to evade taxes and have high tax morale. It would therefore not
   be an efficient use of resources to focus on that group. The other two
   groups, the fickle and the cunning citizens, are groups that should be
   targeted. It is probably most feasible to prioritize strategies aimed at
   the fickle citizens, although the cunning citizens must also be
   considered. Different measures need to be used to target these groups,
   as is discussed in the paper.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how the level of subnational administra-tive state
   capacity, measured as the success of the implementation of the May 2012
   presidential decrees in the regions, affects the electoral support for
   the government. The research study focuses on the indicators that
   reflect the dy-namics of the salaries of public sector workers (doctors,
   teachers etc.), which are considered one of the electoral groups that
   the authorities count on. The results of the study show that in regions
   with higher salaries, pub-lic sector workers tend to vote more actively
   for the government. According to the author's conclusion, these findings
   not only demonstrate that a high level of subnational administrative
   state capacity has a positive effect on the loyalty of citizens, but
   also confirm the efficiency of a strategy of distributing mate-rial
   wealth for maintaining and strengthening stability of authoritarian
   states. At the same time, the study shows that salary manipulation as a
   tool to in-crease loyalty does not work in all cases, even when it comes
   to public sec-tor workers. The same applies to such indicators of
   socio-economic develop-ment as the level of urbanization and the value
   of GRP per capita, which are negatively correlated with pro-government
   voting. All this indicates that, along with economic considerations,
   other factors also influence electoral behavior, which requires further
   research.},

Abstract = {Russia's war against Ukraine has triggered geopolitical shifts
   throughout the post-Soviet space. No other country has been affected as
   much as Armenia. Azerbaijan is putting massive pressure on the Armenians
   who remain in Karabakh and on the Republic of Armenia. Russia, Armenia's
   guarantor of security, has been weakened and is looking for strong
   allies such as Turkey and Azerbaijan. The European Union has sent an
   observation mission, but its powers are limited. The West alone cannot
   protect the people of Nagorno-Karabakh from expulsion and Armenia from
   attack. Brussels and Moscow must leave the issue of Armenia out of their
   confrontation. A conversation with political scientist Narek Sukiasyan.},

Abstract = {The outbreak of full-scale war on the territory of Ukraine and the
   deterioration of the socio-economic situation have negatively affected
   all spheres of public life, including the formation of the part of the
   national budget. Therefore, the purpose of this publication was to
   determine areas for improvement of tax policy in Ukraine, identify
   problematic aspects and consequences of the impact of taxation on
   ensuring the functioning of the state, both during the period of martial
   law, and in the postwar period and its restoration. The authors of the
   article analyze the situation with the formation of tax policy and its
   implementation based on the systematic examination using dialectical,
   comparative and legal, statistical and other methods. Approaches to
   improve tax legislation in Ukraine are discussed. In addition, the need
   to bring the legislative framework in line with modern challenges,
   simplify tax procedures for taxpayers, reduce the level of tax burden on
   business entities, as well as the prospect of state support for
   investment projects to create favorable conditions, conditions for
   attracting significant investments to Ukraine aimed at creating new jobs
   and stimulating the economic development of the regions is substantiated},

Abstract = {The European Union and its Member States are currently facing an
   unprecedented migration phenomenon, a refugee crisis in Ukraine
   triggered by the Russian Federation's military invasion of Ukraine that
   began in February 2022. This ongoing military conflict has created the
   biggest humanitarian crisis in modern European history, resulting in
   many casualties and population movements outside Ukraine's borders.
   Although we believe that the institutions of the EuropeanUnion have
   previously managed a similar event, the Syrian refugee crisis, in an
   effective way, thecurrent refugee crisis, the second one in the last
   tenyears, showsthat international migration should be seen from the
   perspective of a threat to European security, quickly becoming one of
   the main issues,and certainly one of the most contested,in current
   times. The objective of our paper is to analyzethe relationship between
   migration and security and to examine the impact that the refugee crisis
   in Ukraine has on the dimensions of security in Romania},

Abstract = {After Taiwan opened a trade office in Vilnius in late 2021, China
   removed Lithuania from its customs system and pressured international
   companies to stop doing business with Lithuania. This is not the first
   conflict between Beijing and Vilnius. Lithuania's own experience with
   communist rule influences its view of China: Lithuanian politicians
   criticize the repression of national minorities and Beijing's right-wing
   nihilistic approach to Hong Kong. They see parallels between Russia and
   China and warn of the political and military threat that emanates from
   them. They are confirmed by China's de facto support for Russia's war of
   aggression against Ukraine. The Chinese ambassador to France recently
   denied the sovereignty of the Baltic states. Such statements reinforce
   the Lithuanians' critical attitude toward China.},

Abstract = {This article aims to study the relationship between fear and its role in
   the securitization process during the COVID-19 pandemic from the
   perspective of Thomas Hobbes' political philosophy. The securitization
   theory will be reinterpreted in light of Hobbes' understanding of fear
   to analyze how power was exercised during the initial phase of the
   pandemic. Thus, the article demonstrates the existence of different
   moments of fear and types of fear policies. Additionally, it seeks to
   clarify what kind of fear policy the securitization of the coronavirus
   pandemic entailed. To do so, it analyzes the securitization processes in
   several countries from different continents.},

Abstract = {This article identifies the foundations of Pope Francis' vision or
   position on the invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine and, at
   the same time, establishes its correspondence with the doctrinal
   principles of the Catholic Church. The methodology responds to the
   qualitative research approach, in this sense, theoretical and analytical
   tools were used and combined, such as: hermeneutics and documentary
   research techniques. We proceeded to an exhaustive analysis of all the
   Pope's public interventions during a period of one year from February
   24, 2022, and compared his position with the doctrinal position of the
   Catholic Church. It is concluded that the Pope's speech has been
   equivocal in some of its formulations, but doctrinally attached to the
   dictates of the Church.},

Title = {REGIONAL DIFFERENTIATION OF SELECTED STATES OF THE EASTERN WING OF THE
   EU AT THE NUTS 2 LEVEL IN RELATION TO RURAL REGIONS},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the current topic of regional disparities in the
   EU member states. The aim of the present study is to assess the regional
   disparities in the selected countries, as well as to identify the
   dynamics of the existing disparities in regional averages at the level
   of NUTS 2 statistical administrative units. The framework of the text is
   narrowed down to a regional analysis of seven selected countries of the
   EU's eastern wing (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania,
   Slovakia, Slovenia). The text also highlights the position of rural
   areas and their role in the regional balance of the countries. The
   methodological approach is grounded mainly in the analysis of the
   development of disparities based on the analysis of empirical
   statistical data for the period 2001 to 2021, as well as on the
   assessment of the main features and trends of regional differentiation.
   To test convergence, the results of the coefficient of variation of GDP
   per capita in PPP were compared. The research showed the existence of
   significant differences in the economic development of the regions and
   different convergence tendencies. According to the results obtained, the
   countries studied were divided into three groups. Bulgaria, Czech
   Republic, Romania and Slovakia recorded the fastest pace of internal
   balance, with the Czech Republic and Bulgaria showing the smallest
   regional differences at NUTS 2 level. The second group of countries is
   represented by Poland and Slovenia, which have seen minimal changes in
   internal differentiation, while both countries are the least internally
   diversified in the group of seven countries examined. Hungary was the
   only country with an increase in regional disparities in the period
   under review, while Slovakia was one of the countries with the largest
   internal differences between regions. There is scope for future research
   to continue to monitor the evolution of convergence, including the
   impact of recent trends.},

   Methods},
Journal = {STUDIES IN SOCIAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {222-240},
Abstract = {Carceral spaces such as prisons are designed to restrict freedoms and
   keep inhabitants confined and under surveillance through various
   mechanisms. As a result, prisons are spaces where movement is restricted
   through confinement, while prisoners' ability to move is conflated with
   freedom. We aim to move beyond this dichotomy and consider a complex
   rethinking of the body in criminological theory and practice through
   dance in carceral space. In doing so, we explore under what conditions
   movement represents agentic practices. Understanding these nuances
   requires an interrogation of prisoner agency, including prisoners'
   subtle maneuverability of power dynamics within the prison. We explore
   these dynamics using feminist and arts-based methods, specifically dance
   workshops delivered to twenty participants incarcerated in a Canadian
   provincial women's prison. We find that movement and expression in
   prison may create moments of agentic freedom for incarcerated women
   under certain conditions. We argue that more nuanced understandings of
   incarcerated women's agency can be found in their daily negotiations of
   time and space, and movement can provide numerous meanings. Our findings
   suggest arts-based approaches within prison environments create
   opportunities for women to express their identity and sexuality through
   movement in ways otherwise not permitted in prison. For many
   incarcerated women in this study, this sense of freedom may be
   associated with the ability to focus and take care of themselves while
   confined.},

Abstract = {The object of the research is the peculiarities of public administration
   of education and science in foreign countries, in particular, the
   experience of three European countries ranked in the top ten according
   to the results of the international survey PISA2018: Estonia, Finland
   and Poland. The main content is considered the experience of building a
   system of educational management on democratic basis, in cooperation
   between government bodies and society. It is determined that education
   in the studied countries is one of the priorities of the state and
   society. The methodological basis of the research consists of
   comparative legal and systemic analysis, formal legal method, method of
   interpretation, hermeneutic method and methods of analysis and
   synthesis. Similar approaches to administration and financing were
   identified in the conclusions. A trend characteristic of all countries
   is clarified: the state guarantees free education, including science,
   and at the same time ensures equal access to quality education and
   science. Also, the optimal mechanisms of economic support of education,
   science and the main sources of financing specific to each country were
   defined.},

Abstract = {For some years now, the significance of truth for politics has been
   intensely debated under the buzzword ``post-truth.{''} However, this
   cannot hide the fact that political theory and philosophy have
   systematically neglected the relationship between truth and politics
   throughout their history. This article intends to remedy this
   desideratum by differentiating the various modes in which truth is
   referred to and invoked in the political field. To this end, the main
   strands of the post-truth debate are reconstructed and their
   shortcomings are pointed out. Second, based on a contrasting reading of
   Habermas and Foucault, possible starting points for systematizing the
   relationship between truth and politics are discussed. Third, and as a
   prolegomenon to such a systematization, the article proposes a
   cartography of political truth forms and relations along five fault
   lines: truth as foundation and de-foundation, truth as coercion and
   freedom, truth as virtue and scandal, truth as secret and transparency,
   and truth as knowledge and practice.},

Title = {Was the 2019 Christchurch attack a black swan event? Understanding
   far-right violence in New Zealand},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 22},
Abstract = {On 15 March 2019, far-right actor Brenton Tarrant killed 51 people at
   the al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New
   Zealand. Media and politicians presented this event as an `end of
   innocence' for New Zealand, with many wondering how such an attack could
   occur in an extremely isolated and generally peaceful location. However,
   for a range of reasons, it is not immediately clear whether the
   Christchurch attack represented a black swan event, or is better
   understood as a spectacularly lethal version of a poorly documented
   phenomenon chronically occurring across the country. To understand the
   extent to which severe far-right violence is actually occurring within
   New Zealand, this article documents incidents both before, and
   immediately following the Christchurch attack. It identifies a chronic
   level of attacks motivated by far-right beliefs which, when considered
   on a per-capita basis, suggests that serious far-right violence may
   actually be more prevalent in New Zealand than other broadly comparable
   countries. Moving forward, it is crucial that New Zealand develop a
   comprehensive government-funded method to systematically monitor and
   respond to far-right attacks, and that this response is not designed
   solely through the narrow prism of a single, highly idiosyncratic event.},

Abstract = {The increasing number of Black LGBTQ candidates and elected officials
   suggests that voters are being asked to evaluate their candidacies more
   often. These scenarios raise the question about how voters-particularly
   white voters-respond to these candidates, including in non-partisan
   races such as primaries. In this study, we test how sharing information
   about a candidate's racial and sexual identity affects support from
   white and Black voters. Data come from an original online survey
   experiment conducted at 14 college campuses. We find that students use
   race and sexual orientation as vote-guiding heuristics, using
   stereotypes to fill in for knowledge gaps to try to make choices
   consistent with their partisan affiliations. We also find, contrary to
   concerns in some circles that openly-LGBTQ candidates are at an
   electoral disadvantage, that college students are more supportive of
   candidates that are identified as openly gay.},

Abstract = {Path dependence has become a multi-disciplinary concept, employed across
   various literatures to explain why the past matters for decision-making.
   Debate within `new institutionalist' scholarship has provided a detailed
   critique of the term over several decades. Some scholars argue that it
   is hampered by poor conceptual clarity and highlight its limitations in
   explaining institutional reform. Yet, this paper demonstrates how
   neglecting antecedent conditions and associated decision pathways is
   particularly inappropriate for politico-spatial issues like disaster
   risk and natural resource governance. Doing so risks omitting key
   material and perceptual contingencies influencing contemporary
   institutions. Examining southeast Queensland's flooding disaster of
   2011, the paper proposes that path contingency provides a useful
   theoretical bridge between institutionalist theories of stability and
   reform, and the geographic contexts within which disaster risk
   governance proceeds. The analysis then addresses the potential
   generalisability of path contingency beyond its application to disaster
   management, for consideration across a broader range of institutionalist
   research.},

Abstract = {Affective polarization (AP)-the tendency of political partisans to view
   their opponents as a stigmatized ``out group{''}-is now a major field of
   research. Relevant evidence in the United States derives primarily from
   a single source, the American National Election Studies (ANES) feeling
   thermometer time series. We investigate whether the design of the ANES
   produces overestimates of AP. We consider four mechanisms:
   overrepresentation of strong partisans, selection bias conditional on
   strong identification, priming effects of partisan content, and survey
   mode variation. Our analysis uses the first-ever collaboration between
   ANES and the General Social Survey and a novel experiment that
   manipulates the amount of political content in surveys. Our tests show
   that variation in survey mode has caused an artificial increase in the
   mixed-mode ANES time series, but the general increase in out-party
   animus is nonetheless real and not merely an artifact of selection bias
   or priming effects.},

Title = {How to Get Coal Country to Vote for Climate Policy: The Effect of a
   ``Just Transition Agreement{''} on Spanish Election Results},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {118},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1344-1359},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Enacting stringent climate policy has proven politically challenging,
   not least because of concentrated losses in fossil fuel-producing
   communities. ``Just transition{''} strategies have been proposed to
   mitigate this distributional challenge. Yet, little is known about how
   such strategies affect voting behavior. Using a mixed-methods approach,
   we exploit a local climate policy in Spain-a ``Just Transition
   Agreement{''} (JTA) to phase out coalmining, support affected workers,
   and invest in affected municipalities-which was negotiated by the
   incumbent Socialist Party (PSOE) government with affected unions and
   businesses shortly before a national election. A
   difference-in-differences study shows that PSOE's vote share in
   coalmining municipalities increased at the 2019 election relative to
   similar municipalities, implying that the JTA was electorally
   successful. Further statistical tests and elite interviews suggest that
   this electoral boost was driven by unions' support of the JTA. Our
   findings have implications for how parties can craft popular climate
   policy.},

Abstract = {After Hong Kong's handover in 1997, the development of its relations
   with Taiwan has been full of twists and turns. Formal and bureaucratic
   interactions have stifled the strategic ambiguity needed to utilise Hong
   Kong as a buffer for cross-strait tensions. The subtle interaction
   between Hong Kong and Taiwan, being leveraged to reduce tension and
   facilitate communication in the cross-strait conflict, has been weakened
   since the mid-2010s even though institutionalisation was enhanced. Thus,
   the future development of Hong Kong-Taiwan relations may seem even more
   pessimistic than cross-strait relations.},

Abstract = {Le present article confronte l'idee selon laquelle les ecoles privees

   enseignant.e.s et leurs eleves sur le fondement de leur religion ?),
   l'article etablit d'abord que la notion d'exemption qui reside au c oe
   ur des raisonnements theoriques sur la non-discrimination est trop vaste
   et merite d'etre deconstruite et affinee. La comparaison entre le regime
   juridique des ecoles confessionnelles aux Etats-unis et en France permet
   ensuite d'analyser le premier modele comme separatiste (les ecoles
   confessionnelles sont situees dans une sphere distincte, separee de
   celle qui est gouvernee par les normes d'egalite et de
   non-discrimination) et le second, comme accommodationiste (nombre de
   principes constitutionnels generaux, a commencer par le principe de
   laicite, sont adaptes pour accommoder la specificite des ecoles
   confessionnelles). Ce faisant, l'article affirme la pertinence des
   ecoles confessionnelles comme point d'observation et d'analyse de la
   neutralite religieuse de l'Etat.},

Abstract = {Scholars recognize the important role that diasporas play in conflict
   dynamics, including efforts to build peace in conflict-affected
   communities. Broader academic research emphasizes a focus on local
   conditions and actors, as well as site-specific understandings of peace
   and peacebuilding practices. This focus on specific communities and
   contexts often draws on qualitative, narrative-driven data,
   predominantly collected through interviewing. This article identifies
   some of the core challenges related to data collection encountered
   during semi-structured interviews in a study of Somali diaspora members
   in Melbourne, Australia. We emphasize how issues associated with
   cross-cultural and gendered understandings of concepts related to
   peacebuilding can affect each stage of a research project, from the
   preliminary collection of data to the analysis and discussion of
   research implications. Specifically, we address challenges related to
   instances of conceptual dissonance that occur when researchers employ
   cross-cultural and gendered concepts-in this case, peace, peacebuilding,
   and leadership. The findings will benefit conflict researchers who work
   with socially distant groups and ethnically divided populations more
   broadly, along with those who employ interpretivist methodologies that
   focus on how meaning making might ultimately influence peacebuilding
   practices and outcomes.},

Abstract = {In this article, I shall contend that Rawlsian public reason liberalism
   (PRL) is in tension with non-anthropocentric environmentalism. I will
   argue that many reasonable citizens reject non-anthropocentric values,
   and PRL cannot allow them to be used as the justification for ecological
   policies. I will analyse attempts to argue that PRL can incorporate
   non-anthropocentric ideas. I shall consider the view, deployed by
   theorists such as Derek Bell and Mark A. Michael, that PRL can make a
   distinction between constitutional essentials and non-essentials, and
   therefore ecocentric values can be employed when only non-essentials are
   at stake. I will also consider Simon Hailwood's argument that PRL can
   incorporate concern for nature based on its `otherness'. I shall
   conclude that both positions fail to rebut the claim that PRL excludes
   non-anthropocentric viewpoints. I will consider the question of whether
   PRL's exclusion of non-anthropocentric ethics is a problem, and I shall
   show that appealing to purely anthropocentric arguments leads to a
   variety of unpalatable conclusions. I will suggest that comprehensive
   liberalism can include non-anthropocentric concerns, and hence is
   superior from an environmental perspective.},

Abstract = {This article chronicles and analyzes the changing state of party
   affiliation in the American South from the 1990s to the present. Party
   identification (PID) is examined with data from three survey sources:
   the American National Election Study (ANES), Cooperative Election Study
   (CES), and Exit Polls (national and state-level). Emphasis is placed on
   the changing PID patterns of white, Black, and Hispanic voters
   South-wide and in individual states. The findings strongly suggest that
   the current position of Republican electoral dominance will persist for
   some time to come, though there are multiple reasons why, in certain
   parts of the South, Democratic affiliation will likely increase.},

Abstract = {Recent research has identified a strong correlation between polarization
   and democratic backsliding. The creation of antithetical groups in
   society is a necessary element in this type of autocratization process.
   Nevertheless, the agency-driven mechanisms through which elite
   polarization becomes harmful for democracy have been less explored in
   the literature. By resorting to process tracing methodology, the article
   analyses how elite polarization contributed to derailing the
   democratization process in Tunisia. The article identifies three
   necessary mechanisms through which elite polarization became a risk for
   democracy: politicization reinforcing pre-existing party cleavages;
   exclusion politics based on ontological contestation ({''}either us or
   them{''}); and the systematic delegitimization of democratic
   institutions and processes. In Tunisia, Parti Destourien Libre's (PDL)
   political campaign followed these steps creating the context in which
   President Saied could start a democratic backsliding process.},

Abstract = {Frequent observations about the lack of historical work in terrorism
   studies pose questions about history's place - and its relevance even -
   in the field. Why have historians largely failed to engage with
   terrorism studies? And why have terrorism studies scholars generally
   failed to engage with history? This article suggests that the dominance
   of social scientific research methods, the quest for ``rules{''} and
   models, and the prizing of quantitative data in terrorism studies,
   combined with historians' own reluctance to foreground the contemporary
   relevance of their work, have led to the underrepresentation of history.
   It calls on historians to demonstrate the value of qualitative research
   methods to notions of contemporary terrorist violence using a ``cultures
   of terrorism{''} approach in the context of Critical Terrorism Studies.},

Abstract = {A major concern in religiously divided societies, is identity formation,
   as the different communities in such societies aim to pass their
   religion and culture on to the next generation. Research looking at the
   socialization function of education shows that history education plays a
   significant role in identity formation. For instance, {[}Korostelina, K.
   V. (2013). History Education in the Formation of Social Identity: Toward
   a Culture of Peace. Palgrave Macmillan] identifies three conceptions of
   national identity, an ethnic, a multicultural, and a civic one, and
   argues that these can be shaped through history education. Linking this
   back to divided societies, existing research shows that communities
   generally promote an ethnic or a civic identity through history
   education, but not a multicultural one. Lebanon is an example of a
   religiously divided society where the school system, which is mainly
   composed of private schools, is divided along sectarian lines. We draw
   on Korostelina's model to develop our own analytic framework, which we
   subsequently use to analyze history textbooks used in different Lebanese
   religious schools. We find that these textbooks generally promote
   sectarian identities corresponding to the three main religious
   communities, despite recent attempts to promote a civic identity in some
   Christian and Sunni private schools.},

Abstract = {Several countries recruit foreign nationals into their armed forces.
   This is despite the norm of citizen armies and the strong idea that
   individuals join the military to defend their home country while
   military service socializes them into good citizens. We argue that
   foreign recruits can have very specific benefits for some authoritarian
   governments. Because they lack strong links to society, their loyalties
   lie with whoever recruited and pays them, not the nation, country, or
   its citizens. As such, we argue, first, that their recruitment is
   especially attractive for personalistic rulers. Second, we propose that
   foreigners' presence in the armed forces stymies these forces' ability
   to carry out coup attempts and deters the occurrence of mass uprisings
   by signalling the security forces' willingness to respond with violent
   repression. Empirical tests for the period 1946-2010 support these
   arguments. This research expands our understanding of legionnaire
   recruitment, civil-military relations, and comparative authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {Ministers may be powerful policy initiators, but they are not equally
   powerful. Cabinet control mechanisms have become a crucial part of
   cabinet governance, which can serve to contain agency loss and
   consequently constrain ministers in the policymaking process. However,
   empirical studies have not focused on the impact of such control
   mechanisms on individual ministers' political outcomes. I turn attention
   to certain cabinet committees as intra-cabinet control mechanisms and
   argue that members of these enjoy a policymaking advantage compared to
   nonmembers. Analyzing ministers' number of laws proposed to parliament
   in Denmark from 1975 to 2022, I look beyond parties as unitary actors
   and provide evidence for this causal relationship. Membership of the
   Economic Committee increases ministers' legislative activity. Thus, even
   within parties in cabinet, ministers have unequal possibilities to act
   as policy-seeking. These findings offer new insights into political
   parties in governments, cabinet governance, policymaking, and
   legislative processes.},

Abstract = {The `Big Lie' in American politics has sparked intense concern about the
   erosion of public confidence in the integrity of US elections-raising
   questions about the legitimacy of the authorities, institutions, and
   principles of democratic governance. Cynicism generated from
   misinformation about trustworthy elections has attracted a growing body
   of individual-level social-psychological research in America and Europe.
   Another common problem found around the world, however, which has
   received far less attention, concerns credulous citizens who express
   considerable faith and confidence in flawed contests. This study
   theorises that at macro-level, the accuracy of any public judgments
   about trustworthy elections is likely to be mediated by the information
   environment in open and closed societies, as well as by the type of
   regime. To understand these issues, Part I summarises the conceptual and
   theoretical argument about trust and trustworthiness. Part II describes
   the sources of evidence. To apply the theory, data on public opinion is
   drawn from around 85 societies around the globe included in Waves 6 and
   7 of the World Values Survey (2010-2022), with measures of electoral
   trust and subjective perceptions of electoral integrity among ordinary
   citizens. Institutional electoral performance indices are drawn from the
   Varieties of Democracy project (V-Dem 12.0). Part III analyses how far
   these independent estimates match public judgments of the
   trustworthiness of elections in each country - and how far such
   relationships are conditioned by the type of information society as well
   as by the type of regime. Part IV highlights the key findings and
   considers their broader implications for understanding the macro-level
   conditions for trust and trustworthiness.},

Title = {Do text messages increase voter registration? Evidence from RCTs with a
   local authority and an advocacy organisation in the UK},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, text messages have become an
   increasingly attractive tool of voter registration. At the same time, in
   countries without automated registration, advocacy organisations play a
   more prominent role in supplementing the efforts of official bodies in
   registering voters. However, most available, robust evidence on whether
   voter registration campaigns work is based on campaigns conducted by
   official bodies charged with electoral registration. We present the
   results of two RCTs that aimed to increase voter registration in the UK
   using SMS-text messages, relying mainly on behavioural messaging. One
   was conducted by a local authority, while the other was implemented by
   an issue advocacy organisation that had no prior involvement in voter
   registration. In line with previous findings, the local authority's text
   messages resulted in an increased registration rate of eight
   percentage-points, which translates into a three percentage-point
   increase in voter turnout. However, the advocacy organisation's text
   messages neither increased voter registration, nor turnout, no matter
   whether the text message offered a personal follow-up conversation, or
   not. Given that many voter registration campaigns are run by advocacy
   organisations and text messages are an increasingly important
   mobilisation tool, this raises questions about the scope conditions of
   existing findings.},

Abstract = {The paper studies the territorial dimension of legislative activity,
   considering the bills presented by the Argentine Diputados Chamber in
   2020 and 2021 in seventeen committees. A quantitative analysis
   identifies and classifies territorial bills: the ones concerning issues
   that affect a given district in particular. We show there are different
   types of territorial bills in addition to the well-known ``local
   interest{''} declarations, such as the ``national capitals{''} claiming.
   Regarding the elements that influence territorial bills' magnitude and
   type, we show the role of legislative committees and mainly the
   incidence of legislators' political position at subnational and national
   level - in a Congress crossed by multilevel politics-. The exceptional
   period of the covid19 pandemic highlights and illustrates our findings.},

Title = {A compromising mindset? How citizens evaluate the trade-offs in
   coalition politics},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {63},

Abstract = {Coalition building depends on citizens having a `compromising mindset':
   they must accept that parties need to compromise in order to gain
   influence and that this entails deviating from the original policy
   positions. In this study, we show that European citizens understand that
   compromise is essential for democratic governance and that they, holding
   everything else constant, prefer political parties that express a
   willingness to compromise. This finding appears to be independent from
   specific forms of coalition politics and to be widespread across
   different levels of political interest, formal education and even
   ideological extremity. Our analysis compares observational data from the
   Austrian National Election Survey (AUTNES) 2020 and an original survey
   from Denmark in 2021. We also present results from a conjoint experiment
   fielded in Denmark, which evaluates the effect of willingness to
   compromise on vote choice. Our finding is good news for European
   democracies where coalition politics and thus compromise is a necessity
   for governance. Yet, for vote-seeking politics, the situation is complex
   as citizens might sometimes punish parties for compromising, but
   sometimes also punish them for not compromising.},

Abstract = {Are U.S. legislators responsive to public opinion on trade? Despite the
   prevalence of preference-based approaches to international trade, not
   much work has directly assessed the relationship between constituency
   opinion and positioning by members of Congress on trade bills. We assess
   dynamic responsiveness (whether shifting constituency opinion on trade
   yields corresponding changes among legislators) by exploiting an
   original dataset on the positions of members of Congress on the North
   American Free Trade Agreement at various points leading up to the
   November 1993 roll-call vote. We find no evidence of dynamic
   re-sponsiveness to shifting constituency opinion on even a highly
   salient piece of trade legislation. We provide qualitative evidence that
   interest group influence may instead be the predominant source of
   shifting legislator positioning on trade.},

Abstract = {Regime transitions raise expectations of policy change. However, such
   changes do not always take place and the empirical evidence linking
   regime type and policy is not conclusive. To better understand the
   heterogeneous effect that regime transitions have on policy, this work
   presents a historical comparative analysis of the role played by
   legislatures in the space for contestation over policy before and after
   the 1980s democratization processes in Argentina and Brazil. It shows
   the relevance of such legislatures across regime types and how the
   changes in their roles with the expansion of the space for contestation
   affected the likelihood and type of policy change in policies with
   different levels of visibility.},

Abstract = {While there is disagreement over the value of public shaming, scholars
   largely agree that social media introduce pathologies. But while
   scholars rightly identify the effects of online public shaming (OPS),
   they misidentify the cause. Rather than solely a problem of scale, OPS's
   effects are also shaped by the network structure within which they take
   place. In this article, I argue that the social conditions necessary for
   productive public shaming are more likely to obtain in a closed social
   network structure. Using the cases of Twitter, Wikipedia, and Reddit, I
   show how the design of social media platforms facilitates different
   network structures among users, with differing results for OPS. In
   evaluating OPS by way of network structure, I argue, we can not only
   better understand why OPS works productively in some cases and not in
   others, but also derive lessons for how to deploy, discuss, and respond
   to it more effectively.},

Abstract = {Researchers frequently rely on expert surveys to acquire information
   about political ideology and political parties, which they then use to
   explore a range of political phenomena such as proximity voting and
   satisfaction with democracy. Yet it is unclear whether experts and
   citizens place the parties similarly, which may have important
   implications for studies that rely on expert data. To what extent do
   citizens share expert views regarding political party placements? Using
   original data from Canada, we use multidimensional scaling techniques to
   examine and compare the responses of academic and journalist experts
   against a random sample of Canadians to a range of party placement
   questions. Our results suggest there is considerable variation between
   citizens and experts, and among specific subgroups of the general
   population. These findings have important implications for studies of
   party competition, voting behavior, and government responsiveness.},

Abstract = {As the political salience of immigrant-origin minorities continues to
   increase in the United States and Europe, researchers are increasingly
   focused on understanding what interventions reduce exclusionary
   attitudes. While several recent studies have examined the effect of
   different narrative and interpersonal communication techniques, few have
   focused on the role of the ``messenger{''} that delivers these
   techniques. Drawing from psychological research on persuasion, we
   hypothesize that anti-exclusionary messages are more persuasive when
   delivered by elite messengers who reinforce shared identities. To test
   this, we conduct a large, pre-registered survey experiment exposing a
   sample of American adults to audio messages on immigration from
   persuasive elites performed by professional voice actors. We find that a
   persuasive message only shifts attitudes about immigration when elites
   include co-identity reinforcement primes. These findings offer
   additional nuance to the literature on immigration attitudes,
   persuasion, and elite-led public opinion, and have important
   implications for immigration advocacy work.},

Abstract = {This article provides a content analysis of Nicola Sturgeon's first
   ministerial diaries in the final two years of her leadership (April
   2021-March 2023). As first minister, to whom and what did she give her
   time-which issues and interest groups had access? Which didn't? Or, who
   and what may be missing? An audience with a national leader can be
   indicative of priorities and potential for influence-as can its absence.
   The lens of chronopolitics-the politics of time-is used here to consider
   twenty-four months of diaries, with 681 entries. Some key social and
   political issues in Scotland were kept away from the FM's meetings and
   delegated to other ministers to oversee, whereas other issues appear to
   be signature priorities, including climate and the environment, economy
   and finance, culture, and health and Covid-19.},

Title = {Messages Designed to Increase Perceived Electoral Closeness Increase
   Turnout},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {11-22},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The decision-theoretic Downsian model and other related accounts predict
   that increasing perceptions of election closeness will increase turnout.
   Does this prediction hold? Past observational and experimental tests
   raise generalizability and credible inference issues. Prior field
   experiments either (1) compare messages emphasizing election closeness
   to non-closeness messages, potentially conflating changes in closeness
   perceptions with framing effects of the voter encouragement message, or
   (2) deliver information about a particular race's closeness, potentially
   altering beliefs about the features of that election apart from its
   closeness. We address the limitations of prior work in a large-scale
   field experiment conducted in seven states and find that a telephone
   message describing a class of contests as decided by fewer, as opposed
   to more, votes increases voter turnout. Furthermore, this effect exceeds
   that of a standard election reminder. The results imply expected
   electoral closeness affects turnout and that perceptions of closeness
   can be altered to increase participation.},

Abstract = {The role of the president varies between political systems, and so does
   public opinion on presidents. One of the most evident factors
   distinguishing presidents in different systems is the constitutional
   strength of the presidency, which should impact how presidents are
   perceived by the people. Public opinion on presidents has mainly been
   studied in the context of classical presidential regimes such as the USA
   and Latin American countries, and we lack systematic empirical research
   on presidential popularity in other regime types and in the context of
   the presidents' constitutional powers. This article addresses this
   research gap by analysing whether the level of presidential powers
   explain variation in presidential popularity across different
   constitutional settings. Drawing on public opinion surveys and relevant
   contextual data from 15 countries, the results show that a higher level
   of presidential popularity is associated with weaker presidency and that
   the impact of the economy and electoral cycle is conditioned by the
   level of presidential powers.},

Abstract = {We introduce the special issue and provide an extensive review of the
   career patterns of politicians in twenty-seven multi-level countries
   worldwide, the largest number ever analyzed. Based on the wider evidence
   we provide a new synthesis and explanation of those patterns. While
   supporting previous claims on some of those factors our analysis shows
   that political, party, and electoral system features provide the
   strongest explanations for divergence in the development of career
   movement patterns in multi-level systems worldwide. We also introduce a
   set of novel factors, most notably, the existence of a dominant party,
   power-sharing agreements, and asymmetrical federal design. We discuss
   the theoretical and practical implications of our research and identify
   new avenues of research on political careers and comparative federalism.},

Abstract = {Parties and party systems are treated as separate phenomena in theory,
   but not in research practice. This is most clearly so in the literature
   on the institutionalization of party politics, where the party level and
   the systemic levels are often analyzed through combined fuzzy indices.
   We 1) propose separate indicators for measuring institutionalization at
   the party and at the party system level, 2) demonstrate their different
   dynamics in twentieth and twenty-first century European countries, and
   3) investigate the direction of causality. Using a dataset that covers
   more than 700 elections, 800 parties, and 1,400 instances of government
   formation in 60 different historical party systems across 45 European
   countries, we find that party-level institutionalization tends to
   precede systemic institutionalization. The opposite pattern occurs only
   in a few countries.},

Title = {Fracking Twitter: Utilizing machine learning and natural language
   processing tools for identifying coalition and causal narratives},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {51},

Abstract = {The Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) has provided policy scholars with a
   valuable method to gain empirical insight into the power of narratives
   in the policy process. However, a significant limitation of the NPF has
   been its ability to deploy this framework on large N datasets due to the
   labor-intensive nature of collecting narrative data. In recent years,
   NPF scholars have turned to computational social science tools to
   address this challenge. This study builds upon this emerging body of
   literature and our previous work, which uses sentiment analysis, a
   natural language processing technique, to evaluate the use of the
   angel/devil shift across coalitions before and after a major policy
   change. We examined Tweets that included the terms ``fracking{''} and
   ``New York{''} before and after the introduction of a moratorium. While
   sentiment analysis allowed us to gain insight into the narrative
   structure of the fracking policy discourse space, the labor involved in
   hand-coding Twitter users into neutral-, pro-, or anti-fracking groups
   was onerous. This project aims to supplement our natural language
   processing method by employing supervised machine learning techniques to
   increase the universe of respondents. We hand-coded 500 Twitter users
   into neutral-, pro-, or anti-fracking groups and trained a much larger
   dataset using an extreme gradient boost algorithm to classify a broader
   corpus of Tweets. This enabled us to expand the number of Tweets used in
   the analyses. We then applied sentiment analysis on this newly
   classified larger dataset to reveal differences in the pro-fracking and
   anti-fracking advocacy coalitions. By using machine learning to classify
   pro and con Tweets, we gained the ability to achieve significantly
   greater insight into how these two subgroups employed different
   narrative and linguistic devices in their Twitter discussions about
   fracking.},

Abstract = {Scholars in genocide studies have covered much ground in identifying
   causes and consequences of genocides. But much less has been done in the
   area of genocide recognitions: Why have countries recognized some
   genocides but not others? Strategic and economic relations with
   perpetrator states, or the influence of diasporan ethnic minorities are
   often assumed as causes, but we propose that conceptions of national
   identity may underlie these other factors. We explore a case that other
   factors do not readily explain: Given New Zealand's previous bold
   stances on human rights, its strong self-identity as a human rights
   supporter, its recognition of some genocides, and its active and
   vociferous support of Armenians before, during and after the genocide,
   why does it refuse to recognize the Armenian genocide? We explore New
   Zealand's reversal of attitudes by analyzing its public and official
   discourse in three time periods - first at the time of the Armenian
   genocide; second, in the late twentieth century when new narratives of
   national identity, enthusiasm for trade relations with Turkey, and the
   Anzac myth were established, and third, in the contemporary era, in
   which successive governments continue to refuse recognition. While we
   think the anticipated closer economic relations with Turkey during the
   second timeframe helped drive the shift, we theorize that New Zealand's
   current refusal to recognize the genocide is grounded in the
   construction of its national identity during the second period -
   particularly in the establishment of the Anzac myth. This involved a
   changing portrayal of ``the Turks{''} from enemy to fellow victims of
   the evils of war and imperial invasion, and modern-day Turkey as the
   sacred ``home{''} of New Zealand's war dead.},

Abstract = {Ever since ETA declared that it would no longer carry out acts of
   violence, the Basque Country has been involved in a peace process. As
   part of this process, the Basque government has promoted - through its
   Adi-adian Educational Module - the experience of listening to victims'
   testimonies in order to inform young persons about an important chapter
   of our recent history. Reflecting an awareness of the importance of
   addressing socially relevant topics, the University of the Basque
   Country (UPV/EHU) began to implement the Adi-adian model in a number of
   its bachelor's and master's degrees in teacher training. With a view
   towards improving the implementation of Adi-adian, a
   statistical-descriptive study was carried out with a quantitative
   methodological approach. Using a 25-item questionnaire, the purpose was
   to measure knowledge of recent historical events, determine the sources
   of information concerning those events, and gauge the satisfaction of
   participants as regards the information that they have received about
   the violent episodes of their recent history. The statistical analysis
   of the data obtained in this study was conducted using the SPSS
   Statistics 27 software. Generally speaking, the participating students
   were found to possess an average to low knowledge of the events that
   took place during the recent history of the Basque Country. As for the
   sources of information cited, the family, the media and the school are
   the most frequently mentioned, while respondents express a generalised
   dissatisfaction with the information received in this regard.},

Abstract = {Illiberalism emphasizes traditional values and national sovereignty over
   liberal democratic ideals, which can lead to the erosion of democratic
   norms and institutions. Against this background, the paper investigates
   the relationship between illiberalism and various political and social
   factors in Romania, taking into account a particular context (the
   Russian invasion in Ukraine). Romania has experienced a rise in
   illiberal attitudes and the spread of populist and nationalist rhetoric,
   which is particularly concerning given its strategic location as a
   member of the European Union and NATO, and its proximity to the ongoing
   conflict in Ukraine. This study aims to investigate the associations
   between various attitudes, news consumption habits, and perceived
   exposure to misinformation, and how these factors relate to levels of
   illiberalism in Romanian society. Given the increasing prominence of
   illiberal and populist ideologies globally, a nuanced understanding of
   these relationships is critical. The study employs a quantitative
   approach, leveraging an online survey to collect data from a sample of
   1000 Romanian citizens. Soft quotas were used to ensure a diverse
   representation across age, gender, and education levels. Data collection
   was carried out by Dynata, a globally recognized market research firm,
   between March 1-9, 2022. Our analysis, informed by multiple regression
   models, uncovers complex relationships between trust in institutions,
   attitudes towards Russia and Ukraine, news consumption habits, perceived
   misinformation, and demographic factors in shaping illiberal
   perspectives. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the
   contributing factors, this study aims to inform public discourse and
   policy-making processes on how to address illiberal tendencies in
   society.},

Title = {Do Indirect Taxes Bite? How Hiding Taxes Erases Accountability Demands
   from Citizens},

Abstract = {Taxation is fundamental to citizen-government relations. Seminal
   accounts attribute democratization to direct taxation's rise, and recent
   evidence shows that direct taxes increase citizens' accountability
   demands. However, today many governments rely heavily on indirect taxes;
   evidence is mixed on whether they have similar effects. We present
   cross-national data demonstrating that indirect taxes are associated
   with lower levels of government accountability than direct taxes. We
   argue that the visibility of taxes affects their accountability
   consequences. We further posit that, on average, indirect taxes become
   less visible than direct once citizens have acclimated to higher prices.
   We combine lab-in-the-field experiments with survey experiments in a
   developing country to demonstrate that less visible taxes provoke less
   willingness to punish leaders politically and that established indirect
   taxes are not highly visible to citizens. The findings suggest that the
   growing reliance on indirect taxes may limit taxation's accountability
   dividends and impair democratic representation.},

Abstract = {How is the growth and institutionalization of political parties shaped
   by access to public office? In this article, I analyze a natural
   experiment from Mexico, in which a political party used a lottery system
   to select candidates for national public office, and present new
   insights into how access to elected office shapes the development of new
   parties. I find that the party was able to build local party networks by
   gaining access to office (through elected legislators) that subsequently
   mobilized new voters for the party. I show that the party was able to
   institutionalize more successfully and increase its membership base in
   localities that randomly received access to public office through an
   elected legislator from the same locality. The findings highlight the
   importance of access to state resources for the success of new parties
   and have important implications for debates about democratic
   representation and accountability.},

Abstract = {As the political and social challenges facing the world multiply, the
   discipline of political science requires better tools and creative
   approaches advanced by a more diverse set of researchers. Yet the
   discipline has struggled to recruit and admit to graduate programs, and
   retain as faculty, women and underrepresented minorities. Many
   individual faculty, departments, and universities have developed
   innovative programs and sought to create structural changes to address
   these gaps. This article presents the approach taken by the Department
   of Government at Georgetown University: launching a week-long Political
   Science Predoctoral Summer Institute in 2022. We describe the
   Institute's contours and structure, provide preliminary data on
   outcomes, and conclude by offering three ideas for expanding and
   advancing these types of initiatives across the discipline.},

Title = {Individuals' responsibilities to remove carbon},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 22},
Abstract = {The potential upscaling of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies to
   meet states' net-zero targets may enable individuals to remove emissions
   by purchasing carbon removal certificates. In this paper, I argue for
   two concepts of individual responsibility to capture the moral
   responsibility of individuals to remove carbon dioxide from the
   atmosphere through CDR technologies. The first is that of liability, a
   direct responsibility to remove carbon in order to minimize one's carbon
   footprint. The second is a shared political responsibility to remove
   carbon that individuals have by virtue of being part of weak collectives
   responsible for mitigating climate change or by virtue of participating
   in structures that contribute to climate change. I argue that the
   concept of shared political responsibility can be used to determine how
   CDR technologies should or should not be implemented. Finally, I discuss
   how these two responsibilities are related.},

Title = {`Violent protests' in South Africa: understanding service delivery
   protests},
Journal = {POLITIKON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Pages = {242-253},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Violence is a crucial feature associated with service delivery protests
   in South Africa. The media and scholars have often referred to the
   rising violence trend in service delivery protests. However, the
   definition of violent protests is too broad; it fails to paint a correct
   picture of the violence. Previously, the general tendency was to
   classify these protests as either peaceful or violent - a simple
   dichotomy. Therefore, scholars have developed the 3-way formulation of
   protests as `orderly', `disruptive' and `violent'. Although the
   three-way formulation is the best so far, it conflates damage to
   property and injury to people as `violent protests'. Damage to property,
   however bad, should not be bracketed together with injury to people.
   Drawing on qualitative data from low-income communities in Cape Town,
   South Africa, I consider deliberately vandalising property as
   `vandalistic' protests and attacks on persons as `violent' protests.
   Building on the three-fold formulation of service delivery protests, I
   introduce a new category - the vandalistic protests. I, therefore, argue
   for a fourfold formulation of protests as `orderly', `disruptive',
   vandalistic and `violent', which is often the normal order protests
   evolve. This analysis highlights the need for authorities to swiftly
   address communities' grievances to avoid more radical protest tactics.},

Abstract = {Scholars often analyse the Nigerian political economy from class,
   ethnic, regional, and other analytic perspectives. Racial capitalism is
   rarely employed to analyse the Nigerian political economy and the
   endemic identity crises that always lead to hatred, tension, and violent
   conflicts. Environmental pollution is often not accidental, but
   deliberate environmental and economic sabotage. This paper sees it as a
   dimension of environmental racism. Identity manipulation and the crises
   accompanying it are normal functioning of racial capitalism.},

Abstract = {Vladimir Putin's populism is much contested. There are three research
   questions. The first is empirical: is Putin a populist, and on what
   grounds? The second is methodological: can comparative measuring
   techniques help analyse the presence of populism? The third is
   theoretical: what (if anything) does the case of this `populist icon'
   tell us about the populist phenomenon? Four domains of Putin's politics
   are analysed: Russia's support for international populists, Putin's
   leadership style, and his leadership `strategy'; finally, content
   analysis is utilized for an in-depth look at the articulation of ideas
   in Putin's principal speeches from 1999 to 2023. Putin is not
   substantively a populist, since the state (not the people) is his
   central political subject and his `populism' reinforces centralized
   state authority. Ideationally, he is demotic (people-centrist), but also
   fundamentally statist, which vitiates this people-centrism. Some
   populist themes are used instrumentally in foreign policy, but even here
   the statist impulse predominates. Methodologically, the content analysis
   works well at showing the limited articulation of populist themes
   relative to demotic ones. Theoretically, this study is fully consonant
   with recent movements in populist studies to provide complexity-oriented
   accounts which avoid reifying and over-emphasizing populism.},

Abstract = {The main aim of this study is to investigate how political strategies
   (issue ownership, issue trespassing, and issue extremeness) and
   communication styles (responsiveness and mobilization) affect political
   candidates' ability to trigger other users' engagement (in terms of
   likes and retweets) as well as traditional media attention (in terms of
   news articles and of the proportion of media-related followers).
   Theoretically, the study links these strategies and communication styles
   within the framework of a single research and to expand these concepts
   to the social media realm. To do so, we rely on Swiss political
   candidates' tweets over the course of the 2019 national election
   campaign while also integrating newspaper articles about these
   candidates. Combining political strategies with different styles of
   communication within the framework of a single study enables us to
   better understand the dynamics of public and media attention within
   political communication. Findings demonstrate a certain dose of media
   interconnection and highlight the specificities of Twitter in terms of
   communicative behaviors from media-related accounts and how they compare
   to offline media coverage. Practically, the study highlights what are
   best communication practices for political actors, especially which
   strategies and communications styles are more likely to generate other
   users' engagement and media attention.},

Abstract = {Slavery has long been seen as central to the debates in the Federal
   Convention of 1787. Yet scholarship on the ratification debates has
   generally concluded that slavery was an issue of secondary or localized
   importance. This article explores the role of slavery in the
   ratification debate from the vantage point of James Madison and finds
   that the Convention's infamous bargain on slavery in late August played
   a larger role than has been recognized in influencing Madison's
   ratification-era activities. Confusion, animosity, and sectional
   suspicions sparked by a proposal from the Committee of Detail were
   escaping from behind the curtains of the Philadelphia Convention. This
   prompted Madison, in his second phase of contributions to The Federalist
   beginning with no. 37, to begin a complex defense of the reputation of
   the Convention against rumors of a sectional bargain on slavery that he
   would later remember as ``dishonorable to the American character.{''}},

Abstract = {Minority cabinets constitute approximately one third of all governments
   in established parliamentary democracies internationally. Notably, the
   past two decades have seen a marked rise in the prevalence of minority
   governments. In Germany, minority cabinets are often met with skepticism
   and typically regarded as a contingency measure for exceptional
   circumstances. In contrast, they are standard practice in the
   governmental systems of Scandinavia and New Zealand. This literature
   review outlines the current status of both national and international
   research on governing under minority cabinets. Initially, it defines
   minority governments and identifies where they are commonly established.
   The review then illuminates the strategic considerations of political
   parties, detailing why tolerating a minority government can be more
   advantageous than participating in the cabinet. It further explains the
   institutional and situational conditions that tend to favor the
   formation of minority governments and explores various strategies
   through which minority governments secure parliamentary majorities to
   advance their legislative agendas. Ultimately, the review assesses the
   performance of minority governments, highlighting not only the potential
   drawbacks but also the manifold normative benefits.},

Abstract = {Survey experiments that investigate how voting procedures affect voting
   behavior and election outcomes use hypothetical questions and
   non-representative samples. We present here the results of a novel
   survey experiment that addresses both concerns. First, the winning party
   in our experiment receives a donation to its campaign funds inducing
   real consequences for voting. Second, we run an online experiment with a
   Dutch national representative sample (N = 1240). Our results validate
   previous findings using a representative sample, in particular that
   approval voting leads to a higher concentration in votes for smaller
   parties and strengthens centrist parties in comparison to plurality
   voting. Importantly, our results suggest that voting behavior is not
   affected by voting incentives and can be equally reliably elicited with
   hypothetical questions.},

Abstract = {The ubiquity of experts in contemporary policy-making has been met with
   enthusiasm in some quarters, but has also faced severe criticism. Beyond
   the democratic concerns regarding expert power, critics have raised
   worries about whether experts actually contribute to increasing the
   epistemic quality of policies, in line with normative expectations. Yet,
   so far, limited attention has been paid to the specific conditions under
   which experts involved in policy-making are likely to live up to such
   expectations. The article outlines a set of such conditions and
   empirically examines their fulfillment in the case of a real-world
   expert body. The article contributes theoretically to normative
   political theory about the proper role of expertise in policy-making;
   methodologically by linking normative theorizing and empirical analysis;
   and empirically through a longitudinal analysis based on large-n data of
   the extent to which the expert body under scrutiny satisfies a set of
   quantifiable empirical indicators of the proposed conditions.},

Abstract = {The article studies the state-induced famine of 1932-1933 in Soviet
   Ukraine as a public health crisis and explores the interplay between
   medical ethics and medical practices. As state employees and agents of
   the state, medical professionals participated in organization of the
   healthcare system and construction of a new, Soviet society. Among other
   spheres, the revolutionary change concerned medical ethics. Officially,
   pre-Soviet principles of professional ethics were rejected, and new
   ethical concepts were determined by class interest and class
   consciousness. The rapid industrialization, forced collectivization and
   food requisitions and seizure of the late 1920 and early 1930s resulted
   in the catastrophic famine and deaths of millions of Soviet citizens.
   Ukraine was one of the most affected regions, and the explosive spread
   of epidemic diseases followed mass starvation. In their efforts to cope
   with this crisis and stop the spread of epidemics from the countryside
   to urban centres, the authorities imposed disciplinary public health
   orders that resulted in the intensification of state violence, and
   hundreds of thousands of rural and urban dwellers were treated by
   medical professionals. The article examines the role of Soviet medical
   professionals and their entanglement with ethical discourse and medical
   practice during the famine of 1932-1933.},

Abstract = {Country presidents and their political parties have strong connections
   along partisan lines. However, it remains unclear how this relationship
   unfolds when country presidents have to be non-partisans and formal ties
   are not permitted. This article seeks to address this gap in the
   literature and analyzes how country presidents use informal powers to
   maintain an influence in the life of their (former) political parties.
   We use Romania as the most likely case where we would expect such powers
   to occur and matter, because the country's constitution bans the
   country's president from being a party member once they are elected to
   public office. We compare the behaviour of the two Romanian country
   presidents who have each served two complete consecutive terms in office
   in the post-communist period. Our analysis covers the 2004-2022 period
   and focuses on the following four dimensions: electing successors, prime
   ministerial appointments, inclusion in coalition agreements and parties'
   electoral performance.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the conditional effects of legislator gender, party,
   and key district-level characteristics on patterns of roll-call votes. I
   propose and test a theory of legislative freedom conceptualized as a
   member of Congress's ability to defect from their party in roll-call
   votes. I argue that women members of Congress (MCs) will be more able to
   exercise legislative freedom in women-friendly districts. I expect both
   Democratic and Republican women MCs representing women-friendly
   districts will be more likely than those representing districts that are
   less women-friendly to defect from party and that the women-friendly
   district effect will be stronger for Republican women MCs. To test these
   hypotheses, I use roll-call voting data, women-friendly district data
   (Palmer and Simon 2006), and original data collected on members of the
   U.S. House beginning with the 103rd Congress. In this paper, I further
   explore the proposed theory of legislative freedom to examine recent
   high-profile cases of women MCs defecting from the Republican party and
   the conditions in which they exercise this freedom.},

Abstract = {Social scientists are frequently interested in who is most responsive to
   a treatment. By necessity, such moderation experiments often rely on
   observed moderators, such as partisan identity. These designs have led
   to an ongoing debate about where to measure moderators-immediately prior
   to the treatment, after the treatment, or in a prior wave of a panel
   survey. Measuring a moderator prior to the treatment is the most
   efficient and avoids posttreatment bias, but it raises concerns about
   priming. We contribute to this debate by systematically studying whether
   measuring moderators prior to an experiment affects the results. Across
   six different experiments, each involving a commonly used moderator, we
   find little evidence of priming effects, even when a moderator is placed
   immediately before the experiment. Our findings thus help resolve the
   debate, suggesting that researchers should measure moderators
   pretreatment. We conclude with advice on designing well-powered
   moderation experiments.},

Title = {Military force development in New Zealand and Singapore: realising
   different influences on small state military capability},

Volume = {75},

Abstract = {New Zealand and Singapore are both capable small states with notably
   different security and defence concerns. The relative level of
   commitment that Singapore provides to its military forces in comparison
   to New Zealand is not only a reflection of the tremendous economic,
   social and technological development that has occurred in the city state
   since its independence, but is also due the different perceptions,
   discretion and motivation that each state has regarding the role and
   utility of their military instruments. The differences in their military
   capabilities also reflect how each has responded to their particular
   circumstances as small states. New Zealand has, to a large extent,
   worked within the constraints expected of small states while Singapore
   has striven to overcome them. However, the military capabilities of both
   states are significantly influenced by their characteristics as small
   states, and these form the basis of the challenges that they are likely
   to face going forward. This article examines key factors and elements
   underpinning why New Zealand and Singapore have developed markedly
   different military forces in the period from 1965 to 2022 in order to
   understand the extent to which their characteristics as small states
   have influenced their respective approaches to force development.},

Abstract = {Though governments historically have been a men's club, women are
   increasingly gaining access. We argue that democratic institutions are
   important drivers of women's inclusion in government. This stems from
   the rationales of autocratic versus democratic leaders when selecting
   ministers. Autocrats fear a coup by inner-circle elites, who are mostly
   men, incentivizing them to assign ministerial positions as co-optation.
   In contrast, democratic leaders are accountable to the citizenry through
   elections and must satisfy increasing demands for gender equality.
   Furthermore, we argue that it is historical experience with democracy
   that matters, rather than the level, as it takes time to create an even
   playing field, change attitudes, and generate trust in democracy. To
   support this, we contribute with the first study using the most
   comprehensive dataset, WhoGov, on women's access to cabinets. Overall,
   we show that democracy is a process that gradually enables women to
   enter the highest echelons of power.},

Abstract = {Political investorism involves the use of financial investments to
   promote political aims, but has, with some recent exceptions, received
   scarce attention from political scientists although there are valid
   theoretical reasons to consider this a new form of political
   participation. Here, we add new knowledge to this research agenda by
   examining empirically whether political investorism constitutes a
   distinct mode of political participation. Furthermore, we explore the
   characteristics of political investors and why they use political
   investorism. We examine these issues using an original survey from
   Finland (n = 1065). Our results demonstrate that political investorism
   constitutes a distinct mode of participation that in particular appeals
   to young and well-educated women living in an urban setting. Finally,
   cultural ideological divisions (measured with GAL-TAN:
   Green-Alternative-Libertarian and Traditional-Authoritarian-Nationalist)
   mediate socio-demographic characteristics when explaining participation.},

Title = {Digital technologies as a response to healthcare system crises:
   agenda-setting of digital health policies in France},
Journal = {FRENCH POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {227-248},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Since the COVID-19 crisis, digital health or ('eHealth') technologies
   have been a prominent element of domestic political agendas. However, in
   France, their emergence on the political agenda had already been linked
   to another type of crisis: the continuous and enduring crisis concerning
   the financing of the French healthcare system between 1995 and 2004. The
   aim of this article is to shed light on the conditions under which
   digital health technologies may be adopted as `solutions' amidst
   financial constraint and austerity, based on an in-depth study of the
   French case. Using the Multiple Streams Framework, combined with a
   comparative and qualitative methodology, this article explains why
   digital health technologies were adopted as a central instrument of the
   2004 French healthcare reform (the Douste-Blazy reform), but not during
   the 1995 social welfare reforms (the Juppe plan). It shows that if the
   perceived political risk associated with a reform increases, political
   decision-makers are more likely to select economically ambivalent
   devices, such as the Electronic Health Record (EHR), in order to restore
   the balance between pursuing policies and retaining votes.},

Abstract = {This article traces the history of `crowding out', and its use as a
   justification for austerity and state deflation from its origins in the
   1920s to its latest post-2010 incarnation. It examines why governments
   have kept turning to austerity and continue to justify it on the grounds
   that public sector activity crowds out more productive private activity,
   despite the accumulated evidence that this traditional pro-market
   formulation has failed to deliver its stated goals. It examines three
   other embedded forms of crowding out that have been highly
   damaging-leading to weakened social resilience and more fragile
   economies-but which have been ignored by both governments and mainstream
   political economists.},

Abstract = {Natural disasters are likely to increase in the near future. How does
   the emergence of such events influence voting behavior? While the
   literature has focused on the electoral repercussions after disaster has
   already struck, we investigate whether imminent disaster influences vote
   choice. We study the effect of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic on
   electoral choice in a setting that allows for causal identification: the
   local elections in Germany's southern state Bavaria in March 2020,
   where, at the time of the elections, only an as-if random sample of
   localities had recorded cases of COVID-19. We find that initial local
   outbreaks favored the political party governing at the state level and
   hurt the far right. These findings are most likely driven by a
   `strategic alignment' mechanism, whereby voters choose the party or
   candidate they believe is best placed to help them through the crisis.},

Abstract = {Devolution was almost universally regarded as heralding a fundamental
   shift in the nature of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
   Ireland. But, since the 2016 Brexit referendum, the UK government has
   become increasingly hostile-not only towards the Labour and SNP-run
   administrations in Scotland and Wales, but to the very existence of
   devolution. Recent legislative changes-particularly the UK Internal
   Market Act-have given central government carte blanche to intervene in
   what were previously regarded as areas of devolved competence. The
   inevitable result has been to render the governance arrangements for the
   devolved countries more adversarial and less stable than was previously
   the case. One immediate consequence of `the death of devolution' has
   been to trigger calls by devolutionists for more far-reaching changes to
   the state than were achieved in the late 1990s. It is far from clear,
   however, that such changes are politically achievable, raising the
   prospect of an extended period of stasis in which the current
   arrangements persist, not because they have any real supporters, but
   rather, because no alternative is possible.},

Abstract = {Members of some legislatures enjoy long political careers, whereas
   elsewhere turnover is rampant. This variation is consequential since
   high-incumbency assemblies may facilitate legislative expertise at the
   expense of social representation. We explore cross-national differences
   in re-election (incumbency) rates by identifying `supply' conditions
   such as legislative resources that benefit incumbents as well as
   `demand' conditions such as political corruption that affect voters'
   willingness to re-elect incumbents. We hypothesize that legislative
   perquisites help incumbents win re-election, but only if there is
   relatively high public confidence in politics, as reflected in low
   corruption levels. We tested our argument using OLS and instrumental
   variable regression and new global data on sixty-eight democracies
   (2000-18) covering 288 elections and over 55,000 legislators. We found
   that legislative resources help incumbents get re-elected only under
   relatively low levels of political corruption. In contrast, under severe
   corruption, such resources can depress re-election rates.},

Abstract = {How do the prospects for executive branch coordination affect
   legislatures' willingness to expand or contract budgets for public
   agencies? A theory is advanced stating the conditions whereby Congress
   expands and contracts the budgets of U.S. federal executive agencies
   based upon the type of presidential loyalty displayed by agency heads,
   as well as whether Congress's policy interests are aligned with or
   opposed by presidents. One aspect of the theory posits that executive
   agencies' budgets exhibit relatively lower volatility in response to
   unreliable executive agency heads when Congress is controlled by a
   different party than the president compared to instances of unified
   party government. The evidence offers compelling, albeit mixed, support
   for the theory's testable predictions while gleaning novel empirical
   insights for understanding how the prospects for executive branch
   coordination via leadership appointees affect the contingent nature of
   Congress's decisions in shaping the funding of U.S. federal executive
   agencies.},

   2020. Learning from Loss: The Democrats 2016-2020. Cambridge University
   Press). Yet, the logic behind the ``viability consensus{''} lacks
   empirical support and has rendered numerous challenges for marginalized
   candidates. We focus on a couple of challenges in particular - the
   social and psychological mechanisms behind racial/gender disparities in
   candidate success in primary elections. Scholarship on campaign finance
   and congressional elections has shown gender, race, and partisanship
   interact to shape candidates' contribution totals and vote shares
   (Sorensen and Chen. 2021. ``Identity in Campaign Finance and Elections:
   The Impact of Gender and Race on Money Raised in 2010-2018 U.S.{''}
   House Elections. Political Research Quarterly 75 (3): 738-753). It has
   yet to examine, however, how voters' social identities and attitudes
   about social groups contribute to disparities in candidate success and
   how the relationship between social identity and voter support,
   fundraising, and electability varies by electoral environment. In this
   paper, we assess the interaction of candidate and voter characteristics
   on campaign fundraising, voter support, and perceived candidate
   viability in primary elections. We uncover potential explanations for
   why candidates from marginalized groups find it more difficult to raise
   campaign funds and gain electoral support compared to other candidate
   demographic groups. The results of our conjoint experiment reveal that
   Black women in particular struggle to find support among white voters
   and donors.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen an increase in the use of delegated legislation
   to implement major policy decisions in the UK. This has exacerbated the
   longstanding criticism that Westminster lacks sufficiently robust
   procedures for parliamentary scrutiny of delegated legislation. However,
   the UK is not the only country to use delegated legislation, or to face
   the challenge of ensuring it receives adequate parliamentary scrutiny.
   This article therefore places the UK system in wider context by
   comparing it to six other national parliaments. We highlight one
   comparative strength of the UK system, two weaknesses it shares with the
   other six cases, and one way in which the UK might learn lessons from
   elsewhere. Overall, our evidence suggests that no one country offers a
   clear template for more rigorous parliamentary scrutiny of delegated
   legislation. Successful reform of the UK's system is likely to require
   creative procedural innovation.},

Abstract = {After Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, Aleksandr Lukashenka and
   his regime began drifting away from Moscow's orbit of influence. Less
   than eight years later, Belarus has turned into a client state, serving
   as a bridgehead for Russia's large-scale attack on Ukraine. How could
   this happen? The existing literature tends to emphasize ideological and
   regime-type factors. Such accounts, however, are incomplete. This
   article presents a realist patron-client theory that incorporates the
   dimension of power politics to explain the causes, conduct, and
   consequences of Russia's Belarus policy.},

Abstract = {Despite its emphasis on trade, the Regional Comprehensive Economic
   Partnership (RCEP) has been perceived as a liberalisation agenda
   motivated primarily by strategic concerns with fewer economic benefits.
   This article analyses the strategies of Indonesia's trade policymakers
   to legitimize its leading role in RCEP. It is argued that Indonesia's
   legitimation strategy is implemented through the invocation of two
   discourses: Indonesia's historical position as a regional leader and
   bridge-builder and the internationalisation of small and medium
   enterprises (SMEs). While the former is utilised as a coordinative
   discourse to provide an overarching vision for other state agencies with
   a protectionist bent, the latter is employed as a communicative
   discourse to challenge domestic contestations, especially those from
   civil society and business interests. This article contributes to the
   study of trade policy discourse by investigating the role of
   policymakers in mobilising discourses as a strategy for legitimising a

Abstract = {The literature of electoral reform explains politicians' preferences and
   social forces such as working-class power or expansions of the suffrage
   are the major factors that bring about a change in electoral rules.
   However, we argue that generational replacement and electoral issue
   effects lead politicians to introduce a new electoral system for their
   electoral survival in future. By examining Japan's surveys for pre- and
   postreform elections, we show that the entrance of new generation and
   salient issue concerns dissolve electoral bases of political parties and
   finally give rise to a change in the rules of the game for the greater
   electoral stability that political elites desire.},

Abstract = {We review the impact of humanitarian actors in civil war through the
   examination of the concepts of neutrality and impartiality - embedded
   within the `do no harm' principle. We argue that despite the rationale
   of principles seeking to detach international action from the embodied
   dynamics of conflict, these governing tenets have effectively served to
   reinforce power discrepancies between authoritarian regimes, opposition
   forces, and civilians in civil wars. Because humanitarian practices have
   so often been co-opted to strengthen the position of authoritarian
   regimes and inflict harm, we trace their impact in conflict networks and
   assess whether they serve to further protract and unbalance civil war.},

Abstract = {This article explores how informal, citizen-led solidarity with migrants
   is practised digitally and discusses how we can conceptualise such acts.
   The study draws on digital observations, semi-structured interviews and
   one field visit. Citizen humanitarians, who are informants in this
   study, supported migrants from Afghanistan who had been rejected asylum
   in Norway. Support included facilitating unauthorised migration,
   transit, residency within the Schengen area, financial help, and
   caregiving. By analysing these acts, the article discusses scholarly
   debates on citizenship regarding who enjoys the right to stay and access
   social rights in Europe and humanitarian ideals of `saving lives' of
   migrants threatened by deportation. The article show that citizen
   humanitarians use digital acts to carry out borderwork that were
   depended on and enabled by weak social ties. These practices fostered
   communities between citizen humanitarians and enabled them to claim
   rights for themselves and others. Based on the analysis, I develop the
   term `digital citizen humanitarianism', which allows us to be more
   precise about different forms of citizen humanitarianism facilitated by
   the digital.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the women's narratives about working in soup
   kitchens during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the city of Cordoba
   (Argentina), in 2020/2021. This research derives from a large study,
   which has a mixed methodological approach. The quantitative phase (n:
   680 households) reveals asymmetric effects: the socio-segregated sectors
   had a higher risk of job loss or lower income than the rest of the
   population (63\% vs 42.4\%). The qualitative phase (n:10) shows that the
   food demand increased exponentially. The central contribution of the
   research is to show that -in a pandemic situation and against the
   advertising discourse- the possibility of accessing and using social
   networks was not only unequally according to social class, but that
   women from subaltern social classes dispute in action with the dominant
   ideological constructions about this notion of equality associated with
   technological mediatisation. In addition, some redefinitions of domestic
   space/time and collective tasks are observed during the period of
   confinement, given the increasing demands and obstacles, as well as the
   impact on the caring bodies.},

   case identified the most effective instruments of government financial
   policy as a whole and by economic groups of countries and economic
   sectors. Finally, the need to expand the financial instruments of
   governmental support of enterprises in view of the consequences of the
   Russian aggression in Ukraine is emphasized.},

Title = {Reassessing the Effects of Emotions on Turnout},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 1},
Abstract = {Discrete emotions such as anger, pride, worry, and hopefulness have been
   shown to predict candidate preferences, issue attitudes, reports of
   participation other than voting, and stated intention to participate in
   various civic and electoral activities. Yet we know very little about
   how emotions might affect the most fundamental individual act in a
   democracy: turning out to vote. Using original survey data linked to
   past and future validated turnout to form four three-wave panels, we
   find that worry was a significant mobilizer of turnout in the 2018
   midterm election, while enthusiasm was not. We also find that measures
   of discrete emotions have detectable impacts on turnout only when
   respondents are prompted to think about political stimuli. These results
   have implications for theory, measurement, and model specification that
   should inform future work on the effects of emotions on political
   participation generally.},

Abstract = {The capture of institutions is the way in which the economic elites
   manage to relate to the public sphere and maintain their position of
   power through the advantages that their profits give them to co-opt
   various political organizations. This is known as state capture, and is
   typically analyzed at the national level. However, the process has
   internationalized and reached relations between countries and
   supranational organizations. Reading the phenomenon from a State-centric
   framework became insufficient, given that where before there was an
   elite with enough power to monopolize public decisions, now there is a
   co-opted global institutionality that exerts pressure on the actions of
   governments. This article seeks to emphasize the cooptation of
   international institutions, especially in the ways in which it manifests
   itself and its consequences. For this reason, it is exposed that the
   unequal relations between countries and the participation of
   transnational elites in power decisions are the ways in which a global
   capture is evidenced within the new relationship dynamics in the global
   scenario. For the development of the research and the text, a
   qualitative methodology of the documentary review type is used.},

Abstract = {Using a documentary analysis method, the legal issues that exist in the
   field of application and protection of personal non-property
   intellectual rights on the Internet are examined. The first section
   examines the legal consequences of the active development of information
   technologies and their impact on relations in the field of intellectual
   property. Some issues that arise when placing intellectual property
   objects on the Internet are identified. The second section of the
   article provides an overview of approaches to legal regulation of
   intellectual property relations under Ukrainian legislation. The third
   section highlights the types and characteristics of violations of
   personal non-property intellectual rights on the Internet, as well as
   the legislative and technical methods for their protection. It is noted
   that the main types of violations of personal non-property intellectual
   rights on the Internet are piracy and plagiarism. It is concluded that,
   among the problems that hinder the adequate protection of intellectual
   property rights on the Internet, the main ones are the legal uncertainty
   of many key concepts or their insufficient development and the lack of
   effective mechanisms for the protection of non-property personal rights.},

Abstract = {The objective of the work was to study the international aspects of the
   regulation of social and labor relations, with emphasis on global
   processes and their influence, on the part of international
   institutions, on the security of the individual and stable development
   in the work environment. The study used scientific methods such as:
   systemic analysis, comparison, functional historical, legal comparative
   and communicative. It was established that the sharp multiplication of
   global problems that have currently appeared before mankind requires
   consensual efforts of all members of the world community. In the
   conclusions it was stressed that all measures of the world community in
   terms of labor have to start from the true fact that it affirms the
   safety and dignity of work of each person as a fundamental value.
   Consequently, the category \& DLANGBRAC;security \& drangbrac; should be
   considered not only as an abstract dominant of development of a certain
   spectrum of labor social relations, but also as a real reason for the
   valid assurance of each individual. Definitely, the guarantee of safety
   should be based on the active position of each separate individual, not
   only in the sphere of occupational safety and hygiene, but in all
   spheres of social relations.},

Abstract = {The constructivist research programme on international norms has
   demonstrated convincingly that, how, and why norms matter. Norms have
   been shown to constitute the identity of actors, to guide their
   behaviour into desired directions, and, altogether, to generate the
   normative basis of the international system. In the course of this
   intensive debate, its main concepts, such as the question of what
   constitutes a norm or different norm types, became fuzzy. Also, while
   the focus on the intended effects of norms certainly encompasses an
   essential part of the phenomenon, their unintended effects have been
   largely neglected. Motivated by these shortcomings, the article presents
   a new systematisation of effects of norms. The typology developed here
   discerns two types of intended effects, namely prohibitive and
   obligative effects, as well as two corresponding types of unintended
   effects, namely permissive and omissive effects.},

Abstract = {Over the past few years, equity-diversity-inclusion (EDI) requirements
   have proliferated in higher learning institutions. What impact have they
   had on students? This paper leverages a unique opportunity to evaluate
   the effect of an EDI requirement at a large public university: taught by
   the same instructor over the course of four quarters in three years, the
   course administered short anonymous surveys to students at the beginning
   and at the end of each term. These surveys measured student political
   attitudes such as preferences toward refugee admissions and affirmative
   action. Repeated surveys and repeated quarters allow us to evaluate
   changes in student attitudes during each quarter and averaged over three
   years. Results indicate an increase in inclusionary attitudes driven
   largely by students at the lowest baseline levels. Further analyses
   allow us to rule out social desirability bias, and suggest one possible
   mechanism: participation in small-group peer discussions.},

Abstract = {Before the 1997 Labour landslide, Roy Jenkins famously described Tony
   Blair as being `like a man carrying a priceless Ming vase across a
   highly polished floor'. Many think Keir Starmer appears even more
   diffident. This article argues that he should perhaps look for
   inspiration to the general election of 1964, the last occasion upon
   which Labour overturned a large Tory majority and secured its own
   majority. In 1964, Harold Wilson made great play of the charge that the
   Conservative governments of 1951-1964 had presided over `thirteen wasted
   years'. The nature and correctness of this case is examined, albeit that
   the charge may have been somewhat overstated. The parallels with the
   thirteen years of Conservative governments since 2010 are then analysed.
   The article concludes that there appear to be uncanny parallels between
   1963/4 and the present. Not only have the Conservatives been in power
   for thirteen years, but the British economy is once more floundering
   relative to its peers.},

Abstract = {South China Sea disputes pose huge energy insecurity to China and
   Southeast Asian nations, threatening their vital Sea Lines of
   Communication. This study explores the ongoing conflicts in the South
   China Sea through Womack's Asymmetry theory of international relations.
   It contributes to the theory by suggesting ways to improve regional
   cooperation by adapting to new and renewable energy sources, such as
   offshore wind. The disparity of capacity among littorals in the South
   China Sea has created systemic misperception. How China can make amends
   with these countries by aligning with the United Nations Sustainable
   Development Goals and bridging the asymmetry in the region becomes the
   key research question. This study analyses the existing international
   environmental agreements applicable in the South China Sea based on the
   issuing agency, China as a signatory, legality, and the nature of the
   agreement. It has been observed that the existing international
   agreements are ineffective in creating geopolitical symmetry. Our
   proposal of using offshore wind energy as a cooperative sustainable
   development tool to bridge the asymmetry can encourage cooperation for
   knowledge, technology, and practice sharing ensuring peace and
   cooperation in South China Sea.},

Abstract = {Canada is one of many representative democracies with low youth
   representation in parliament of the age cohorts 30 years or under, 35
   years or under, and 40 years or under. While most research tries to
   examine structural- or party-level factors responsible for youth's low
   presence in politics, our study is interested in politicians'
   perspectives. Are candidates and elected officials aware of youth's low
   presence in the Canadian House of Commons? Do they find this dearth of
   representation problematic, and if so, what remedies do they suggest to
   alleviate the situation? We try to answer these questions through
   original survey research of candidates and elected representatives of
   the 2019 and 2021 Canadian general elections. Our results reveal
   interesting patterns. Most of the surveyed are aware that youth
   representation is lacking behind youth's distributive share of the
   population in Canada. However, only a minority of the survey respondents
   finds this problematic. Interestingly, there is also not enough support
   for proactive measures such as youth quotas or term limits to increase
   youth representation in the House of Commons.},

Title = {Stability and change in political trust: Evidence and implications from
   six panel studies},

Abstract = {Are political attitudes a stable feature of individuals or a rational
   response to changing circumstances and contexts? This question has long
   been a feature of political science and underpins our theories of how
   political attitudes are formed and what their consequences might be. In
   this paper, we explore this perennial question with a focus on the case
   of political trust, a fundamental indicator of democratic legitimacy and
   a long-standing topic of debate. Theoretically, we devise a framework
   that highlights how different theories of political trust assume
   different levels of stability or volatility and the implications that
   this has for those theories and their normative consequences.
   Empirically, we study within-individual stability of political trust
   using six panel studies that cover five countries between 1965 and 2020.
   Our results consistently point to trust being stable in the long term,
   with potential for short-term volatility in response to changing
   political contexts, and for substantial changes between people's
   formative years and their adulthood. Even over a period of 19 years,
   most people's responses to trust questions are remarkably similar
   between surveys and significant life events such as unemployment and
   going to University do not significantly influence trust. Changes in the
   political environment, like incumbent government turnover, have larger
   effects but these appear to return to equilibrium in a few years. The
   exception to this general finding is individuals who are first surveyed
   when they are under the age of 18, who appear much more likely to change
   their trust levels in subsequent waves. Overall, our results complement
   previous research on attitude stability, indicating that trust is
   approximately as stable as other attitudes, such as towards immigration
   and redistribution. These findings have fundamental implications for our
   understanding of the nature of political trust and attitude formation
   more broadly.},

Abstract = {Girls and young women have played leading roles in Australian climate
   politics since 2018. The distinctive age-cohort and gendered
   characteristics of this movement and the implications of this for
   contemporary politics and democracy are not well documented. Focusing on
   School Strike 4 Climate movement, we ask how to best understand this
   development? Is their appearance as leaders and speakers in political
   forums politically significant, and if so, how? We use 41 speeches to
   examine what `being political' means for them. We identify the
   reflexively gendered ways these young women are experiencing - and
   remaking - contemporary politics. This is consonant with a tradition of
   political theory developed by Arendt, Wolin and Ranciere's idea of `the
   political' as what reveals the exclusion of people who aren't normally
   allowed to take part.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses productivity growth in the context of the Greek
   economy. Productivity of labor in the Marxian sense is estimated using
   the distinction between productive and unproductive labor, and it is
   compared and contrasted with its mainstream counterpart. Marxian
   productivity is generally higher in level and exhibits a higher average
   rate of growth than mainstream productivity. We also estimate
   econometrically the determinants of productivity growth. Variables
   stressed in the classical-Marxian approach expressing capital
   accumulation appear to account for most of the variation in productivity
   growth. This is in contrast to certain radical approaches and especially
   the Social Structures of Accumulation school which stress the importance
   of `social' variables for the explanation of productivity growth. In
   particular, the negative correlation found here between productivity
   growth and unemployment rate for Greece contradicts earlier findings in
   the Social Structures of Accumulation literature which postulate a
   positive correlation between those variables for countries like Greece
   and the United States. JEL classification: E11, E24, J21},

Abstract = {In recent years several contributions have made the argument that
   right-wing populist voting is interrelated with individuals being
   negatively affected by globalisation. While there is certainly merit to
   this argument, it cannot explain why voters unconcerned by globalisation
   vote for right-wing populist parties. In this article we answer this
   question and argue that ontological insecurity or, the way we frame it,
   existential anxieties are a previously overlooked determinant of
   right-wing populist voting, as these anxieties make people vulnerable to
   right-wing populist crises narratives even when they are not affected by
   the crises. Using European Social Survey data for 12 Western European
   countries between 2004 and 2018, we construct a novel index that
   measures existential anxieties on the individual level. Our index shows
   (1) that existential anxieties increase the likelihood of right-wing
   populist voting and (2) that the fear fuelling narratives of these
   parties especially mobilise individuals with moderate globalisation
   attitudes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {426-437},
Abstract = {Do unbiased third-party peacekeepers build trust between groups in the
   aftermath of conflict? Theoretically, we point out that unbiased
   peacekeepers are the most effective at promoting trust. To isolate the
   causal effect of bias on trust, we use an iterated trust game in a
   laboratory setting. Groups that previously engaged in conflict are put
   into a setting in which they choose to trust or reciprocate any trust.
   Our findings suggest that biased monitors impede trust while unbiased
   monitors promote cooperative exchanges over time. The findings
   contribute to the peacekeeping literature by highlighting impartiality
   as an important condition under which peacekeepers build trust
   post-conflict.},

Abstract = {Oil discoveries, paired with delays in production, have created a new
   phenomenon: sustained post-discovery, pre-production periods. While
   research on the resource curse has debated the effects of oil on
   governance and conflict, less is known about the political effects of
   oil discoveries absent production. Using comprehensive electoral data
   from Uganda and a difference-in-differences design with heterogeneous
   effects, we show that oil discoveries increased electoral support for
   the incumbent chief executive in localities proximate to discoveries,
   even prior to production. Moreover, the biggest effects occurred in
   localities that were historically most electorally competitive. Overall,
   we show that the political effects of oil discoveries vary subnationally
   depending on local political context and prior to production, with
   important implications for understanding the roots of the political and
   conflict curses.},

Abstract = {The politics of disability policy in the contemporary Congress confirms
   the observation by James Curry and Frances Lee that lawmaking largely
   remains a process of bipartisan accommodation. Most major disability
   legislation since the 1970s has passed with bipartisan sponsorship and
   support. One reason is that the issue affects so many Americans,
   including members of Congress. There have been some exceptions to this
   bipartisan pattern, particularly when disability policy intersects with
   more contentious issues. And bipartisanship does not guarantee outcomes
   that are satisfactory to people with disabilities.},

Abstract = {When studying corruption's consequences for voter turnout, reverse
   causality hinders identification; corruption may affect turnout, but an
   engaged citizenry may also improve governance. However, because good
   instruments are hard to find, most studies do not adjust for the issue.
   Here, I surmount the endogeneity problem by predicting turnout among
   second generation Americans with the level of corruption in their
   ancestral country. The core intuition is that the best predictors of
   turnout-education, income, and civic duty-are endogenous to corruption,
   internationally mobile, and reproduced inter-generationally. Thus,
   corruption in one country can affect turnout among the American-born
   children of the country's emigres. However, because turnout in US
   elections does not affect corruption in the ancestral country, there is
   no threat of reverse causality. Estimating the model with data from the
   Current Population Survey and the Varieties of Democracy Project reveals
   a statistically robust, substantively sizable negative effect of
   corruption on turnout.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recently, much debate has occurred regarding Machiavelli's standards for
   good leadership. Drawing on his unusually approving-but still
   understudied-treatment of Marcus Furius Camillus, a Roman general and
   ruler, this paper presents a new perspective on Machiavelli's leadership
   teachings. It argues that the Machiavellian leader possesses a rare
   self-honesty that frees him from heroic visions of himself and, thus,
   from dangerous vanity and from vengefulness toward opponents. Although
   this leader is no altruist, then, he often benefits his people more
   effectively than other rulers can, for he views the needs of his state
   with clearer eyes. This complex outlook differs from the ones that most
   scholars have attributed to the Machiavellian leader. It also provides
   us with a nuanced framework for considering what qualities to look for
   in potential leaders today.},

Abstract = {A large number of young adults still live with their parents because
   they have difficulties entering the job market, because of low wages, or
   the cost of housing. Despite much research in social science on the
   consequences of this salient social trend, we lack an understanding of
   its implications for public opinion. This research note fills this gap
   by investigating whether such living arrangements between working age
   children and their parents is correlated with household members'
   political stances. Specifically, I expect that the anxiety induced by
   seeing their children having difficulties to become independent will
   lead parents to hold more negatives political stances, while the same
   outcome is expected from working age children who failed to fly the nest
   compared to their independent peers. Using data from the European Social
   Survey in 32 countries covering the period between 2002 and 2016, I show
   that, for both parents and young adults, cohabitation is associated with
   negative evaluations of the national economy and of the government's
   performance. Studies that do not take into account the situation of
   other household members might miss an important part of the opinion
   formation puzzle.},

Title = {Categorizing Salafism with and without Wiktorowicz: grounded reflections
   from Tunisia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {306-326},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Since Wiktorowicz's landmark article in 2006, students of Salafism have
   been critical users of his tripartite typology ('purists', `politicos',
   and `Jihadis'). Most efforts have been directed towards refining the
   typology according to the specificities of certain contexts or actors,
   especially after the Arab revolutions, but none contested its
   foundational paradigm. Based on fieldwork in Tunisia and a critical
   review of the academic literature, this article endeavors both to refine
   Wiktorowicz's and Wiktorowicz-inspired typologies in the post-Arab
   revolutions era and to challenge their foundational paradigm through a
   discussion of the tension between ideology-oriented and
   behavior-oriented typologies. Criticisms include the erroneous equation
   of quietism with apoliticism, the restriction of jihad to Jihadis, the
   lack of distinction between jihad as a doctrinal tenet and as violent
   action, the diverse forms of political activism, the fluidity of
   categories and the birth of hybrid categories after the Arab
   revolutions, and the need for spatio-temporal (re-)contextualization and
   inductivism as well as for decentering the typology and genealogy of
   Salafism from (Saudi) Wahhabism. As a response to these limitations, the
   article proposes to distinguish between ideological attitudes and
   specialization into a field of action in a new typology of Salafism that
   is replicable beyond the Tunisian case.},

Abstract = {On 7 January 2015, brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, armed with
   Kalashnikovs, entered the headquarters of the Paris-based satirical
   magazine, Charlie Hebdo, and opened fire, killing 12 people and injuring
   11 more. It would later emerge that the brothers - both native Frenchmen
   born to Algerian parents - belonged to the Islamist terrorist group, al
   Qaeda. The attack, which targeted a Western magazine, attracted
   tremendous international news coverage, provoking a widespread debate
   over issues relating to free speech, immigration (even though both
   attackers were born in France) and integration. There has been less
   discussion of the news framing of the attack by Western media outlets,
   and to what degree that news framing may have been biased or
   Islamophobic. In this study, it is our goal to understand how media
   framing may have been affected by this attack, and to what degree such
   framing is Islamophobic. To that end, we have operationalised the
   Runnymede framework of Islamophobia using the content analysis software
   Nvivo, in order to identify and better understand manifestations of
   Islamophobia in the mainstream press. Specifically, we analyse the news
   framing of Islam in the headlines of two US daily newspapers, The New
   York Times and The Wall Street Journal.},

Abstract = {Political attempts to control how the past may be represented have
   flourished in the twenty-first century. Russia participates in this
   trend, having taken steps to legislatively and juridically safeguard the
   legacy of the USSR's involvement in World War II. This has
   institutionalized an interpretation of the fight against Nazism that was
   already widely held in society, making the Russian case a ``hard
   test{''} for evaluating when the violation of a historical norm is
   deemed appropriate and what the impact of a memory law might be relative
   to other factors. Drawing on two vignette experiments conducted in 2021,
   our article demonstrates both that the discursive context in which a
   controversial statement about the past is made matters when respondents
   assess whether the person making it should be punished and that
   criticism of a historical norm is more likely to be accepted when it
   emanates from an in-group member. We also find that the state has
   limited ability to influence societal attitudes regarding history.
   Moreover, a willingness to defend state-led interventions into how the
   past is depicted aligns with support for the political system but the
   latter does not necessarily overlap with individuals' historical views,
   underscoring the multidimensional nature of collective memory.},

Abstract = {Factionalism is an important element in parties' internal life,
   affecting their policies, strategies, electoral performance and even
   survival. Yet little is known about how parties manage factionalism.
   This study examines how radical left parties (RLPs) manage factionalism,
   drawing on a comparative case study of four RLPs - the Spanish Podemos
   and United Left (IU), and the Portuguese Left Bloc (BE) and Communist
   Party (PCP) - from 2010 to 2019. Drawing on original data collection, we
   find that parties adopt both formal and informal mechanisms to address
   factionalism. However, their approaches differ significantly. We
   identify two main approaches towards factionalism: a permissive
   approach, which allows internal pluralism, in the BE and IU; and a
   prohibitionist approach, which actively fights factionalism, in Podemos
   and the PCP, with competitive prohibitionism in the former and
   pre-emptive prohibitionism in the latter. These approaches strongly
   correlate with parties' origins and political orientation, but neither
   fully prevents intra-party conflict or splintering.},

Abstract = {The post-truth condition is just as much about naming a meta-game as
   winning it. This condition can be tracked across Western intellectual
   history from the Homeric epics to popular culture. The common thread is
   that players are more likely to succeed in this meta-game if they have a
   certain consistency of character, which Thomas More called
   ``integrity.{''} The presence of integrity means that the historical
   losers have often had an advantage in defining for subsequent
   generations the name of the game because the steadfastness of their
   characters may make them be regarded as the agents of history, for
   better or worse. Further, naming the game tends to be stabilized by a
   variety of mental and material conditions, including ``modal
   power{''}-control over what people think is and is not possible. Modal
   power is related to both Machiavellian politics and Kantian
   transcendentalism, and to the phenomenon of ``truthiness.{''} The
   character of the post-truth player is epitomized by Thomas More, the
   ``man for all seasons,{''} who remained consistent as he moved between
   multiple games, and ultimately to his execution.},

Abstract = {Existing research on child soldiering has largely neglected whether
   external support affects the decision of child soldiering by rebel
   groups. This paper shows that rebel groups' levels of engagement in
   child soldiering depends on the types of support that rebel groups
   receive. I argue that territorial support is associated with increased
   child recruitment, while troop and monetary support are associated with
   less child soldiering. This research has crucial implications for our
   understanding of the relationship between rebel groups' engagement in
   human rights violations and support from external actors. Furthermore,
   this research highlights previously overlooked roots of the use of child
   soldiers, so policy makers can pay more attention to these issues in the
   future.},

Abstract = {Do voters want their party to be office- or policy-seekers in coalition
   negotiations? This question has been left unstudied in political science
   research so far. While existing research shows that policies matter for
   voters when forming their preferences for coalitions, in this study it
   is argued that voters find it at the same time important that their
   preferred party gains offices. Specifically, voters' office-seeking
   considerations are expected to increase the more indifferent they are to
   the policy content of a coalition agreement. To test this assumption, an
   original conjoint experiment among Green Party voters in the context of
   the German federal election in 2021 has been conducted. The findings
   demonstrate that voters' office-seeking considerations become more
   important the more similar coalition agreements are with regard to their
   policy content. These findings have important implications for the
   understanding of voters' preferences regarding coalitions.},

Abstract = {For many governments, enacting green policies is a priority, but such
   policies often impose on citizens substantial and uneven costs. How does
   the introduction of green policies affect voting? We study this question
   in the context of a major ban on polluting cars introduced in Milan,
   which was strongly opposed by the populist right party Lega. Using
   several inferential strategies, we show that owners of banned
   vehicles-who incurred a median loss of euro3,750-were significantly more
   likely to vote for Lega in the subsequent elections. Our analysis
   indicates that this electoral change did not stem from a broader shift
   against environmentalism, but rather from disaffection with the policy's
   uneven pocketbook implications. In line with this pattern, recipients of
   compensation from the local government were not more likely to switch to
   Lega. The findings highlight the central importance of distributive
   consequences in shaping the political ramifications of green policies.},

Abstract = {A growing literature links experiences of armed conflict with postwar
   political behavior. This paper examines how legacies of wartime violence
   shape dynamics of protest in twenty-first-century Iraq. We argue that
   experiences of shared violence against civilians generate strong social
   and organizational ties, as individuals turn to neighbors, friends, and
   communal organizations or social groups to help them cope. These
   strengthened social networks endure beyond the end of the conflict,
   forming important vehicles that can facilitate the organization of
   protest when new grievances or opportunities arise. Further, we posit
   that these effects will be strongest when the perpetrator of wartime
   violence is a clear out-group-e.g., a foreign army or non-coethnic
   militia-which facilitates network strengthening by creating a sense of
   collective victimization and in-group solidarity. We support these
   arguments using an original database of Iraqi protests from 2010 to 2012
   and data on civilian casualties during Iraq's 2004-2009 conflict. We
   further test our argument with geo-referenced Arab Barometer surveys. We
   leverage a case study of Fallujah, based on original interviews and
   other qualitative data, to unpack mechanisms of network strengthening,
   endurance, and reactivation during the Iraqi protest wave of 2011.},

Abstract = {The People's Republic of China (PRC), the Special Administrative Region
   of Hong Kong, the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the Republic of
   Singapore represent different types of political regimes and provide a
   fascinating contrast concerning their performance with regard to the
   global conflict between liberal democracies and autocracies. This paper
   examines briefly their common historical backgrounds and provides a
   detailed analysis of common `Asian' cultural features and popular
   support for democracy on the micro-level. It then systematically
   assesses their performance concerning liberal democracy and quality,
   governance scores, and socio-economic development. Finally, the
   reactions to the Covid-19 pandemic are documented showing again specific
   regime characteristics. We use most recent V-Dem, World Bank, United
   Nations Development Programme, World Values Surveys and similar data.
   The conclusions point to possible international consequences and the
   crucial position of Taiwan.},

Abstract = {Where is the human rights discourse most resonant? We use aggregated
   cross-national Google search data to test two divergent accounts of why
   human rights appeal to some populations but not others. The top-down
   model predicts that nationwide interest in human rights is attributable
   mainly to external factors such as foreign direct investment,
   transnational NGO campaigns, or international legalization, whereas the
   bottom-up model highlights the importance of internal factors such as
   economic growth and persistent repression. We find more evidence for the
   latter model: not only is interest in human rights more concentrated in
   the Global South, but the discourse is also most resonant where people
   face regular state violence. In drawing these inferences, this article
   confronts high-level debates over whether human rights will remain
   relevant in the future, and whether the discourse still animates
   counter-hegemonic modes of resistance. The answer to both questions, our
   research suggests, is ``yes.{''}},

Abstract = {This paper assesses mandatory human rights laws for companies in light
   of the public-private divide in international human rights law. It asks
   whether and to what extent these laws contribute to the blurring of the
   private-public divide by reducing or even eliminating the boundaries
   between the obligations of public and private entities. The paper also
   assesses whether maintaining the divide is normatively desirable from
   the perspective of international human rights law. It first explains the
   public-private divide in international human rights law by recalling its
   doctrinal basis, reflecting on attempts to create binding obligations
   for companies in international human rights law, and assessing the
   United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights within
   this framework. Next, it analyses existing and proposed domestic laws
   and legal instruments aimed at establishing human rights obligations for
   companies. It highlights the difference between approaches directly
   binding companies to human rights and laws requiring human rights due
   diligence. Based on this, the paper concludes that the public-private
   divide remains a useful analytical framework for international human
   rights law even though the boundaries between public and private are
   increasingly blurred in practice.},

Abstract = {College faculty often struggle with getting their students to read
   assigned materials. Even if students do read, they may not read closely
   or critically. Not only does the lack of effective reading undermine
   understanding, but it also hampers class discussions and engagement. To
   promote close and critical reading in a required, upper-division
   International Security Studies course, we offered optional reading guide
   worksheets as tools to increase students' reading comprehension and
   completion. While our reading guides helped students focus on key terms
   and lesson objectives, flaws in our implementation produced a lack of
   perceptual value and extrinsic motivation in using the reading guides.
   In this article, we offer our lessons learned from the use of reading
   guides, focusing on their form, function, and frequency. These findings
   equip faculty with useful guidance in how to design and implement
   effective reading guides across the disciplines.},

Abstract = {Influenced by the academic work of Stephen A. Resnick and Richard D.
   Wolff, the author and his close collaborator Richard McIntyre have spent
   four decades closely reading and contributing research to adjacent
   radical literatures on the empirical history of workers and capitalism.
   In this response to Richard McIntyre's review of Shredding Paper, the
   author reveals how his own research into the story of Maine's paper
   mills has developed since the 1980s, drawing out the class implications
   of the details embedded in a history that stretches back to the origins
   of Maine's paper industry. Hillard highlights the efficacy of reading
   capitalist histories of focusing on subsumed classes, i.e., a ``volumes
   2 and 3 {[}of Capital] approach,{''} alongside the much more common
   ``volume 1{''} methodology common to most radical political economy and
   labor history. For better and worse, this story has culminated in two
   generations of rural Mainers rejecting the sensibilities of neoliberal
   capitalism. This local class formation and particular consciousness of
   class contains many lessons for those who see capitalism
   problematically, but in the absence of an established U.S. Left, and
   given the cultural forces and propaganda acting upon them, this critical
   culture appears to have moved on.},

Abstract = {Using an analytical and documentary methodology based onthe review of
   high-impact scientific literature, the objective ofthe article was to
   develop the legal-conceptual principles of thequality management system
   in the field of tourism. Everythingindicates that, product quality
   assurance means a set of legaland planned measures of a systematic
   nature that create the necessaryconditions for the implementation of
   each stage of the quality concept, sothat, the product meets the quality
   requirements of the market segment.One of the main principles of
   creating a concept of quality managementin the field of tourism is a
   correct definition of the concept of quality oftourism services in the
   broader framework of the legal regulation of thesystem of tourism
   management. The obtained results allow us to concludethat the tourism
   industry is one of the promising areas of the developmentof global
   economic relations, and in the context of the transformation of
   theeconomy of a country, increasing the efficiency of the functioning of
   thisindustry acquires special relevance for the achievement of social

Abstract = {This paper argues that in normalizing the language of the critique of
   law enforcement during voir dire in the 2021 trial of Derek Chauvin,
   three important changes occurred: the first was that Black jurors were
   less likely to be dismissed for opinions they have long voiced, but
   which had been seen as the basis for legitimate dismissal, the second
   was that it clarified what contextual impartiality should mean for the
   court given widespread scrutiny of the racial discrimination within and
   outside of the law. Lastly, the topics covered during voir dire served
   to highlight precisely the types of life experiences that may be
   valuable for the juror's task of phronesis, Aristotle's term for
   practical wisdom, necessary for deliberation and determining the
   verdict. The paper includes a close reading of the voir dire responses
   of several jurors in the Chauvin trial.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Macroeconomic variables like unemployment, inflation, trade, or GDP are
   not set in stone: they are preliminary estimates that are constantly
   revised by statistical agencies. These data revisions, or data vintages,
   often provide conflicting information about the size of a country's
   economy or its level of development, reducing our confidence in
   established findings. Would researchers come to different conclusions if
   they used different vintages? To answer this question, I survey all
   articles published in a top political science journal between 2005 and
   2020. I replicate three prominent articles and find that the use of
   different vintages can lead to different statistical results, calling
   into question the robustness of otherwise rigorous empirical research.
   These findings have two practical implications. First, researchers
   should always be transparent about their data sources and vintages.
   Second, researchers should be more modest about the precision and
   accuracy of their point estimates, since these estimates can mask large
   measurement errors.},

Year = {2023},

Abstract = {This work examines the relationship between Kant's notion of freedom and
   the legal duty to leave the state of nature and enter the civil state in
   his theory of law and politics. As opposed to ethical duties, the
   fulfilment of legal duties can be forced upon a person. Coercion is
   important in the context of this pa-per because, according to Kant,
   right is always connected with an authoriza-tion to use coercion. The
   right of intelligible possession as an acquired right already existing
   in the state of nature is the basis of the legal duty to leave the state
   of nature and enter the civil state. The right of intelligible
   possession, which refers to the possession of external objects, or
   possession independ-ent of the empirical conditions, implies the duty of
   all others to refrain from using the objects we first possess, but also
   the moral authorization of coercion over those who refuse to do so.
   However, since in the state of nature there is no public authority which
   enforces the law through general laws, coercion is arbitrary and depends
   on particular interpretations of legal situations. The ar-bitrariness of
   coercion implies the possibility that the freedom of the individu-al,
   which is externally manifested through the right of intelligible
   possession, will be endangered. For this reason, others can be forced to
   enter the civil state with me, submitting to the public authority under
   the same conditions. The public authority makes rights of possession
   explicit and secures them, and is thus a necessary condition for the
   fullness of human freedom.},

Abstract = {The teaching-learning processes of contents and the human capacities
   that emerge from them on a daily basis are determined by the policies,
   plans and concrete projects that regulate the subject and the teaching
   of English is no exception; thus, it is the national, regional, local
   and institutional policies that produce or delay, as the case may be,
   the conditions of possibility for the achievement of the programmatic
   objectives of a subject of strategic use such as English. By means of a
   descriptive, analytical and documented methodology, the objective of
   this article was to review some educational policies for the teaching of
   English in higher education in Ecuador. The results obtained allow us to
   conclude that, although educational policies are regularly designed
   asymmetrically, from a hegemonic institutional center (State, Teachers,
   University, among others) and imposed in a relatively consensual way to
   the rest of the actors of the educational process, in the cases known by
   this research, the successful teaching of English also depends
   significantly on the creative capacity of the teacher and, even more, on
   the commitment of the students in the development of their language
   skills in order to achieve meaningful learning.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article was to analyze the legal basis of the postwar
   restoration of Ukraine, and to investigate the possible options,
   programs and plans for effecting this restoration. The following methods
   were used for the detailed study of this topic: comparative,
   legal-cognitive, logical-legal, hermeneutic, statistical, dialectical
   and formal-legal. The results of the research are the definition of
   basic concepts and terms, namely ``reparations{''} and ``war{''};
   clarification of peculiarities of Ukraine's post-WWII reconstruction;
   research and analysis of Ukraine's post-war programs, strategies and
   plans of renewal, and; establishment of peculiarities and payment of
   reparations for Ukraine. The legal framework of Ukrainian reconstruction
   was also studied. It is concluded that, the integration of all existing
   opportunities in the world to assist Ukraine in its post-war
   reconstruction will facilitate Ukraine's accession to various
   international and European institutions, including the European Union.
   Also, the updating of new international acts regulating assistance to
   Ukraine and compensation from Russia will contribute to the improvement
   of the international legal framework, which in some respects has not
   changed since World War II.},

Abstract = {How do considerations related to backlash affect the desirability of
   pursuing otherwise justified immigration policies? This paper argues
   that backlash-related considerations bear on immigration policy
   decisions in ways that are both more powerful and complicated than
   typically recognized. The standard possibility, the egalitarian backlash
   argument, endorses immigration restrictions in order to protect support
   for egalitarian distributive institutions. The paper shows that this
   account does not, by itself, provide a convincing rationale for
   restricting immigration because such diminished support is (a) likely
   outweighed by the benefits of more permissive immigration policies and
   (b) caused by the objectionable preferences of citizens. However, the
   paper develops an alternative account of the relevance of
   backlash-related considerations, the democratic backlash argument, which
   holds that increased levels of immigration threaten to contribute to
   undermining democratic institutions. This argument provides a more
   powerful rationale for restricting immigration, one that can-under
   identified conditions-justify immigration restrictions.},

Abstract = {Can wars breed nationalism? We argue that civilians' indirect exposure
   to war fatalities can trigger psychological processes that increase
   identification with their nation and ultimately strengthen support for
   nationalist parties. We test this argument in the context of the rise of
   the Nazi Party after World War 1 (WW1). To measure localized war
   exposure, we machine-coded information on 7.5 million German soldiers
   who were wounded or died in WW1. Our empirical strategy leverages
   battlefield dynamics that cause plausibly exogenous variation in the
   county-level casualty fatality rate-the share of dead soldiers among all
   casualties. We find that throughout the interwar period, electoral
   support for right-wing nationalist parties, including the Nazi Party,
   was 2.6 percentage points higher in counties with above-median casualty
   fatality rates. Consistent with our proposed mechanism, we find that
   this effect was driven by civilians rather than veterans and areas with
   a preexisting tradition of collective war commemoration.},

Abstract = {For W. E. B. Du Bois, the tragedy of Reconstruction was that its
   achievements were overthrown and erased from collective memory. Du
   Bois's Black Reconstruction corrects this, claiming enslaved people who
   fled plantations self-emancipated, thus enacting a ``general strike
   against the slave system.{''} Yet Du Bois contravenes his general strike
   thesis when he quotes without rebuttal several Union officials who spoke
   of the formerly enslaved in degrading, nonagentic terms. I turn to
   Jacques Ranciere's politics of dissensus to understand why Du Bois
   quoted such racist views without comment. In Ranciere, political actors
   ``stage a scene{''} of equality that is shared, even among parties in
   conflict. Recording conflicting perceptions of the strike, highlighting
   divisions that persist despite momentary advances of equality, Du Bois's
   reading of the general strike is dissensual in Ranciere's sense, I
   argue. But Du Bois also offers a valuable corrective to Ranciere, whose
   account of the first plebeian secession erases a different general
   strike from memory. Ranciere reads the Aventine as an event of
   confrontation unconnected to the collective action that Du Bois summoned
   from the archive and named ``general strike.{''}},

Abstract = {Protectionist measures often have target countries, and public support
   for such measures depends on who the targets are. We identify such
   target effects on protectionist sentiments and examine the effects of
   information in tempering protectionist sentiments in East Asia. Using an
   original survey experiment in China, Japan, and South Korea, we test how
   providing information about the costs of protectionism changes public
   attitudes toward targeted protectionist measures. We found that
   providing a target country identity increased public support for
   protectionism by 8.6\%. Providing cost information, on the other hand,
   reduces support for protectionism by 10\%. We also found that
   information and target effects persist in the presence of the other:
   Receiving cost information reduces support for both general and targeted
   protectionism but does not necessarily mute the target effect.
   Similarly, when reputation and retaliation costs are associated with
   protectionism, knowing a target country identity still increases public
   support for protectionism.},

Abstract = {Should educators teach diversity courses in online formats? Courses
   covering sexism, racism, ethnocentrism, or homophobia are increasingly
   part of the curriculum requirements for college students. This study
   compares student surveys from six sections of the author's introductory
   Diversity in Politics course; three of these sections are taught
   asynchronously online, and three are taught in a face-to-face setting.
   Results reveal no difference between online and face-to-face students'
   understandings of privilege and oppression, sense of belonging, or white
   guilt. However, although all Republican students increased their
   understanding of privilege and oppression from this course, Republican
   students uniquely entered the course with less knowledge of oppression
   and experienced increased growth compared to their online counterparts.
   The importance of partisanship suggests a more student-centered approach
   can be valuable in determining the transmissibility of online diversity
   courses and provides evidence for a successful model for political
   science diversity courses in online and in-person spaces.},

Abstract = {This study analyses how preference heterogeneity across EU member states
   affects the adoption of soft-law acts over time. On the one hand, high
   diversity in policy preferences is expected to increase the proportion
   of soft-law instruments because governments are less likely to agree to
   binding measures. Conversely, preference heterogeneity could also
   decrease soft law due to the perceived threat of compliance problems. We
   test these competing arguments using a dataset on all EU soft-law and
   hard-law instruments adopted between 1967 and 2019. The results show
   that preference heterogeneity increases the share of soft EU
   instruments. However, more past heterogeneity prompts EU legislators to
   decrease the proportion of softer measures in areas that experience high
   levels of past non-compliance.},

Abstract = {Models of agenda setting are central to the analysis of political
   institutions. Elaborations of the classical agenda-setting model of
   Romer-Rosenthal have long been used to make predictions about policy
   outcomes and the distribution of influence among political actors.
   Although the canonical model is based on complete and perfect
   information about preferences and policy outcomes, some extensions relax
   these assumptions to include uncertainty about preferences and reversion
   points. We consider a different type of uncertainty: incomplete
   knowledge of the mapping between policies and outcomes. In
   characterizing the optimal agenda setting under this form of
   uncertainty, we show that it amends substantively the implications of
   the Romer-Rosenthal model. We then extend the model dynamically and show
   that rich dynamics emerge under policy uncertainty. Over a longer
   horizon, we find that agenda control suppresses the incentive of
   legislators to experiment with policy, leading to less policy learning
   and worse outcomes than are socially efficient.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {825-839},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The conference in Poona that led to the foundation of Indian National
   Congress in 1885 aimed to serve as the germ of a native parliament to
   provide a reply to the assertion that India was still unfit for any form
   of representative institution. It spearheaded the Indian independence
   movement and post 1947 ushered in a `Congress system' of one-party
   dominance that represented a historical consensus with few parallels in
   any political party system in the world. Dialectical contradiction has
   been a historic recurrence in the Congress as `personality cults' of
   Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi in the early years and a `high
   command culture' later on decimated its hegemonic power in competitive
   party politics. The Congress declined due to a deficit of political
   vision, lack of forward-thinking ideas, engagement in competitive
   pseudo-secularism and diminishing electoral returns of dynastic
   (Nehru-Gandhi) politics. The institutionalization of BJP as a dominant
   party in 2014 coincided with the deinstitutionalization of the Congress
   party system. The grand old party needs to relegitimize itself by
   revamping its ideology, formulating a populist model of governance,
   creating son-of-the-soil leadership, revitalizing the party system,
   re-engaging with citizens, altering its politics to meritocracy and
   embracing new age electoral grammar.},

   Curriculum Change in Political Science, 2009-2019},

Abstract = {Thirty years after the last APSA-sponsored recommendations on the
   structure of the undergraduate political science major, new efforts at
   curriculum reform are under way. As a prelude to how the profession
   might respond, this article examines how political science departments
   made undergraduate curriculum changes during the 2010s. Based on a
   survey of department chairs in 2019-2020 (prior to the onset of the
   COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.), one-half of political science programs
   changed major requirements in the previous five years and 70\% made
   revisions during the decade. Most changes involved adding courses or
   tracks and modifying course sequences within the prevailing model of
   subfield distribution. Assuming departments are rational actors seeking
   to improve student learning and respond effectively to the educational
   marketplace, various explanations of curriculum change were tested.
   Structural variables (institutional type and departmental factors) had
   no significant effects. Nevertheless, the survey revealed learning-based
   (acquiring disciplinary knowledge, developing intellectual skills) and
   market-based (concern about enrollments) motivations for change, as well
   as institutional constraints. Among curricular alternatives to the
   distribution model, evidence indicated greater support for promoting
   liberal learning outcomes. Moreover, the civic engagement movement
   influenced departmental decision-making. However, few programs made
   curriculum changes related to diversity, equity, or social justice,
   notable concerns among students and within the discipline.},

Abstract = {Despite the fact that sectorial advisory councils have existed in Spain
   for decades, it is unknown whether there are major differences between
   them in terms of their functioning and results. This research seeks to
   contribute to a better empirical understanding of the reality of these
   mecha-nisms and to establish whether any of the cases analyzed could be
   considered as successful and exemplary. Using up to five dimensions of
   evaluation, the scores obtained by each council based on objective
   (institutional design) and subjective indicators (satisfaction of its
   participants) will be compared. lhe results indicate that none of the
   cases in the sample is a clear example of success. At the same time, it
   is evident that the councils focused on a specific theme (education) and
   a specific territorial level (the regional one) achieve, on the whole
   and significantly, the best scores.},

Abstract = {The extended constitutional process Ecuador has undergone since 2007 for
   the approval of its new Constitution and its subsequent application
   generated high expectations in the specific area of democratic
   development as the so-called citizen participation systems were
   implemented at the local level. This article offers a qualitative
   analysis based on documentary sources and information extracted from
   interviews and discussion groups with politicians, technicians and
   citizens, to understand the characteristics and achievements of the
   process of institutionalization of citizen participation and to assess
   its democratic quality. In spite of the good practices in the area of
   social participation, the results offer a scenario of highly
   institutionalized weak democracy, with little progress in terms of the
   direct and participatory democracy established in its Constitution.},

Abstract = {This research note deals with the think tanks that many parties have
   promoted. This phenom-enon has hardly been studied in Latin America
   despite the relevance it has acquired. As part of a larger project on
   centers of power within political parties that pays special attention to
   partisan think tanks, this research note is focused on the way
   legislation regulates partisan think tanks and their relationship with
   parties. Thirteen indicators are used to assess whether there is a
   specific treatment for think tanks in accordance with the type of
   functions they have assumed within the parties, the existence of
   specialized supervision of their activity, as well as their funding,
   including the type of economic relations allowed between think tanks and
   political parties. The prevailing trend in the eight cases analyzed is
   that, in contrast to the extensive legis-lation on electoral and party
   matters, there is a situation of under-legislation of party TT. They
   tend to share a similar legislative treatment and supervision Both their
   regulation and supervi-sion to other types of associations, even though
   their role is markedly different from that of other associations.},

Abstract = {Over the past three decades, the world has experienced significant
   turbulence, shaped by conflicts, global transformations, and crises
   within the international community. The end of the Cold War disrupted a
   long-established order, leaving both policymakers and scholars in
   uncharted territory. During the Cold War, international relations were
   more predictable, offering a stable framework for strategic analysis. In
   the aftermath, a wave of activity in the United States - fueled by a
   sense of victory - sought to redefine the future. This effort went
   beyond physical actions, extending into research institutions, think
   tanks, and academia, all striving to chart new courses in both practice
   and theory. Yet, the rapid pace of change and the fluid nature of the
   global landscape led to numerous missteps and misjudgments, affecting
   both major and middle powers to varying degrees. This paper examines the
   consequences of these intellectual efforts and the transitional phase
   that followed. It explores the defining features of this period and the
   forces that have shaped it. By shedding light on these dynamics, the
   paper aims to equip policymakers and scholars with the insights needed
   to better understand and influence the emerging international order. The
   ultimate goal is to foster a practical understanding of the challenges
   and opportunities ahead, helping navigate the complexities of the
   evolving global landscape.},

Abstract = {Research suggests that solidarity between people of color (PoC) is
   triggered when a marginalized ingroup believes they are discriminated
   similarly to another outgroup. This evidence has primarily focused on
   Asian Americans, Latinos, and Middle Eastern people, who are
   systematically discriminated against as foreigners. Yet evidence remains
   absent on Black people, who are systematically discriminated against as
   inferior, but not as foreign. Using a pair of pre-registered experiments
   with Black and Latino adults (N = 2060), we manipulated a shared sense
   of discrimination as inferior ({''}second class citizenship{''}). This
   treatment measurably increased Black solidarity with PoC, which then
   significantly boosted their support for pro-Latino policies (e.g., less
   Border Patrol agents along US-Mexico border). This pattern was
   reciprocated by Latinos, whose heightened solidarity with PoC increased
   their support for pro-Black initiatives (e.g., endorsing
   \#BlackLivesMatter). Sensitivity analyses further establish this
   pathway's viability. We discuss the implications for more effective
   coalition-building among racially minoritized groups in US politics.},

Abstract = {Research into and widespread knowledge about the Assyrian Genocide,
   called Seyfo by Assyrians, is a recent phenomenon. Assyrians themselves
   have always known of the tragic events that occurred during the First
   World War, but it took some time before these were conceptualized as
   genocide and became an important element in the collective memory of the
   people that demanded recognition. In this article, the author analyzes
   how, when, and why the established narrative of Seyfo developed and took
   shape in Sweden, a country with a substantial Assyrian community. This
   is done through analysis of how the tragedy has been described in
   Hujada, the official magazine of the Assyrian Federation of Sweden.},

   address this puzzle drawing on an analysis of official statements,
   media, in-depth interviews, and surveys in Georgia and Ukraine conducted
   in 2020 and 2021. Our data suggest that the churches' historical role as
   the pillar of the nation provided the necessary motivation and leverage
   against the government; their success, however, varied with respect to
   the level of church fragmentation.},

Abstract = {Intra-party factionalism and media fragmentation have emerged as two
   major trends in U.S. politics, especially on the right. We explore
   potential connections between these developments by analyzing Republican
   members of the U.S. House of Representatives' engagement with far-right
   alternative news media during the 116(th) Congress. We develop three
   discrete measures to scale representatives' engagement using hyperlinks
   to news media on Twitter, demonstrating their validity against existing
   positional data: roll-call voting, ideological caucus membership, and
   political rhetoric. We then apply our scales empirically, showing that
   representatives with further-right media engagement became increasingly
   radical in their online communication during the Trump presidency.
   Representatives with more moderate media engagement did not radicalize
   in this way. These results suggest a dynamic relationship that reflects
   the `dual function' of elite-media relations, where partisan elites
   serve as receivers of information and transmitters of intra-party
   signals in a fragmented media environment.},

Title = {Levelling Up the UK: If not the Conservatives, will Labour Learn the
   Lessons from Past Policy Failings?},

Volume = {94},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article considers the levelling-up agenda in the UK, examining the
   Johnson government's original proposals to tackle regional and local
   inequality and its continuation under new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak
   following the short-lived premiership of Liz Truss. The 2022 Levelling
   Up in the United Kingdom White Paper is notable for the frank and
   wholesale critique it provides of previous governments'-both Tory and
   Labour-efforts to address the pressing issue of geographic inequality.
   The assessment was that a pattern of ad hoc and incoherent reforms
   needed to be replaced by a stable, long term and system-wide approach to
   change. Yet, under Johnson, Truss and now Sunak, policy churn is
   continuing, with an approach that falls short in following the lessons
   set out in the White Paper. We provide a detailed analysis of the
   government's critique of past reforms, the lessons it has set out and
   why its reform programme is likely to repeat past failings. Crucially,
   the approach leaves the structure of central government almost
   untouched, with substantive reforms instead focussed at the local
   governance level. We argue the government's programme perpetuates the
   `power-hoarding' tendencies of the Westminster model, a key bulwark
   against meaningfully addressing the UK's spatial inequality problem. We
   conclude that the levelling-up agenda, missions and targets are unlikely
   to be met under Rishi Sunak, reflecting the endemic nature of
   short-termism and centralisation of power in the UK's public policy
   approach. We then consider the approach of Starmer's Labour Party to
   levelling up and the issues it needs to confront if it forms the next
   government.},

Abstract = {Experiments on the responsiveness of elected officials highlight the
   tension between the freedom to carry out research and the right of
   subjects to be treated with respect. Controversy emerges from the power
   of politicians to block or object to experimental designs using identity
   deception. One way to resolve this conundrum is to consult citizens who,
   as constituents of politicians, have an interest in promoting the
   accountability of elected representatives. Building on the work of
   Desposato and Naurin and ohberg, this survey experiment presented
   research designs to UK citizens for their evaluation. The findings show
   that citizens strongly approve of experimental research on Members of
   Parliament (MPs) and are glad to see their representatives participate.
   There are no differences in support whether designs use identity
   deception, debriefing, confederates or pre-agreement from MPs. Linked to
   high interest in politics, more citizens are glad their MPs participate
   in studies using identity deception than those deploying confederates.},

Abstract = {A recently published dataset of Middle East and North Africa
   (MENA)-focused scholarship in journals selected to represent the
   disciplinary ``core `` of political science sheds empirical light on key
   publishing trends, from the balance between quantitative and qualitative
   studies to the growth in experimental and ``large-N `` statistical
   methods. Cammett and Kendall's (2021) analysis shows that between 2001
   and 2019, MENA-focused studies declined as a share of publications but
   that slightly less than half of that work is qualitative. However, the
   definition of qualitative research that the study uses significantly
   overstates the number of such articles in the Cammett and Kendall
   dataset. Our analysis rectifies this, distinguishing among research
   studies that use qualitative evidence, qualitative methods, theoretical
   traditions, and paradigms (i.e., positivist/post-positivist). This
   yields a more accurate and significantly starker picture of the
   marginality of MENA qualitative research in core politics journals.
   These results raise the question of why methodologically sophisticated
   scholarship outside of the ``top journals `` has not been published
   there.},

Abstract = {Since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008, the EU has been
   tested and contested as it struggled to come to terms with a series of
   crises, sometimes labelled a polycrisis. In response to crises, the EU
   has emerged as a collective power and the concept `Collective Power
   Europe' (CPE) offers a promising lens with which to analyse the
   21st-century European Union and the nature of the polity that is
   emerging. The aim of this article is to unpack the concept of CPE and to
   analyse its core features - collective leadership and framing,
   institutional coordination and the evolving policy toolkit - in response
   to three crises: Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {Re-election of all incumbent Presidents, most of them from the Socialist
   Party (PS) or the Republicans (LR), was the main feature of the French
   regional elections of 20 and 27 June 2021. As a result, regional
   government remained controlled by the two parties that have dominated
   French politics since the early 1980s, even though both lost the 2017
   presidential and legislative elections to newcomer Emmanuel Macron. The
   second-order elections model captures part of these dynamics, but the
   candidate-centered politics model provides a more appropriate framework
   to understand the general pattern of these regional elections. In a
   context of increasing split-ticket voting between regional and
   departmental elections, which were held at the same time, an era of
   divided government seems to have emerged since 2017.},

Abstract = {Previous work suggests that observing women officeholders increases
   women's political ambition. Yet, jumps in women's representation in the
   United States' ``Years of the Woman{''}-following the Anita Hill
   testimonies and the election of Donald Trump-are linked to women's
   exclusion from political decision-making. Drawing on focus groups with
   prospective women candidates, we theorize that exclusion when combined
   with a gendered policy threat increases women's political ambition.
   Using survey experiments replicated across different samples, we show
   that women who read about an all-male city council poised to legislate
   on women's rights report increased ambition compared with their
   pretreatment ambition levels and to women in other treatment groups.
   Women's increased sense of political efficacy drives these results. When
   women's rights are not under discussion, men's overrepresentation does
   not move (or even depresses) women's ambition. Seeing the policy
   consequences of their exclusion causes some women to seek a seat at the
   table.},

Abstract = {I rally behind Floyd's call to arms for an approach to political
   philosophy based on the broad hope `that we can successfully treat
   certain forms of human action as expressions {[}of] normative
   preferences ripe for conversion into political principles'. I have
   doubts, however, about his use of social science: it is too selective
   and is selected on the basis of the avoidance of two social evils and
   thus does not answer the fundamental questions of political philosophy
   about the good life and a polity that is based on positive ideals and
   aspirations. Nor do I see that the avoidance of the normative aloofness
   of `continental' critical theory requires the postulation of a universal
   human nature, a postulate that in any case is unavailable.},

Abstract = {Does technological change fuel political disruption? Drawing on
   fine-grained labor market data from Germany, this paper examines how
   technological change affects regional electorates. We first show that
   the well-known decline in manufacturing and routine jobs in regions with
   higher robot adoption or investment in information and communication
   technology (ICT) was more than compensated by parallel employment growth
   in the service sector and cognitive non-routine occupations. This change
   in the regional composition of the workforce has important political
   implications: Workers trained for these new sectors typically hold
   progressive political values and support progressive pro-system parties.
   Overall, this composition effect dominates the politically perilous
   direct effect of automation-induced substitution. As a result,
   technology-adopting regions are unlikely to turn into
   populist-authoritarian strongholds.},

Abstract = {Steffen Ganghof's Beyond Presidentialism and Parliamentarism can improve
   existing typologies in comparative government and has great potential
   for discussions about democratic innovation and reform. So far,
   democratic innovations like deliberative mini-publics have remained
   mostly additive, leaving the underlying decision-making logics of
   representative political systems unchanged. Ganghof's ideas can move
   debates about how deliberative democracy is to be institutionalized
   forward. Semi-parliamentary government constitutes an intriguing option
   to meet both demands for legislative flexibility and responsiveness to
   citizens' concerns and demands for stability and accountability. At the
   same time, I identify a limitation of the book in the fact that
   Ganghof's normative theory of democracy remains thin. To appeal to
   citizens in constitutional reform processes, proposals for
   semi-parliamentary reform need to do more than reconcile conflicting
   visions of majority rule. They need to speak to democracy's central
   promises of equal autonomy and rationality.},

Title = {Conceptual Replication of Four Key Findings about Factual Corrections

Abstract = {In the final two months of the 2020 US election, we conducted eight
   panel experiments to evaluate the immediate and medium-term effects of
   misinformation and factual corrections. Our results corroborate four
   sets of existing findings: fact-checks reliably improve factual
   accuracy, while misinformation degrades it; effects of fact-checks on
   belief accuracy endure, though they fade with time; effects on attitudes
   are minuscule; and there are important partisan asymmetries. We also
   offer one new empirical finding suggesting that effect heterogeneities
   by personality type and cognitive style may reflect attention paid to
   treatments. Our study confirms that the fundamental push and pull of
   misinformation and factual corrections on political beliefs holds even
   in electoral settings as saturated with mistruths as the 2020 US
   election.},

   vision and follows the struggle to survive in circumstances similar to
   those faced by the new campuses of the 1960s. While the details may be
   unique, a number of features and processes are described which may be
   endemic to those satellite and multi-institutional campuses which are
   changing the shape of higher education in the UK.},

Volume = {22},

Pages = {101-118},

Abstract = {This article analyses and explains the rapid electoral success of an
   emergent populist radical right party in Romania-the Alliance for the
   Union of Romanians (AUR). AUR's definition of `a transnational people'
   relates to a multi-layered community-native Romanians within Romania,
   co-ethnic communities in neighbouring countries, and Romanians living
   and working abroad-that create, together, a Romanianness in need of
   representation, and preservation. By focusing on AUR's definition of
   `the people' and on (trans)national mobilization, we unwrap a new
   dimension of populism which refers to broader fields of connectedness
   across borders in which bottom-up and top-down dynamics co-exist, acting
   as rhetorical and operational openings for the party's development and
   success in the homeland arena.},

Abstract = {The study of electoral system reform is often focused on consolidated
   democracies. This special issue on electoral reforms in the
   Mediterranean region selects both consolidated democracies and moderate
   authoritarian systems. It analyses reforms under the aspects of how they
   deal with the dilemma between improving `governability' by majoritarian
   instruments versus increasing proportionality of representation. While
   governability also depends on other factors, public debates are
   frequently structured along this dichotomy, which also affects the
   outcome of the reform process. The Mediterranean focus reflects the
   higher degree of reform activities in this policy area (for instance
   compared to the Nordic countries), which helps to focus on drivers,
   scope, direction, and vested interests of electoral reforms.},

Abstract = {Significant progress has been made in mapping the media efforts as well
   as the media coverage of policy advocates such as interest groups, think
   tanks and private corporations. However, less attention has been devoted
   to connecting media efforts to media coverage. In this research note, we
   therefore ask: To what extent do the media-targeted activities of policy
   advocates actually influence the news? In a first analytic step, we use
   three different methods to assess whether interest groups influence the
   news: automated identification based on anti-plagiarism software,
   computer-assisted topic modelling and manual word search. Based on the
   results of this first analysis, we use manual word search to identify
   possible media effects of a larger sample of all press releases issued
   by five major Danish interest groups in 2018. We conclude that the press
   releases issued by interest groups have very little-and most often
   no-direct influence on the news.},

Abstract = {Financial regulation is often adopted in the wake of scandals and
   crises. Yet political science has little to say about the political
   effects of corporate scandals. We break that silence, asking whether
   exposure to news coverage of bank scandals changes the preferences of
   voters for financial regulation. Drawing from the literatures on media
   influence and public opinion, we argue that news coverage of bank
   scandals should increase voters' appetite for regulation. We test our
   hypothesis with data from six countries, using original nationally
   representative panel surveys with embedded experiments (total N =
   27,673). Our pooled and country-specific analyses largely support our
   expectation that exposure to news coverage of scandals increases
   regulatory preferences. We reproduce this finding in a separate survey
   wave, using different scandals than in our original analysis. These
   results contribute to studies on media influence on public opinion, the
   political significance of scandals, and the political economy of
   regulation.},

Abstract = {Australian and British strategic interests diverged after the early
   1970s. As London's horizons narrowed, Canberra held tight to Australia's
   alliance with the US and looked to emerging Asia for economic
   opportunities. Recently, however, Australian and UK strategic interests
   have reconverged, as concern grows in both countries about China's
   growing assertiveness. The AUKUS arrangement is the clearest signal of
   this shift, but, as Ian Hall argues, the substance of Australia-UK
   strategic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific is yet to be determined and
   several challenges loom.},

Abstract = {The dynamics between international organisations' activity of
   scriptwriting universalised models and theorising the local effects of
   such models has been a little studied aspect of world society research.
   In this paper, we seek to bridge this gap in the existing research. We
   examine one prominent IO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
   Development (OECD), and its flagship reports, and how the policy
   proposals promoted therein have changed from the 1960s to the 2010s. Our
   analysis reveals that from the 1990s onwards the themes addressed
   proliferate and the language becomes more abstract, while references to
   other countries' policies also increase. In parallel, the actual policy
   proposals aimed at the countries evaluated expand and become more
   detailed, containing explicit links to national contexts and conditions.
   We suggest that these changes in the issuing of policy recommendations
   reflect strategic decisions by the OECD to facilitate the domestication
   of its reform ideas.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the link between implicit racial bias and right-wing
   populism. Using data from 41,803 participants, I explore whether
   implicit racial bias predicts the support of right-wing populist parties
   (RPP) in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The results reveal a
   significant association between implicit racial bias and support of RPP,
   even when controlling for explicit bias. Additional analyses show that
   the effect of implicit racial bias is especially high for participants
   with high levels of explicit racial bias. Participants with negative
   explicit racial bias are thus especially likely to support RPP if they
   also have high levels of negative implicit racial bias. The study also
   finds a significant effect for participants with no explicit racial
   bias, although the effect is markedly smaller.},

Abstract = {Welfare states have traditionally been studied through quantitative
   tools such as indices and qualitative ones such as typologies. However,
   there seems to be a lack of analytical tools that simultaneously show
   welfare state outcomes and development potential. In this paper, we
   developed the Welfare State Scattergram. This result of two indices
   gives the welfare state's outcomes and fiscal capacity, the latter
   serving as a proxy for improvement potential. The indicator used for the
   X-axis is a modified debt-sustainability formula to indicate fiscal
   capacity and, thus, the development potential of the welfare state. The
   indicator used for the Y-axis gives the welfare state outcomes and
   consists of a weighted welfare state outcomes indicator.},

Title = {European Think Tanks as a Channel of EU Public Diplomacy Towards
   Transnational Publics},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {200-212},
Abstract = {This article examines the role of European think tanks in public
   diplomacy efforts of the EU. It builds on Bourdieu's field theory and
   concept of capital using data from EU official documents, website
   materials, and semi-structured interviews with representatives of think
   tanks from Brussels, France, Slovenia, and the United Kingdom, as well
   as their networks and the EU institutions. The article argues that EU
   institutions provide financial support for think tanks to obtain
   political capital in the form of internal and external legitimacy. The
   European Commission mobilises think tank academic capital by funding
   their educational activities, which helps to deal with the ``democratic
   deficit{''} and plays the role of intellectual ``soft power{''} by
   training current and future policymakers in Europe and beyond as
   potential allies in competition with other regions. Due to the
   particularity of the EU public sphere, characterised by the lack of
   outreach mass media, the European Commission tries to improve its
   capacity to shape public opinion at the European and global levels by
   using think tank publicity capital in its communication activities via
   new media platforms, distinguished by direct access to wider audiences.
   The European Commission benefits from think tank social capital,
   encouraging them to create transnational networks regarded as
   contributing to the promotion of integration within the EU, building
   relations with candidate countries, and strengthening its position in
   multilateral negotiations. Although the citizen's dimension is not
   always at the core of practices of European think tanks, this article
   demonstrates their effectiveness as a channel of public diplomacy
   towards transnational publics.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the East-West conflict, Russia has been supplying
   armaments to China. Militarily and technologically, Russia was once far
   superior to China. In the meantime, however, China's defence industry is
   now able to produce cutting -edge technology on its own, from air
   defence systems and fighter planes to intercontinental ballistic
   missiles. The Chinese market for Russia's defence industry is shrinking.
   The People's Liberation Army still benefits from the Russian armed
   forces through joint manoeuvres and officer training in Russia, as these
   bring in lessons learned from combat in Chechnya, Syria, and Ukraine. It
   is only a matter of time before Russia becomes the junior partner in
   arms and military cooperation with China.},

   Ukrainian citizens in the conditions of martial law wascarried out: for
   social protection, for housing, for a sufficientstandard of living. The
   place of social rights in the system ofhuman rights, their legal
   regulation and mechanisms for ensuringthem are determined. It was
   concluded that there are such typesof social protection of the family,
   childhood, maternity andpaternity as social assistance, social services
   and social benefits. In addition,the general principles and legal
   regulation of family and child protectionin Ukraine are defined, the
   main directions of transformations aimed atensuring rights in the social
   sphere are described. In particular, the stateguarantees of compliance
   with the rights, freedoms and legitimate interestsof internally
   displaced persons displaced by war were analyzed. Finally, itwas noted
   the presence of consolidated approaches to judicial practice inthe field
   of family relations, in particular, in terms of the primacy of

Title = {Varieties of Anti-Globalism: The Italian Government's Evolving Stance on
   the EU's Investment Screening Mechanism},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {177-187},
Abstract = {In 2017, Italy, France, and Germany jointly supported the setting up of
   an EU-wide investment screening mechanism to strengthen the EU's
   capacity to screen and eventually block foreign investments. In a few
   months, however, the Italian government changed position dramatically,
   shifting from leading supporter to staunchest opposer of this policy
   initiative. Such a change of positioning was decisive in both watering
   down the initial proposal and moving forward with the idea of a looser
   mechanism coordinating national investment screening activities. This
   article develops an explanation of the Italian government's changing
   negotiating stance. We develop an argument that stresses how two factors
   combined to produce this puzzling outcome. First, we stress the role of
   political parties as drivers of governments' foreign economic policy
   choices. More specifically, we show that the preferences of the parties
   forming the Italian government after the 2018 general elections (the
   Lega Nord and the Five Star Movement) were crucial in shaping Italy's
   evolving stance on this important issue. Second, we highlight the
   implications of the tension that exists between two different
   ``varieties{''} of anti-globalism. While ``self-proclaimed{''}
   anti-globalist political parties usually combine a traditional critique
   of globalization and opposition to further political integration in the
   EU, they may be forced to prioritize one over the other when they prove
   incompatible. In this context, we show how Italian anti-globalist
   parties' choice to prioritize anti-Europeanism over anti-globalism led
   them to prefer strengthening domestic-level institutions to screen FDIs
   rather than allowing the EU to acquire new powers.},

Title = {Parliamentary Women Opposition Leaders: A Comparative Assessment Across
   28 OECD Countries},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},

Pages = {85-96},
Abstract = {While women have increasingly gained access to the position of
   opposition leader, we still know very little about their pathways to
   that office. Therefore, this article seeks to uncover the dynamics and
   patterns that shape the ascendency of women politicians to the office of
   opposition leader from a comparative perspective. In this article,
   opposition leaders are understood as the parliamentary party group
   leaders of the largest non-governing party in a given legislative
   assembly, which marks the closest equivalent to the Westminster
   understanding of leaders of the opposition that continues to dom-inate
   international notions of opposition leaders and oppositional leadership
   in parliamentary democracies. We draw on data from opposition leaders in
   28 parliamentary democracies between 1996-2020 to identify opportunity
   structures that allow women opposition leaders to emerge across
   countries. In addition, we test how factors on the individual level
   (e.g., previous experience in party and parliament as well as in
   government) and at the party level (e.g., ideology) affect the
   likelihood that a parliamentary opposition leader is a woman. Our
   analyses demonstrate that the share of women in par-liament
   significantly increases the likelihood that at least one of the
   parliamentary opposition leaders of the past 25 years was a woman.
   Moreover, opposition leaders in leftist parties are more likely to be
   women than their more rightist coun-terparts. Surprisingly, and contrary
   to our expectations, previous political experience does not shape the
   probability of women becoming opposition leaders. Thus, overall, the
   institutional and ideological contexts of selecting parliamentary
   opposition leaders seem to matter more than the experience and
   qualifications of individual candidates.},

Abstract = {Lobbying firms seek access to policymaking by hiring individuals with
   connections to government officials and with previous experience as
   government employees. This paper examines a different avenue for access:
   the transition of a firm's lobbyists into government roles. We find
   firms frequently forge connections to government in this manner and
   their business benefits as a result. Using panel data from 2001 to 2020
   of U.S. federal bureaucrats and congressional staff matched to lobbying
   records, we quantify the value to lobbying firms when their employees
   enter government service. We find lobbying firms that gain government
   connections through the departure of one of their lobbyists experience a
   36\% revenue increase, or roughly \$320,000 per year. In examining what
   drives this increase in revenue, we find firms present connections as a
   premium service to existing clients and that connections to
   congressional offices are more valuable than those gained to executive
   branch agencies. These results shed light onto the business model of
   lobbying firms and the political economy of the lobbying industry.},

Abstract = {In the current moment marked by the imprint of the digital era and by
   the technological advances of the fourth industrial revolution,
   artificial intelligence (AI) has been developed in different human
   activities, such as: health, entertainment, security,
   telecommunications, art and government. In this sense, the objective of
   this article was to analyze the capabilities of AI in the new forms of
   digital government, among which the following stand out: smart cities,
   open government and democracy 2.0. Methodologically, this is a
   documentary research, based on some aspects of the Cartesian method. In
   addition, the technique of open interviews with two social scientists
   was used to know their opinion about the possible problems and benefits
   brought by the use of IA in government work. The information analyzed
   allows us to conclude that, in the near future, the use of AI in
   different government activities will be very common, in order to
   increase efficiency and effectiveness in public management and reduce
   traditional corruption practices. However, the problems that AI may have
   in technological and political terms for the true being of democracy are
   not ruled out.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},

Volume = {11},

Pages = {212-222},
Abstract = {Since the 2010s the EU has expanded its preferential trade agreements,
   responding to challenges at the World Trade Organization and
   preferential trade agreements of key geoeconomic competitors. However,
   preferential trade agreements are only as good as their implementation.
   The EU 2021 Trade Policy Review for a more assertive trade policy
   includes a greater focus on preferential trade agreement implementation.
   An analysis of preferential trade agreement implemen-tation reports
   identifies challenges in operationalising these. It shows that since
   2019 there has been an increase in EU recourse to formal dispute
   settlement mechanisms under preferential trade agreements demonstrating
   the shift to greater assertiveness. Interestingly, most of the cases are
   of limited economic significance to the EU but serve to reinforce the
   mes-sage of enforcement of trade rules.},

Pages = {276-288},
Abstract = {In December 2021, the European Commission proposed a directive creating
   five criteria for the presumed classification of platform economy
   workers as salaried employees. The issue is timely, of course, as the
   digital organisation of work continues to grow rapidly. Our article
   contrasts the merits and limitations of this initiative to the Canadian
   experience concerning so-called independent contractors in the platform
   economy. In fact, Canadian labour law has long recognised a third status
   of workers-dependent contractors. It permits collective bargaining,
   while platform workers remain autonomous, notably for tax purposes.
   Immediately, the striking similarities between the European Union's five
   criteria and judicial tests applied by Canadian labour tribunals seem to
   indicate that both entities are moving in the same direction. However,
   the federal structure of labour law in Canada and the single market's
   social dimension also pose important challenges regarding the uniform
   implementation of new protections. Based on recent fieldwork in Toronto,
   and as the European Union directive moves into the approval and
   implementation stages, our article addresses the research question of
   how basic labour rights in the platform economy progress similarly (or
   differently), and which actors are driving the change on each side of
   the Atlantic. We argue that this policy field provides labour market
   actors with opportunities for ``institutional experimentation{''}
   navigating the openings and limitations of federalism.},

Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Number = {42},
Pages = {24-42},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article has a twin mission: examining the impact of party merger on
   the federal arrangement and its association with the current conflicts
   in Ethiopia. The 1995 federal constitution of Ethiopia devolves powers
   to regional states. Since then, each regional state was fused with its
   distinct ruling party that created a coalition at the federal level.
   This state-party fused federal arrangement faced serious challenges with
   the rise of intra-coalition disagreements since 2016 following the
   protest movements in the country, which further plunged Ethiopia into a
   devastating civil war since November 2020. This article asks what caused
   the conflicts. While recognizing the multidimensional roots of the
   conflicts, this article uses a political party-driven theory of
   federalism in order to identify the political processes that led to the
   conflicts. It argues that in a multiethnic federation such as Ethiopia
   where there is state-party fusion, a ruling party's metamorphosis from a
   coalition to a union may not only centralize power but could also result
   in both de facto merger of that fragile federation and conflicts.
   Delinking the state from the party through inclusive national
   negotiations and democratic elections within a federal arrangement might
   help transition Ethiopia to a stable country.},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors share their research on a curriculum for
   social justice, truth, and then reconciliation as put forth by the First
   Nations Child and Family Caring Society (Caring Society). The Caring
   Society is a non-profit organization that advocates for equity and
   social justice for First Nations children and creates social justice
   educational materials for Canadian learners. The authors provide an
   overview of the Caring Society campaigns and educational research. More
   specifically, they discuss how the Caring Society is creating
   educational resources that center a child and youth-driven civil rights
   movement across the school curriculum. Such curricular and pedagogical
   approaches focus on truth and then reconciliation, Indigenous
   sovereignty, and position a social justice pedagogy. They then discuss
   some of the ways we might advocate relational forms of citizenship that
   seek to honour the truth, and then reconciliation education.},

Abstract = {The article explores the private law regime of human geneticinformation.
   To achieve the objective, an analysis of bibliographicsources in the
   field of genetic and genomic research, legal supportfor the circulation
   of genetic information and its legal protectionwas carried out. The
   document also analyses the provisions ofthe legislation and practice of
   the United States and the MemberStates of the European Union. General
   and specific methods ofscientific knowledge, including dialectical
   methods, formal logicand comparative law, were used to solve the
   problems raised. Thearticle clarifies the doctrinal and legal
   definitions of the conceptsof ``genome{''} and ``gene{''} of an
   individual. It points out the dualnature of the human gene as a material
   object: a DNA molecule, and also as a unit of hereditary information
   that is intangible in nature. The article explores the possibility of
   attributing genetic information to objects of civil rights, in
   particular material objects, intangible movable property and the results
   of intellectual activity. The conclusions support the need to
   distinguish between the concepts of genetic information and genomics. In
   addition, it reviews theoretical approaches to define the concept and
   nature of genetic information},

Abstract = {The new geopolitical situation, which is changing before our eyes,
   highlights the specific role of Israeli-Ukrainian relations. The
   researchers present in the article a brief digression into the history
   of these relations, which dates back a little more than three decades,
   reveal the main aspects of bilateral interaction and its political,
   social and economic dimensions; analyze the causes and problems that
   prevent the two states from overcoming the accumulated negative trends
   and establishing a full-fledged cooperation. The articles that have
   recently appeared in the domestic and foreign press are mainly
   informational in nature, and they focus on aspects related to Israel's
   unwillingness to participate in NATO countries' campaign fully support
   of the Kiev regime's confrontation with Russia. In this regard, the
   authors attempted to analyze a significant part of the complex of
   problems that have a key impact on the algorithm of development of
   Israeli-Ukrainian relations. The main result of the study is to answer a
   fundamentally important question: why, being a key strategic partner of
   the United States in the Middle East region, Israel, in contrast to the
   Russophobic position taken by NATO countries and their satellites,
   adheres to more balanced and constructive approache to the situation
   around Ukraine after Russia launched its special military operation.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {108},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to clarifying the understanding of the nature of
   politics. Having documented the lack of consensus in the scientific
   discourse even regarding the very concept of politics, the author
   proposes an approach that, from his point of view, allows to obtain the
   most consistent conceptualization of the political. In his study of the
   nature of politics, the author relies primarily on the analysis of the
   phenomenon of polis, because, despite serious disagreements in the
   scientific circles about what politics is, its origin is generally
   associated with polis. Based on the works of Plato and Aristotle and
   drawing on the works of modern historians and political philosophers, he
   demonstrates the inadequacy of the interpretation of polis as a city,
   state or society, and proposes to consider polis as a sphere of
   ``supra-physical{''} and ``supra-economic{''} activity of citizens in
   external and internal harmonization of public space. In the development
   of the transcendentalist tradition, the article shows that polis is
   primarily an ontological reality, a place where (in the eyes of the
   Greeks) the existence of being was manifested. Taking into account the
   connection between polis and politics in the ancient world, the author
   comes to the conclusion that politics as a practice of organizing life
   in polis is an activity for the formation and maintenance of ontological
   reality. Such an understanding of politics, in his opinion, is valid not
   only in relation to antiquity. Therefore, he defines politics as an
   ontological action, in which a struggle for the fate of being unfolds
   every time. In this respect, the nature of ancient politics differs
   little from the nature of medieval and modern politics. Despite all the
   differences between modern and premodern political discourse, this
   definition quite adequately characterizes the nature of the political
   per se.},

Journal = {POLITOLOGIJA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {111},
Number = {3},
Pages = {8-40},
Abstract = {The paper dwells on the longitudinal data set of Lithuanian
   parliamentary candidates' views and investigates the post-communist
   politics of memory. The analyzed surveys are conducted in 2008, 2012 and
   2016. Several hypotheses regarding the impact of time, democratic
   consolidation and geopolitical challenges on the national level of the
   politics of memory are tested, and we examine differences among party
   families regarding the politics of memory. The list of dependent
   variables of this study includes the attitudes of the parliamentary
   candidates and their determination to implement lustration, ban the
   public display of Soviet symbols and implement the claim that Russia
   must compensate the damage inflicted on Lithuania during the Soviet
   occupation. The study reveals that the politics of memory remains a
   matter of contention shaped by the dynamic interaction of three kinds of
   logic: transitional (based on the need to mark a break from the previous
   regime), post-transitional (encouraged by expiring early transitional
   conventions and re-articulated geopolitical visions), and partisan
   (inspired by multi-party electoral competition).},

Title = {BENEFITS OF USING ALEXANDER BOGDANOV'S ORGANIZATIONAL THEORY IN
   EXPLAINING THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},

Abstract = {The current development crises of the European Union (EU) reveals at
   least a slowdown in the pace of integration, if not ia rollback on
   common policies. The seeming lack of connection between events like
   Brexit, European debt crisis or the rise of Eurosceptic parties, leads
   to their isolation as subjects of research. However, there is an
   alternative view that all these events are different manifestations of a
   single process which is consistent with a deep transformation of the EU
   political system. Transformation implies both integration and
   disintegration. In this article, organizational theory (tectology) is
   presented from the perspective of applying the concepts proposed by
   Alexander Bogdanov to the processes of change in the united Europe.
   Classical theories of European integration are limited because they
   focus on the drivers of integration rather than disintegration. With the
   politicization of integration, growth of its influence on everyday life
   of European citizens and changes in the EU itself, a demand appeared for
   a new theory that could explain these changes (including crises). The
   article analyzes modern theoretical and methodological approaches in
   European studies, including postfunctionalism. The blind side of
   postfunctionalism is its extensive expansion of the subject field.
   Despite the predominance of this theory in modern European studies, it
   is not a system theory, meaning that another turn of EU transformation
   will require a new theory to explain it. The organizational theory of A.
   Bogdanov, being a system theory, is able to provide the necessary
   assumption and concepts in order to explain crisis phenomena (including
   disintegration) as part of a larger process. A distinctive feature of
   Bogdanov's tectology is considering a (political) system as a
   ``living{''} creature capable of self-regulation and adaptation. This
   approach to the study of democratic political systems seems to yield
   better insights in the functioning of the modern International Relations
   system.},

   studies that is not only enriched by queer/cuir thinking and activism,
   but also contributes to contemporary gender-based dissident proposals.
   This article presents some epistemic contributions from the

   religious. An example of this theological integration refers to the
   program of the Doctorate in Critical Gender Studies (DECG) at the

   this article is to analyze the intersection of body-gender-religion from
   the hermeneutical approach of the book The Queer God, by the Argentine

Abstract = {The context of contemporary democracies began to change years ago with
   the exponential development of the media and information and
   communication technologies (ICT). To this was added the irruption of the
   internet and, currently, artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet
   of things (IoT), which are promoting far-reaching changes in all social
   orders. This article starts from the question about the implications of
   the context marked by AI and IoT for democracy and, specifically, for
   the exercise of citizenship. Next, what this new context has meant for
   the participation mechanisms is exposed, emphasizing the changes in the
   relationship between citizens and the Public Administration. To
   continue, the challenges that this new scenario poses for the Public
   Administration are analyzed. Finally, the possibility that this new
   context is determining the configuration of a new type of citizenship is
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Throughout these forty years of uninterrupted democracy in Argentina,
   tourism has been progressively incorporated into the public agenda and
   into government agendas of various scales. How is tourism included in
   these complex and dynamic agendas? In what terms is it configured as a
   public issue? In order to answer these questions, some elements make it
   possible to reconstruct a genealogy-neither exhaustive nor definitive,
   but academically and socially relevant-about the incorporation of
   tourism in the agendas of democracy: the public policy approach, the
   gender perspective and the commitment to accessibility.},

Abstract = {Although unfolding a continent away, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is
   detrimental to the strategic stability of East Asia, which is already
   riven by its own unresolved conflicts and territorial control disputes.
   The degradation of global security norms, the disruption to global
   energy supplies and the need to pick sides for or against Russia have
   each contributed to making East Asia's security a more complex Rubik's
   cube to manage. This article examines the implications of Russia's
   invasion of Ukraine on Russia-China relations; Taiwan Strait's
   stability; Japan's defence policy; and the Korean peninsula. How and on
   what terms Russia's invasion ends will carry another set of impacts and
   lessons for East Asia. In closing, the lessons of freezing conflicts in
   East Asia are applied to the emerging situation in Eastern Europe: of an
   unresolveable and unwinnable war that may become a lasting feature of
   European security, in the way that unresolved wars over Korea and Taiwan
   have become enduring realities in East Asia.},

Abstract = {When the Bolsheviks organized the administration of the Soviet state a
   hundred years ago, they did so primarily according to
   national-ethnographic principles. They deviated from this as soon as
   they saw the ``interests of the Union{''} at risk. In territorial
   revisions between the Union republics after Stalin's death, economic
   issues were crucial. Ideological constructs such as ``friendship of
   peoples{''} or ``gifts{''} between the Union republics were not
   categories in Soviet spatial thinking. Today, economic aspects and
   access to water play an important role in territorial conflicts and wars
   in the post-Soviet space. This applies to Crimea, the border war between
   Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and the wars in the South Caucasus.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {189-199},
Abstract = {The article conceptualizes global performance indicators as public
   measures that are powerful but also receive a wide range of criticism.
   Global performance indicators derive their power from combining three
   analytically distinct elements: (a) commensuration (comparing
   performances on a common metric), (b) visual simplification (presenting
   performances in an appealing format), and (c) serialization (framing
   performance as a continuous developing property). However, the very same
   elements are often subject to criticism. The producers of global
   performance indicators, therefore, defend method-ologies and the
   validity of commensurated numbers, meet charges of visual
   oversimplification by professing sobriety and nuance, and balance
   temporal continuity and discontinuity. By conceptualizing global
   performance indicators as powerful and criticized public measures, the
   article draws attention to the Janus face of valuation, which the
   producers must tackle continuously. Investing considerable time, energy,
   and resources, these organizations are a key feature of today's vast
   indi-cator culture.},

Abstract = {The Economic globalization and the transnational integration of capitals
   provide a centripetal impulse to global capitalism, while, in turn, the
   political fragmentation offers a powerful centrifugal counter-impulse
   that is resulting in the escalation of geopolit-ical conflict. The abyss
   is widening rapidly between the economic unity of the global capital,
   and the po-litical competition between ruling groups seeking to obtain
   legitimacy and those aiming at preventing the internal social order of
   their respective nations from fracturing in the face of a growing crisis
   of global capitalism. In this scenario, States are attempting to
   transfer the burden of this crisis onto the working and popular classes,
   as they for instance resort to more repressive, authoritarian, and even
   fascist forms of government, in addition to various ideological and
   rhetorical devices, to contain societal discontent. Much of the left not
   only seems unable to conceptu-alize the transformation that has been
   occurring in these last decades of capitalist globalization, but
   in-stead clings tenaciously to a formula that conversely ossifies the
   singular American empire, seconded by the Triad countries and the rest
   of the world as vic-tims of such empire. According to this formula,
   any-thing that appears to challenge the Unique Enemy is seen as
   progressive, part of a just struggle of the op-pressed and, more
   importantly, an effort deserving of support. However, while a
   self-declared ``anti-imperialist{''} left condemns the capitalist
   exploitation and repression around the world when it is carried out by
   the United States and other Western powers or governments they support;
   it turns a blind eye to, or even defends, repressive, authoritarian, and
   dicta-torial regimes simply because these states face hos-tilities from
   Washington. Thus, I will discuss here the cases of China, Nicaragua, the
   BRICS and, mul-tipolarity as they expose the convoluted logic and the
   retrograde politics of the ``anti-imperialist{''} left.},

Abstract = {The Crimea Platform is a diplomatic initiative of Ukraine, designed as
   an international coordination mechanism to reverse the 2014 annexation
   of the Crimean Peninsula by the Russian Federation. The initiative
   attracted the attention of EU member states, due to the very nature of
   the annexation - a result of Russia's aggressive and assertive foreign
   policy. However, attitudes to the issue of the annexation and the
   perception of its impact on the security of the EU vary greatly from one
   Crimea Platform participant to another, which leads to numerous
   discussions on the level of the security threat to the EU and the
   support to be provided to its eastern neighbours. For this article, I
   have used process tracing to track the formation of the attitudes to the
   annexation of EU members participating in the Crimea Platform, which is
   an essential step in conducting a comprehensive analysis of European
   solidarity in the face of external security threats.},

Abstract = {In recent years, political philosophy has increasingly faced the
   question about the nature of the contemporary war. Despite the invention
   of nuclear weapons, war has not disappeared from the historical scene.
   However, has its essence remained unchanged? In an era of global
   political communication, when it is increasingly difficult to separate
   foreign policy from domestic policy, do the trends in the development of
   military conflicts correspond to the classical ideas about war? One
   definitely needs a clear paradigm that would help to trace the common
   logic behind the whole variety of such conflicts taking place in the
   world today. The article is devoted to the consideration of one of these
   paradigms, which is gaining momentum among political theorists. It
   concerns the conceptualization of all the modern military conflicts as a
   global civil war. Based on the works of Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt,
   the author outlines the general contours of this approach, after which
   he turns to the analysis of the phenomenon of s civil strife, described
   by the ancient Greek notion of stasis - a term that Giorgio Agamben put
   back to the current political vocabulary. His detailed study of the
   original meaning of stasis and its interpretation in the works of Nicole
   Loraux and Agamben reveals the potential of this concept to be a
   theoretical tool for understanding the logic of modern war.},

Title = {The criminalization of border solidarity and the Law as a double-edged
   weapon},

Abstract = {Criminalization of solidarity towards migrants at the external and
   internal borders of Europe is in full swing. It roots into the wider
   process of criminalisation of racialised foreigners and their mobility
   towards and within Europe, as well as into the increasing
   judicialization of direct activism and grassroots social movements on
   the ground of anti-terrorism. Law and society scholarship has grasped
   the complex relationship between legal institutions or tools and social
   movements, and how these latter can use Law as an offensive or defensive
   weapon to protect themselves and enhance their cause. Activists can also
   turn the weapon of Law against the State, when using repressive measures
   and trials as mediatic and political stages to launch general statements
   and denounce the State's inconsistency and law violations. Aiming at
   contributing to the understanding of the room and conditions to
   transform judicialization into a political weapon, the article
   investigates a peculiar case of criminalization of solidarity, namely
   the territorial bans issued by Italian police against ``No Border{''}
   activists on the French-Italian border of Ventimiglia since 2015. It
   points out that, in spite of the annulment of the bans obtained by the
   defendants and their lawyers in court, the peculiar features of the
   repressive tool, of the social movement itself and of the context in
   which they occurred, strongly limited the possibility of a political
   reversal of judicialization. Crossing a legal opportunities framework
   with a legal consciousness perspective, the article also shows the
   plurality of activists' attitudes towards law and the effects of
   criminalization on activists' life paths.},

   Rafanelli's promoting justice across borders},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 21},
Abstract = {In Promoting Justice Across Borders, Lucia Rafanelli develops an ethical
   theory of `reform intervention': a deliberate attempt to promote justice
   in a foreign society. The theory specifies which types of interventions
   are justified under what circumstances and who is justified in
   intervening where. Rafanelli's theory eschews nation-states and instead
   makes its main actors societies with capacity for self-determination.
   This, I argue, can make the theory hard to apply, because different
   societies can overlap or intersect, and the theory's implications change
   depending on how one draws boundaries around groups. So the theory can
   give contradictory directives for the same event, depending on how one
   envisions the subject of intervention. The move away from states,
   however, may be inevitable, because contemporary problems in
   international relations (such as those related to climate change) cannot
   be easily contained within the framework of independent sovereign states
   in the international system. The book opens avenues to think about this
   problem.},

Abstract = {Does election fraud erode support for dictators? An original survey
   experiment from Russia following the 2020 vote on constitutional
   amendments reveals three key findings. First, regime supporters and
   opponents differ significantly in their baseline beliefs about election
   fairness. While regime opponents are already aware of fraud, supporters
   expect relatively fair elections. Consequently, only regime supporters
   revise their election beliefs when exposed to fraud information. Second,
   fraud revelations reduce regime legitimacy beliefs, but only among the
   regime's political base. In contrast, regime opponents already perceive
   the regime as illegitimate at the baseline. Third, the experiment shows
   minimal, if any, effects on attitudes toward Putin. While fraud
   revelations cause regime supporters to adjust their views on the regime,
   their opinions about Putin remain largely unaffected. The findings imply
   that dictators can maintain popular support among their political base
   while manipulating elections, posing questions about the potential of
   fraud to undermine regime stability.},

Abstract = {Whether countries and their publics are responsive to the international
   legal commitments they make is the source of long-standing academic
   debate. Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine brought real-world
   significance to these debates. While Ukraine is not a member of the
   North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the invasion raised the
   prospect that other NATO members could be targeted and that Article 5
   collective security commitments would be invoked. While recent research
   suggests that emphasizing mutual defence treaties can increase public
   support for defending an ally, prior work focuses on US opinion in a
   less fraught political environment. We constructed and fielded a survey
   experiment in Italy in the initial weeks of the Ukraine invasion to
   probe support for defending a NATO ally, the relevance of the Article 5
   legal commitment on support for defending an ally, and the potential
   moderating influence of gender and political party. Our findings show
   that the Article 5 commitment significantly increased support for
   defending an ally. Consistent with past research, we find a significant
   gender gap, with men being more supportive of defending an ally than
   women; however, both men and women responded to the Article 5 commitment
   to virtually the same degree. The estimated treatment effect was larger
   for supporters of right-wing parties than for the left; however, the
   difference was not statistically significant.},

Abstract = {As our nation struggles to make sense of the pathologies of conspiracy
   thinking and hyper-polarization in our body politics, this study
   investigates why some members of the House GOP caucus used Twitter to
   promote conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 election. Our study
   first examines the predictors of conspiracy theory tweeting, and second,
   whether this messaging was related to voting for or against the
   certification of presidential election results in Arizona and
   Pennsylvania on January 6th. Our results suggest President Trump's
   election performance in 2020, conspiratorial tweeting, and freshman
   status of House members were the driving factors of voting behavior on
   January 6th.},

Abstract = {Incels (short for ``involuntarily celibate{''}) have recently gained
   notoriety for their aggressive, often violent, misogyny, yet incels were
   not always an antidemocratic social group. They thus pose a challenge
   for thinking about democracy and identity in (anonymous) digital
   environments: how can we create spaces for marginalized social groups
   while ensuring the resulting identities remain democratic? While many
   scholars point to technological affordances or corporate content
   moderation policies as providing some solutions, in this article I
   propose a more democratic approach. Drawing from incel wikis and
   archived forum posts from two early incel communities-IncelSupport and
   LoveShy-I argue that a community's social norms, and the moderation
   practices required to sustain them, are user-directed interventions that
   have outsized effects in shaping group identities in democratic ways.},

Abstract = {This article provides an empirical overview of federal lobbying in
   Canada, examining lobbying contacts by field and sector from 2011 to
   2022. We track shifts in lobbying representation over this period,
   including across Harper Conservative and Trudeau Liberal
   administrations. The study reveals the dominance of business interests
   in lobbying in Canada and a high level of lobbying concentration. By
   sector, export-oriented industries with high environmental and climatic
   impacts-namely, agriculture, fossil fuel and manufacturing
   industries-predominate. With the transition to Trudeau, we find a
   significant increase in overall rates of lobbying and a modest increase
   in the ratio of public interest representation. Overall, the lobbying
   industry is characterized by greater access but unequal voice.},

Abstract = {This study examines women's political representation as election
   supervisors, the rules regarding women's representation in accordance
   with the regulations of Law Number 7 of 2017 concerning General
   Elections have not been able to run well. This study uses qualitative
   research by making observations in the recruitment process of the
   Election Supervisory Board of the Republic of Indonesia and the
   affirmation quota of women as election supervisors in Election
   Supervisory Board, Yogyakarta Special Region Province. This study aims
   to see the application of regulations on the general election law on
   women's representation and its application in the recruitment process of
   election supervisors that accommodate women's representation. This
   finding shows that there is still a gap in women's representation in
   election supervisory institutions where the rules regarding 30 percent
   female representation have been very clearly regulated. Evaluation of
   these findings requires a policy of changing regulations that regulate
   sanctions for non-fulfillment of women's representation as one of the
   solutions to fulfill women's gender kouta as female supervisors. The
   conclusion of this study is that there are several factors that hinder
   the fulfillment of women's political rights such as, a wrong
   understanding of political gender, the risk of becoming a very large
   election supervisor, socialization of selection that is not right on
   target and the competence of prospective candidates who lack knowledge
   about elections.},

Abstract = {Frederik W. de Klerk left numerous bookmarks in South Africa's history.
   During his presidency (1989-1994), many of those relate to his handling
   of foreign affairs. When he became president, he was a novice in this
   field. He made a quantum political leap on 2 February 1990 when he
   released Nelson Mandela from prison and unbanned the African National
   Congress. He engaged in personal diplomacy and forged remarkable
   relationships with President George H. W. Bush and Prime Minister
   Margaret Thatcher. His decision to destroy South Africa's nuclear
   arsenal led to the signing of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
   Treaty in July 1991. He evaluated the events in Eastern Europe, the fall
   of the Berlin Wall, and demise of the Soviet Union in their proper
   context. He abolished apartheid. He did not attempt to reform it as
   Gorbachev did with the Soviet system. He adjusted South Africa's foreign
   policy accordingly when the geo-political environment changed in
   Southern Africa with Cuban withdrawal from Angola and Namibia's
   independence in March 1990. In December 1993, he shared the Nobel Peace
   Prize with Mandela. Up to now FW's legacy in the realm of international
   relations have not been properly explored.},

Abstract = {The legitimacy crisis of Iran's clerical state may be at a tipping
   point: its fading Islamist facade and crumbling republican pretensions
   can no longer disguise its mismanagement and failures at governance.
   With the public more attuned to the hypocrisy and corruption of the
   ruling elite, the Islamic Republic has been plagued by a succession of
   popular uprisings. Its characteristic response has been violence,
   draconian repression, and the intensification of securitisation. But the
   more it focuses its efforts at self-preservation, the more it risks
   eroding its veneer of legitimacy. The centralisation of power around an
   increasingly autocratic Supreme Leader, the obsequiousness of elected
   institutions, and the kleptocracy of unelected entities, have
   contributed to disillusionment even among core supporters. Concerted
   efforts at marginalising Iran's non-Islamic heritage, and subsuming
   Iranian national identity into a Pan-Islamist Shia ideology, also raise
   questions about whom the Islamic Republic regards as its true
   constituency.},

Title = {Electoral Messiah or Party Label? Quantifying and Investigating
   Leader-Party Relationships in German Federal Elections 1998-2021},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {87},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {While the personalization of politics thesis has received support when
   exploring the supply side of politics and the media's coverage of
   elections and campaigns, the unmediated impact of leaders on vote choice
   (demand-side behavioral personalization) is debated. Most scholars agree
   that leaders can and do influence the vote, but the extent,
   circumstances, and pathways for this to occur, notably distinct from
   voter assessments of the party, remains contested. Using data from the
   German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) and the Comparative Study of
   Electoral Systems (CSES), we explore demand-side behavioral
   personalization in German Federal elections between 1998-2021, with a
   particular focus on the 2021 contest, where leadership was arguably an
   especially salient feature of the campaign. We offer a quantification of
   the phenomenon - first in the form of a vote-leader/ party favorite
   alignment index and second by separating the impact of leader and party
   popularity on the vote in the 2021 contest, including provision for
   temporal and reciprocal dynamics. In doing so, we comprehensively
   examine leader-inclined voting while testing whether the 2021 contest
   represented a ``Crossroads{''} contest on this dimension. Our results
   show leaders directly influenced vote choice in 2021, support for
   leader-inclined voting. Nevertheless, we find little evidence that 2021
   marked a ``Crossroads,{''} with few voters aligning their vote solely
   with their favorite leader, a pattern detected in all German elections
   between 1998 and 2021. Conspicuously, substantially more voters report
   aligning their vote with their favorite party. Further, our analysis
   illustrates that the association between leader popularity and the vote
   mostly trails the impact of party popularity's connection with the vote.
   These results align more with the leaders minimalist school of
   demand-side behavioral personalization.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a new pedagogic approach to the teaching of
   political science. In engineering education, the
   Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) pedagogy provides an active,
   experiential learning experience, structuring learning around four key
   phases in product development. Applied to the undergraduate Politics and
   International Relations (IR) classroom, this pedagogical innovation in
   learning, teaching and assessment is adapted to policy development. This
   design-build-test pedagogical approach has been highly successful in
   engineering education, supporting students to be ``industry-ready
   engineers{''} on graduation. Results across 3 cohorts suggest that this
   pedagogical innovation is also highly successful when transferred to
   Politics and IR, supporting political science students develop
   ``society-ready{''} attitudes, attributes and skills, greatly enhancing
   the student experience and increasing their attainment, engagement,
   inclusion and wider graduate outcomes. Civic engagement and the ability
   to understand and respond to a range of stakeholders are also improved.
   This paper presents the pedagogy and the module to which it was applied
   as a case study, before highlighting opportunities for political science
   educators to transfer the pedagogy to their own teaching context.},

Abstract = {In sustainability governance, the reliance on deliberative participatory
   processes has greatly increased over the last decades due to
   expectations that such processes can mobilize additional creative
   potential, foster better understanding of problems and acceptance of the
   costs of relevant solutions, and mediate the decline in traditional
   forms of participation. However, in complex technological contexts such
   as bioeconomics and, especially, biotechnology, participatory processes
   are still rare, at least partly because of concerns that citizens might
   lack the necessary information and skills. Yet bioeconomic innovation
   trajectories often imply societal, political, and economic changes that
   also affect citizens' lifestyles and budgets and may cohere or conflict
   with individual and collective norms. Thus, citizen participation in
   relevant deliberations and decisions would seem opportune. In this
   paper, we therefore inquire into the potential and challenges for
   participatory processes in bioeconomic contexts. Specifically, we
   identify pivotal criteria for the democratic quality of relevant
   participatory processes on the basis of the rich literature on citizen
   participation in sustainability governance. We then explore how (well)
   these criteria can be achieved in participatory processes on the
   bioeconomy and biotechnological innovation strategies, drawing on two
   such processes we carried out in 2021 and 2022. On this basis, we
   propose further questions and implications for research and practice.
   Der Ruckgriff auf deliberative, partizipative Prozesse hat in der
   Nachhaltigkeits-Governance in den letzten Jahrzehnten stark zugenommen,
   da erwartet wird, dass solche Prozesse ein zusatzliches kreatives
   Potenzial mobilisieren konnen, ein besseres Verstandnis von Problemen
   sowie die Akzeptanz der Kosten entsprechender Losungen fordern konnen
   und den Ruckgang traditioneller Formen der Partizipation auffangen
   konnen. Gleichwohl sind partizipative Prozesse in komplexen
   technologischen Kontexten wie der Biookonomie und besonders der
   Biotechnologie immer noch selten. Dies ist zumindest teilweise bedingt
   durch die Befurchtung, dass den Burgerinnen und Burgern die notwendigen
   Informationen und Fahigkeiten fehlen konnten. Wege hin zu
   biookonomischen Innovationen implizieren jedoch oft sozialen,
   politischen und okonomischen Wandel, der sich auf die Lebensstile und
   Lebenshaltungskosten von Burgerinnen und Burgern auswirken und mit
   individuellen sowie kollektiven Normen in Einklang stehen, aber auch in
   Konflikt geraten konnen. Die Beteiligung von Burgerinnen und Burgern an
   entsprechenden Deliberationen und Entscheidungen erscheint deshalb
   angebracht. In diesem Beitrag untersuchen wir daher das Potenzial und
   Herausforderungen partizipativer Prozesse in Kontexten der Biookonomie.
   Genauer werden grundlegende Kriterien fur die demokratische Qualitat
   entsprechender partizipatorischer Prozesse auf der Grundlage der
   umfangreichen Literatur zu Burgerbeteiligung in der
   Nachhaltigkeits-Governance identifiziert. Anschliessend wird untersucht,
   wie (gut) diese Kriterien in partizipativen Prozessen zu Biookonomie und
   biotechnologischen Innovationsstrategien umgesetzt werden konnen. Dabei
   stutzen wir uns auf zwei solcher Prozesse, die wir in den Jahren 2021
   und 2022 durchgefuhrt haben. Auf dieser Grundlage werden weiterfuhrende
   Fragen und Implikationen fur Forschung und Praxis vorgestellt.},

Abstract = {Survey researchers testing the effectiveness of arguments for or against
   policies traditionally employ between-subjects designs. In doing so,
   they lose statistical power and the ability to precisely estimate public
   attitudes. We explore the efficacy of an approach often used to address
   these limitations: the repeated measures within-subjects (RMWS) design.
   This study tests the competing hypotheses that (1) the RMWS will yield
   smaller effects due to respondents' desire to maintain consistency (the
   ``opinion anchor{''} hypothesis), and (2) the RMWS will yield larger
   effects because the researcher provides respondents with the opportunity
   to update their attitudes (the ``opportunity to revise{''} hypothesis).
   Using two survey experiments, we find evidence for the opportunity to
   revise hypothesis, and discuss the implications for future survey
   research.},

Abstract = {In this research, we explored how foundational issues can become subtext
   in political discourse by studying how statehood was debated in social
   media prior to two plebiscites in Puerto Rico. Historically in Puerto
   Rico, local parties are divided on this issue instead of along the more
   common conservative versus liberal division that is found in most parts
   of the United States. We collected the corpus of Twitter communication
   by members of Puerto Rico's Legislature for the term of 2017-2021. Using
   latent topic modeling techniques, we classified the political discussion
   along party lines. Surprisingly, statehood was not a major topic in our
   model when using the full corpus of data. However, when we filtered the
   data to include only those tweets discussing statehood and sub-sampled
   them by major party, the sub-topics within statehood communication
   became clear and coherent as was the partisan divide. Ultimately, while
   there is a clear division about statehood between the parties, the issue
   has become so intrinsic to the political sphere in Puerto Rico that it
   no longer commanded significant attention in the political discourse
   during this period.},

Abstract = {Democracy's resilience arguably depends on political elites' loyalty to
   the political system. How do elected representatives understand
   democracy and their own role in it? We present results of a survey
   conducted among German legislators in state parliaments and the
   Bundestag in 2022. We start by mapping the scope and content of
   consensus and dissent where principles of democracy and their
   institutionalisation are concerned and go on to hypothesise that
   congruence between one's own conceptions of democracy and established
   institutions and practices is generally higher among established and
   government parties' representatives but also dependent on ideological
   inclinations. Our results are overall reassuring, showing a relatively
   low level of polarisation in attitudes to democracy, and have
   implications for the study of political elites, for diagnoses of
   political polarisation in Germany and for the possibility and
   feasibility of institutional reform.},

Title = {Bounded solidarity? Experimental evidence on cross-national bonding in
   the EU during the COVID crisis},

Abstract = {Most studies on European solidarity ('bonding') during COVID-19 lack a
   baseline comparison with outside states. We, therefore, cannot say
   whether European solidarity is universal or geared towards European
   Union (EU) insiders ('bounding'). We thus ask whether European
   solidarity is `bounded', that is, whether it relies on differentiation
   between European insiders and outsiders. We argue that if existent,
   bounded solidarity constitutes a long-term and thick basis for
   institutional building. To explore this `bonding-bounding' dynamic, we
   use a vignette experiment embedded into an original survey collected in
   eight European countries (n similar to 8900), covering all European
   regions. Our design varies the countries receiving solidarity, and the
   channels (EU level vs. member state level), policy domains (health vs.
   economy) and instruments (loans, grants, medical equipment, vaccines)
   through which solidarity is provided. Regarding bounding, we find that
   most countries are more solidaristic with EU countries than an outsider,
   baseline state (Peru), Italy excepted. There is, nonetheless, a strong
   heterogeneity between countries: France, Germany, the Netherlands and
   Sweden mostly want to help themselves and Southern member states, but
   not Central Eastern European member states, which we show is due to
   their perceived obstructionism related to the Rule of Law debate.
   Concerning the nature of solidarity, we find that most respondents
   prefer solidarity to be channelled through the EU and loans, with
   evidence suggesting a freeriding mechanism behind this preference. All
   in all, our results indicate that EU citizens form a distinct community
   of solidarity which, in line with a Rokkanian understanding of polity
   formation, plays a key role in political development and consolidation.},

Abstract = {Coercive institutions' internal structures remain poorly understood.
   Bureaucratic reorganizations within security institutions cause
   significant variation in their behavior, however. Intra-agency reforms
   interact with officers' careerist incentives to cause changes in
   coercive capacity or repression. In this paper, I test the effects of
   intra-agency reforms on surveillance capacity. I exploit a rare source
   of exogenous variation in the structure of the secret police in
   communist Poland. Difference-in-differences models find that when
   security headquarters were duplicated through an administrative reform,
   the proliferation of higher-level posts within the service caused a
   large and statistically significant increase in the number of informants
   it employed. Intra-agency reform substantially altered the agency's
   coercive capacity. Previously overlooked dynamics within coercive
   institutions have important effects on authoritarian repression.},

Abstract = {The public places an important constraint on funding security in Europe,
   and austerity risks making the constraint tighter. Several recent
   studies show that curtailing military spending is a popular way to
   reduce debt in Europe. Yet it remains unclear if military spending
   aversion persists when threats are salient. We fielded an original
   survey experiment in Italy weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine
   to examine how information about security threats influences military
   spending preferences and fiscal trade-offs. We found that information
   about threats increases support for military spending. To validate the
   survey experiment, we recontacted and remeasured our respondent's
   preferences three weeks after Russia's invasion and find evidence
   consistent with our initial experiment. Our findings suggest that, while
   public opposition to military spending remains high in Italy, external
   threats dampen the public's opposition to military spending, even under
   high debt burdens.},

Abstract = {Recent work in political economy suggests that autocratic regimes have
   been moving from an approach of mass repression based on violence,
   towards one of manipulation of information, where highlighting regime
   performance is a strategy used to boost regime popularity and maintain
   control. While the evolving strategies autocratic governments use to
   legitimise their rule have been the subject of much analysis, the role
   of third parties in adding to such strategies is less examined. This
   paper argues that corporations confer legitimacy on autocratic
   governments through a number of material and symbolic activities,
   including by praising their economic performance. We trace out the
   implications of adopting legitimation as a key concept in the analysis
   of corporate relations to autocratic regimes. We identify the ethically
   problematic aspects of legitimation, present new quantitative evidence
   suggesting that corporate legitimation of regimes matters empirically
   and outline a research agenda on legitimation.},

Abstract = {Whereas in recent decades most Latin American countries adopted a runoff
   rule that requires a majority of the vote for victory in the
   presidential election, Argentina adopted a runoff rule with a reduced
   threshold (45 percent or 40 percent plus a 10-point lead). This research
   note argues that Argentina's rule successfully prevented the election in
   2003 of a president with very scant support and a potentially very
   serious legitimacy deficit. However, the reduced threshold voided a
   runoff that would have been advantageous for presidential legitimacy in
   1999. Further, although the reduced threshold constrained party-system
   fragmentation in Argentina, it also advantaged a longstanding political
   party with authoritarian proclivities and impeded the emergence of new
   parties that might have been valuable for the country's democracy.},

Abstract = {How do international audiences perceive, and respond to, gender equality
   reforms in autocracies? For autocrats, the post-Cold War rewards
   associated with democracy create incentives to make reforms that will be
   viewed as democratic but not threaten their political survival. We
   theorize women's rights as one such policy area, contrasting it with
   more politically costly reforms to increase electoral competition. A
   conjoint survey experiment with development and democracy promotion
   professionals demonstrates how autocracies enhance their reputations and
   prospects for foreign aid using this strategy. While increasing
   electoral competition significantly improves perceived democracy and
   support for aid, increasing women's economic rights is also highly
   effective. Gender quotas exhibit a significant (though smaller) effect
   on perceived democracy. A follow-up survey of the public and elite
   interviews replicate and contextualize the findings. Relevant
   international elites espouse a broad, egalitarian conception of
   democracy, and autocrats accordingly enjoy considerable leeway in how to
   burnish their reputations.},

Abstract = {Eco-social policy research has emerged to address the interconnected and
   escalating pressures of social reproduction, climate change, and
   biodiversity loss, which require structural and behavioural changes for
   environmental and social welfare. However, conceptual ambiguity persists
   in applying an eco-social policy perspective to empirical research.
   After reviewing the interconnections and tensions of environmental and
   social policy, this article proposes a novel eco-social policy typology
   to assess policy discourses for their eco-social potential and to
   imagine different pathways towards sustainable policy-integration. The
   typology discusses four perspectives: Green Economy, Green Keynesianism,
   Recomposing Consumption and Production, and Degrowth. Each perspective
   is analysed based on its approach towards economic growth, the extent to
   which it appreciates public modes of governance, and its potential to
   either perpetuate existing institutionalised policymaking frameworks or
   lead to transformative shifts. This typology fosters constructive
   debates on integrating environmental and social policy, facilitates
   empirical research on policy proposals' eco-social potential and offers
   guidance in evaluating policy discourses through an eco-social lens.},

Abstract = {What is the relation between coups d'etat and civil wars? While a wide
   set of studies have traced the determinants of internal armed conflicts
   and coup attempts, the interplay between these contentious processes
   remains unexplored. Building on different strands of research, this
   article seeks to explain why, and under what conditions, some regimes
   experience coup attempts in the midst of civil wars while others do not.
   Concretely, I posit that coup attempts during internal armed conflicts
   are more likely to occur when two conditions converge: when insurgents
   reach a medium-level of strength in situations of intra-elite
   competition. Key military forces, elite outsiders and coalition insiders
   interpret this situation as a unique opportunity for changes in the
   distribution of power and potentially coalesce through the formation of
   alternative regime coalitions. This argument is tested with a novel
   dataset on 90 Latin American revolutionary socialist insurgencies active
   since 1950 and a qualitative case study of the dynamics leading to the
   1976 coup d'etat in Argentina, with results supporting the theoretical
   expectations. These findings contribute to a more detailed understanding
   of the relation between coups and civil wars, opening the way for
   further studies on this burgeoning area of research.},

Abstract = {In divided-executive patronal systems, legislatures have been sites of
   resistance to the centralization of power in a single patronal pyramid.
   Kyrgyzstan is an anomaly among divided-executive patronal systems when
   between 2010 to 2020, the Kyrgyz parliament was neither a site of
   opposition nor did it demonstrate legislative agency vis-a-vis the
   executive. Instead, following another uprising in 2020, a unified single
   patronal pyramid was re-established. Adopting an approach rooted in the
   semiotics of meaning making and drawing on a dataset of interviews with
   parliamentary deputies and a range of documentary sources, this article
   complements existing institutional approaches to explaining weak
   legislative agency by revealing a series of dialogical relationships
   between deputy meaning making and broader institutional and cultural
   constraints which shaped the Kyrgyz's parliament's overall quality and
   strength. These relationships pertain to legislative initiative, the
   protection of private interests and representation, with the interplay
   between the ascribed meaning and its constitution within broader
   institutional and cultural context contributing to the diminishment of
   legislative agency vis-a-vis the presidency. Kyrgyzstan illustrates the
   value of meaning making as an approach to understanding
   legislative-executive relations in non-democratic contexts, and its
   impact in conjunction with cultural and institutional constraints in
   shaping legislative agency.},

Abstract = {Do mutually reinforcing cleavages harm democracy? Evidence from specific
   cases suggests that autocratization can be related to the predicament of
   ethnic groups, if ethnicity is politicized and involves resource
   distribution. However, we know little about whether this is a cause of
   autocratization more broadly. The article demonstrates that, with
   increasing inequalities between ethnic groups, a country experiences a
   decline in its level of democracy and higher propensity to start
   autocratizing. The analysis thus advances previous contributions,
   focusing on individual inequalities and power-sharing institutions as
   explanations of democratization or democratic quality, in two ways.
   First, isolating autocratization as downturns in democracy levels and
   the onsets of related timespans (autocratization episodes), and
   comparing the impact of (economic, political, and social) types of
   inequalities between ethnic groups. Second, adopting a global sample of
   (democratic and non-democratic) countries since 1981, with an original
   data collection integrating expert surveys with survey data.
   Quantitative evidence confirms most expectations, particularly on
   economic inequalities between ethnic groups, and - although less
   precisely - economic, political and social dimensions combined. The
   findings have important implications for political regime and ethnic
   studies, showing that preventing the mutual reinforcement of
   sociocultural and economic cleavages is key to stabilize democracy.},

Abstract = {Declining levels of trust in the media in Western democracies have drawn
   the attention of political scientists, but much less attention has been
   paid to East Asia. This paper sets out to examine the logic behind media
   trust in three different types of regimes in East and Southeast Asia:
   countries with, partial, and no press freedom, respectively. Our
   findings show that while respondents' trust in government and support
   for socioideological control of the government have consistent and
   significant associations with their media trust across all 12 countries,
   Internet usage, online political participation, support for media
   censorship, and patriotic belief have different associations with the
   variable being studied as the degree of press freedom varies. The
   findings indicate that citizens are well aware of the role mass media
   plays in the political system and thus their trust in the media reflects
   the expectation-perception gap of the government-media relationship
   accordingly.},

Abstract = {Debates about controversial comedy are rife in public discourse.
   However, despite a great interest in wider issues surrounding freedom of
   expression, political philosophers have had curiously little to say
   about comedy. This is a costly omission because in mainstream public
   debates, many of the worries about the potential harms of comedy are
   often confused or conflated, and both the defences of comedians to use
   controversial material and calls for censorship of such material are
   usually under-theorised. This paper takes a step towards correcting this
   oversight by explaining the potential harms of comedy and identifying
   who should be held responsible for these harms. By transposing existing
   work on hate speech, three harms of comedy are diagnosed: that it can
   cause status harms, that it can silence speakers, and that it can
   motivate violence. Using linguistic theory and the philosophy of
   language, the paper argues that often, it is audience members and third
   parties who ought to be held morally responsible for these harms, and
   therefore, that comedians are not usually under moral duties to modify
   their comedic expression, even if it is harmful.},

Abstract = {Research problems are crucial in the sense that they provide new
   research with purpose and justification. So why, despite the abundance
   of guidance available from an extensive methods literature, do graduate
   students often struggle to develop compelling research problems? This
   article argues that the process of developing research problems
   epitomises the insecurity of doing research. We focus in particular on
   the anxiety that graduate students often seek to avoid or alleviate
   through a range of counterproductive coping strategies. The existing
   literature on research problems focuses predominantly on the technical
   aspects of doing research while neglecting how anxiety might affect the
   research process. This article seeks to rectify this shortcoming by
   providing advice on how graduate students can face such anxiety, and how
   professors can assist them in this endeavour. Drawing on theories about
   identity and anxiety, the article explains the allure of coping
   strategies such as gap-filling, while arguing that anxiety is not
   necessarily a negative emotion to be avoided at all costs, but integral
   to learning and creativity. It concludes by suggesting that compelling
   research problems can be constructed through the formulation of
   narratives that try to embrace anxiety, instead of seeking premature
   resolutions.},

Abstract = {This article explores the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil
   radicalizing Foucault's notion of governmentality. While dominant
   scholarship has been interpreting the human tragedy of the outbreak in
   Brazil in terms of necropolitics and Bolsonaro's populist rhetoric, the
   present work highlights other dimensions. It shows that the management
   of the pandemic was deployed to govern the conduct of the Brazilian
   population. This article detects novel economies of medical truth,
   obedience, and salvation. It also examines the struggles and
   (bio)political resistance of Brazil's vulnerable communities. While
   academic debates interpreted those movements in terms of care and
   compassion, this article highlights their radical political aspects.
   Extending Foucault's notion of ``counter-conducts,{''} this article
   reveals how those collectives shaped new forms of medical dissent. More
   concretely, they brought forward political practices of hope,
   solidarity, and resilience.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The irruption of information and communication technologies in labour
   relations, together with the decentralization of production and people,
   the autonomy of workers, hyper-flexibility, fragmentation and the
   reduction of working hours, has led to the emergence of new forms of
   labour relations and with them new controversies that must be mitigated
   by the legislator and collective bargaining and, failing that, by the
   courts and tribunals. One of their characteristics is that the concepts
   of hours and working hours have been blurred, and, consequently, so has
   their impact on the real and effective enjoyment of the right to rest
   through the right to digital disconnection. Such a transgression can in
   turn have negative consequences for the conciliation of work and family
   life, occupational health and safety and, ultimately, decent work. This
   is a matter that entails the necessary and correct application of the
   control of the time record by the employer to guarantee the enjoyment of
   the right to effective rest. Therefore, the objective of this study is
   the analysis of the legal configuration, both international and
   national, in order to try to answer the various questions that arise in
   the new labour relations of society 4.0, and, to a greater extent, in
   relation to the time record as an instrument of guarantee of the right
   to digital disconnection.},

Abstract = {Social media presents a contradictory relationship with democracy. Once,
   it was regarded as a tool for democracy, providing alternative sources
   of information and coordinating social movements for democratization.
   Later it also became a tool for authoritarian regimes to control
   information and spread propaganda to stay in power. This mixed
   perception suggests that both democratic and authoritarian forces can
   use social media to influence public opinion. This presents a puzzle to
   the relationship between social media use and democratic understanding.
   Does social media promote or erode understanding of democracy? This
   study argues that the effect of social media use on understanding of
   democracy depends on higher education. The relationship also differs
   between democracies and non-democracies. Using the newest wave of the
   World Values Survey (wave 7, 2017-2020), this study analyses the
   influence of social media use on understanding of democracy in
   non-democracies and democracies. The findings suggest that social media
   use positively affects understanding of democracy in democratic
   countries. However, the democratic effect of social media is nullified
   in non-democracy unless it interacts with higher education. The findings
   offer implications for the relationship between social media, higher
   education, and understanding of democracy.},

Abstract = {Consensus from the debate over lagged dependent variables in dynamic
   linear regression models advises that including enough lags of the
   dependent and independent variables will fully model autocorrelation in
   the error term. But this approach fails to account for a long-neglected
   source of autocorrelation in the error term-moving averages-which cannot
   be represented with a finite number of lags. Approximating moving
   averages results in either inconsistent or inefficient estimates of
   relevant quantities of interest, a claim demonstrated here via Monte
   Carlo simulations and three empirical demonstrations. Ultimately, we
   argue that moving averages should be a standard part of dynamic analysis
   and offer guidance for incorporating them into various modeling
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Different forms of integration into the European Union (EU) call for
   studies of the consequences of multilevel access structures. Similar to
   EU member-states, government officials from associated states interact
   closely with EU-level administrative institutions, notably the European
   Commission (Commission) and EU agencies. Benefiting from a large-N
   survey, this study demonstrates that bureaucrats from
   ``third-countries{''}, such as Norway, may exert sectoral policy
   influence in the EU, and that organizational features of the public
   administration may systematically shape such patterns. The study offers
   two distinct contributions to the extant literature: First, it presents
   original survey data on how domestic agency officials perceive their
   influence vis-a-vis the EUs executive branch. Secondly, it probes the
   effects of two distinct drivers of policy influence-bureaucrats' access
   to secondary structures and requisite administrative capacities.},

Abstract = {From April 2020 to December 2021, the Canadian federal government
   earmarked \$330,000,000 through the Emergency Food Security Fund to
   address food insecurity during the COVID-19 global pandemic. These funds
   were disbursed through a handful of national and regional emergency food
   and food justice agencies to smaller front-line organizations for the
   purchase of emergency food provisions and personal protective equipment,
   and to hire additional workers. We theorize these dynamics within the
   broader processes of neoliberalization and argue that the Canadian
   federal government was conscripting food justice and community
   development organizations into its efforts to address dramatically
   increasing rates of food insecurity across the country through charity
   emergency food provisioning. Within Peck and Tickell's stylized
   conceptions of the destructive (roll-back) and creative (roll-out)
   moments of the process of neoliberalization, we frame the crisis of
   COVID-19 as exposing a form of recalibration (rollcall) neoliberalism.
   We focus on this dynamic specifically within the context of household
   food insecurity in Canadian communities and argue that the federal
   government's funding regime during the global pandemic effectively
   directed food justice organizations (and by extension, the populace in
   general) away from a more ambitious social change agenda towards the
   more acceptable strategy (in neoliberal terms) of emergency food
   provisioning services.},

Abstract = {The significant rise in the number of populist radical right (PRR)
   parties has not been accompanied by a parallel interest in the
   consequences that these parties may have on public opinion. The limited
   range of attitudes that the literature has considered so far can be
   broadened to include political correctness (PC), given the increasing
   attacks on this concept made by PRR parties. To address the effects of
   such attacks, we examine the Spanish case, where the presence of a new
   PRR party makes anti-PC messages a recent, quite exogenous stimulus.
   Using panel data to address potential non-recursive relationships and
   time-variant effects, we find that individuals are indeed more prone to
   lowering their levels of PC after finding Vox an attractive electoral
   option. Our results inform the debates on the effects that `cultural
   wars', anti-woke and anti-PC rhetorics may have on public opinion, which
   could lead ultimately to harmful consequences for minority groups and
   social cohesion.},

Abstract = {Elections are key moments for interactions between civil society and
   representatives. While bottom-up mobilization tries to influence the
   composition of parliament and policy outputs, political parties and
   politicians engage with broader civil society to strengthen their
   legitimacy and to obtain strategic benefits in terms of electoral
   results. This study focuses on the role organized interests play in
   election campaigns and explains why collective societal actors do not
   engage in a significant way in the electoral process. By examining the
   Portuguese case during the 2019 elections, this study relies on data
   triangulation to map the involvement of organized interests in the
   electoral process. We argue that political parties have no incentives to
   foster linkages with interest groups, while civil society organizations
   prefer to stay in the shade or do not have opportunities to engage in
   electoral politics. The findings have implications not only in terms of
   low levels of political mobilization, but also with regard to policy
   innovation (and lack thereof).},

Abstract = {Cooptation is one of the most efficient strategies employed by
   authoritarian regimes and their leaders in order to survive in power. In
   most of these regimes, dominant pro-government parties serve as
   important tools of cooptation in general and of legislative recruitment,
   as one of its forms, in particular. The main thesis of this study is
   that cooptation is selective. When contrasted to the social sectors that
   are directly linked to the state, the private sector will be at a
   relative disadvantage, resulting in a smaller scope of cooptation. To
   test this thesis empirically, we build several hypotheses based on our
   expectations regarding the effects of electoral rules on candidate
   selection, and then test these hypotheses against the data from 82
   regional legislative elections held in Russia in 2015-2020. The analysis
   confirms our main thesis and clarifies several findings previously
   reported in the literature on business and politics in Russia.},

Abstract = {There are few questions about the fact that China has achieved
   substantial strides in economic development over the last four decades.
   Nonetheless, many have cast doubts on its path of increasing
   transparency. Previous analyses on Chinese transparency have shed light
   on this issue in isolation. For this reason, we attempt to offer an
   integrated account of Chinese government transparency. Moreover,
   transparency involves various dimensions and types. For a complete
   understanding of transparency, therefore, considering diverse measures
   is critical. This article aims to provide a condensed overview of
   government transparency in China by considering various measures of
   transparency. To a certain extent, China has been successful in bringing
   greater transparency. Still, in many accounts, it cannot be said that
   the Chinese government has achieved sufficient progress in promoting
   transparency.},

   `Professional Parliaments'},

Abstract = {Leaving parliament is often a time of significant financial, employment
   and emotional difficulty for MPs. However, few studies have examined the
   support provided by parliaments to departing and former members.
   Consequently, parliaments lack access to best-practice case studies to
   improve the transitional experience for MPs. This article develops five
   benchmarks for supporting former MPs, covering transitional financial
   assistance; retirement income; career, financial, life transitions and
   redundancy counselling; mental health and medical services; and social
   and networking opportunities. These benchmarks are used to assess the
   support provided to former members by 22 selected `professional
   parliaments'. Although most of these parliaments offer adequate
   retirement income, none currently provide sufficient transitional
   financial assistance for MPs who depart before pensionable age. In all
   cases, improvements are also required to mental health and other
   counselling services. Most parliaments provide adequate social and
   networking opportunities. Implementing and extending these measures will
   improve the transitional experience of former MPs and enhance democratic
   rotation by reducing impediments to high-quality candidates from diverse
   socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds from seeking political office,
   while easing the exit of MPs who are ready to leave.},

Abstract = {Scholars of global governance have long attended to the role of
   non-state actors in formulating and interpreting regulatory instruments,
   analysing these actors' engagement with processes, their influence, and
   their preferences in terms of the content and, to a limited degree, form
   of regulation. Among the non-state actors involved in governance
   settings, business actors are an interesting subject given the resources
   at their disposal to exert material, structural, and ideational power
   and due to the global nature of large corporations. They are especially
   relevant in human rights regulation, as the global nature of business
   activity through supply chains, subsidiaries, and finance is contrasted
   with a state-centred human rights regime. Several regulatory instruments
   have been passed in this space, both nationally and internationally, and
   regulatory initiatives are increasingly common. This article focuses on
   business actors' potential interest in the form of regulation, how
   different forms of regulation may affect different business actors, and
   how the interest of business actors can be traced back to notions of
   public and private.},

Abstract = {Despite steady growth of global climate finance over the last decade, a
   590 percent annual increase in climate finance is needed by 2030 to meet
   climate finance needs. This is especially the case for Turkiye, which
   faces an annual adaptation cost estimated at \$155-330 billion by 2030.
   Only 7.5 percent of climate finance in Turkiye is dedicated to
   adaptation, with the private sector lagging behind. This article
   presents several policy recommendations for mobilizing private sector
   adaptation financing in Turkiye's climate adaptation initiatives. It
   emphasizes four pillars: enhancing data accessibility, ensuring clear
   and consistent policy signals, establishing an enabling legal and policy
   framework, and economic incentives. These pillars offer Turkiye a
   promising pathway for increasing adaptation finance for a resilient and
   sustainable future.},

Abstract = {Understood not only as a challenge to democracy but as a crisis,
   populism has received widespread attention in both media and academic
   circles for the better part of the past decade. Yet the outbreak of C
   OVI D-19 and its escalation into a pandemic eclipsed the fear of rising
   populism within weeks: With lockdowns imposed and civil liberties
   suspended, it lost its menacing character and became a mere background
   nuisance. This, I argue in this article, is the consequence of a
   discursive constellation in which there is only room for one dominant
   crisis - a meta-crisis as I call it - at a time. Populism filled this
   meta-crisis role for a long while, but the C OVID-19 shock redirected
   society's attention to a more pervasive and immediate threat While this
   does not spell the end of populism, it still marks a notable shift in
   the relative importance we attribute to it},

Abstract = {A substantial body of literature documenting the
   ``school-to-prison-pipeline{''} identifies the adverse effects of
   punitive school discipline policies and how they have increased the
   contact students have with the juvenile justice system. This literature
   tends to position school policies and the broader education system as a
   significant contributor - both directly and indirectly - to
   incarceration. Relying on data from California, our paper first argues
   that there is little evidence of a direct ``school-to-prison
   pipeline,{''} as school discipline policies are rarely directly
   responsible for juvenile incarceration. Drawing from an extensive
   secondary literature on mass incarceration and data on incarceration and
   crime rates, the paper then argues that there is little reason to
   believe that school policy is a substantive indirect driver of
   incarceration rates. Finally, we show that activists and policymakers
   have adopted the STPP framework in ways that incorrectly suggest that
   changes in school policy are key to addressing incarceration. While the
   metaphor has proven to be morally evocative and catchy, attracting the
   attention of activists and politicians across the political spectrum, it
   ultimately obfuscates the complex realities of what drives punitiveness
   in schools and in society writ large.},

Abstract = {This article studies the messages of the Mexican government about
   Russia's invasion of Ukraine, from the perspective of strategic
   political communication. Statements of President Andres Manuel Lopez
   Obrador and official press releases are evaluated through the method of
   discourse analysis, to determine the political purposes of the messages.
   The theoretical framework defines the following categories: strategic
   communication, political communication, and studies on war and
   relationship with foreign policy. The empirical analysis is based on
   statements obtained from the official pages of the Mexican government
   between February 2022 (the start of the war) and May 2023. The main
   contribution of this study is reveal the political use that the
   government has given to the war to contribute to its internal
   legitimacy. It is concluded that the government transmits its messages
   strategically, not neutrally, creating an arbitrary association between
   this war and the political situation of Mexico.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {52},
Pages = {1-19},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The concept of passive revolution is one of the most important in
   Gramscian theory. It is an abstraction that explains historical
   processes of popular mobilisation that end in the predominance of
   stability over change. This paper analyses the use of this concept over
   three different historical periods and reflects on its usefulness in
   analysing current political phenomena. Through an empirical exercise of
   analysis of 31 in-depth interviews with leaders of associations that
   participated in the Chilean social revolt, the conclusion is that the
   so-called social outburst of 18 October is heading towards a closure in
   the form of a passive revolution. This, through a gradual
   institutionalisation that shows a resolution ``from above{''} and
   without popular protagonism. Also, social organisations' critical
   participation confronting the fear of ``winning nothing{''} after months
   of continuous mobilisation and attrition.},

Abstract = {This article compares Abraham Lincoln's and John Brown's justifications
   for violently confronting slavery during the Civil War and the raid at
   Harpers Ferry, respectively. Though significant differences existed
   between these two men, I argue that there is a surprising and often
   overlooked convergence. Both Brown and Lincoln rooted their opposition
   to slavery in their belief that it threatened the possibility of free
   self-government. Both concluded that violence was the only effective way
   to fight slavery. Finally, both argued that their violence was justified
   by democratic procedures and principles. In making this comparison, this
   article offers three contributions to the study of American political
   thought and political theory more broadly. First, it challenges the
   historical consensus that portrays these men as radically opposed
   exemplars. Second, it rehabilitates John Brown's political thought.
   Third, through the comparison, it surfaces a democratic approach to the
   complex relationship between violence, democracy, and racism.},

Abstract = {This Special Issue seeks to understand the formation and development of
   Asian political dynasties that extended or continue to extend power
   through at least two generations by comparing and contrasting the
   experiences of eight select country cases in the region. The Issue
   concentrates on ``political dynasties{''} rather than ``political
   families{''} because we examine the chronological extension of clout by
   a kinship group over the geographical unit in which it resides rather
   than simply the nuanced power relations of the political family in
   stasis. We also focus on dynasties as political families in motion-not
   political families at one point in time. The study is crucial because it
   enhances comprehension of the Asian family dynasty's role as a political
   institution in the age of elections. Such research remains uncommon.},

Abstract = {By differentiating the dynamics of leader democracy from those of
   populist leadership, this paper provides a political-sociological
   theoretical framework that can identify the ideal-types of the
   personalisation of leadership in advanced democracies. In the first
   part, the article develops the main features of leader democracy from
   the perspective of democratic elitism, highlighting how process does not
   entail a partyless democracy. The second part focuses on the
   disintermediation process in populist leadership, which is presented as
   a particular form of plebiscitary politics. The proposed theoretical
   framework diverges from the stream of the literature on populism, which
   tends to equate populist leadership with charismatic leadership.
   Furthermore, the article points out the substantial differences between
   the personalisation of the populist and charismatic leadership styles by
   comparing the key issues of populism and charisma in the processes of
   personalisation thus proposing an interpretative framework to resolve
   the contradictions among the dominant interpretative frameworks.},

Abstract = {ISIS has seemingly been successful in mobilizing advocates from
   heterogenous backgrounds. Such diversity is symptomatic of the
   organization's heavy investment in strategic messaging and identity
   construction to gain legitimacy. This study examined the multimodal
   discursive properties of ISIS's narrative in its communique, Dabiq. It
   undertook a Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis of the representation
   of in-group and out-group actors implementing Van Leeuwen's
   socio-semantic inventory. The results showed that the in-group members
   are deliberately specified, hence foregrounded, and at the same time,
   the diversity among them is highlighted as an inseparable hallmark of
   ISIS's movement. Therefore, no racial, geographical, or cultural line
   was drawn apropos its participants to ensure more inclusion. Conversely,
   the perceived enemies are framed as diverse yet homogeneous entities
   textually through generic references and addressing them collectively
   regardless of their potential dissimilarities and visually by
   categorizing them through religiously, culturally, or nationally
   distinguishable features. It acts as a legitimation tactic by which
   striking against one enemy justifies striking against others. The
   combination of these strategic multimodal framing tasks serves as a
   propaganda tool for ISIS to intensify polarisation, enhance in-group
   participation, and ultimately facilitate mobilization.},

Abstract = {The article examines the rise of contemporary populist movements in
   Europe and North America. These movements are driven primarily by
   working-class men who feel marginalized by developments in employment,
   work conditions, family life, and, in particular, by gender politics and
   the modern status of women. The growth of the service sector has created
   new opportunities for women. Demography, especially the decline in the
   fertility rate, has been neglected in sociological theories of the
   modern development of radical populism. With a declining and ageing
   population, the labor market depends increasingly on immigrant workers.
   These circumstances-feminism and migration-fuel the frustration of
   marginalized men who form the basis of radical populism.},

Abstract = {Teaching Critical Race Theory (CRT) in schools quickly became a salient
   issue nationally and in local elections despite CRT's origins as an
   academic theory. In this paper, we argue that elite asymmetries
   regarding the importance of CRT spillover to the electorate. We show
   that Republican legislators and conservative media's use of the term
   ``critical race theory{''} dwarfed that of Democratic legislators and
   liberal media, respectively. A spike in general interest in the term
   happened concurrently with this elite push. We then hypothesize that in
   part due to this asymmetry in exposure to the term ``critical race
   theory{''} itself in elite messaging, CRT policy may have an asymmetric
   effect on political mobilization, favoring Republicans, who tend to
   oppose the teaching of CRT in schools. To test this hypothesis, we
   conduct a survey experiment and find that Republicans presented with a
   pro-CRT policy change are politically mobilized, while Democrats
   presented with an anti-CRT policy change are not. In particular,
   Republicans exposed to the pro-CRT policy reported a higher likelihood
   of voting, encouraging others to vote, and contacting their local
   politicians. Thus, the case of CRT helps to illustrate the conditions
   under which issues can asymmetrically mobilize citizens.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the suggestion in Tae-Yeoun Keum's Plato and the
   Mythic Tradition in Political Thought that myth and reason can be
   reconciled in a practice of philosophy. If that practice remains
   centered around critical reasoning, and myth is resistant to such
   reasoning, then Keum's argument seems to suggest that resistance to
   critical reasoning must be somehow necessary to critical reasoning. How
   to make sense of this apparent contradiction? Exploring the ambiguous
   relationship between myth and truth, I explore several ways of
   understanding Keum's contribution.},

Title = {Natural disasters and the limits of electoral clientelism: Evidence from
   Honduras},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {85},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The changing climate is leading to more frequent weather extremes across
   the globe, altering many aspects of social, economic and political life.
   In this paper we examine the impact of natural disasters on clientelism,
   a form of particularistic exchange in which voters are induced to eschew
   policy-oriented electoral decision-making in favour of voting for a
   party or candidate that offers them a targeted reward. We hypothesize
   that extreme weather should increase clientelism in contexts where it
   operates. But we also anticipate that multiple severe disasters may
   overwhelm clientelist networks, as demand outstrips supply.
   Triangulating quantitative and qualitative data, we test our
   expectations and find strong evidence that flood-based resources have
   been clientelized in Honduras, but that the combination of especially
   widespread flooding and the COVID-19 pandemic generated a situation
   where political parties were unable to use their clientelist networks
   effectively, as citizen need was too great.},

Abstract = {Parties and their actions almost always shape the preferences,
   attitudes, and behaviour of their voters. However, does partisan
   influence over public opinion apply to all policy proposals regardless
   of their initial popularity and to all voters regardless of their degree
   of partisan attachment? This question is addressed in the real-world
   context of Finland, where the government enacted two reforms at the same
   time: an initially popular reform extending the age of compulsory
   education, and an initially unpopular removal of the `retirement tube'
   for older laid-off workers. An original panel survey asked respondents
   about their attitudes before and after the government actions, finding
   that while voters of government parties increasingly tended to support
   the enacted policies, the magnitude of opinion change depended on
   voters' initial policy preferences and party attachment. Strong party
   attachment led to government voters increasing their support for a
   reform that they initially opposed. In contrast, those with weaker
   partisan attachments tended to alter their preferences for an initially
   popular reform. These findings are relevant for understanding partisan
   influence over public opinion in a broader political context.},

Abstract = {This article examines the effect of country size on the
   professionalization of politicians in six European micro-states and a
   large-scale democracy - Germany - since 1980. The article revisits an
   ongoing debate about the extent to which either country size or
   government size are causal factors in the individual professionalization
   process. Using an original dataset consisting of 6,940 parliamentary
   mandates - 2,809 individuals - in national parliaments, the article
   shows that country size is a determinant of the degree of politicians'
   professionalization. The article further demonstrates that political
   parties' gatekeeper role is the key causal mechanism explaining the
   influence of population size on politicians' professionalization.},

Abstract = {We provide a mixed-methods, comparative analysis of the development of
   the urban-rural electoral cleavage in Canada, Great Britain, and the
   United States from the early 20th century to the present. Using
   aggregate election results, electoral district boundary files, and
   electoral district population measures, we construct a new comparable
   dataset of district election results and urbanity for the lower house of
   the legislature in each country. We use this dataset to measure the
   importance of the urban-rural divide for election outcomes across
   countries and time. We find that the cleavage has widened over time in
   each country, each arrived at its current urban-rural divide via a
   distinct developmental trajectory, which we interpret with reference to
   secondary literature. We conclude by discussing the significance of our
   findings for theories of both the causes and consequences of urban-rural
   divides and discuss the implications of our work for the comparative
   study of urban-rural cleavages.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the Indonesian government's strategies to
   safeguard its informal sector in Malaysia, which has experienced
   considerable human rights violations and exploitation. Such incidents
   breach both the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and Law No. 18 of 2017
   on the Indonesian migrant workers' protection. Utilizing the pro-people
   foreign policy theory and the citizen protection concept, this research
   explores the government's responses to these issues as a protective
   measure for its citizens. Employing a qualitative descriptive method,
   data was gathered through library studies. The findings reveal that the
   Indonesian government, in its bid to protect indonesian women migrant
   workers in malaysia by 2022, has publicly criticized the Malaysian
   government, implemented a Moratorium, and pushed for immediate bilateral
   meetings between the two nations. Hence, the study concludes that these
   efforts have positively influenced the protection of indonesian women
   migrant workers in malaysia in 2022.},

Title = {World market, imperialism and State derivation in Claudia Von Braunmuhl.},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {52},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Claudia von Braunmuhl was part of the German State derivation debate.
   Her contribution focused on understanding the link between the State,
   the World Market and Imperialism. In this paper we propose to
   reconstruct and deepen her argument of the primacy of the World Market
   over States, and then advance in a critique of her perspective. The
   center of gravity of these is found in the observation of a
   juxtaposition of the levels of abstraction between the state, the world
   market and imperialism. We conclude that the juxtaposition of the levels
   of abstraction triggers a series of problems from which Claudia von
   Braunmuhl fails to overcome the classical visions of imperialism.},

Abstract = {Right-wing media are pivotal for the success of the political right. We
   investigate the discursive trends in roughly 57,000 articles published
   in Germany's biggest far-right weekly newspaper, Junge Freiheit (JF),
   between 1997 and 2019. During this period, JF expanded steadily in terms
   of both circulation and output. Quantitative content analyses reveal
   that, firstly, JF shows clear partisanship: although officially
   independent, JF has already covered the relatively new right-wing party
   Alternative fur Deutschland more than all other parties combined.
   Secondly, JF tends to form its identity mostly through railing against
   the perceived dominance of liberalism in politics and society, although
   attention to these aspects has decreased in recent years. At the same
   time, whitewashing Germany's past has been a rather stable theme.
   Lastly, the JF clearly casts immigrants, refugees, and Muslims as a
   threat to Germany. However, this aspect has mainly become prominent in
   recent years, and the refugee inflows of 2015/16 worked as a catalyst
   that boosted attention on related topics. We discuss implications for
   scholarship on right-wing media in general, and Germany in particular.},

   Experimental Evidence from the United States},

Abstract = {Regressive taxation plays an increasingly important role in financing
   public programs, but prior studies have not fully explored the
   conditions under which citizens would support such financing strategies.
   This paper fills this gap by focusing on the United States, where sales
   taxes account for nearly one-third of state government revenue, and
   sales tax ballot measures have received majority support. I conducted an
   online survey experiment to examine two potential sources of public
   support for a sales tax increase: equal treatment beliefs (i.e., that
   all taxpayers should pay the same rate) and a lack of public awareness
   of the distributive consequences of sales taxes. I find that exposure to
   information about sales taxes' distributive consequences significantly
   reduced respondents' support for a sales tax increase, but that equal
   treatment beliefs had no significant effect on such support. Additional
   analyses suggest that other-regarding motivations are a plausible
   mechanism underlying the effects of information provision. These
   findings shed light on how misperceptions of tax burdens shape support
   for regressive taxation and have broad implications for how fairness
   beliefs influence tax policy preferences.},

Abstract = {The Greek citizenship regime in the first decade of the 21st century has
   been described as one of the most restrictive in Europe. The campaign
   `No to racism from the baby's cot' was created in mid-2000s and called
   for legislative changes that would allow second-generation immigrants
   born and/or raised in Greece the right to acquire Greek citizenship.
   Building on critical studies of citizenship and using life-history
   interviews, the article explores the political formation of two leading
   activists who were involved in the campaign, charting the evolution of
   their experiences and struggles. This way, it shows that citizenship is
   more than a formal legal entitlement and citizenship struggles are part
   of the process of making and being a citizen. The story of Loretta
   Macauley, president of the United African Women's Organization, focuses
   on the African women's contribution to the campaign and situates this
   within a broader practice of sisterhood and struggle in line with Black
   feminist intersectionality. The story of Michael Afolayan, a young
   second-generation activist involved in the campaign, provides a view of
   black youth involvement in specific forms of political participation,
   drawing attention to the `hybrid' identity behind the term `second
   generation immigrant' and the serious implications this identity has for
   collective action.},

Abstract = {The absence of an electoral connection is a widely held assumption in
   the scholarship on the European Parliament (EP) and a cause of serious
   normative concern about the functioning of the European Union. Weak
   individual legislator accountability is part of this assumption, even if
   we still know little about the extent to which legislative performance
   matters for citizens in EP elections that allow preferential voting.
   This study is the first to analyse how legislative performance
   influences the preference vote shares of members of the European
   Parliament (MEPs) and whether this is moderated by their parties' EU
   salience and incumbent intra-party competition. It draws on an original
   dataset that combines candidate and electoral data from three rounds of
   EP elections held between 2004 and 2014 under open or flexible list
   rules with information on individual legislative activity (i.e., number
   of reports, parliamentary questions and speeches) and leadership
   positions at EP and committee level. One dimension of legislative
   performance, report writing, is associated with a larger share of
   preference votes but only for incumbents of parties assigning high
   salience to the EU. While MEPs win a higher share of preference votes
   when they face limited co-partisan incumbent competition, this factor
   does not moderate the electoral connection.},

Abstract = {This article considers a significant stage in the convergence of US
   counterterrorism policy and immigration enforcement exemplified by the
   emergence of a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) unit known as the
   Tactical Terrorism Response Team (TTRT). In my analysis I show: (i) that
   TTRT agents engage in a process I call social homicide which subjects
   travellers to a condition of bare life; (ii) that the increasing
   production of border violence highlights that the convergence of
   securitisation and immigration enforcement is a praxis of anti-Blackness
   and Islamophobia; (iii) that securitisation and exclusionary immigration
   policy have made use of invisibility to create and expand a permanent
   state of exception; and (iv) that border enforcement through
   securitisation is used as a mechanism for the surveillance and control
   of social movements inside the United States. Given the limited public
   information on TTRT's operations, this study explores the matter through
   a case study of Abdikadir Mohamed's 2017 encounter with the unit, his
   subsequent immigration proceedings, and the FOIA lawsuit filed against
   CBP for more information on the TTRT.},

Abstract = {A new approach is needed to manage the UK's increasingly nebulous
   terrorism threat, argues George Glover. The UK's terrorism definition
   relies on a determination of what ideological or political cause an
   individual or group is trying to advance. However, the predominance of
   self-initiated terrorists and the omnipresence of the internet in
   everyday life are challenging this approach. A better approach would
   more clearly demarcate terrorism from extremism, to provide the UK
   counterterrorism community with more robust tools to challenge a threat
   that is harder to understand.},

Abstract = {This article investigates German foreign and security policy from 1999
   to 2022 through the prism of strategic culture. In contrast with
   previous studies on German strategic culture, this article employs a
   mixed research design to examine areas showing major changes and areas
   of relative continuity. By using NVivo's two analytical tools (word
   frequency analysis and matrix coding analysis), the article conducts a
   computer-based content analysis of German official strategic discourses
   in the foreign and security realm. The findings reveal that although
   some of the foundational elements have been preserved and further
   strengthened, German strategic culture appears to have exhibited more
   changes since 2014, particularly in terms of the geographical scope of
   security concerns, perceptions of key threats and Russia. The article
   argues that Germany's understanding of security has shifted towards a
   normative dimension that places greater emphasis on values and rules,
   and that Germany's security concerns are no longer confined to European
   regional security but rather extend further afield.},

Abstract = {Inspired by recent studies about the effects of coups on future regime
   trajectories, the article examines the conduct of praetorian armies in
   electoral contests that occur in the aftermath of military coups. In
   some countries, putschist militaries refrain from interfering in
   post-coup elections and withdraw from executive power. In others, they
   rig elections in favour of their preferred candidate and become
   entrenched in executive power. In each outcome, coup makers play a
   different role in subsequent regime dynamics. To explain these different
   outcomes, the article designs an integrative framework and applies it to
   countries displaying different post-coup electoral outcomes over time.
   The findings reinforce skepticism about the democratisation potential of
   militaries and highlight the importance of intra-military factionalism
   on praetorian leaders. The article encourages scholars to engage in
   case-based and processual research linking coup makers to long-term
   regime dynamics and provides hypotheses guiding such research agendas.},

Abstract = {This paper will study a recent protest in Indian football against the
   Citizenship Amendment Act, a law championed by the Hindu nationalist
   Bharatiya Janata Party that threatens to render millions of Indian
   citizens stateless. Recent scholarship on supporter activism in football
   tends to focus on the local conditions that drive fan-led actions. Yet,
   as witnessed at the Kolkata demonstration against the amendment in early
   2020, the horizon of politics as imagined by fans remains much wider in
   its scope. Through this study, we can discern a mode of political
   articulation by football supporters that combines the local and the
   national.},

   analysis of the Brazilian case during the Covid-19 pandemic},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {127},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {During the Covid-19 pandemic, states employed restrictive health
   measures that affected rights, such as freedom of movement, impacting
   international human mobility, with practices such as closing borders.
   Such tendency to portray health emergencies as a national security
   agenda rather than a public health agenda, in a process of health
   securitization, opposes the idea of Global Health Security, promoted by
   WHO, in its main body, the International Health Regulations (IHR), whose
   general orientation is firmly against the imposition of border
   restrictions, and remained so during the Covid-19 pandemic. The
   objective of the present study is to analyze the measures imposed by the
   Brazilian government on international mobility during this health
   emergency. Therefore, in the methodological field, we employed the
   deductive approach method and the bibliographic research technique. The
   analyses begin with a review of the literature on the subject and the
   contexts of scientific production. From this analysis it was possible to
   conclude that the Brazilian restrictive measures to international human
   mobility occurred in an uncoordinated way, without the elaboration of a
   health security protocol for the different types of Brazilian borders,
   which enabled the use of discriminatory practices, in disagreement with
   the IHR and the protection of human rights.},

Journal = {REVISTA ESPANOLA DE CIENCIA POLITICA-RECP},
Year = {2023},
Number = {62},
Pages = {95-119},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The rise of evidence-based policies has revived the interest in
   evaluation use. Nevertheless, avail-able evidence on instrumental uses
   has been mostly generated in countries with a consolidated evaluation
   culture. Thus, there is a lack of information on how those uses are
   achieved in contexts where evaluation is not fully institutionalized.
   This research uses a Qualitative Comparative Anal-ysis to identify the
   factors that explain the instrumental use of the evaluations carried out
   by the Catalan Institute for the Evaluation of Public Policy (Ivalua) in
   Catalonia, a context where the institutionalization of evaluation is
   still weak. The results confirm the explanatory importance of the three
   types of factors identified in the literature (methodological,
   institutional, and, related to political context) and the conjunctural
   nature of evidence use. Additionally, they indicate that factors
   influencing instrumental uses of evaluation change according to its
   degree of institution-alization. In environments with a less developed
   evaluation culture, those factors precisely aimed at alleviating the
   lack of institutionalization seem to gain importance.},

Abstract = {We use the occurrence of the London bombings on July 7, 2005, during the
   fieldwork period of the British Social Attitudes Survey to analyze the
   dynamics of public support for measures curbing core freedoms. We
   observe little change in public attitudes toward counterterrorist
   policies in the first week after the attack. Approval of infringements
   on privacy and procedural rights surges in the following weeks before
   stabilizing at an increased level in the medium run. Our findings
   indicate that, when it comes to restrictive counterterrorist measures,
   the public adopts a wait-and-see attitude rather than reacting in fear.
   Ancillary analyses suggest that the media may be the source of
   attitudinal changes on policies curtailing civil liberties.},

Title = {By any memes necessary: Belief- and chaos-driven motives for sharing
   conspiracy theories on social media},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Although a growing body of scholarship examines who believes conspiracy
   theories (CTs) and why, less is known about why people share CTs. We
   test the impact of three independent motives on people's willingness to
   share CTs on social media: bolstering their or their group's beliefs
   (motivated sharing), generating collective action against their
   political outgroup because of losing (sounding the alarm), and
   mobilizing others against the political system (need for chaos). Using
   an original survey of US adults (N = 3336), we test these three motives
   together and find strong evidence for motivated sharing and need for
   chaos, but no evidence for sounding the alarm. Our findings suggest that
   motivated sharing-when measured directly as belief in the CTs-is the
   strongest predictor of willingness to share CTs on social media. Need
   for chaos has less of an effect on sharing than belief but a
   consistently stronger effect on sharing than partisanship and ideology.
   Altogether, we demonstrate that sharing CTs on social media can serve
   both motivated and mobilizing functions, particularly for those who
   believe the CTs or seek to challenge the political system, rather than
   impugn their political rivals.},

Abstract = {Using dialectics and cognition method the purpose of thiswork was to
   analyze the appropriate level of legal support forthe activities of the
   State Bureau of Investigation, to determineits effectiveness and to
   identify problematic aspects. A number ofstatutes, reports, online
   meetings and speeches delivered in themedia and in the specialized
   committee of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukrainewere investigated. It is
   concluded that among the shortcomings of the StateBureau of
   Investigation regulation, the following stand out: 1) Absence of asystem
   of internal law enforcement agencies and clear delimitation of
   theirrole; 2) Uncertainty about the status of the State Investigation
   Bureau as ananti-corruption body; 3) Changes in the status compared to
   the principalestablished in the first edition of the Basic Law of
   Ukraine; 4) Inadequacyof regulatory consolidation of social and pension
   provision of employeesof the State Bank of Ukraine; 5) Questions about
   the need to create expertservices in the SBI system and include them
   among the state institutionsentitled to conduct forensic examinations in
   Ukraine},

Abstract = {The main objective of the article was to study the legal and economic
   aspects of the formation of the budgetary mechanism of the national
   model of economic development. It is possible to ensure the dynamic
   processes of economic development of Ukraine only through effective
   regionalization, which significantly increases the requirements for the
   formation and utilization of the financial potential of the regions,
   which requires the development of strategic priorities for public
   financial management of the region as a whole. The research methodology
   involved the use of modern theoretical methods of analysis within the
   framework of dialectics. As a result of the analysis, the key aspects of
   the budget mechanism of the national model of economic development in
   Ukraine were characterized. It is concluded that, The study has a series
   of limitations when carrying out a purely theoretical analysis. More
   research should be dedicated to the examination of digital technologies
   for the formation of the budgetary mechanism of the national model of
   economic development, among other aspects.},

   Public Safety},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 1},
Abstract = {Effective public goods provision requires coproduction by both citizens
   and the government. Search costs that complicate citizens' ability to
   share information constitute a critical and understudied impediment to
   this coproduction. We experimentally evaluate search costs in a rural,
   conflict-affected province of the Philippines. We randomize the rollout
   of a police hotline that dramatically reduces the costs of reporting and
   compare it against both the status quo and an alternative intervention
   that builds trust but does not affect search costs. The hotline
   increased the likelihood of reporting crimes by 10-19 percentage points.
   The intervention reduced perceived insurgent activity but had no
   perceptible impact on ordinary crime. Our findings suggest that
   addressing search costs substantially improves service delivery,
   potentially explaining why policies imported from higher-capacity
   countries may fail to achieve results in developing contexts.},

Title = {New Polish right - politeness and radicalism. A corpus analysis of
   Krzysztof Bosak's (de)legitimation strategies on twitter},

Abstract = {The article discusses (de)legitimation strategies of Krzysztof Bosak,
   one of the leaders of the Confederation Liberty and Independence, a
   Polish coalition of right-wing movements. The success of the formation
   appears to be in line with that of other European (far) right-wing
   parties, which have become politically relevant in recent decades.
   Despite the Confederation's growing position in European politics, there
   is a paucity of research devoted to the party. The present paper
   attempts to bridge the gap by focusing on Bosak's 2020 presidential
   campaign and the politician's use of Twitter. In order to investigate
   Bosak's discourse in detail, corpus linguistic methods were used. As
   they allow the researcher to work on large samples of data, Bosak's
   tweets were investigated at both qualitative and quantitative levels.
   The results suggest that the candidate focused on legitimizing
   Catholicism and conservative ideas. At the same time, he delegitimised
   the left and LGBT communities, framing the presidential campaign as a
   clash between the conservative order.},

Abstract = {Darwinism and evolutionary theory have a bad track record in political
   theory, given their entanglements with fin-de-si \& egrave;cle
   militarist imperialisms, racialized hierarchies, and eugenic reformism.
   In colonial contexts, however, Darwinism had an entirely different
   afterlife as anticolonialists marshaled evolutionist frameworks to
   contest the parameters of colonial rule. This article exhumes just such
   an evolutionary anticolonialism in the political thought of Aurobindo
   Ghose, radical firebrand of the early Indian independence movement. I
   argue that Ghose drew on a nuanced reform Darwinism to criticize British
   imperialism and advance an alternative grounded in the Indian polity's
   mutualism. Evolutionism formed a conceptual ecosystem framing his
   understanding of progress-national, civilizational, and spiritual-and
   reformulating the temporal and conceptual coordinates of the liberal
   empire he resisted. The article thus exposes the constructiveness of
   anticolonial politics, the hybridity of South Asian intellectual
   history, and the surprising critical potential of Darwinism in colonial
   settings.},

Abstract = {What determines party strategies in the short run during election
   campaigns? In this paper, I highlight a novel aspect of party behavior
   pertaining to the connection between election programs and actual
   campaign statements issued by party elites in the media. I argue that
   party leaders may feel compelled to fine-tune their rhetoric and stances
   during campaigns and thus deviate from their party's election programs.
   Nonetheless, their ability to conduct ad-hoc adaptations is limited. The
   theory I propose posits that two features of party organizations will
   determine if party leaders can engage in short-term inconsistencies.
   First, membership-dominated parties will be less likely to be
   inconsistent because their leaders will fear alienating (the strong)
   party members and getting punished as a result. Second, parties with
   strong societal integration-those that maintain strong ties with society
   and an extensive network of local branches-are more likely to indulge in
   ideological inconsistency because they establish close bonds with voters
   based on problem-solving rather than broad ideological principles. I
   test these dynamics in 14 European democracies between 1972 and 2017 and
   find strong empirical support. The findings show that intricate party
   organizations and robust connections with normal citizens influence
   parties' short-term strategies during election campaigns.},

Abstract = {Political parties are typically seen as conservative institutions which
   rarely change. Despite this common perception, parties do change, and on
   occasion, transform themselves by changing features such as the party
   name and logo, or their policy program. How can we conceptualize these
   kinds of changes, and what are the electoral consequences for parties
   which change in these ways? In this paper, I argue that feature changes
   and policy changes are instances of party rebranding, or situations
   where a party attempts to overhaul its entire image. I then test the
   electoral consequences of feature and policy rebrands on a dataset of
   239 political parties from 1945 to 2019. The results indicate that
   feature rebrands increase party vote share for the election after the
   rebrand, while policy rebrands have no effect. These findings have
   implications for our understanding of parties themselves and the kinds
   of party signals that voters respond to.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I examine citizen-police interactions in Latino
   communities near the US-Mexico border. Drawing on evidence from
   sixty-one in-depth interviews with residents, activists, and nonprofit
   workers living in San Diego, I explore Latinos' perceptions of the
   police. Interview data, in conjunction with observational evidence from
   work with community-based organizations, revealed heterogeneity in the
   views of Latinos toward the police. Some Latino residents were skeptical
   of the police and resented policing practices, including sobriety
   checkpoints, vehicle seizures, and investigatory stops that targeted
   people concerning documentation status or prior system involvement,
   while other Latino residents trusted the police and their efforts to
   reduce crime. Yet still, some Latino residents expressed critical and
   positive views about the police. Interview data also highlight the
   financial, psychological, and social strain of local police practices on
   Latinos who have uncertain status or live in mixed-status households.
   These findings underscore the centrality of the criminal legal system in
   the lives of many Latinos and draw attention to heterogeneity in their
   experiences with, and views about, the police.},

Abstract = {In which ways and under what conditions do the procedural and economic
   performance of political systems matter for citizens' political trust?
   While this question has been a recurring theme in research on political
   support, we still lack a clear understanding of the conditional nature
   of the performance-trust nexus. In this study, we focus on the affective
   and cognitive foundations of the performance-trust nexus, arguing that
   the impact of objective procedural and economic performance on political
   trust is conditioned by citizens' political allegiances (i.e., status as
   electoral winner or loser) and political sophistication (i.e., political
   knowledge and political interest). Our empirical analysis using
   comparative survey data from two European high-quality surveys (European
   Election Study 2014 and European Social Survey 2002-2018) shows that
   procedural and economic performance feature particularly prominently in
   the trust calculus of politically more knowledgeable and interested
   citizens as well as electoral losers, while being less relevant for the
   political trust of less sophisticated citizens and electoral winners.
   Moreover, the analysis provides evidence that cognitive orientations are
   overall more important than affective ones in moderating the
   performance-trust nexus. These findings offer important implications
   concerning the nature and meaning of feelings of disenchantment and
   distrust in contemporary democracies.},

Abstract = {Scholars commonly observe that lawmaking in Congress has transitioned
   from the textbook system of ``regular order{''} in which power was
   decentralized in committees and lawmaking followed a formal process to
   one of ``unorthodox lawmaking{''} characterized by the centralization of
   power in party leaders and a lack of formal process. It is debated
   whether this change marks a decline in Congress's lawmaking capacity, or
   is a procedural adaptation that has allowed Congress to remain
   productive despite high levels of partisanship. In this article, we
   maintain that lawmaking in Congress varies along two dimensions:
   formality of process and centralization of power. We analyze
   non-spending bills added to omnibus appropriations packages to
   demonstrate that lawmaking on these bills is informal and decentralized.
   Rank-and-file members retain a capacity to place matters on the
   legislative agenda and authorizing committees retain gatekeeping and
   policymaking authority. The process through which add-ons are approved
   is also bipartisan. Our findings demonstrate that this style of
   lawmaking is a procedural adaptation used by members to pass legislation
   important to their districts and in which committees continue to play an
   important deliberative role.},

Abstract = {Responding to student concerns about the market value of an
   undergraduate degree in Political Science, many departments offer
   students the opportunity to earn credits toward their degree by
   completing relevant internships. This raises two important questions:
   what sort of internship experiences should qualify as a Political
   Science internship and how can faculty ensure that internships
   contribute to students' professional and academic development? I contend
   that the criteria for granting Political Science credits for an
   internship experience should emphasize the likelihood that the
   internship experience will help the student achieve some of the specific
   learning objectives that Political Science departments typically set
   forth for their students rather than focusing on the nature of the
   organization where they complete their internship. I also argue that
   designing complementary academic assignments that require students to
   utilize the research, analytic, and communication skills we expect our
   students to develop during their undergraduate career is the best way we
   can ensure that a Political Science internship not only enhances our
   students' marketability but also contributes to students' achievement of
   discipline-specific learning objectives.},

Abstract = {What makes female candidates for political office persist in their
   quest? Using self-determination and casual agency theories, we
   hypothesize that female candidates for public office need to construct
   and maintain a political identity in their quest for office. Through
   interviews, we explore the narratives of 35 women who ran for public
   office at the state and local levels in the United States. Half of the
   women persisted to the end of the race, whereas the other half aborted
   their campaign at some point before elections. We show that those who
   persisted performed conscious and deliberate political identity work
   which neutralized threats from the external environment, leveraged
   opportunities, and strengthened political identities. Internalizing,
   identifying with, and expressing oneself as a political actor is
   critical to resilience as a candidate for political office.
   Understanding threats to fragmentation of political identity is a
   critical implication for women running for office.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, liberal democracies have considerably expanded the
   scope for citizen participation, calling their citizens to vote in a
   growing number of popular votes. This research investigates the effects
   of the rising election frequency on electoral participation. It expands
   on the voting calculus and theorizes which, when, and how past votes
   affect current voter turnout. We argue that all election types
   contribute to a common factor of election frequency, whose high values
   depress turnout and reduce the effectiveness of party mobilization even
   in the most important elections. We find support for the new theory
   using an original database of all significant elections and referendums
   held in 22 European democracies between 1939 and 2019, two natural
   experiments, and survey data from the Comparative Study of Electoral

Abstract = {During the administrations of Cardoso (1995-2002) and Lula da Silva
   (2003-2010), Brazil considerably increased its activism on international
   issues, seeking to consolidate a leadership position among South
   American countries. Especially in recent decades, the diplomatic
   tradition has reiterated the need to obtain the region's support as an
   instrument to boost international projection. In this sense, based on
   qualitative research analysis of Brazilian foreign policy, this article
   aims to answer the following question: Can Brazil be considered as a
   regional power? To this end, the article examines how the governments of
   Rousseff (2011-2016), Temer (2016-2018) and Bolsonaro (2019-2022) have
   changed the patterns of foreign policy action, leaving little room for
   more effective action by the country as a regional leader.},

Abstract = {The Autobiography of Malcolm X highlights the eponymous subject's
   conversion from aimless rage and criminality to a form of militant study
   while in prison, a conversion dedicated to understanding the societal
   foundations of power and racial inequality. Central to this
   understanding is the idea that new philosophical perspectives and
   `thought-patterns' are necessary to reprogramme dominant or
   `brainwashed' mindsets towards organising political resistance. In this
   article, I explore Malcolm X's concepts of `conversion' and `prison',
   identifying them, not only as mere spatiotemporal locations, but also as
   larger frames in which Malcolm conceives of domination and freedom. I
   identify Malcolm's three-aspect account of domination through which
   radical education and mental liberation drive his project of Black
   nationalism. I then consider the significance of an unexpected ally
   invoked by Malcolm: the 17th century philosopher Benedict de Spinoza,
   described as a `Black Spanish Jew' and presented as an oppositional
   figure to the western philosophical canon. While this alliance is partly
   rhetorical, if overlooked, both work through problems of `epistemic
   agency' and `democratic civic agency' as vital for ameliorating
   domination and enhancing freedom. Malcolm and Spinoza offer distinct but
   significant contributions to ideas of domination and freedom in terms of
   both an individual and a collective capacity to think and act.},

Abstract = {Governmental measures against the spread of the Corona virus have been
   met with varying levels of opposition in many countries worldwide.
   Existing research has claimed that some of this opposition is linked to
   esoteric and anthroposophical beliefs. This research note tests this in
   an observational study using election results from the 2021
   parliamentary election in Germany and new data on the distribution of
   natural healers, homeopathic doctors and Steiner schools. Results show
   that counter to common expectations, there is no evidence that esoteric
   beliefs systematically lead to increased support for the established
   right-wing AFD. Rather, some indicators for esoteric beliefs - in
   particular, the presence of homeopathic doctors and Waldorf schools -
   are related to higher support for the new fringe party dieBasis, a
   single-issue party campaigning against governmental Corona measures.},

Abstract = {We investigate how dominant media networks can manipulate voters in
   young democracies. During the first presidential election after the
   democratic transition in Brazil, TV Globo, the largest and most-watched
   network in the country, unexpectedly manipulated the news coverage of
   the last debate 2 days before the decisive second round. In a video
   segment, Globo unfavorably depicted the left-wing candidate, Luiz Inacio
   Lula da Silva. Using the geographical distribution of
   broadcaster-specific TV signals and the timing of election events, we
   identify the effect of the manipulation net of the effect of the debate
   itself, showing that Globo's misleading reporting caused Lula to lose
   millions of votes. Our results showcase how the media can reshape an
   election in a single stroke, especially where the media is concentrated
   and politically inexperienced voters have few other sources of
   information.},

Abstract = {This study complements the extant literature by assessing the role of
   governance dynamics in food security in Ghana for the period 1980-2019.
   The empirical evidence is based on the fully modified ordinary least
   squares technique and governance is categorized into political
   (entailing political stability and voice and accountability), economical
   (consisting of regulatory quality and government effectiveness), and
   institutional (entailing corruption-control and the rule of law)
   governance dynamics. The study finds that the engaged governance
   dynamics improve food security in Ghana. Policy implications are
   discussed with specific emphasis on the sustainable development goals.

Abstract = {Since the \#MeToo movement, several countries have taken steps to
   address sexual harassment in politics (for example, the United States,
   United Kingdom and Canada). While researchers have evaluated the
   electability of candidates accused of sexual harassment, less is known
   about what the public thinks should happen when elected officials engage
   in this behaviour. Utilizing an innovative module from the 2019 Canadian
   Election Study, we assess the steps voters believe legislatures should
   take when an MP sexually harasses someone. Our results demonstrate that
   a vast majority of the public believes that MPs should face consequences
   when they commit sexual harassment, including potential removal from
   office. We also find that women are more likely than men to believe MPs
   should be punished when they are accused of sexual harassment. These
   findings have relevance for legislatures globally, revealing the
   importance of transparent, independent processes to address harassment
   and violence in the political sphere.},

Abstract = {What explains party polarization in multiparty systems? This study turns
   the spotlight to intraparty mechanisms, namely, the authorities and
   influence of party activists over the candidate selection process, as a
   potential source of party-system polarization. I hypothesize that
   parties in which activists possess more comprehensive selection
   authorities, the party elite will hold more extreme ideological
   positions, catering to activists' representation demands. Additionally,
   in such cases, the ideological gap between party elites and voters will
   be larger since more extreme actors overshadow the preferences of
   moderate party voters. Aggregating the intraparty effect of activists to
   the party-system level, I expect to find higher level of party
   polarization in countries where more parties allocate selection
   authorities to activists. Utilizing party-level data regarding candidate
   selection procedures as well as public opinion and elite position data
   from 19 countries and 93 parties between 2011 and 2017, I find support
   for my hypotheses.},

Abstract = {Ethnopluralism has gained great significance as a political ideology
   with the rise of right-wing populism in Europe in recent years. It is
   now the dominant ideology of most radical-right parties and movements in
   France, Germany, and Italy. With the adoption of ethnopluralism, the
   radical right has performed a `cultural turn'. They have ostentatiously
   moved away from biological racism and replaced it with ethnopluralism -
   which has also been described as `cultural racism' or `differentialist
   racism'. This study looks at the foundational texts of ethnopluralism
   and traces the evolution of this cultural turn in the thinking of their
   authors. The crucial works of the most important ethnopluralist writers
   are examined: Alain de Benoist, Guillaume Faye, Henning Eichberg, and
   Martin Lichtmesz. This analysis is complicated by the fact that there
   are several ambiguities in these texts, especially when it comes to the
   distinction between biological and cultural racism. The evidence
   supports the assumption of a `cultural turn' in radical-right thought.
   It was also found that there are still elements of biological racism in
   the texts of these radical-right thinkers, particularly where they
   connect ethnopluralism with the idea of the heredity of culture and with
   biological determinist interpretations of territoriality.},

Abstract = {Democratic backsliding in many world regions has prompted scholars to
   study how democracies can resist and push back against autocratization,
   and many accounts suggest that a unified, pluralist opposition is key to
   mobilize voters against democratic backsliding. However, pluralist
   ideology is not necessarily associated with higher awareness of and
   opposition to backsliding, as evaluations of democratic erosions are
   highly contingent on political context. We illustrate this point with
   the case of Indonesia, a country where a pluralist government coalition
   has deepened democratic erosion by harshly repressing an anti-pluralist
   Islamist opposition. Using data from a national survey, we document that
   Islamist Indonesians are systematically more likely than pluralist
   individuals to believe that democracy has worsened: Resistance to
   democratic erosion is thus concentrated in the most ideologically
   illiberal citizens. Rethinking the pluralist/anti-pluralist dichotomy
   has implications for how we conceptualize democratic backsliding and
   assess democratic resilience.},

Abstract = {This text presents an overall and long-term vision of the relations
   between business and the state in Mexico. The analysis aims to explain
   how business mobilize their interests, what influence they have on
   public policies that affect the entire society, why and how they have
   participated in party politics and the expansion of democracy in Mexico.
   It shows how they started the twentieth century with a legitimacy
   deficit, expelled from the political scene because of the Revolution
   (1910-1921), and how they managed to grow and create powerful companies
   and organizations that allowed them to transnationalize and start the
   twenty-first century at the top of the power, not only economic, but
   also political. It examines the political participation of business to
   face the growing interventionism of the State in the economy during the
   period of industrialization by import substitution and shows how many
   business people left their companies to enter partisan politics from the
   local and regional spheres to the National. Their involvement in public
   policies that led to privatization, deregulation, and economic openness
   is also examined. The relations of business interests with the four
   governments of the twenty-first century is analyzed in a particular way:
   the two of the PAN (Vicente Fox, 2000-2006 and Felipe Calderon
   2006-2012), that of the PRI (Enrique Pena Nieto, 2012-2018) and that of
   Morena (Andres Manuel Lopez, 2018...).},

Abstract = {While numerous explanations for vote-switching have been proposed (e.g.
   declining rates of partisanship, ideological shifts, partisan
   ambivalence, change in policy preferences), far less work has examined
   the personality profile of people more likely to engage in this
   behaviour. In Study 1, we examined the relationship between both general
   (i.e. openness, conscientiousness) and antagonistic (i.e. psychopathy,
   narcissism, Machiavellianism) personality traits and the intent to
   switch one's vote in a large sample of Canadian citizens, while
   controlling for several established correlates such as age, income and
   political interest. Of all personality traits, only individuals higher
   in openness reported a greater intent to engage in vote switching.
   Despite our expectations, Machiavellianism, a trait characterized by its
   strategic nature, was unrelated to vote switching intentions. In Study
   2, we addressed several methodological reasons for why antagonistic
   traits may have been unrelated to vote switching intentions in Study 1
   by examining the traits at the facet level and utilizing a new measure
   of Machiavellianism among a separate sample of Canadian citizens. Here
   again, we found little evidence for a relationship between antagonistic
   traits, including Machiavellianism, and vote switching intentions.},

Title = {Agrarian extractivism: Addressing actors and their agency at the
   national level},
Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {231-251},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The literature on the transformation of Latin American agrarian
   productive and trade patterns (1990s to 2010s) tends to overemphasize
   traits of the agrarian extractivism concept, such as intensive
   mono-production for exportation, sectoral disarticulation, concentration
   of benefits and power outside the producing nation, and degradation of
   environmental and labor conditions. At the same time, an analysis of the
   experiences of the Argentine and Brazilian soy chains shows that they
   include characteristics that the literature does not usually
   incorporate. After reviewing the literature and two case studies, we
   discuss the need to incorporate the agency of national state and
   nonstate actors into the analysis of agrarian extractivism. We argue
   that addressing this level and these actors' agency is necessary to
   understand the potential link between agrarian extractivism and economic
   development in Latin America. Empirical research relies on publications
   based on fieldwork and statistics. This article theorizes that agrarian
   systems are made up of chains whose links specialize in different
   distinct functions, and their actors' economic behavior is determined by
   their decision-making (agency) capacity and rational choice. Power in
   chains is relational and mutates over time and according to changes in
   context, so this configuration opens the possibility of fostering
   economic development options through national actors and justifies their
   inclusion in the analysis of agrarian extractivism.},

Title = {Populist Memory Politics and the Performance of Victimhood: Analysing
   the Political Exploitation of Historical Injustice in Central Europe},
Journal = {GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 10},
Abstract = {Right-wing populists often mobilize popular support by employing a
   people-versus-elite dichotomy in which they cast `the people' as the
   underdog, or by `performing' crisis to discredit the elite. Such
   `underdogism', and the reliance on crisis more broadly, remains an
   effective strategy for as long as populists are in opposition. But what
   happens when populists gain power? One would expect that they would not
   be able to exploit their position as effectively and their appeal would
   weaken drastically. In certain cases, however, they still manage to
   sustain the underdog illusion. This article argues that memory politics
   are an important locus for populists to maintain their underdog
   rhetoric, and within that field the performance of victimhood is key.
   Building on theories about the performance of crisis and recent trends
   in research on memory politics in Central Europe, we propose a framework
   for understanding how governing right-wing populists justify vindictive
   policies and thus try to cement their power.},

Abstract = {Dissidents mobilizing against a repressive regime benefit from using
   public information for tactical coordination since widespread knowledge
   about an upcoming event can increase participation. But public calls to
   protest make dissidents' anticipated activities legible to the regime,
   allowing security forces to better stifle mobilization. I examine
   collective action during Sudan's 2018-19 uprising and find that
   mobilization appeared to be publicly coordinated through social movement
   organizations and internet and communicative technology, consistent with
   common channels identified by existing literature. Yet embedded field
   research reveals that some dissidents independently used public calls to
   secretly organize simultaneous contentious events away from publicized
   protest sites, perceiving that their deviations would make the regime's
   repressive response relatively less efficient than the resulting
   efficiency losses on the movement's mobilization. These findings push
   future work to interrogate more deeply the mechanisms by which
   dissidents use coordination channels that are also legible to the regime
   they are mobilizing against.},

Abstract = {This article contours the collective imaginary horizons of
   post-socialist subjects as they emerge within and around the
   `routinised' practice of labour migration and its pressing
   materialities. Taking the case of Bulgarian-origin migrants in the UK,
   the article problematises the common conceptualisation of
   (semi-)peripheral imaginations as medium for enacting the hegemonic
   project of Western modernity-coloniality. Rather than passive
   subscribers to powerful but deceitful political utopias, `peripheral'
   migrant subjects emerge as autonomous agents, articulating radically
   different visions of the desirable and possible. The politicisation of
   the socialist past as a historical context of shared social meaning and
   experience, as well as a symbolic resource of forgotten ideals, opens up
   a space for critical engagement with the capitalist mechanisms producing
   despair in the present. Invoking meaning and value from previously
   existing ideals of solidarity, justice and egalitarianism as they relate
   to the realms of work, self-hood and socio-political organisation, my
   interlocutors countermap the trauma of the present to the stability and
   fullness of what was before, in the process hinting at a possible moment
   of `rupture' and `re-institution'. Respectful engagement with the `lay'
   socialisms of today, I suggest it is vital for exploring further the
   political capacity of the post-socialist imaginary and its possibilities
   for carving out self-affirming agendas for equality, collectiveness and
   working-class dignity.},

Abstract = {The article deals with decommunization in Ukraine from 2014 to 2020,
   examining the motives and actions of the main actors of this policy and
   societal responses and recounting its most significant developments and
   outcomes. The decommunization in Ukraine in 2014-2020 was a successful,
   though belated, effort initiated at a time when Communist symbols had
   lost their original ideological sense as well as social, cultural, and
   political significance. The promoters of decommunization reanimated it
   and managed to contextualize it under actual threat from Russia to
   justify their policy, which they used to promote a nationalist narrative
   of memory.},

Abstract = {Are personal stories more effective in shaping opinion than experts'
   endorsements? This study investigates the persuasiveness of personal
   stories and expert endorsements in shaping public opinion on education
   spending and pollution reduction policies. Using a survey experiment in
   Spain, we found that personal stories consistently increased support for
   both policies, with a particularly strong effect on citizens with
   populist attitudes or voters of populist parties. These findings
   contribute to a better understanding of the success of populist parties
   and the influence of personal stories on public opinion.},
