Abstract = {After World War II, and especially following the Civil Rights Movement,
   racism was generally rejected in the West, but the root of
   racism-capitalist private ownership-still exists. Since the Great
   Recession of 2008, racial problems have become increasingly serious. The
   living conditions of blacks and other minority groups have not improved,
   while ethnic and migrant conflicts are widening. At the same time, white
   supremacism has gone on the offensive, ``neo-racism{''} has emerged, and
   far-right parties and organizations are on the rise. The anti-racist
   movement faces bleak prospects in the ``post-ideological{''} era. The
   initiative of ``building a community with a shared future for
   mankind{''} proposed by China advocates that all civilizations should
   draw on each other's strong points, make common progress, and promote a
   higher level of liberation for the masses, including colored people. In
   this way, we can create better conditions for a transition to a more
   advanced social system.},

Abstract = {Why does the scale and intensity of protest vary so widely across
   Russian cities? This article answers this question by disaggregating
   political opportunity structures to consider the interaction between
   formal and informal political factors through a paired comparison of two
   similar Russian cities during the turbulent 1990s. Drawing on archival
   documents, interviews, and an analysis of local media, I argue that the
   observed variation depends on elite strategies for social control and
   local governmental institutions. Specifically, when a city's
   institutions and political elite strategy match, either with
   undemocratic institutions and a closed political elite strategy, or with
   democratic institutions and an open political elite strategy, protests
   are likely to be small and insignificant. In contrast, when the
   institutional architecture and political elite strategies mismatch,
   protests are more likely to be large and intense because there is an
   opening for protest, but not institutionalized paths for participation.},

Abstract = {Transportation costs are an under-studied barrier to political
   participation. In many elections worldwide, subsidies to voter
   transportation are already provided or are under discussion. However,
   these types of incentives have not been rigorously evaluated. Here we
   examine possibly the world's largest-ever intervention to lower these
   costs, the adoption of a fare-free public transit policy in Brazil
   during the 2022 national election, when about half of Brazilian voters
   were granted the right to use public transit for free on election days.
   However, while some cities adopted the benefit for both rounds of the
   election, others adopted it only for the second round. Using an event
   study design, we exploit this difference in adoption timing to examine
   the policy's causal impact on voter turnout rates and human mobility
   levels. We find that fare-free transit increased ridership between 7.2\%
   and 17.5\% on election days, however, we estimate a precise and robust
   null effect of the policy on voter turnout (Coef. -0.03p.p. with
   standard error of 0.22p.p.). Our results illustrate that monetary
   transport costs may not always be a critical factor behind
   non-participation. Although reducing transportation costs improves
   access to polling places, we show that even a full transit subsidy may
   not be sufficient to increase voter turnout.},

Abstract = {Differentiated integration, and the prospect thereof, is a prominent
   feature of European integration and policymaking. This article theorizes
   and demonstrates an explicit link between the threat of differentiated
   integration and the resolution of major European integration crises.
   Based on archival sources and secondary literature on differentiated
   integration, it shows how and why, in June 1984, the United Kingdom and
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher agreed to increase the European
   Community's (EC) financial resources, despite their years-long
   insistence on budgetary restraint and their formal right to veto such a
   decision. The article argues that the prospect of a `multi-speed'
   Europe, represented by Franco-German `go-it-alone' power, threatened to
   exclude recalcitrant member states. Lacking more promising alternatives
   to continued membership in a reformed EC, the British government
   consented to European financial objectives. It also joined the other
   national governments towards deeper political integration and,
   eventually, a European Union, despite its actual rejection of European
   federal ambitions. The article's theoretical expectations and empirical
   findings on ways to overcome intergovernmental deadlock based on formal
   national veto rights have broader implications also for more recent
   European integration crises.},

   passionately angry political speech is an urgently needed addition to

   exaggeration and distortion and is therefore liable to be amplified into

Abstract = {Economic development and accompanying structural changes of the economy
   create new opportunities, however not everywhere and not for everyone.
   Development increases the demand for skilled labor, improving their
   welfare perceptions, but low-skilled workers feel more insecure and
   worse off economically. This adverse effect results from a mismatch
   between local labor demand and individual skill sets. To measure the
   development levels of people's local environments, I combine geocoded
   Afrobarometer data and night lights. Bayesian multilevel analysis
   confirms that the highly skilled are economically most dissatisfied in
   lagging areas, while the low-skilled are less satisfied in highly
   developed environments. These findings emphasize the importance of local
   conditions for welfare perceptions and show the unequal effect of
   development leaving behind large parts of the population.},

Abstract = {Coastal West African countries are in a threat anticipatory anxiety
   mode: over the fear that subaltern violent ``jihadist{''} groups (SVJGs)
   are breaching their borders and heading south from across the Sahel. In
   Ghana, this fear has led to a build-up of commentaries, political
   statements, and counter-extremism/counterterrorism programs. This
   article interrogates the terrorism discourse in this West African
   country at the intersection of critical security studies and the
   politics of space, by applying securitisation theory and critical
   discourse analysis. In what is the most comprehensive academic review of
   news articles on the terrorism discourse in Ghana yet, I contend that
   the discourse evokes what Boaventura de Sousa Santos calls `abyssal
   thinking' and creates cognitive and physical spatial abyssal lines. On
   the invisible side, insecurity within Ghana gets ``normalised{''} by the
   discourse. On the visible side, however, SVJGs are securitised as
   abnormal, foreign, and uniquely threatening. This nature of the
   discourse effectively places events and conditions in the country that
   are either terroristic or constitutive of terrorism on the invisible
   side of Ghana's security priorities. The discourse, therefore, hides
   much about the reality of insecurity and political violence within the
   country. These arguments advance the frontiers of security/terrorism
   knowledge and practice in West Africa by demonstrating the pervasiveness
   of ``global war on terror{''} systems of representation, two decades
   after their inception and despite its flaws and adverse implications for
   human and national security.},

Abstract = {Over two decades, voters who emphasised their English identity played an
   influential role in the rise of UKIP and the Brexit Party, the Brexit
   referendum and the election of Conservative governments-a trend
   overlooked in most electoral analyses. Using twenty years of data from
   the British Election Study and British Social Attitudes Survey, as well
   as recent original surveys, the article explores the evolving political
   behaviour of national identity groups. It finds that `more English' and
   `more British' identifiers increasingly voted for different parties. The
   analysis also identifies growing differences in the demographics, social
   values and immigration attitudes of these groups, which descriptive and
   regression analysis suggests may underpin these divergent political
   behaviours. However, a fuller understanding of electoral behaviour must
   take account of ideas of national democracy and sovereignty. The
   electoral impact of both the characteristics of English identifying
   voters and ideas associated with English identity constitute `political
   Englishness'.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, governing parties in Central and Eastern Europe
   have dismantled liberal democracy, violating the rule of law and
   limiting the power of judges. This article examines the opposition to
   these transformations, focusing on the role of judges in Poland,
   Hungary, and Romania. Drawing on an original survey, as well as a set of
   interviews with judges, the article shows that while in Poland judges
   have developed a unified opposition to the government in defending their
   independence, in Romania, in contrast, governmental measures have
   polarized judges into a divided opposition, while their mobilization has
   been rather non-existent in Hungary. Why do judges oppose governmental
   action limiting judicial independence in some contexts but not in
   others? The article shows that the nature and the sequencing of domestic
   transformations, coupled with ideational factors and interests-based
   calculations, explain judges' opposition at the collective and
   individual levels.},

Abstract = {Research suggests that single-issue groups and labor unions have been

   whether other types of groups, including trade and professional
   associations, have experienced such incorporation. I argue that some
   groups are closely aligned with one of the political parties, but others
   choose not to affiliate for strategic reasons rooted in their membership
   and policy goals. I develop a new measure-Party Proximity Index-to plot
   a unique dataset of 2040 interest groups on a partisan scale that
   provides valuable information about variation in interest group lobbying
   strategies, the ways interest groups mobilize their members, and groups'
   relationships to parties over time.},

Abstract = {I apply a new theoretical framework to voting to more cohesively bridge
   the economic cost-benefit model of voting with the psychology-motivated
   voting-as-a-habit literature. This new theoretical frame gives greater
   clarity as to how a vote in one election might beget a vote in another
   election, while yielding testable predictions as to which circumstances
   are more favorable for developing turnout persistence. To test these
   predictions, I make use of a novel dataset consisting of nine large-N,
   door-to-door voter mobilization field experiments in various election
   contexts (with similar to 1.8 million voters in total). Consistent with
   prior empirical research, my analysis finds that being nudged to vote in
   one election leads to increased turnout four years later. But the main
   contribution of this paper is that the theoretical framework's
   predictions and the corresponding empirical results make sense of
   turnout persistence heterogeneities that have been detected in certain
   prior empirical studies but not others.},

Abstract = {The rise of right-wing populist parties in Western democracies has led
   to a renewed interest in theories concerning class-based voting. It is
   argued that traditional workers' parties are increasingly being
   challenged over the working-class vote by the populist radical right
   because they are perceived as being too culturally liberal for their own
   electorate. However, while it is established that the views of
   traditional parties are often incongruent with those of workers, it is
   not yet clear whether right-wing populist parties fare any better in
   this regard. Using many-to-many congruence, this article compares the
   preferences of different social classes and MPs in the 2017 German
   Federal Election. Three notable findings emerge. First, opinion gaps
   vary greatly across issues, and occupational groups do not hold
   fundamentally different views. Second, there are nonetheless significant
   congruence gaps at the expense of workers. Third, neither left-wing
   parties' MPs nor the right-wing populist AfD MPs provide a good fit for
   workers' opinions.},

Abstract = {Polarization, populism, and animosity amongst political parties,
   movements, and societies across Europe and North America has led to an
   increase in violent extremism in recent years. Groups and individuals
   motivated by extremist ideology have launched violent attacks against
   democratic institutions, murdered elected representatives, and bombed
   government buildings. Militia organizations with a pro-state orientation
   have also been involved in anti-government extremist violence and
   terrorism against their own governments. Despite being pro-nation-state,
   some of these militias now have an anti-government agenda leading to an
   awkward relationship with the state as a diverse actor encompassing both
   the government and other state institutions. How can we explain the
   shift in pro-nation-state militias from pro to anti-government
   extremism? Using contemporary case studies from both the United States
   of America and Ukraine, this article will propose that ideological
   de-alignment between the government and the militia group leads to
   pro-state militias becoming anti-government. Furthermore, the article
   will argue that bargaining processes relating to power and control
   between pro-state militias and governments can lead to these militias
   exhibiting anti-government extremist behaviour.},

Abstract = {This article delves into the legal discussions surrounding the crisis
   unleashed by the military operation launched on October 7, 2023, in
   Southern Israel by Palestinian forces of the resistance based in Gaza.
   Israel considered this a ``terrorist attack,{''} asserted the right of
   self-defense, declared war on Gazans, and started the continuous and
   indiscriminate bombardment of Gaza. As a result, Gaza has become the new
   Dresden, in which thousands have been killed and tens of thousands
   injured. This article is an attempt to answer the following questions to
   illuminate the legal issues surrounding the current crisis and the
   broader context of Israel's legal status as a state and its territorial
   claims: Was the Palestinian offensive in Southern Israel an instance of
   terrorism and/or an act of aggression? Which side of the conflict can
   rightfully claim the right of self-defense? Did Israel commit genocide
   in Gaza? Do Israel's statehood and territorial claims rest on firm legal
   grounds? Is it legally sensible to argue that Israel is a threat to
   international peace and security?},

Abstract = {When and why do human rights-defending countries tolerate the actions of
   known rights violators? This paper examines that question using New
   Zealand's bilateral relationships with the Republic of Turkey (also
   Turkiye) and the People's Republic of China. The aim is to ascertain
   systematic regularities as to when and why New Zealand, a liberal
   democratic state with an expressed commitment to human rights, has been
   relatively mum on atrocities in China and Turkey. Drawing from archival
   and recent documentary evidence, the article finds that shifting
   commercial interests play a key role in New Zealand's reticence, and
   that its relationships with China and Turkey have deepened over time,
   even amid increasing authoritarianism and human rights abuses in these
   countries.},

Abstract = {What explains variation in neighborhood problem-solving? We argue that
   collective action infrastructure-place-based connections, organizations,
   knowledge, and practices formed while organizing-can reduce the costs of
   local collective action, even in communities without preexisting social
   and civic organizations. We adapt theories from the social movements
   literature about mobilizing structures and personal networks to the
   neighborhood context and propose that, even absent preexisting
   structures, an initial act of organizing in the face of a salient
   problem can itself facilitate future organizing. In contrast to
   expectations that local organizations will disband quickly upon
   achieving their initial goal, we argue that, because neighborhood
   problem-solving involves fixed costs and overlapping constituencies,
   local organizing infrastructure is often repurposable across issue
   areas. Observational data, a natural experiment, and a survey experiment
   from an online survey of residents across Mexico City demonstrate these
   downstream effects of organizing, even across unrelated issues.},

Abstract = {For many decades now, high-level studies have been dedicated to etienne
   de La Boe-tie and his Discours de la servitude volontaire. These
   studies, however, partly due to the particular history of the Discours,
   have often remained disconnected from each other. The last decade, on
   the other hand, has seen a real flowering of laboetian studies. And the
   emergence of what had been partly missing: a common debate, capable of
   bringing together different methodologies and interpretations. This
   essay offers a brief but argued overview of this flowering. First it
   presents the most important recent conferences and publications. And
   then it focuses on two essays. Historian Anne-Marie Cocula-Vaillieres'
   book etienne de La Boetie et le destin du Discours de la servitude
   volontaire (2018): an excellent essay where the reconstruction of La
   Boetie's life and the study of the history of the Bordeaux region in the
   16th century enrich each other. And Le soi subjugue. Servitude
   volontaire et cliniques de l'alienation (2022) by philosopher Tristan
   Dagron. Which I argue to be one of the most convincing attempts ever to
   come to terms (in both philosophical and psychological terms) with the
   psycho-political << phenomenon >> of voluntary servitude.},

Abstract = {Placebo tests are increasingly common in applied social science
   research, but the methodological literature has not previously offered a
   comprehensive account of what we learn from them. We define placebo
   tests as tools for assessing the plausibility of the assumptions
   underlying a research design relative to some departure from those
   assumptions. We offer a typology of tests defined by the aspect of the
   research design that is altered to produce it (outcome, treatment, or
   population) and the type of assumption that is tested (bias assumptions
   or distributional assumptions). Our formal framework clarifies the extra
   assumptions necessary for informative placebo tests; these assumptions
   can be strong, and in some cases similar assumptions would justify a
   different procedure allowing the researcher to relax the research
   design's assumptions rather than test them. Properly designed and
   interpreted, placebo tests can be an important device for assessing the
   credibility of empirical research designs.},

Abstract = {We conceptualize the reach of the state by examining how the physical
   presence of the state helps the state project its power by signaling
   state interests and strength. We present a new measurement strategy to
   capture the territorial reach of the state using points-of-interest data
   provided by location-based service companies. Our measure exhibits
   several advantages: (1) it draws on firm-produced or crowd-sourced
   (rather than government-produced) data, (2) it includes highly precise,
   geo-referenced location information, which can be aggregated to any
   geographical or administrative level, (3) it traces temporal changes,
   and (4) it covers different types of state agencies. We illustrate its
   features using original databases that we compiled on state agencies in
   China and other countries. We demonstrate how researchers can use our
   measure by examining the locations and effects of coercive organizations
   and provide our data, code, and a tutorial to help researchers explore
   new avenues of inquiry.},

Abstract = {A hidden facet of democratization in the world over the past two
   centuries has been the increased weight of people's voice in electing
   presidents. On the basis of new data on all presidential elections in
   the world since 1789, we show that they evolved from systems in which
   the final decision was made by someone other than voters, to systems in
   which the choice of voters was decisive only if it generated a majority,
   to systems in which the final decision is made by voters. This means
   that in countries where presidents have executive powers, elections may
   not be the mechanism by which the people, as a collectivity, always
   selects its rulers, thus violating the fundamental norm of democracy. We
   document the history of presidential election rules, offer some
   tentative explanations, and explore the consequences of particular
   systems.},

Abstract = {A variety of research has found strong evidence that men are more likely
   to donate to political parties and candidates relative to women. Yet
   studies of other kinds of political participation have observed a
   shrinking gender gap. What explains this variation? One possible
   explanation comes from several studies that report women are more likely
   to donate to nonpolitical groups when told they have been entered into a
   monetary draw. Does simulating resource equality also reduce the
   political donations gender gap? To answer this question, we analyse
   original Canadian data from two surveys that asked participants how much
   they would give to a federal (survey 1)/provincial (survey 2) political
   party if they were given CDN\$100. Contrary to our expectations, we find
   no gender gap at the federal level and a positive gap favouring women at
   the provincial level.},

Abstract = {Non Profit associations in Lebanon are governed by the 1909 Law of
   Associations, an Ottoman law predating the creation of the state that
   was based on the French law of associations. The main aim of this paper
   is to assess the extent to which the law offers an enabling environment
   for associations' development in Lebanon. Based on 15 interviews
   conducted with experts and activists in the field, the main argument
   this paper presents is that although the law itself is fair and
   supportive to associations, the vagueness of its wording and
   interference by Lebanese state government are hindering the development
   of associations in Lebanon. In other words, analyzing the Law of
   Associations as it is written is inadequate to comprehend the state of
   associations. Lebanon's historical, political and social context must be
   taken into account to shed light on the law's implementation. The paper
   argues that the absence of a comprehensive programme of action or a
   movement to defend the autonomy of association could be encouraging the
   state administration to interfere in associations' internal governance.
   Civil society has a long road ahead of it in order to reach full
   independence.},

Abstract = {This article examines the effect of racial attitudes on the electoral
   performance of the New Democratic Party (NDP). Since 2017, the NDP has
   been led by Jagmeet Singh, the first non-white leader of a nationally
   competitive Canadian political party. Voters' racial attitudes and the
   race of party leaders have a significant effect on vote choice in the
   United States. Less is known about whether similar effects exist in
   Canadian elections. I show that NDP vote choice polarized on the basis
   of racial attitudes following Singh's ascension to party leader. Voters
   with cold feelings toward racial minorities were less likely to vote for
   the NDP in 2019 and 2021 than in comparable historical elections. In
   contrast, there is no significant difference between 2019/2021 and prior
   elections in support for the Liberals and Conservatives among such
   voters. These results suggest that racial attitudes are salient in
   Canadian elections and that national parties may face an electoral
   penalty when selecting non-white party leaders.},

Abstract = {Radical right parties are commonly associated with nativism and
   opposition to ethnic diversity, but there have been few systematic
   attempts to investigate this connection further. Noting that radical
   right parties in Europe do not express hostility towards all minorities
   or all immigrants, I investigate possible explanations for the
   difference in targeted hostility. I introduce the concept of targeted
   nativism, distinguishing between ethnic minorities that are excluded
   using the nativist cleavage, and those that are implicitly included in
   `the nation'. I propose three explanations for the targeted nativism,
   identifying minority outgroups based on: (1) ethnocultural differences,
   (2) minority political empowerment, or (3) ethnocultural minority
   accommodation. I examine these explanations using the examples of
   radical right parties in Sweden and Bulgaria, and further test these
   hypotheses with a new dataset that identifies targeted minorities. My
   findings indicate that more distinctive minorities are significantly
   more likely to be targeted by the radical right.},

Abstract = {This paper examines strategic voting at Scottish Parliamentary elections
   since 1999. The emergence of the pro-independence Scottish National
   Party as the dominant party in Scotland has forced unionist voters to
   carefully consider their options. Analysing differences between the
   simultaneous pluralist constituency ballot and proportional list ballot
   of Scotland's Additional Member System provides a unique insight into
   how voter behaviour has changed in response to Scotland's changing
   political reality. This paper finds that many unionist voters have put
   aside left-right rivalries to support fellow unionist candidates on the
   constituency ballot. This examination finds that Labour and Conservative
   voters are willing to work together, in some circumstances, to defeat a
   significant number of pro-independence candidates. I find that
   intra-unionist strategic voting helped prevent the separatist majorities
   in parliament in both 2016 and 2021.},

Abstract = {Does participation in conflicts abroad lead to a great risk of conflict
   escalation at home? We contend that involvement in interstate conflict
   can impact the likelihood of civil conflict escalation via international
   conflict's effects on domestic repression. During international
   conflict, states employ their military abroad to cope with an external
   threat, so they may have fewer resources with which to repress.
   Insurgencies may thus seize the opportunity to target the state. We
   predict that states that maintain high levels of repression during
   international conflict will be less likely to experience civil conflict
   escalation, but that states whose repressive output weakens increase
   their risk of such escalation. Utilizing mediation analysis, we find
   evidence that involvement in international conflict shifts repressive
   patterns, influencing internal conflict intensity. Specifically,
   governments that increase repression in the shadow of international
   conflict are less likely to witness civil conflict escalation while
   states that maintain or decrease repression are more likely.},

   Contentious Elections: Evidence from a US 2020 Election Panel Survey},

Abstract = {What effects do contentious elections have on partisan appraisals of
   democracy? We consider the case of the November 2020 US election, a
   highly polarized partisan contest but also an objectively free and fair
   election by credible accounting. We conducted a panel study embedded
   within two nationally representative surveys before and after the
   election. Results indicate a familiar but underexamined partisan gap, in
   which satisfaction with democracy decreases among Republicans and
   increases among Democrats relative to nonpartisans. We find that the gap
   is fully mediated by partisan shifts in satisfaction with elections and
   the news media that cover them. Our results underscore how eroding
   institutional confidence can undermine democratic legitimacy in hitherto
   consolidated democracies. To overcome partisan divisions following
   contentious elections, we highlight the need to bolster confidence in
   democratic institutions to reduce partisan fears and uncertainties-both
   rational and irrational-that electoral losses may trigger.},

Abstract = {The similarity of parties' policy preferences has long been considered
   an important determinant of whether they form a government coalition.
   That similarity has typically been assessed based on parties' respective
   locations in a policy space. The degree to which parties care about
   different issues may, however, also vary. Parties that care about
   different issues may actually be the most compatible partners, as their
   tangential preferences would allow them to engage in policy logrolling
   and enable them to preserve their distinctiveness in the eyes of voters.
   This analysis tests arguments regarding the role of tangentiality and
   its interaction with policy proximity on the party composition of
   governments formed in Western Europe from 1945 to 2019. The findings
   show that parties that emphasise the same issues are more natural
   coalition partners provided the ideological differences between the
   parties are sufficiently similar.},

Abstract = {While a large and growing body of work has explored the effects of
   minority representation, Europe's oldest minority has been overlooked.
   Previous studies have shown that social exclusion and abstention rates
   in districts with a high Romani population are inflated (Carmona in
   Sociol Hist 10(1):174-205, 2019). Still, no individual data has ever
   been used to understand Romanies' participation in politics. Combining a
   pool of datasets covering Romanies in Spain with district and municipal
   level data, we comprehensively study Romanies' turnout. Controlling for
   several individual and district variables, we find that Romanies vote
   less, are less interested, and think that elections are less useful than
   the rest of the Spaniards. Our results suggest that socialization plays
   a role. Both living in a Romani district and following evangelism affect
   the reasons given by Romanies to never participate in politics: while
   those who live in Romani districts declare to abstain because of
   thinking that elections are useless, those who live in non-Romani
   neighborhoods declare to abstain because they are non-interested in
   politics.},

Abstract = {From the late 1980s onward, Daniel Bensaid developed an extensive
   theoretical oeuvre marked by the influence of Walter Benjamin
   intertwined with Bensaid's own classical Marxist background. Through
   Benjamin, Bensaid came to the work of Charles Peguy, whose role in his
   thought has yet to be fully analyzed. Bensaid does not ignore Peguy's
   contradictions and limits but reads them selectively to better
   understand history, politics, and temporality. The starting point of
   Bensaid's analysis of Peguy is the triad formed by the critique of
   historical reason, modern temporality, and progress. Peguy was also a
   source of inspiration for his reflection on politics, victory, and
   defeat and for his framing of political commitment as a melancholic
   wager.},

Abstract = {This extract from two interviews that took place in 2021 and 2023 with
   Nevhiz Tanyeli at her home in Sisli, Istanbul centers on a dialogue over
   her paintings, the possible interpretations of which the interviewers
   had discussed beforehand, informed by Bulent Kucuk's research on
   remembrances of Turkey during the events of 1968. Tanyeli offered both
   tea and counterinterpretations in her unique and witty style, with the
   interviewers both taken aback and learning something new. Her stories'
   poetic sensibilities weave the violent historicity of witnessed events
   with personal memories of the living and the dead. Her paintings
   constitute a diary that combines the personal with the political, the
   dreamlike with the factual, and the associative with the nightmarish and
   repetitive real of the past. Her paintings, while they belong to certain
   dates, characters, and places, thus remain open for others' imaginations
   to interpret. As a living participant and witness of `68, her creative
   will yet speaks to us.},

Title = {Class Root of Police Brutality: The Missing Gap in the Black Lives
   Matter Movement},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {381-402},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {This paper explores the activism of the Black Lives Matter (BLM)
   movement and argues that the missing link in the movement is the class
   question, which has impacted on its tactics, strategies, and modus
   operandi. Since its emergence, the BLM movement has won some concessions
   in police reforms, defunding of police, policy changes in use of body
   camera and greater transparency in policing, yet the problems of racism,
   police brutality, over-policing, and police killings persist. What seems
   to be problematic is the narrow understanding of the problems and the
   cosmetic nature of police reforms that have failed to address the
   capitalist root of the problem. By sidestepping the class question, the
   movement has failed to understand that racism, police brutality, and
   police killings are essential tools used by the ruling class and the
   state in the American capitalist system to sustain its rules,
   domination, and control. By taking the class question off the agenda,
   the engagement of the BLM movement has been reduced to the race question
   and race consciousness, which led to a failure to unpack racism and
   policing as class questions and draw the tactics of the movement around
   the class question. The solution to this impasse is to understand black
   struggle as a subset of class struggle and prioritise the radicalisation
   of the black working class as a social base to connect with the black
   underclass and American working class in general and externalise the
   issues as generic problems facing Americans. The paper concludes that it
   is the unity of the American working class that can confront the
   capitalist underpinning of the problems of racism, police brutality, and
   extra-judicial police killings in American society.},

Abstract = {This research analyzes the Peruvian party system between 2001 and 2022
   through a longitudinal and comparative study. During this period, a very
   low institutionalization of the party system, growing tensions between
   the executive and the legislature, and progressive fragmentation and
   atomization of Congress stand out. This party fragmentation was
   reflected in the executive, where 12 presidents held office and eight
   vacancy processes were initiated, but also in the legislature, with high
   volatility and difficulty in reaching majorities. Thus, Peru has become
   an interesting case study on the effects that a party system with low
   institutionalization can have on the political system as a whole and the
   importance of analyzing this variable. In this sense, the harmful
   effects on both powers and governance are evidenced, as well as the
   absence of indicators that attest to possible consolidation.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article was to highlight the essence andspecific
   features of the transformation of the Ukrainian statepolicy in the
   health sector during the development of martial law.The methodological
   basis of this research grouped a set of generaland special scientific
   methods of scientific cognition (deductive,comparative and legal,
   comparative, systems analysis method, formaland logical method, etc.).
   Everything indicates that, the destabilizingfactors affecting the state
   policy include the reaction to the armedaggression of another state and
   the subsequent introduction of martial law. The authors have emphasized
   the regulatory legal acts of the national legislation of Ukraine, which
   establish the principles for the formation and implementation of state
   policy in the health sector. Specific features of the transformation of
   state policy in the health sector during martial law have been
   identified and revealed. It has been concluded that the state policy in
   the health sector is characterized by a dual nature, which consists in
   its stability, on the one hand, and at the same time, wide adaptability
   to changes and needs caused by martial law.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to determine the methodological aspects
   of the construction of mechanisms for strengthening economic sovereignty
   in the context of the processes of globalization and war. Comparative
   law and economic statistics were used in the study. The research found
   that economic security, which showed a significant decrease after a
   large-scale invasion, is the material expression of economic
   sovereignty. The Debt/GDP ratio reached 85\% and gross external debt was
   83\% of GDP. Mechanisms for strengthening Ukraine's economic sovereignty
   and economic security were determined by analysing international
   experience. They included, in particular: improvement of the legal
   framework, development of emergency response mechanisms, development of
   international partnerships, strengthening of economic governance,
   balancing regional development. Reactive and proactive approaches to the
   development of response measures should be taken into account when
   introducing such mechanisms. The results of the study are of value to
   government representatives in terms of ensuring the economic security
   and economic sovereignty of the country. Further research can focus on
   identifying the main methods for forecasting threats to the economic
   sovereignty of the country.},

Title = {Women's Political Representation in African Rebel Parties},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 1},
Abstract = {Across Africa, women's political representation is twice as high in
   postconflict states as it is in non-conflict-afflicted states. Scholars
   have attributed gains to changing gender norms, international pressure,
   and local women's movements. However, these factors do not explain
   variance in women's representation across political parties. This
   article asks how the conflict legacies of political parties influence
   these trends, by analyzing patterns of women's political representation
   in rebel groups that transition into political parties. The article
   argues that these parties have unique incentives to promote women's
   representation. Novel data on women's candidacy and electoral success at
   the party level in postconflict Africa from 1970 to 2020 are presented.
   Findings suggest that rebel parties run and elect significantly more
   women than other political parties. These results are consistent across
   contexts, including varying conflict outcomes. These findings are
   relevant to understanding women's postconflict political representation
   and the role of women in rebel parties.},

Abstract = {The invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, a sovereign
   country, has been interpreted from different points of view: However,
   beyond the different opinions, it is clear that this war, which took
   place in Eastern Europe, has meant a hard blow for global finances, with
   concrete effects in the increase of fuel prices (gas and coal), in high
   inflation rates and, according to data from the World Bank (WB, 2023),
   it has also created an international environment of restrictive
   financial conditions that hinder macroeconomic recovery in terms of
   sustainable economic development, after the COVID-19 pandemic. In this
   order of ideas, using a documentary methodology of geopolitical
   analysis, which values the geographic conditions of each country, its
   particular history and its international relations, the objective of the
   article was to interpret the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine
   on world finances. The results obtained allow us to conclude that the
   Russian invasion of Ukraine has had far-reaching consequences on world
   finance. The economic impacts of this invasion have been significant,
   with disruptions in supply chains, fluctuations in inflation and
   commodity prices, among others.},

Title = {Foreign policy strategy of the Communist party of Cuba at the present
   stage},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {52},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The article is examining the foreign policy strategy of the Communist
   Party of Cuba (PCC) at the current stage and identifies its key
   elements. The author, in reviewing the foreign policy doctrine of the
   PCC in the past, demonstrates that since the 1960s, the PCC has been
   characterized by a revolutionary and ideologized foreign policy line
   that, in the context of the real foreign policy of the Republic of Cuba,
   has manifested itself in various expressions of internationalism and
   anti-imperialism. He concludes that in Cuba, where a socio-political
   system of the ``party-state{''} type is maintained, it is the attitude
   of the PCC leaders that plays a decisive role in the implementation of
   contemporary foreign policy. All the institutions of the executive
   branch function interdependently, which contributes to the
   implementation of a firm and conciliated foreign policy, in accordance
   with the general line of the party. The analysis of the programmatic and
   political documents and the materials of the PCC congresses shows that
   the ideological component continues to play a crucial role in the
   implementation of Cuban foreign policy. It is thanks to the PCC's
   foreign policy strategy that Cuba in the XXI century represents a
   classic example of left-wing foreign policy. In particular, this
   political line is clearly manifested in its anti-imperialist component,
   which goes back to the history of the PCC and the Cuban communist
   movement. The anti-imperialism of the PCC is of a fundamental nature,
   but it mainly has a spearhead against the United States. The article
   shows the great importance of the integration processes in Latin America
   for the PCC and Cuba's contribution to the development of integration
   associations in Latin America and the Caribbean, especially ALBA. The
   author analyzes the contemporary approach of the Cuban communists
   towards the paradigm of the New World Order. The article deals with the
   importance of the CPC's relations with the Marxist-Leninist parties in
   power in Asian countries. The author also comes to conclusion that the
   PCC objectively plays a very important role in the activities of the
   international and Latin American communist left movement.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to understand, from a sociological point of view,
   what has been the central principle of reflection/rationalization of the
   academic discourse of marketing over the last decades, particularly
   since the eighties, and its connection with the paradigm of managerial
   strategy. This research objective has been set in the light of the study
   of 20th century neoliberalism and the Foucauldian perspective that asks
   about the government of people: how is the conduction of the conduct? In
   this case, we are interested in clarifying the historical conditions of
   possibility that allowed marketing to establish -in its discursive
   practices- a general reflexive principle that orients the subjects
   involved in the field of marketing and business, but which expands to
   the programming of everyday life. Thus, we propose to think of marketing
   as a governmental technology that has been rationalized from the
   principle of strategic ``competitiveness{''}.},

   on the descriptive representation of women in Chile. For this purpose, a
   case study is made of the 2013 legislative elections, which did not
   include any gender affirmative action mechanism; the 2017 and 2021
   legislative elections with quota; and the 2021 election of convention
   members, which for the first time in the country included parity in the
   lists and in the composition of the Convention. The evaluation is
   carried out through six variables: seats; voting; candidacies; placement
   of women in lists and districts; gender gap and institutional strength
   of the quota/parity. The results indicate that, in the short term and in
   all variables, parity with a strong institutional design produces better
   results than the quota in descriptive representation of women in Chile.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the validity of the second-order model in the 2019
   municipal elections. We focus, first, on the theoretical evolution that
   has transformed the model proposed by Reif and Schmitt specialIntscript
   Second, it evaluates the explanatory capacity of a model that does not
   fit with highly fragmented and heterogeneous units of analysis. Finally,
   a contextual analysis is presented to provide a more robust explanation
   of the 2019 Spanish municipal election.},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that voters not only rely on characteristics of
   candidates, such as age and gender, but also on procedural cues to
   evaluate candidates, particularly on how candidates were selected. I
   argue that selection via primaries, which has become popular in Western
   Europe, is an important cue to voters. Drawing on procedural fairness
   theory, I develop contradicting arguments about how primaries affect
   voters' evaluations of candidate quality, such that either the logic of
   procedural fairness improves voters' evaluations of candidates' quality,
   or the violation thereof through clientelism and vote-buying leads to
   worse evaluations of candidates. I employ a conjoint experiment,
   implemented in Spain, and analyze responses to an open-ended question to
   investigate underlying mechanisms. The findings indicate that voters
   perceive candidates resulting out of primaries as outsiders, who are
   less corrupt but also less experienced and less competent.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the determinants of populist attitudes among
   ethnic minorities. It breaks with conventional studies of the so-called
   losers of globalization, which focus almost exclusively on the majority
   population. Minorities were not spared by the economic and cultural
   displacements of late modernity and often suffer structural
   disadvantages vis-a-vis the majority population. Displacement and
   discrimination threaten the social position of established ethnic
   minorities - many of which arrived in Europe as guestworkers in the
   1960s. Threatened, at once, by persistent skepticism form the majority
   population and new arrivals into the political community, it is
   plausible that such established minority groups share in the populist
   resentment currently sweeping continental Europe. Using the 2014 Belgian
   Ethnic Minority Election Study, we investigate how resentment might
   trigger the populist attitudes of anti-elitism and a preference for
   unmediated popular sovereignty, not only among the most vulnerable, but
   among those who occupy intermediate social positions.},

Abstract = {Not all aspects of a campaign are issue-oriented, nor are many voters. A
   candidate builds mass support largely by appearing warm, friendly, and
   likable, not only by propagating their viewpoints on controversial
   issues. Based on a prominent candidate's Twitter accounts and the
   associated analytics, our research analyzes the online content and
   reaction to every post across a four-year period, both before and after
   a major general election. Twitter's analytic measures demonstrate how a
   campaign uses social media to accomplish very different outreach goals.
   Warm and non-politically oriented messages attract broad support in the
   form of audience likes but are not retweeted with as much frequency as
   messages that are less liked but more politically pointed. The
   undeniable popularity of personal, earnest messages underscores the
   power of the social media platform to present candidates in an
   approachable and convivial way, despite the necessity of taking
   positions on difficult issues.},

Abstract = {In addition to interest in undergraduate research, political science
   increasingly recognizes the value of civically engaged research for
   various educational, professional, and civic outcomes. With limited time
   and steep tradeoffs, instructors must find ways to cleverly combine
   undergraduate research experiences with the broader normative
   civic-education responsibilities of political science and higher
   education. This article presents a course design that allows instructors
   to leverage their classroom for both civic education and undergraduate
   research without the need for previously developed community
   partnerships that are common to most engaged research and learning. Our
   approach brings together undergraduate research and community engagement
   through course design.},

   compiled in the work Eco de Caminos (1974). In addition, it is

   starts to record the different moments of said process. The strong
   ideological component of Aguirres work in general and of his conception
   of the national in particular is demonstrated; and this is the basis of
   its value and originality.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-75},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a framework of immigrant acceptance that accounts
   for both group-level and individual-level characteristics and conducts a
   novel test of the cultural threat hypothesis. Immigrants' individual
   traits are conceptualized as secondary to their identity-based claims.
   The empirical strategy leverages a set of survey experiments conducted
   in the extreme rentier state of Qatar, where naturalization poses
   tangible negative financial consequences for citizens by expanding the
   pool of government welfare beneficiaries. Findings demonstrate that
   citizens are willing to share citizenship with a narrow ethnic in-group
   while individual cultural and economic attributes are lower-order
   determinants influencing economically vulnerable citizens. Importantly,
   answers to direct survey measures are at odds with these findings,
   demonstrating their susceptibility to social desirability bias.},

Abstract = {This review essay situates recent scholarship on two nineteenth-century
   Black American political activists, Maria Stewart and Henry McNeal
   Turner, in relation to contemporary Black political thought on the role
   of despair in the Black freedom struggle. As Jared Loggins has argued in
   this journal ({''}Who Decides What We Should Do with Our Despair?,{''}
   Winter 2022), despair's role is a question of political judgment: it is
   a decision to be made rather than an answer to be discovered. I argue
   that, by returning to the role of despair in nineteenth-century Black
   American political thought, we are able to enrich our political
   imagination concerning possibilities for despair and its counterpart,
   hope, in emancipatory politics. Maria Stewart offers us a vision of
   apocalyptic hope for the end of an unjust world, while Henry McNeal
   Turner despairingly declares that the Black freedom struggle must begin
   again.},

Abstract = {This research note investigates how different sources of economic
   information affected citizens' approval of the government in Portugal
   from 2001 to 2018. It compares the predictive power of the revised and
   most accurate data on GDP growth with other economic indicators that
   were available to the public at the time, such as the first estimates of
   recent growth and the forecasts of future growth. It finds that approval
   is best predicted by information about forecasted growth for the current
   year. These results provide further indirect evidence that the state of
   the economy, as it plays out directly in people's lives and experiences,
   may be less consequential for evaluations of the government than the
   mediated information about it that is conveyed to the public.},

Abstract = {Pluralism is a key component of liberal democracy, ensuring that diverse
   groups of citizens have opportunities to contribute to the governance of
   their society. Third sector organisations (TSOs) are central to
   pluralist democracy, representing diverse interests through advocacy.
   Advocacy has many forms but the most visible are protests or public
   demonstrations aimed at widespread public engagement. However,
   curtailing advocacy capacity for TSOs has been a political objective of
   conservative governments for several decades, with the Morrison-led
   Liberal/National Party government re-engaging in this behaviour. The
   article illuminates this behaviour through a case study of a recent
   legislative proposal (2021) to limit TSO advocacy. A qualitative
   discourse analysis of government and parliamentary materials shows how
   the state masked proposed changes through an illiberal and populist
   tactic that narrowed the focus to a narrative of `trust' and uncertainty
   lacking an evidentiary basis and despite recognition of the potential
   impact on Australian democracy.},

Abstract = {The end of the Civil War brought freedom to 3.9 million formerly
   enslaved people. Yet, almost immediately following the war, Southern
   states started to incarcerate freedpeople at unprecedented rates in an
   effort to reinstate racial hierarchies in the post-Emancipation era. Not
   before long, Southern states introduced new carceral institutions, most
   notably the convict-lease system, under which prisoners were leased out
   as laborers to private contractors for the duration of their sentence.
   The emergence of convict leasing has often been portrayed as a
   programmatic attempt by the Southern whites to find an alternative to
   antebellum chattel slavery.(1) Paying special attention to the
   sequencing of political events during Reconstruction, I revisit this
   story by highlighting the role that state capacity and public finance
   played in the introduction of the policy. As conviction numbers swelled
   after Emancipation, the carceral capacity of Southern penitentiaries was
   quickly overwhelmed, prompting Reconstruction legislatures and governors
   to search for alternatives to conventional imprisonment. I argue that
   convict leasing emerged from these capacity challenges as a
   cost-effective solution that initially enjoyed broad bipartisan support.
   Over time, leasing grew more profitable, both for the state governments
   and the lessees, and abolition efforts were stalled for decades, even
   when the system became increasingly abusive. Using a range of archival
   materials, I illustrate these carceral developments in an in-depth case
   study of the origins of convict leasing in Georgia.},

Abstract = {While the knowledge on how candidate selection happens is flourishing,
   remarkably little attention has been paid to the selection criteria. Why
   do selectors prefer some candidates? This study investigates the
   intricated trade-offs party selectors face when having to compromise
   between the pursuit of three core party goals: unity, policy, and
   victory. When candidates score lower on one goal, do selectors favour
   candidates following the party line, skilled for politics or able to
   garner votes? Relying on 23 in-depth interviews with party selectors
   from three Belgian francophone parties (Social Democrats, Greens, and
   Liberals), this research offers insight into how selectors balance their
   choices between candidates in a PR list context where the group
   equilibrium is almost as important as individual assets. I point out the
   interconnections selectors consider between selection criteria, and
   hence the need to regard the full picture instead of criteria on their
   own when studying intra-party competition at the nomination stage.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to contribute in two respects to the evolving
   research agenda focused on the problem of democratic resilience. First,
   we attempt to provide several clarifications regarding the general
   concept of `democratic resilience', in the course of which we both
   assess a number of accounts offered thus far and discuss some
   difficulties raised by elements of its most attractive articulation.
   Second, we outline a specific conception of democratic resilience framed
   on minimalist grounds and designed so as to be compatible with a wide
   range of descriptive and normative models of democracy. Aside from the
   conceptual and analytical value of these contributions, we also point to
   their practical relevance for both empirical assessments and for the
   normative and applied-level evaluation of democratic institutions and
   their performance.},

Abstract = {Administrative leader turnover adversely affects the organizational
   stability of U.S. federal executive agencies, as well as undermines
   presidents' policy goals. An incentive compatibility theory of
   administrative leader turnover is proposed that distinguishes between
   proponent (policy priority) versus caretaker (non-policy priority)
   loyalist executive appointees. This theory predicts that the proponents'
   tenure will be comparatively more stable since it reflects incentive
   compatibility for both the president and executive appointee compared to
   caretakers where such a relationship is lacking. The evidence comports
   with this logic by demonstrating that appointee loyalty results in a
   longer tenure in office when their agency constitutes a stated policy
   priority for the president at the time of agreed upon service compared
   to when this happens not to be the case. Responsive competence in
   executive administration requires incentive compatibility that benefits
   both the president and executive appointees for ensuring stable
   leadership of U.S. federal agencies.},

Abstract = {During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments across the
   globe implemented severe restrictions of civic freedoms to contain the
   spread of the virus. The global health emergency posed the risk of
   governments seizing the pandemic as a window of opportunity to curb
   (potential) challenges to their power, thereby reinforcing the ongoing,
   worldwide trend of shrinking civic spaces. In this article, we
   investigate whether and how governments used the pandemic as a
   justification to impose restrictions of freedom of expression. Drawing
   on the scholarship on the causes of civic space restrictions, we argue
   that governments responded to COVID-19 by curtailing the freedom of
   expression when they had faced significant contentious political
   challenges before the pandemic. Our results from a quantitative analysis
   indeed show that countries who experienced high levels of pro-democracy
   mobilization before the onset of the pandemic were more likely to see
   restrictions of the freedom of expression relative to countries with no
   or low levels of mobilization. Additional three brief case studies
   (Algeria, Bolivia and India) illustrate the process of how pre-pandemic
   mass protests fostered the im-position of restrictions on the freedom of
   expression during the pandemic.},

Abstract = {Following the resurgence of the extreme right in Europe, we have
   witnessed several attempts to classify these parties and group them
   together under a common label. These efforts have shown that there are
   significant differences within this ``family{''}. Some of these
   differences, such as the variations in the degree of radicalisation of
   their discourses, have not received the attention they merit. The goal
   of this research is to show that these differences in radicality
   indicate how individual parties adapt, through the use of language, in
   response to the specific cultural contexts in which they operate. To
   this end, we have performed an analysis of the language employed in five
   party platforms, linking the differences to the determinants of their
   environments.},

   users' comments. A total of 74 videos were analyzed. Political vlogs
   tend to elicit more positive responses than news outlets. News outlets
   and specific journalists were perceived to be biased. Both presidential
   candidates received positive feedback from political vlogs in general.
   Both candidates received praise and criticism from YouTube users. Both
   competing politicians tend to receive more positive feedback in
   political vlogs. In contrast, only a specific politician may receive
   higher positive feedback from YouTube users who watch videos from news
   outlets. Word analysis on political vlogs about one candidate's
   accomplishments revealed that her accomplishments resulted from her
   dedication to public service. In contrast, the other candidate's
   accomplishments were closely related to his father's. None of the first
   candidate's accomplishments were labeled as untrue, whereas
   fact-checkers labeled a few of the other candidate's accomplishments as
   false. The implications of the findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {Rising support for populist parties and candidates has become a key
   story of recent decades, making headlines in Western democracies and
   beyond. While a growing body of populism research focuses on how parties
   use populist messaging and which voters are most drawn to these
   messages, we still know relatively little about the extent to which
   individual politicians hold populist views. Using data from the
   Representative Audit of Britain Survey, we examine populist sentiments
   among parliamentary candidates in Britain. Our findings show that
   populist attitudes among candidates remain modest, with anti-elite
   sentiments being the most prominent. Additionally, we find partisanship
   and incumbency to be the most consistent predictors of the extent to
   which candidates hold populist attitudes. Taken together, our findings
   suggest that populist sentiments are not particularly strong among
   parliamentary candidates in Britain and that support for different types
   of populist views varies in terms of strength and motivation.},

Abstract = {This analysis seeks to understand the appropriation or rejection of
   radicalism by two groups in a poor and immigrant neighbourhood of
   Montreal. Yet although both defend the same causes and share the same
   progressive dimension, one presents itself as a group of non-radical
   citizens while the other presents itself as a group of radical
   activists. So for each group, what do these different definitions of
   identity enfold: citizens versus militants, non-radicals versus
   radicals? More than the acceptance and the use of violence, the
   investigation's results reveal that the divergences observed illustrate
   a different construction of the intersection between social class,
   cultural or ethnic identity, and global and local boundaries. These
   different ways of conceiving the intersection shape specific democratic
   practices and relations to politics. This analysis outlines the
   relevance of not restricting the reflection on radicalism to a focus on
   the repertoire of collective action but rather exploring its meanings
   for citizens in their daily lives and its implications for their
   relations to politics. Finally, it also offers a concrete picture of
   left-wing ideological tensions and debates and how some grass roots
   organizations try (or do not try) to resolve them.},

Abstract = {This article explores kleptocracy, authoritarianism and democracy as
   sociological ideal types of the exercise of political power. Kleptocracy
   is theorized as an ideal type which uses coercion as its primary power
   resource, while both authoritarianism and democracy are based upon
   authority, defined as a belief in legitimacy. Where authoritarianism and
   democracy differ is how a belief in legitimacy is obtained. These
   differences and similarities are explored with reference to the four
   dimensions of political power, which consist of agency, structure,
   social epistemology and social ontology.},

Abstract = {The challenges of the demographic transition require urgent State
   actions that meet the needs and demands of the population aged 65 and
   over. This article addresses the insertion of the problems of the older
   adult population in the policy agenda of the Ecuadorian State. For this
   purpose, a qualitative orientation is followed, under the theoretical
   framework of neoinstitutionalism. For the analysis, a review was made of
   the trajectory of state action in the recent history of the nation, in
   which three major facets of the agenda were identified: minimal early
   insertion, neoliberal opening and recognition of rights. The main
   conclusion is that it is a symbolic agenda, affected by a sort of
   institutional ageism, which places the problems of the elderly in a
   peripheral position in Ecuadorian politics, despite the great normative
   platform that the country has and a governmental discourse of broad
   recognition of this group.},

Abstract = {Education creates reliable and competitive people resources, which
   determines a nation's success. Scholarship policies have a substantial
   impact on the growth of a nation, particularly in terms of enhancing the
   quality of human resources and access to quality education. Open access
   to education can help establish an improved education system. The
   Excellence Scholarships Program is part of the Indonesian government's
   goal to produce trustworthy and competitive human resources. This
   research used a qualitative descriptive methodology by tracing official
   government documents associated with the Excellence Scholarships
   program. This report analyzes the 2019-2020 implementation and impact of
   Indonesia's main scholarship program. This study examined program
   implementation using descriptive-qualitative research. According to the
   findings of this study, 2025 undergraduates won scholarships in the last
   two years. The procedures and aid distribution of the Excellence
   scholarship program are effective because they adhere to the
   predetermined flow and conditions, however, future improvements are
   required for the implementation of these scholarship programs: first,
   improving the principle of equal distribution of scholarship recipients
   to combat inequality, particularly in eastern Indonesia; and second,
   providing equal opportunities. This research also suggests further
   research could look into how the excellence scholarships program
   enhances scholarship recipients' quality of life and human resources.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article was to outline a framework of instructions to
   determine the amount of damage caused to the environment and people
   during the armed conflict, and to determine the consequences of such
   impact on the environment in Ukraine and, internationally. The
   theoretical and methodological basis of the research is a system of
   philosophical, general scientific and special methods aimed at obtaining
   objective and reliable results, in particular: ontological, axiological,
   integrative and prognostic. It was found that the events of military
   nature on the territory of Ukraine extremely exacerbated the problem of
   effectiveness of international and national legal documents. It was
   established that at the international level since 2014, the state of
   Ukraine has been defined as an ecological disaster zone. It was
   determined that there are economic and ``environmental{''} components in
   the composition of environmental damage. The environmental component is
   equivalent to moral damage. It is proposed to create (1) special
   associations for environmental impact assessment after the return of
   territories under Ukrainian control; (2) an international financial
   institution to overcome the environmental consequences of armed conflict
   and occupation; specialIntscript to create a comprehensive system of
   collecting information on the state of the environment.},

Title = {To preserve, release, and litigate: Dimensions of executive branch
   transparency},
Journal = {PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {53},
Number = {2},
Pages = {209-233},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Transparency is essential for public awareness of government activity
   and in holding officials accountable for their behavior and decisions.
   However, executives understandably have a desire to maintain autonomy
   over the flow of information outside of the executive branch, which can
   sometimes lead to a clash between government openness and executive
   control over information. This article investigates executive branch
   transparency along two specific dimensions: threats to the preservation
   of government information, and the judicial monitoring of executive
   branch transparency. Federal law directs executive branch actors to
   preserve government information. Statutes and regulations detail
   governing policies as well as guidelines that apply to every
   presidential administration. However, we consider each rule and
   recommendation through the lens of the Trump administration to gain
   greater clarity and precision. The Trump administration proves a useful
   focus for our empirical analysis because of its recency as well as
   multiple reports of its improper handling and preservation of records.
   We lay out and develop a typology of threats to record preservation.
   Preservation conflicts have emerged across multiple presidential
   administrations and have become increasingly common and visible.
   Judicial monitoring of executive branch transparency has become a
   crucial tool to address the withholding of records. We show that federal
   judges can play a vital role in defining the boundaries of government
   transparency through their decisions in Freedom of Information Act
   (FOIA) litigation. The U.S. Department of Justice oversees and often
   leads the government's defense against FOIA actions. We find that
   federal judges are most likely to require executive branch
   responsiveness and disclosure when the judges' underlying policy
   preferences are most distant from that of the administration. Our
   findings should inform reforms to protect government transparency.},

Abstract = {Novel, unstructured, and high-stakes situations, such as Brexit, have
   been found to magnify the impact of personality on the performance of
   high-level political office. This article uses quantitative content
   analysis of Theresa May's verbal output to develop a profile of her
   characteristic approach to politics and leadership, and utilizes this
   profile to further our understanding of her actions during the Brexit
   negotiations. Using the well-established Leadership Trait Analysis
   technique, the article links May's political personality-her tendency
   toward black-and-white thinking, her high belief in her ability to
   control events, and her relative lack of facility with the political
   tools of influence and persuasion-to her guidance of the Brexit process.
   While avoiding a reductionist approach, subscribing neither to an ``all
   agency{''} or ``no agency{''} account of the prime minister's role in
   Brexit, the research does conclude that May's personality was a
   significant factor in shaping the course of Brexit during her time in
   office.},

Abstract = {This article looks at a sample of academic articles in the field of
   terrorism studies and international relations to explore the ways in
   which marriage, sexual activity and close relationships in jihadist
   groups are framed, imagined and investigated. Despite the scarcity of
   research being conducted on the subject, this article reveals that, in
   the study of terrorism, the issue of intimate relationships is the
   object of two trends: on the one hand, the themes of sexuality and
   marriage are in fact present in the field, only exclusively through the
   lens of sexual victimisation, violence, abuse and romantic manipulation.
   On the other hand, intimate relationships are often dismissed as not
   being worthy of in-depth investigation when not related to violence.
   Together, these two interdependent trends create, using the words of
   Butler, a ``silent and melancholic discourse{''}, which downplays the
   subjectivity, banality, and vulnerability of the life experiences of
   subjects involved in jihadist groups. Using the learnings of queer
   scholarship, the article posits that the ways in which the intimate life
   of individuals involved in jihadist movements are portrayed and ascribed
   a perverted characteristic matter in how vulnerability is distributed
   and how the subjects are apprehended in academia and beyond.},

Abstract = {Most researchers assume legislators repay past favors to secure future
   rewards and avoid future punishments, but a growing literature shows
   that human beings are intrinsically motivated to reciprocate past
   favors. However, there is no systematic evidence as to whether
   legislators bring this preference for reciprocity to Congress. An
   original survey experiment, an observational study of end-of-career
   behavior, and a matching-based analysis of responses to committee
   assignments provide consistent evidence that legislators have a
   preference for reciprocity.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes how the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban uses
   social categorization and populist rhetoric in an anti-LGBTQ campaign.
   Drawing on social identity theory and the scholarship on populist
   rhetoric and anti-LGBTQ politics, the article examines 46 interviews,
   press statements, public speeches, and op-eds by Orban. Using critical
   discourse analysis (CDA) and Wodak's discourse-historical approach, it
   shows how the prime minister frames LGBTQ communities as an out-group
   that poses a threat to Hungarian values and way of living. Similar to
   the issue of immigration and existing anti-LGBTQ frames in other
   countries, Orban presents LGBTQ groups within his well-established
   anti-Western narrative. In addition, he connects LGBTQ communities to
   other out-groups that have been portrayed as a threat for a long time.
   The study sheds new light on the linguistic strategies of Orban and
   shows how populist rhetoric and social categorization complement each
   other in a political campaign.},

Abstract = {Electoral rules can affect who wins and who loses elections. Most cities
   select office holders through plurality rule, but an alternative,
   ranked-choice voting (RCV), has become increasingly popular. RCV
   requires voters to rank candidates, instead of simply selecting their
   most preferred candidate. Observers debate whether RCV will cure a
   variety of electoral ills or undermine representation. We test the
   effect of RCV on voter's choices and perceptions of representation using
   survey experiments with large, representative samples of respondents. We
   find that candidates of color are significantly penalized in both
   plurality and RCV elections, with no significant difference between the
   rule types. However, providing respondents with candidates' partisan
   affiliation significantly increases support for candidates of color.},

Abstract = {Scholars usually portray institutions as stable, inviting a status quo
   bias in their theories. Change, when it is theorized, is frequently
   attributed to exogenous factors. This paper, by contrast, proposes that
   institutional change can occur endogenously through population loss, as
   institutional losers become demotivated and leave, whereas institutional
   winners remain. This paper provides a detailed demonstration of how this
   form of endogenous change occurred on the English Wikipedia. A
   qualitative content analysis shows that Wikipedia transformed from a
   dubious source of information in its early years to an increasingly
   reliable one over time. Process tracing shows that early outcomes of
   disputes over rule interpretations in different corners of the
   encyclopedia demobilized certain types of editors (while mobilizing
   others) and strengthened certain understandings of Wikipedia's ambiguous
   rules (while weakening others). Over time, Wikipedians who supported
   fringe content departed or were ousted. Thus, population loss led to
   highly consequential institutional change.},

Abstract = {Why do some non-violent uprisings escalate into armed violence while
   others do not? We suggest that horizontal polarisation contributes to
   the escalation of non-violent campaigns. We examine the effect of ethnic
   cleavages between the campaign and its opponent and movement cohesion as
   explanatory factors for escalation into civil war and non-state
   violence. Statistical analysis of all major non-violent campaigns
   (1970-2014) shows that non-violent conflicts with ethnic cleavages have
   a higher risk of escalating into armed violence in particular, when the
   conflict takes place over governmental aims. The results also indicate
   that movement cohesion alleviates the risk of armed escalation.},

Title = {Has the electoral college grown more disproportional? An analysis of
   election results, 1876-2020},
Journal = {POLITICS \& POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Especially following the 2000 and the 2016 presidential elections, some
   authors have denounced the legitimacy of the Electoral College as a
   presidential selection method. It is alleged that the college is not
   representative of the electorate as a whole and tends to favor one
   specific political party. In this article, we compare the popular vote
   with the composition of the Electoral College for every presidential
   contest since 1876 (n = 37 elections). We confirm that the college is
   indeed disproportional as it provides a major bonus to the winning
   candidate. Although this disproportionality has become slightly stronger
   during the 1876-2020 period, it does not specifically benefit one
   political party. Measured at the level of the states, there is no
   substantial increase in bias with regard to geographic representation.
   However, to the extent that electoral races become tighter, as was the
   case in the last quarter of the 19th century, the risk that results fall
   within a margin of statistical error becomes larger. This suggests that
   the current controversy finds its source less in the electoral rules and
   more in the situational and highly competitive balance of party
   competition. Related ArticlesArdoin, Phillip J., and Bryan M. Parsons.

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {287-304},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {This article explores the importance of inter-related securitisation
   processes on each other, most notably the impact of securitisation
   practices in one country on the securitisation processes in another. It
   analyses the impact of US drone strikes on the securitisation processes
   related to the militancy conducted by successive Pakistani governments
   in the aftermath of 9/11. The successful securitisation of the war on
   terror by the US allowed the latter to take extraordinary measures to
   eliminate terrorism, most notably through the use of drone strikes.
   However, these securitisation practices inhibited the securitisation of
   militancy inside Pakistan. While we understand successful securitisation
   processes, we understand much less about unsuccessful securitisation
   cases. This article analyses the use of drone strikes as securitisation
   practices by the US and their impact on the unsuccessful securitisation
   process of militancy in Pakistan after 9/11. The empirical contribution
   of this article is its focus on the case of Pakistan where more than 400
   drone strikes took place, reportedly killing approximately 7000 people.
   The article demonstrates how the drone strikes in Pakistan turned the
   war on terror into an American war and made it difficult for the
   domestic audience in Pakistan to accept the securitisation moves of the
   security actors.},

Abstract = {What determines the flow of unsanctioned information in authoritarian
   regimes? To answer this question, we explore the use and circulation of
   illicit foreign information among citizens in North Korea. This paper
   focuses on how the structure of social relations among citizens
   determines where and with whom people acquire and disseminate
   politically unsanctioned and potentially illegal content offline. Based
   on findings from a choice-based conjoint administered to 313 former
   residents of North Korea, we show that social capital and trust-related
   effects associated with the place where information is acquired and the
   person who provides it determine information flows.},

Abstract = {The Pacific Alliance deviates from other Latin American integration
   agreements due to its close association between governments and the
   private sector. Analysts have assessed the agreement as a pragmatic
   experience of regional integration to facilitate the free movement of
   production factors, a ``tail moves dog{''} project, or an example of
   deep integration to diffuse liberal normative principles. This article
   analyzes the Pacific Alliance Business Council discourse to identify how
   the private sector perceives its role in the agreement and expresses it
   in the group's external negotiations, for example, Pacific
   Alliance-Mercosur, before contrasting its self-defined role with those
   assumed by interpretations in the literature. We argue that the private
   sector sees its role as multifaceted, and this self-perception escapes
   the limits of normative deep integration notions, allowing business to
   adapt to changes in internal and external factors. Business
   self-perception contributes to enhance Pacific Alliance pragmatism and
   the application of an inductive micro-negotiation methodology, but
   transversality may also influence the Business Council to support
   normative issues.},

Abstract = {Simulations have become a staple of political science education due to
   their effectiveness and creative nature that contributes to learning
   success. In this contribution, we argue that simulations can also offer
   new insights not only into student engagement and active learning, but
   also into the sociology of political processes. In this case it is a
   political communication seminar, that included a simulation of
   presidential campaigns and an election in a fictionalized setting. This
   article shows that in a classroom setting the students are prone to
   reproduce existing electoral leanings and behavior. In the proposed
   simulation of elections in a fictional country of Genovia, the students
   naturally aligned around two candidates: a right-wing populist and an
   environmental activist who ultimately lost the elections. This article
   offers several insights into an online simulation format and breaks down
   the sociology of the surprisingly realistic representation of a
   Euro-American electorate.},

Abstract = {We study the drivers of refugees' decision making about returning home
   using observational and experimental data from a survey of 3,003 Syrian
   refugees in Lebanon. We find that the conditions in refugee-hosting
   countries play a minor role. In contrast, conditions in a refugee's home
   country are the main drivers of return intentions. Even in the face of
   hostility and poor living conditions in host countries, refugees are
   unlikely to return unless the situation at home improves significantly.
   These results challenge traditional models of decision making about
   migration, where refugees weigh living conditions in the host and home
   countries ({''}push{''} and ``pull{''} factors). We offer an alternative
   theoretical framework: a model of threshold-based decision making
   whereby only once a basic threshold of safety at home is met do refugees
   compare other factors in the host and home country. We explore some
   empirical implications of this new perspective using qualitative
   interviews and quantitative survey data.},

   status vis-a-vis natives under the kafala system. Building on existing
   studies of immigration politics, we theorize how immigration policies
   can either facilitate or prevent the social mobility of foreign workers.
   Exploring immigration attitudes in 14 Middle East and North Africa
   countries using an original dataset that matches survey responses with
   host country-specific factors, we find that extreme rights-restricting
   immigration policies (such as the kafala system) encourage wealthier
   natives to be more hostile than their lower-class counterparts. Our
   study suggests that anti-immigrant sentiment is context-specific and
   influenced by local institutions.},

Abstract = {Top-level presidential advisor appointments provide would-be autocrats
   in backsliding democracies a quick and effective means to coopt elites
   and assemble an authoritarian coalition. Such appointments represent a
   mechanism for making promises of patronage that are more credible and
   more directly under the executive's control than patronage facilitated
   by their party. Elites who join the executive's coalition via such
   appointments have incentives to maintain their privileged access and
   therefore are more likely to match or even surpass the authoritarian
   sentiment of an autocratic executive. This research uses a sentiment
   analysis model trained with 2 years of Twitter data-between 2019 and
   2021-to compare the authoritarian sentiment of Turkey's major political
   parties and to examine differences between groups within Turkey's ruling
   party. The evidence shows that President Erdogan's advisors are
   significantly more authoritarian than the rest of the party, and, as
   such, they form an authoritarian vanguard within an already
   authoritarian party.},

Abstract = {Digital media plays a vital role for political parties' communication.
   Research so far has focused mainly on the use of social media for
   election campaigns, while little is known about party officials' use of
   social media for intra-party communication. Besides elections, key
   events for political parties are conferences, in which delegates play a
   central role in transmitting the party branches' perspectives to the
   party and vice versa. Therefore, this paper addresses a) the role played
   by social media regarding the communication of party delegates with
   their party branch, and b) the factors determining delegates' social
   media usage. To answer these questions, we drew on survey data collected
   during the 2018 party conference of the German Green Party. Based on
   multivariate analysis, our results indicate that party delegates' social
   media usage is rather low and driven by (younger) age and normative and
   strategic considerations.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian regimes do not only target and oppress their opponents at
   home, they also try to repress dissident diaspora members abroad. The
   literature on transnational (extraterritorial) repression has shown that
   authoritarian regimes normally use transnational organs of the state
   such as intelligence services as part of their usual transnational
   repression activities. However, since they do not have sovereignty in
   the countries, their transnational repression has limits. This article
   argues that loyal diaspora supporters help these regimes as additional
   repression and violence apparatuses by trying to repress diaspora
   members from the same country of origin. However, the discursive
   mechanism behind this phenomenon has not been studied. This study aims
   to address this gap. Based on the competitive authoritarian Turkish
   case, it introduces the concept of ``transnational securitization{''} to
   securitization theory. The article argues that what makes this type of
   securitization different is that the audience (pro-government Turkish
   and non-Turkish Muslim diaspora groups) is not only convinced by the
   securitization narrative that legitimates the use of extraordinary means
   that are normally undertaken by the state, but takes it upon themselves
   to carry on the anti-dissident repressive and violent actions. The
   article contributes to both transnational repression and securitization
   literatures.},

Abstract = {While support for redistribution remains high across Europe, voting for
   left-wing parties, traditionally identified with this agenda, has been
   under par. Past research explains this puzzle by class-based
   disagreements about redistributive priorities and by second-dimension
   attitudes. These explanations, however, assume coherent voter
   preferences reacting to structural changes. By contrast, I argue that
   part of the puzzle also lies in attitudinal ambivalence-simultaneous
   negative and positive evaluations-regarding redistributive policy. Using
   cross-sectional public opinion and party position data, I find that such
   ambivalence increases with lower political sophistication, greater value
   conflict, and weaker economic need. Electorally, it deepens detachment
   between support for redistribution and left-wing self-identification and
   increases voting for more economically and culturally right-wing
   parties. These patterns hold independently of class differences and
   second-dimension attitudes and replicate stably in earlier data. The
   findings contribute to ongoing debates about attitude structures and
   voting patterns and illuminate an additional challenge for economically
   progressive parties.},

Abstract = {The commitment to the rational actor model of state behavior is said to
   be a core assumption of realist theory. This assumption is listed in
   most textbook accounts of realism. Yet is rationality a core supposition
   of realist theory, and if so, what kind of rationality is implied in
   these claims? Debate on the relationship between realism, and what is
   often labeled as rationality is replete with misunderstandings. Authors
   deploy terms such as rationality, rationalism, and rational actor in
   diverse and contradictory ways. This article aims to cut through this
   confusion and provide an account of the different ways in which these
   terms are used in the field of International Relations (IR). We argue
   that much of the confusion surrounding rationalism/rationality in IR
   arises due to a failure to distinguish between rationalism as an
   epistemological position (the observer rationality assumption) and
   rationality as an ontological position (the rational actor assumption).
   We use this distinction to examine carefully the relationship between
   the concepts of rationalism/rationality in realist theory.},

Abstract = {What are the strategies of political parties in multi-level government
   systems and how do voters respond to these strategies? At the national
   and state level, many researchers have worked with data from party
   manifestos, candidate lists, party press releases, parliamentary
   questions, and parliamentary speeches. At the local level, these
   standard components of the political science toolbox are not available
   to researchers in many countries-including Germany. The absence of these
   data means that politics at the local level remains chronically
   understudied. In this research note, we draw attention to the dearth of
   data when studying local politics and the questions that we cannot
   answer as a result. Specifically, we document our failed attempt to
   collect local party manifestos in smaller municipalities which would
   have been the basis for an analysis of political parties' strategies in
   response to the lowering of voting ages in local elections in German
   states. We point to examples from other countries that show that it does
   not have to be this way.},

Abstract = {The political participation literature has documented a long-term trend
   of the normalization of noninstitutional participation that is often
   equated with the conventionalization of engagement in protest politics.
   Less is known on the extent to which noninstitutional forms are
   differentiated by their mobilization context. Population surveys find it
   difficult to contextualize individual engagement, and on-site surveys
   point to effects that are hard to generalize. This study fills this gap
   by emphasizing differentiation and distinguishing participation
   according to the issue of engagement. It introduces a conceptual
   distinction between political insiders and outsiders, defined based on
   the extent to which they are embedded in the organizational landscape of
   the dominant cleavage dimension. Using an original survey conducted in
   Germany during the Covid-19 crisis, the analysis demonstrates that
   general-population surveys are fit to examine issue-specific
   participation patterns. The results expose an insider and outsider
   divide, captured by the effect of attitudinal and behavioral indicators,
   and demonstrates that the two groups are equally likely to participate
   in noninstitutional forms. However, insiders engage on the established
   issues of climate and anti-racism, whereas outsiders engage on the new
   issues of Covid-19 related economic assistance and civil liberties
   restrictions. In addition, dynamic models reveal that noninstitutional
   participation is rooted in volatile issue preferences. Overall, the
   paper argues that participation during the Covid-19 crisis has furthered
   the trend towards a differentiated protest arena.},

Abstract = {The United States and South Korea are both shifting their engagement in
   the Indo-Pacific, but in fundamentally different ways. In recent years,
   Washington has altered the format of its engagement in the
   region-shifting toward an increasingly minilateral approach seen in the
   Quad and AUKUS arrangements. On the other hand, Seoul has sought
   primarily to alter the focus of its engagement-shifting from a narrow
   focus on the Korean Peninsula toward a broader regional approach. In
   other words, American leaders have adjusted the format of their
   engagement while Korean leaders have adjusted the focus of their
   engagement. This has created a disconnect. As South Korea has aligned
   its focus to that of the United States, Seoul has expected Washington to
   integrate South Korea more deeply into American regional strategy. Yet,
   US efforts to build minilaterals have seldom included South Korea.
   Addressing this divide will require leaders in both capitals to adjust
   their approaches to both focus and format in the Indo-Pacific.},

Abstract = {Online information sources help undergraduate students acquire knowledge
   and find supporting evidence for their papers. However, this
   practicality is often clouded with unreliable sources. As such,
   instructors need better strategies to teach students how to reach
   reliable online sources and evaluate the accuracy of the online
   information they obtain. In this article, we introduce a series of
   exercises to teach students how to identify the reliability of a source,
   ways to fact-check information, steps to use online search tools
   effectively, and examples of online academic blogs to utilize and check
   the reliability of the information that they present, and how to use
   online data/survey sources. We believe that educating students on
   identifying and utilizing reliable sources is essential for their
   intellectual development and ability to conduct their research
   independently. Therefore, our exercises aim to provide a roadmap for
   instructors to improve their students' virtual literacy.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the role of interest groups in US sanctions policy
   toward Iran from 2007 to 2016. The aim of this work is to explain what
   changed in regard to the role of interest groups in the most significant
   shift in US-Iranian relations under President Barack Obama before and
   after the vote on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which was
   intended to halt Iran's non-peaceful nuclear program in return for an
   easing of sanctions by the US Congress. This study contributes to our
   knowledge about how structural variables, issue salience, and actor
   strategies work together to produce outcomes. In addition, it provides a
   better understanding of interest group influence by identifying
   conditions under which interest groups can be successful in changing the
   policy status quo. This research proposes that the once firm stands of
   the Democrat legislators on supporting Iran sanctions changed due to
   support of President Obama's strategy of engagement by Pro-Diplomacy
   groups and the international community, which he used as legislative
   subsidy. In addition, favorable policy windows opened up opportunities
   that pushed for diplomacy instead of confrontation.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a concept mapping teaching exercise that was
   implemented in different stages at both the graduate and undergraduate
   level. First, a small group of graduate students worked to construct a
   concept map that illustrated the connections between published work as
   they prepared to take their qualifying examinations. A similar
   assignment-visually depicting connections between course readings-was
   implemented between the midterm and final exam in a large-section online
   undergraduate course. In the undergraduate course, there was noticeable
   improvement between midterm and final essay responses in which students
   compared and contrasted readings, and students reported perceptions of
   it as a valuable exercise. Structured interviews with both undergraduate
   and graduate students further confirm that concept mapping can improve
   learning outcomes at both levels of instruction. The project reveals
   important differences in the way that both sets of students approach
   relational exercises involving readings and suggests ways of using
   concept mapping to enhance students' retention of the material.},

Abstract = {Although Europeans are favourable towards the idea of being governed by
   `independent experts', and despite the burgeoning literature on
   technocratic ministers, we still miss important information about the
   profiles of technocrats in government. This article provides new
   insights into the characteristics of non-partisan, non-elected ministers
   and the roles they perform once in government based on a Technocratic
   Ministers' Dataset covering all governments in 31 European countries
   from 2000 to 2020. First, we show that average share of technocratic (as
   opposed to partisan) ministers in European cabinets rose from 9.5\% to
   14.2\% over the last two decades. This increase is characteristic of all
   macro-regions, except Scandinavian countries. Second, technocratic
   ministers are assigned to a diversity of portfolios and not just finance
   and economy, which, respectively, account for only 15\% of technocratic
   ministers. Finally, technocratic ministers do not hold office for
   shorter periods of time than partisan ones, except when they are part of
   caretaker cabinets.},

Title = {When Do Leftist Parties Put Taxing the Rich on the Agenda? Lessons from
   the 2021 Federal Election in Germany},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {353-378},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite an increasing concentration of income and wealth, most
   democracies refrain from taxing the rich more heavily. This article uses
   Germany as a case to examine the reasons for this reluctance, as well as
   conditions under which taxing the rich does appear on the political
   agenda. An analysis of campaigns since 2005 shows that the Social
   Democratic Party (SPD) has only reluctantly championed tax increases
   during this period. Interviews with political actors reveal the main
   reasons to be a feared countermobilization by business interests,
   hostile public opinion, and a lack of tax expertise in left-wing
   parties. The 2021 election campaign deviated from this pattern because
   the SPD made taxing the rich a priority. This deviation can be explained
   by the interplay of an unusual taxation focus of the party leadership,
   the salience of investment needs, and a programmatic weakness of the
   Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union and Free Democratic
   Party with regard to financing these needs. Particularly with a fiscally
   moderate candidate, the SPD was able to champion taxing the rich without
   compromising economic competence ratings. In a second step, the article
   describes survey experiments and focus groups involving low-educated
   citizens that were used to investigate whether the tax campaign
   contributed to the SPD's electoral success. This did not seem to be the
   case. Overall, assumptions about public opinion voiced by political
   elites in our interviews were confirmed: Proposed tax increases were met
   with disinterest, uncertainty about their effects, negative
   connotations, and worries about harm to the economy. Taxes for the rich
   were also frequently rejected based on meritocratic legitimization of
   wealth.},

   protectors to resist the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline,
   within the larger context of the Indigenous sovereignty, land-back, and
   climate-justice movements across North America. These protectors
   articulate their struggles by speaking to what Leanne Simpson and others
   have referred to as a politics of Indigenous ``radical resurgence{''}
   and by fighting violent and ongoing dispossession through attempts to
   reject a politics of recognition or sanction from the U.S.
   settler-colonialist state, an approach that embodies possibility through
   radical Indigenous thought and practice. The essay documents this
   antecapitalist epistemology by describing acts of resistance at Rootz
   Camp over a several-month period. The essay illustrates how such efforts
   go beyond simply resisting or existing outside of capitalism but rather
   seek to vision and build an alternative.},

Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {112-121},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {``Post-truth{''} politics is often framed as a failure of the
   competition of idea-s. Yet there are different ways of thinking about
   the competition of ideas, with different implications for the way we
   understand its benefits and risks. The dominant way of framing the
   competition of ideas is in terms of a marketplace, which, however,
   obscures the different ways ideas can compete. Several theorists can
   help us think through the competition of ideas. J. S. Mill, for example,
   avoided the metaphor of the market by focusing, instead, on competition
   as the testing of arguments in adversarial encounters before a critical
   audience. Georg Simmel, alternatively, conceived of competition as a
   form of indirect conflict, where two individuals strive in parallel to
   gain audience approval. This view emphasizes innovation and creativity
   in the competition of ``all for all.{''} More recently, theorists have
   developed the market logic of competition by thinking of a marketplace
   not for ideas but for rationalizations. This articulates some of the
   features of Simmel's view of competition, but underestimates the degrees
   of constraint required to secure the goods of competition. Ultimately,
   recognizing these different modes of competition in the public sphere
   can enrich our theories of deliberative democracy and sharpen our view
   of the problem of ``post-truth{''} politics.},

Abstract = {Contemporary research in American federalism has evaluated the
   centralizing characteristics of several institutions within state
   governments-including state statutes, executive orders, and judicial
   decisions-and has shown that these institutions are generally associated
   with shifting power away from local governments toward state
   governments. I expand this discussion by assessing the consequences of
   direct democracy for the balance of power between state and local
   governments. In particular, I investigate whether ballot measures are
   associated with decentralizing power away from state governments toward
   local governments or rather whether these measures are associated with
   centralizing power in state governments. Leveraging new data across the
   history of direct democracy in the United States and coding 945 proposed
   ballot measures according to their de/centralizing impact on local
   governments, I find that citizen-initiated ballot measures are neither
   centralizing nor decentralizing, but legislature-referred ballot
   measures are decentralizing. I also find that regardless of whether
   citizens or legislators are responsible for placing measures on the
   ballot, voters generally provide more support for centralizing ballot
   measures than decentralizing ballot measures. However, voter support is
   conditioned on state-level partisanship and ideology.},

Abstract = {In Morocco, as elsewhere in the world, women's representation in elected
   assemblies faces many challenges to assert itself. Beyond the classic
   debate centered around the cultural promotion of the image of women, it
   is time that particular attention be paid to the reconfiguration of the
   electoral system as an essential lever for the political emancipation of
   women. Hesitating for a long time between the legal and cultural levers,
   decisionmakers must urgently activate the former through establishing a
   voting system that is as proportional as possible. By opting for a
   territorial division based on large and high-magnitude constituencies,
   reducing the wastage of votes to a strict minimum, maintaining the
   threshold at a reasonably high level, and decreeing the use of closed
   lists, the legislator would ensure a commendable female presence in the
   arena of electoral competition.},

Abstract = {On the eve of the First Russia -Africa Summit in the fall of 2019, the
   Russian infospace for the first time started talking about new
   opportunities for Africa. The African theme became increasingly
   important with the start of the special military operation in Ukraine in
   February 2022, the subsequent adoption of the new Concept of Russian
   Foreign Policy of 2023 and the actualization of Russia's contacts with
   the so-called Global South. Contemporary Africa is not a continent of
   threats, as was commonly said a decade ago, but of opportunities. The
   very identity of more and more states on the African continent is
   growing. Many of them continue to build their capacities at the expense
   of their rapidly growing young populations. At the same time, against
   the backdrop of the emerging global scramble for Africa's raw materials
   and new attempts at resource colonization and fragmentation, the
   continent needs honest partners focused on a pragmatic but mutually
   beneficial approach. In this context, Russia actively advocates
   strengthening the sovereignty and development of the national economies
   of the continent, using the << two-way street >> concept. The Russia
   -Africa Summits (in 2019 and 2023) marked a new milestone in Russia
   -Africa relations and led to concrete practical results: the
   establishment of new contacts and the strengthening of trust and mutual
   interest of representatives of political, business, scientific and
   cultural circles. These and other topics were discussed by Lora
   Chkoniya, Junior Research Fellow (Institute for International Studies,
   MGIMO University), and Dr Irina Abramova, Director of the Institute of
   Africa of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Full Member of the RAS.},

   that the use of violence by penitentiary agents constitutes a regular
   phenomenon, inscribed in the institutional contexts. Drawing upon social
   studies of professions and violence, the objective of this paper is to
   work narratives of male penitentiary agents of the Buenos Aires
   Penitentiary Service, in order to explore the legitimation processes of
   violent practices and its informal mechanisms. Open and semi-structured
   interviews were conducted with penitentiary agents, and observations in
   penitentiaries were carried out (2016-2019). We identified several
   ritualized practices in the early stages of their labor trajectories.
   Notably, we describe four practices that were narrated as indexes:
   ``welcomes{''}, ``earning one's place{''}, ``passages{''}, and
   ``punishments{''}. We argue that the logic of ``verdugueo{''} can be
   seen as the general framing for the learning of informal rules and
   violent practices in prison agents.},

Abstract = {This work analyzes the current situation of the North Pole on the global
   geopolitical board and its importance due to hydrocarbon reserves and
   communication routes. Forecasts about medium term melting marked by
   seasonality revives the discussion on regional roles already
   contemplated in the great geopolitical theories of Mackinder, Mahan,
   Spykman, Corbett and Seversky, thus turning the Arctic into a new
   scenario of confrontation that can alter the balances of power. Focusing
   on a comparative analysis set in the context of the current situation,
   the article addresses the question about the role that the North Pole
   will play within a few years given its geographical position. Whether
   the North Pole will become a decisive region in the struggles for global
   hegemony will depend on how factors such as obstacles to life, transit
   and resource exploitation derived from its condition of frozen sea play
   out in the geopolitical board.},

Abstract = {Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's morning press conferences are an unusual
   political communication strategy in Mexico and the world, through which
   the President interacts with the media, other political actors and
   citizens. The objective of this paper is to analyze the characteristics
   of Las mananeras (as they are popularly known) and to reflect on the
   strategies deployed by the Presidency with them to influence the public
   agenda.In the first place, following Dell Hymes model, a general
   ethnography of this communicative act is presented, carried out from
   monitoring carried out between December 2018 and April 2022. In second
   place, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic levels of a multimodal corpus
   made up of the entries (thumbnail images and titles) of the videos of
   848 conferences hosted on YouTube are analyzed. The results show the
   evolution of La mananera as a discursive genre, as well as the
   importance that issues like the Covid pandemic, insecurity, migration,
   the reactivation of PEMEX, the development of infrastructure, the
   relationship with the US, and the fight against corruption have had for
   the current administration. However, various semiotic and discursive
   elements of the YouTube page focus their attention on the figure of AMLO
   and reinforce the presidentialism that characterizes Mexican political
   system.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {17-27},
Abstract = {While the US Constitution expressly grants the federation the power to
   tax, Article 311 TFEU is silent on whether such power exists at the EU
   level. This contribution argues that the Union has the power to tax,
   provided that the chosen resources in the basket match the objectives
   and policies of the Union. Since the achievement of the internal market
   is a shared competence (Article 4 TFEU), the Union can decide the level
   of resources tailored to this goal. Although the Union has a broad power
   to tax under Article 311 TFEU to pursue its objectives and policies, the
   member states are still the ``masters,{''} able to decide the level of
   resources under the unanimity rule. To resolve this paradox, this
   contribution embraces a democratic legitimacy of EU taxes that grant the
   European Parliament the power to decide the revenue side of the EU
   budget. EU democratic taxes approved by the European Parliament could
   reaffirm the redistributive function of taxes, thereby allowing the
   redistribution of wealth from rich to poor.},

Title = {Does Land Quality Increase the Power of Traditional Leaders in
   Contemporary Africa?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 1},
Abstract = {The power of traditional leaders varies across and within sub-Saharan
   African countries. Existing literature explains this as the result of
   state-building decisions about where to employ indirect rule in the
   colonial and postcolonial periods. We argue that the contemporary power
   of traditional leaders is also influenced by land quality. In the
   precolonial period, land quality played little role in encouraging
   political centralization due to its abundance relative to the
   population. In the current period, traditional chiefs are more
   influential in places with higher agricultural potential because of
   increased competition for land. Drawing on survey, ecological, and
   anthropological data, we show that the power of traditional leaders is
   endogenous to local land quality.},

Abstract = {The German-Polish relationship is deeply burdened by at least two
   centuries of conflict between 1770 and 1970. As a result, a community of
   conflict has emerged. Correspondent patterns of communication burst
   forth again and again whenever occasion arises. Categorically, the
   German-Polish relationship can be described as a ``post-colonial{''}
   one. Russia's war against Ukraine is an opportunity: Polish German
   cooperation could be structurally changed and improved by the
   involvement of Ukraine.},

Abstract = {The issue of violence seems to be the key to defining and interpreting
   Colombia's troubled history. This is also reflected in the extensive
   scholarly on the causes, the timeline and the methods by which such
   violence has been perpetuated. In 2016, the Colombian government and the
   Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) signed a peace
   agreement after decades of armed conflict, but violence and land issues
   continue to pose challenges to the real implementation of the agreement.
   One of the most dramatic chapters in the history of violence in Colombia
   is that concerning the extermination of Union Patriotica, the party born
   in 1984 after the peace agreement signed by the governement of Belisario
   Betancur and the FARC. From its debut in the political arena until the
   2000s, but especially during the 1980s, the party was the target of a
   cruel campaign of stigmatization and of a plan of extermination that
   produced more than six thousand victims. Recently the Interamerican
   Court issued a ruling in which it recognized the responsibilities of the
   Colombian state in the plot of violence, including symbolic violence,
   against the Union Patriotica party. This essay aims to reconstruct that
   historical chapter, starting with the reconstruction of the context
   within which the extermination plan matured, a context of impunity and
   political terror unleashed against an ``internal enemy{''} seen as
   something to be eliminated.},

Abstract = {The National Economy gained prominence as a dominating political and
   economic discourse after 1908. The National Economy was not merely a
   political project; it possessed significant economic and social
   dimensions as well. As an integral component of Muslim/Turkish
   nationalism, the National Economy had a social base. Historiography has
   often posited the National Economy as an endeavor to establish a
   national bourgeoisie. In contrast, the National Economy was also a
   demand of the emerging Muslim/Turkish bourgeoisie. A primary aspiration
   of this class was the establishment of a credit institution.
   Consequently, and not coincidentally, this class spearheaded the
   establishment of local banks. There was a need to mobilize a campaign to
   gather deposits in support of the National Banking. The necessity of
   converting savings and wealth into bank capital for the bourgeoisie led
   to the Savings Movement and the advent of the money box, kumbara.
   Promoting the use of local products and Savings Movement paved the way
   for a drastic increase in savings accounts, accumulated in banks.
   Consequently, national banks surpassed foreign banks in terms of
   deposits and the wealth in the hands of the public also turned into bank
   capital and was made available as credit to the Muslim/Turkish
   bourgeoisie.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research was to highlight the interaction between law
   enforcement agencies during the investigation of crimes in accordance
   with international standards. It also highlights the main areas of
   cooperation between law enforcement agencies in different States during
   the investigation of criminal offenses. Taking into account the great
   public danger of criminal offenses, it is worth noting that they have
   long since acquired a transnational character and it is therefore
   interesting to pay special attention to the issue of cooperation between
   the National Police of Ukraine and various international police
   organizations in the investigation of this category of criminal
   offenses. The methodological basis of the research is presented as

Abstract = {Latin America is emerging as a region of great democratic stagnation. In
   this paper, I empirically analyzed the level of political regimes to
   understand this situation. The central objective was to comparatively
   evaluate Latin American countries in their levels of political regime.
   The research was carried out based on an assessment of political regimes
   according to the Democracy Index (2022) classification. The methodology
   consisted of a comparative investigation between Latin American
   countries in the years 2017 to 2021 using descriptive analysis of data
   from the Democracy Index survey (2022). According to procedural -based
   Contemporary Democratic Theory, a democratic regime needs to meet some
   minimum conditions for the success of the democratic method. Most of
   these countries met the electoral requirements of democracy. However,
   Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela were not classified as democracies. The
   results of the investigation confirmed a process of deterioration in
   most Latin American political regimes, except Uruguay, Costa Rica, Chile
   and Brazil. The latter was the only country to show no variation in its
   numbers.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the Tigray crisis in Ethiopia based on the
   policies of global and regional powers in the context of the African
   neo-colonial order. The study emphasizes that although the colonial
   system has ended in the international system, the power struggle in
   Africa continues through neo-colonialism. The article proceeds with the
   argument that changing the policies of global and regional actors may
   result in neo-colonial struggle and instability in Ethiopia. The study
   aims to define a variable of the approaches of global and regional
   actors, which is the cause of the instability and neo-colonial struggle
   experienced due to the crisis in Ethiopia. In this context, the study's
   most probable case study method was used and it assumed that the
   indirect involvement of global and regional actors in the
   Ethiopian-Tigray conflict has a neo-colonial purpose. Global actors have
   different interests in line with the regional power struggle and
   competition. It shows the existence of neo-colonialism as global and
   regional actors influence Ethiopia's economic and political systems.
   Ethiopia's exposure to neo-colonial interventions hinders these
   countries' economic growth and their political, social, and
   technological development. As a result, it has reached that the
   neo-colonial struggle has a destabilizing effect on Ethiopia.},

Abstract = {In this article we have studied the specific features of the liability
   of insolvency administrators for disciplinary offenses. The norms of the
   current legislation (in particular, the Bankruptcy Proceedings Code of
   Ukraine, the Tax Code of Ukraine, the Labor Code of Ukraine) regarding
   the determination of the legal status of insolvency officers and the
   specific features for bringing them to liability have been analysed in
   the article. The purpose of this research was to study problematic
   issues related to the liability of insolvency administrators. During the
   research general scientific methods, in particular dialectical, methods
   of analysis and synthesis, formal and legal, systematic approach have
   been used. It is concluded that disciplinary liability in the profession
   of insolvency officers in Ukraine is of mixed nature. It is partly
   civil, partly disciplinary and administrative liability -- in its
   essence -- and is not clearly regulated by the current legislation.
   Referring to the facts of bringing insolvency administrators to
   disciplinary liability even for a single offense has, on the one hand,
   elements of civil liability. On the other hand, disciplinary liability
   can also be imposed on insolvency administrators.},

   Instruments},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {165-176},
Abstract = {Mercantilist policies, protectionism, Chinese and US violations of the
   spirit-if not always the rules-of the World Trade Organization, along
   with supply chain vulnerabilities, trade wars, and illegal state
   subsidies have all contributed to a rise in the weaponisation of
   commerce (using trade in response to, or to achieve, political decisions
   or acts) across the globe. The weaponisation and geo-politicisation of
   trade pose a challenge for the EU, which is poorly suited for a game of
   power politics. Its common commercial policy developed separately from
   the intergovernmental foreign and security policy. The level of
   exclusive EU competence differs across the two policy domains, as do
   decision-making processes. Drawing on work addressing ideational and
   instrumental levels of policy, we discuss how the EU is assessing the
   international environment through the ideational framework of strategic
   autonomy, and how this has shaped the construction of new trade defence
   instruments intended to protect against economic and technology-related
   security risks. Focusing specifically on trade defence instruments
   addressing security concerns, which are justified in the 2023 European
   Economic Security Strategy (especially in the pillar focusing on
   protecting against economic security risks), we show that the
   distinction between commercial policy and traditional security concerns
   is eroding.},

Abstract = {Filibusters and efforts to defeat them shape the public reputation of
   U.S. senators and their parties. I develop a formal model to study how
   senators' concerns about their own and the opposing party's reputation
   influence their behavior in the Senate. In the model, a majority and
   opposition party bargain over policy. Each party earns a reputation with
   a core primary constituency which observes legislative bargaining and
   forms beliefs about its party's policy priorities. Filibusters and
   attempts to defeat them are costly and can therefore credibly signal
   that a party values a particular issue. I identify conditions under
   which parties use these costly procedural moves to preserve or enhance
   their reputation when the costs of obstruction deter purely
   policy-motivated parties from filibustering or attempting to defeat a
   filibuster. Alternatively, under certain conditions parties
   strategically choose not to pursue policy victories that they otherwise
   would either to protect their own reputation with a constituency that
   values other issues more highly or to deny the opposing party the
   opportunity to signal. I examine the model's empirical implications for
   the relative frequency of filibusters, cloture votes, and tabling
   motions and identify conditions under which the Senate is endogenously
   supermajoritarian.},

Abstract = {The EU Commission is seeking the expansion of the southern gas corridor,
   which runs from the Caspian Sea via Azerbaijan to Southeastern Europe.
   This is to replace natural gas imports from Russia. Turkmenistan is also
   offering itself to the EU as a supplier of natural gas. The argument in
   favour of importing gas from Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan via pipeline is
   that significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions are generated than
   when importing liquid gas from other regions of the world. However, a
   deepening of the energy partnership with the EU would elevate the
   financial and political status of Azerbaijan, which is an authoritarian
   state and is behaving aggressively towards Armenia. Considerable
   investment is required to extract and transport the additional volumes
   of gas. To this end, investors must first be found.},

Abstract = {China, with a population ten times larger and an equal amount of arable
   land, produces six times as many goods and services as Russia. In terms
   of gross domestic product valued at purchasing power parity, China ranks
   first in the world, Russia sixth. In Russia, a significantly larger
   share of GDP goes to private consumption as well as government final
   consumption expenditures than in China, and Russia is more militarised.
   In China, the investment rate is twice as high than in Russia, which has
   been one reason for its strong economic growth, along with the strong
   increase in the labour force. At the same time, 25 percent of China's
   inhabitants live in absolute poverty; in Russia, 4 percent. China is a
   far more important trading partner for Russia than Russia is for China.
   China determines the scope and intensity of economic integration with
   Russia and is guided only by its own interests.},

Title = {ON POLITICAL LIBERALISM OF JOHN RAWLS: PERSPECTIVES AND PROBLEMS IN
   CONTEMPORARY CIVIL-POLITICAL DISCOURSE},
Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Except to the Theory of Justice from 1971, which fundamentally changed
   the view of pluralist democracies with a market system on the welfare
   state and redistribution, John Rawls was also responsible for another
   application of philosophical doctrine to political practice by the form
   of the idea of political liberalism. This approach, as in the case of
   the ,,Theory of Justice{''}, was to once again solve the fundamental
   dilemma of democratic and pluralist societies built on the value basis
   of liberal tradition and market economy, how to approach opinion
   opponents who hold other ideological attitudes, which operate in
   democratic frameworks. In the presented text, we tried for an objective
   definition of John Rawls's political liberalism, while the study had the
   ambition to analyze the perspectives and pitfalls of this concept for
   the contemporary civil-political discourse. For the purpose of the
   presented study, we chose the method of analysis of the author's
   original work as well as secondary literature. Subsequently, we
   synthesized the obtained partial findings into statements and knowledge
   of new quality. The study demonstrated that, similar to the author's
   work ,,Theory of Justice{''}, this concept of the author in the form of
   ,,Political Liberalism{''} is workable and applicable in civil-political
   practice. However, the text also works with the idea, that this approach
   is currently accepted rather formally, and the idea of political
   liberalism necessarily runs into the problem of gradual preference of
   liberal conceptions of the good life. By referring to authors from
   domestic and also foreign philosophical communities, the text
   demonstrated the international and interdisciplinary scope of the
   problem, which extends into the broad field of humanities social
   sciences..},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {181-192},
Abstract = {This article sets out to identify a constructionist framework for a new
   and expanded ``embedded liberalism{''} and WTO reforms in the global
   trading system. Globalization and populism led the Trump administration
   to attack the WTO system by introducing unilateral protectionist
   measures and undermining its rules and norms. US populist trade policies
   have persisted under President Biden. Necessary steps to restore the WTO
   system include (a) domestic reforms by WTO members to improve economic
   adjustment, labor mobility, and social safety nets; (b) WTO reforms to
   allow for additional domestic policy space, new negotiated rules to
   address contentious issues, and a relaxation of the consensus rule; and
   (c) US restoration of its commitment to multilateral trade rules.
   Renewed global leadership will be required to pursue these steps. If the
   current WTO agreement proves to be incapable of resolving these issues,
   countries will turn increasingly to the alternative of regional trade
   agreements, which may be able to re-create the conditions for a return
   to a rules-based global trading system. Yet populism, anti-globalization
   pressures, and geopolitical tensions present the danger of a continued
   unwillingness to cooperate among major countries.},

Abstract = {Why do terrorist attacks occur in certain places and times but not
   others? Despite advances in collection and empirical methods, the
   literature has produced divergent results and reached little consensus
   for common hypotheses about the economic, political, and social causes
   of terrorism. It is hard to know what to make disagreements as studies
   adopt disparate research designs using different datasets covering
   different locations and times. This article applies the xSub data
   protocol to conduct a meta- analysis of terrorism event datasets and
   isolate explanations for variations in findings. Although the datasets
   are constructed for different purposes by different research teams, with
   different inclusion standards, processing data onto a common event
   typology, and conducting analysis across common coverage reduces
   heterogeneity in findings. This protocol also facilitates comparisons
   with general conflict event datasets, providing researchers,
   policymakers, and practitioners with a broader context for understanding
   terrorism in relation to other forms of violence.},

Number = {5},
Pages = {141-152},
Abstract = {Neuroscience is actively developing and penetrating into social areas of
   scientific research. Compared to other areas of the social sciences,
   international relations and world politics have been less concerned with
   neurostudies, since the conduct of experiment, which is the main method
   of neuroscience, is limited. The research question of the article is the
   following: how does neuroscience open up new opportunities for the study
   of world politics and, in particular, international negotiations?
   Neuroscience is aimed at obtaining objective data. In the history of
   international research, there were periods of increased interest in
   objective research methods. The last period is associated with the
   fourth industrial revolution and the emergence, among other things, of
   neuroscience. The article highlights four areas of neuroscience in the
   field of international relations and world politics: 1) The role of
   cognitive and emotional processes, the problem of leadership,
   cooperation and conflict in international relations and world politics
   in decision-making and interaction; 2) Differences in the course of
   neuroprocesses among representatives of different cultures; 3) The
   possibility of transferring data obtained by neuroscience to
   international relations and world politics; 4) Limitations and emerging
   benefits of using neuroscience in international research.},

Title = {Study of the degree of institutionalization of academic coordination in
   master?s degrees in Spanish public universities: application of the
   fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA)},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Abstract = {The present paper focuses on the analysis of the institutionalization of
   the academic coordination position of the online master's degrees in
   Spanish public universities, analyzing the conditions in which the
   management of online master programs by academic staff, help (or not)
   institutionalize academic coordination. The methodology used in this
   investigation is the Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA)
   method, a technique that has allowed, through a qualitative analysis, to
   combine a set of variables that determine the degree of
   institutionalization in the position of coordinator. The results
   indicate that a high institutionalization occurs in those cases in which
   the person in charge of the coordination has specific functions for the
   performance of their task, he/she shows a good opinion on the e-learning
   initiatives of their university and exercises the position during a
   short period of time.},

Abstract = {The British historian Ian Kershaw has developed a catalogue of factors
   to analyse the influence of political leaders on the course of history.
   At its core lies the classic relationship between personality and power.
   Kershaw's grid may be used to explain the rise of Vladimir Putin, once
   an unknown man without qualities, to the presidency of Russia, the
   concentration of power in his person, and the transition from autocracy
   to dictatorship. Every successful autocracy carries within itself the
   seeds of its own downfall. In Putin's case, the war he arbitrarily
   unleashed on Ukraine is acting as a catalyst. The ``Wagner Uprising{''}
   under Evgenii Prigozhin on June 24,2023, is the overture to the Putin
   regime's ``Gotterdammerung{''}.},

Title = {UNDERSTANDING OF ELECTORAL REFORMS: TESTING THE THEORY OF THE ``THREAT

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2023},

Pages = {72-85},
Abstract = {The analysis of institutional changes is one of the main directions of
   academic political research. The approach to the study of changes in
   electoral systems puts the conceptualization of electoral reform on the
   academic agenda. The current period of development of political science
   is characterized by the expansion and refinement of the concepts
   relating to electoral reforms that go beyond the boundaries of the
   traditional theoretical approach. The explanation of electoral reforms
   should not be limited to the theory of rational choice, according to
   which institutional changes reflect the interests of those who accept
   them. The theory of the ``threat of revolution{''} by D. Acemoglu and J.
   Robinson was chosen as the analytical basis for this study. Using the
   method of case-study analysis and more specifically Process Tracing, the
   author aims to find answers to two interrelated research questions: why
   is the ruling elite reforming the electoral system? What was the causal
   mechanism that led to electoral reform? Georgia was chosen as the object
   of research in this article. The conclusions reached by the author
   challenge the standard approach (rational institutionalism) prevailing
   in the literature and confirm the central role of opposition and
   protests in stimulating institutional change. The main conclusion is
   that prolonged mass anti-government actions are one of the factors that
   contribute to the electoral reform. It is shown that the ruling party
   has made institutional changes, agreed with the demands of the
   opposition to reform the rules for holding parliamentary elections
   against the background of a potential threat of revolution.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the Chinese debates on utopian and dystopian
   modes of democracy. It opens the black box of the one-party state and
   delves below the surface of the People's Republic of China's of-ficial
   statements on ``democracy{''} (e.g., ``people's democracy,{''}
   ``democratic centralism{''}) by focusing on the often-overlooked
   ``democracy{''} contempla- tions within the highly fragmented Chinese
   academic communities. These reflections indirectly respond to the
   debates and governance practices in other world regions-with the US
   being referred to as the main ``mirror{''} image. The article mainly
   focuses on the first two office terms of Xi Jinping. Developments since
   this re-appointment as head of the Chinese party-state in 2022 (and
   2023), however, indicate that the ``democracy{''} frame contin- ues to
   serve as core element of the Chinese role-identity narratives.},

   Regions: Implications for State Security Forces},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Climate change has emerged as the imminent threat to national security
   in many regions of the world. Nowhere is this reality more acute than in
   West and Central Africa where surging population growth, rising
   urbanisation, persistent environmental degradation, emergence of violent
   extremist organisations and weak state capacity have created a perfect
   storm of insecurity. It is against this backdrop that this article
   examines the nexus and dynamics of climate change and natural resource
   conflicts in ECOWAS and ECCAS regions, with a view to highlighting its
   security implications. This study notes that climate change contributes
   to increased conflict, but along indirect pathways. Across the two
   regions, climate change is experienced through rising temperatures,
   droughts and destructive floods, which greatly undermine people's
   well-being and compound the fragility of states. This calls for the
   capacitation of state security forces through orientation and training
   that foster good understanding of the complex relationship between
   climate change, peace and security. The study concludes by offering
   strategic recommendations and policy directions to effectively tackle
   the climate change and natural resource conflict challenges in the
   contiguous regions.},

Journal = {DESAFIOS},

Abstract = {While the literature reports increasing interest in the applications of
   Design Thinking (DT) in the field of public administration in general, a
   gap persists in academic reflections about the specific role of DT in
   informing policy and program evaluation. This article makes a conceptual
   and methodological contribution to this last debate. Part of the
   proposed reflection is meta-theoretical, allowing the iden- tification
   of commonalities between the epistemological foundations of the DT and
   one evaluation school, in particular: pragmatic evaluation. In a second
   analytical moment, the text examines some epistemological limitations of
   pragmatism (as a research paradigm) to ground causal conclusions in
   social inquiry. This is not a trivial matter since the very essence of
   evaluation is, precisely, the iden- tification of causal dynamics
   unleashed by social interventions. It is possible to amend some of these
   problems in a DT-based evaluation by adopting some epistemological
   principles from Critical Realism. A brief discussion of two applied
   evaluations of education interventions in Colombia led by the authors
   serves to illustrate some methodological implications of these last
   arguments.},

Abstract = {Parts of the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk have been occupied
   by Russia since 2014. The occupiers there are trying to bind the people
   to their regime. One means is to ideologically influence young people in
   schools. They are to be reared as defenders of the fatherland, their
   Ukrainian sense of self to be erased. The regions' schools have been
   integrated into the Russian school system. Moreover elements of Soviet
   schooling have been reintroduced. This can be seen in the canon of
   subjects such as literature, history, and social studies, which are
   intended to instil Russian patriotism and loyalty to the ``people's
   republics{''}. Physical education has been militarized, and a new
   subject, military education, has been introduced.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA},

Number = {2},
Pages = {349-375},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the political situation in Peru in 2022, focusing
   on the state of democracy through an analysis that combines structural
   and conjunctural factors. The argument is that the cyclical
   confrontation between the Executive and Legislative powers -noticeable
   since 2016- resulted in a victory of the Legislative that led to an
   imbalance of powers in favor of Congress. This altered not only the
   200-year-old tradition of presidentialism in the country, but also the
   fundamental principles of a democracy reinaugurated in 2001. The
   estallido emerged as a reaction and accentuated both the
   delegitimization of the government and of the regime, as a whole. The
   instauration of an authoritarian government deepened the confrontation.
   In this way, the country entered an authoritarian transition with
   uncertain results.},

Abstract = {The Rohingya refugee crisis has been a prolonged refugee crisis in
   Bangladesh. With the first refugee influx having taken place as far back
   in late 1977, to the latest one in 2017 (MSF, 2022), the protracted
   nature of the crisis has made the refugees extremely volatile. The
   Bangladeshi people warmly welcomed the Rohingya refugees in the face of
   the 2017 Myanmar military crackdown against the minority, citing four
   main reasons for the feelings of solidarity - (i) religious
   similarities, (ii) historical cultural and linguistic linkages, (iii)
   solidarity from political parties, and (iv) the historical experience of
   Bangladesh during the liberation war. To add to this, one can also cite
   constitutional and international duties as humanitarian motivation for
   Bangladesh to host the refugees. This research will focus on indications
   of solidarity expressed by actors from state actors and non-state actors
   through their policies and actions at individual, state and
   international levels. It will view the issue of expression of solidarity
   with Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh with the multi-focal lens of levels
   of analyses. In doing so, the study poses the questions: How is
   solidarity expressed at the individual, state, and international levels
   in the context of the Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh? Throughout
   the study, we link how certain policies, actions and narratives are
   indicative of expressions of solidarity with the Rohingya refugee
   population in Bangladesh, especially after the August 2017 Rohingya
   refugee influx. In doing so the illustrates expressions of solidarity
   towards the Rohingya refugees at different levels, and also explained
   some of the justifications of such solidarity. Much of the motivations
   for the expressions of solidarity has come from sentiments of empathy,
   global community, neighborly affection and respect and sense of duty
   from religious, cultural, historical, international human rights and
   legal obligations.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS},

Abstract = {Over the last years, political parties have increased their efforts to
   garner electoral support in the so-called `empty Spain'. A part of
   Spain, where recent depopulation dynamics have been intense, allocates
   79 parliamentary seats in the Spanish Congress of Deputies and it has
   emerged as an important electoral asset. Yet, what is the relationship
   between depopulation and political behaviour? Has the decrease in
   population benefited or damaged certain parties? As a result of it, has
   electoral participation increased or decreased? Using a new dataset that
   includes the share of the votes of different parties and the
   depopulation dynamics between 2008 and 2019, this article aims at
   contributing to the existing literature by analysing a phenomenon which
   we still know little about. To do so, we use the five regions that,
   according to Sergio del Molino (2016), make up Empty Spain. The analyses
   indicate that depopulation is related to a significant increase of
   mobilization and vote for the conservative parties, an effect that is
   fundamentally driven by demographic compositional changes triggered by
   young people, who are more likely to be left-wing, but also more likely
   to move out to urban areas.},

Abstract = {Car-oriented mobility produces externalities that disrupt the quality of
   life, especially for urban residents. New national and EU-funded
   projects are dedicated on improving sustainable mobility and raising the
   ecofriendliness of transport. In our paper, we aim to answer if Poland
   has a chance to foster ecofriendliness in drivers and mobility users.
   The survey results (n=3094) illustrate how intergenerational differences
   between mobility users depends on their place of living. We conclude
   that in large cities, opportunities for changing the mobility patterns
   are higher. In order for the local authorities to achieve succeed, they
   should prioritize promoting private and shared micromobility.},

Abstract = {Right-wing populism is on the rise all over the world and has led to
   profound effects and changes in the international system. The European
   continent, which is identified with democracy and human rights, also
   sees its share of this trend. Today, right-wing populist parties and
   actors are gaining strength in many EU countries and come to the fore as
   a serious political focus. The European Parliament (EP), as an example
   of direct democracy, has become one of the most visible institutions
   facing this shift. In this article, the discourses of right-wing
   populist parliamentarians in the EP toward Turkiye are focused on
   through a social constructivist perspective. The 2009-2014 and 2014-2019
   parliamentary periods are analyzed comparatively to present which
   discursive strategies MEPs used in their statements about Turkiye and
   what kind of Turkiye representation they constructed in the EP. The
   article benefits from critical discourse analysis studies and aims to
   contribute to the literature on the attitudes of rightwing populist
   groups on Turkiye.},

Abstract = {The globalizing world has forced various actors to look beyond their
   borders and establish relationships with other actors, in order to
   reflect the current demands of society. The European Union (EU) was able
   to reflect on this situation very effectively, since the impact of the
   European integration process does not end only at the external borders
   of its member states. The main objective of the article was to define
   the European Union as an important geopolitical actor that can
   effectively spread its values and norms across the entire political map
   of the world. The scope of the EU's external impact beyond the borders
   of the European integration area was identified through the theoretical
   approaches of inter-regionalism and External Governance. The author
   analysed how the EU can spread values and standards towards selected
   groups of actors, namely candidate countries, countries of EU
   neighbourhood and other regional integration organizations. The emphasis
   was not only on the process of how the EU can spread its norms and
   values, but also on how they are accepted by the affected actors. The
   large scale and institutionalized form of the EU's external impact
   documents the effort to actively act beyond its external borders. The
   spread of values and norms towards external actors contributes to the
   strengthening of the geopolitical position, where the EU represents an
   actor with a wide global reach. In addition, the article offered a
   prognosis of which actors will likely to be exposed to stronger external
   influence from the EU in the coming years.},

Abstract = {Imagery frames reality, and political actors tell stories using images.
   In an increasingly digital communication landscape, political actors
   tell visual stories directly on websites or social media channels. This
   online shift places digital imagery centrally in how we picture
   political issues, events, and places. Digital images are mobile,
   circulable and appropriable, which means images are not fused to their
   immediately surrounding text. Telling a story with digital imagery
   constitutes a contribution toward a wider digital visual discourse,
   enabled by circulation. Interpretivist research lacks tools to unpack
   this digital visual discourse. This article critically evaluates a
   technique to tap into digital visual discourse using semi-automated data
   collection utilising search engines. Such data collection tools can
   divorce imagery from its immediately surrounding text and create a
   corpus that allows us to identify a digital visual discourse around a
   given topic. I draw on an attempt at scraping search engines to this
   end, studying how actors portray the Arctic. The technique is presented
   transparently with a call to engage with the tool, to spur
   methodological debates and innovation. Search engine scraping can, in
   the right research design and if applied critically, illuminate new
   dimensions of discourse by prying apart written text and imagery.},

Abstract = {This article aims to determine whether there are gender-based
   differences in using Twitter. For this purpose, 518,156 tweets from 280
   Colombian Congress members were analysed. The study compares the number
   of tweets, audience, influence and efficacy of their messages on
   Twitter. Despite Colombia being below average in terms of political
   equality, research shows that a gender balance exists between Colombian
   male and female politicians on this social media channel. Members of the
   Colombian Congress use Twitter similarly, regardless of their gender:
   they are comparably influential in terms of volume, amplification,
   audience and efficacy of their messages. In fact, no significant gender
   differences exist regarding audience figures or amplification. However,
   the data show remarkable disparities regarding political party
   affiliation and ideological beliefs rather than gender.},

Abstract = {Globalization and technological advancements pose a threat of job loss
   for native-born citizens, potentially leading to blaming immigrants for
   economic hardship. This sentiment hinges on the perception that
   foreign-born residents are not contributing to the host society, often
   combined with discourse portraying immigrants as competitors regarding
   welfare benefits. Nevertheless, we have limited knowledge about how
   labor market risk to job loss is related to anti-immigrant sentiments in
   tandem with their assessment of the welfare state, such as the
   deservingness of beneficiaries. Drawing on the European Social Survey,
   this study examines the relationship between labor market risks,
   deservingness perception, and anti-immigrant attitudes. First, the
   extent to which individuals are exposed to job-displacing
   transformations is negatively associated with a perception of
   immigrants' contribution to the host society. Second, in contrast, the
   perception that welfare recipients are deserving is positively
   associated with an attitude toward immigrant contribution. Third, the
   association between the labor market risks and the devaluation of
   immigrants' contributions is stronger among individuals who emphasize
   the deservingness of beneficiaries. We argue that economic insecurity
   combined with frustration with the fairness of the social welfare system
   can drive anti-immigrant attitudes.},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether and why party members sometimes vote
   for other parties. Although often taken as parties' most loyal voters,
   recent evidence suggests that members' vote is not unconditional. Using
   novel survey data from Portugal, we examine rates of defection by
   members, test the validity of existing explanations and assess the
   extent to which traditional theories of party membership can account for
   such behavior. We argue that ideological incongruence, satisfaction with
   intra-party functioning, incentive structure and party activism play a
   key role in explaining why a member casts a vote for another party while
   maintaining a formal connection with their own party. Findings support
   the impact of internal discontentment and engagement in party
   activities, as well as instrumental motivations for members of smaller
   parties. We also explore how motivations relate to strategic
   considerations in driving defection. Results differ across parties,
   suggesting the importance of of party models and legacy. They have
   important implications for party membership and mobilization, as well as
   for future research on membership decline and the consequences of party
   cohesion and factionalism.},

Abstract = {China built internment camps officially referred to as training centres
   within the scope of a policy for countering extremism and terrorism in
   the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in 2017. While the repression
   imposed by China on Uyghurs in these camps has attracted the response of
   the international community, there has been neither a public protest nor
   a meaningful government response to China in Turkey, despite it having
   been the voice of Uyghurs on international platforms before 2017. This
   study aims to identify the reasons for Turkey's silence on the
   persecution of Uyghurs by utilizing the legitimation and co-optation
   strategies of the authoritarian stability framework. The Turkish
   government's legitimation strategies of ``rallying around the flag{''}
   via anti-Americanism and the economic expectations of China to boost its
   performance-based legitimacy are evaluated as reasons for the
   government's silence on the Uyghur cause. Moreover, it is also discussed
   how formal and informal co-optation strategies of the government with
   nationalist and Eurasianist parties are playing a role as a bolstering
   mechanism of its silence policy on Uyghurs.},

Abstract = {Rousseau's account of the ``legislator{''} or ``lawgiver{''} is commonly
   regarded as one of the most far-fetched, ominous, and baffling parts of
   his teaching in the Social Contract. In brief, Rousseau's lawgiver seems
   to be a proto-totalitarian figure whose self-appointed mission is to
   found a political community by ``denaturing{''} people at a single
   stroke and who may be a mere figment of Rousseau's overheated
   imagination. Accordingly, this part of the Social Contract threatens to
   make a mockery of Rousseau's claim to be ``taking men as they are and
   laws they can be,{''} as well as his claim that the combination of
   ``freedom and equality{''} is ``the greatest good{''} in the civil
   state. Following and extending Rousseau's own method of teaching by
   examples, however, this essay argues that Benjamin Franklin's influence
   over the American republic-especially through his posthumous
   Autobiography-offers a prosaic example of the apparently fantastical
   phenomenon sketched by Rousseau. In fact, I argue that Franklin's case
   corresponds more fully to Rousseau's description than do any of
   Rousseau's own examples (such as Moses, Lycurgus, and Numa) and that
   Franklin showed in practice what Rousseau suggested in theory: that a
   lawgiver can succeed without relying on coercion and without
   undercutting the equality that underlies a just society. Franklin's
   denaturing influence, I suggest, has been crucial for the durability of
   republicanism in the United States, given the country's size and
   diversity.},

Abstract = {The article is based on an empirical socio-legal analysis of criminal
   court case files concerning prostitution abuse in Slovenia. Based on the
   theoretical frame-work developed by Petra ostergren, the authors analyse
   whether the Slovenian regulatory system on sex work is repressive,
   restrictive or integrative. The pa-per explores how the courts define
   ``abuse{''} and ``exploitation{''} of prostitution, how the p
   articipation of third parties in sex work activities is dealt with by
   the courts, how the vulnerability of sex workers is treated, and how the
   exist-ence of consent is considered before the courts. The paper
   examines the files for moral arguments, stereotyping, and
   stigmatisation, as well as references to occupational risks in the field
   of sex work and sex workers' rights. In the con-clusions the authors
   argue that in Slovenia the characteristics of the restrictive model,
   with elements of both repressive and integrative, prevail.},

Abstract = {This article considers an alternative paradigm for responding to the
   climate emergency. Drawing on Fierke's ideas on quantum complementarity
   and wuwei, or actionless action, it considers what quantum social
   science and Eastern philosophies can offer to a fragmenting, polarized
   world where responses to climate change appear to be limited and
   ineffective. The wisdom of actionless action involves engaging
   differently with difference, emphasizing a spontaneous and ethical
   quality of agency that both disrupts the patterns that maintain the
   drivers of climate change and contributes to social and cultural norms,
   rules, regulations, and institutions that are equitable and sustainable.
   In contrast to doing nothing, actionless action may one of the keys to
   generating quantum social change.},

Title = {Should we include margins of error in public opinion polls?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {63},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1082-1107},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Public opinion polls have become vital and increasingly visible parts of
   election campaigns. Previous research has frequently demonstrated that
   polls can influence both citizens' voting intentions and political
   parties' campaign strategies. However, they are also fraught with
   uncertainty. Margins of error can reflect (parts of) this uncertainty.
   This paper investigates how citizens' voting intentions change due to
   whether polling estimates are presented with or without margins of
   error.Using a vignette experiment (N=3224), we examine this question
   based on a real-world example in which different election polls were
   shown to nationally representative respondents ahead of the 2021 federal
   election in Germany. We manipulated the display of the margins of error,
   the interpretation of polls and the closeness of the electoral race.The
   results indicate that margins of error can influence citizens' voting
   intentions. This effect is dependent on the actual closeness of the race
   and additional interpretative guidance provided to voters. More
   concretely, the results consistently show that margins of error increase
   citizens' inclination to vote for one of the two largest contesting
   parties if the polling gap between these parties is small, and an
   interpretation underlines this closeness.The findings of this study are
   important for three reasons. First, they help to determine whether
   margins of error can assist citizens in making more informed (strategic)
   vote decisions. They shed light on whether depicting opinion-poll
   uncertainty affects the key features of representative democracy, such
   as democratic accountability. Second, the results stress the
   responsibility of the media. The way polls are interpreted and
   contextualized influences the effect of margins of error on voting
   behaviour. Third, the findings of this paper underscore the significance
   of including methodological details when communicating scientific
   research findings to the broader public.},

Abstract = {Democratic governments produce more policies than they can effectively
   implement. Yet, this gap between the number of policies requiring
   implementation and the administrative capacities available to do so is
   not the same in all democracies but varies across countries and sectors.
   We argue that this variation depends on the coupling of the sectoral
   bureaucracies in charge of policy formulation and those in charge of
   policy implementation. We consider these patterns of vertical
   policy-process integration an important feature of bureaucratic quality.
   The more the policymaking level is involved in policy implementation
   (top-down integration) and the easier the policy-implementing level
   finds it to feed its concerns into policymaking (bottom-up integration),
   the smaller the so-called ``burden-capacity gap.{''} We demonstrate this
   effect through an empirical analysis in 21 OECD countries over a period
   of more than 40 years in the areas of social and environmental policies.},

Abstract = {Even as The Federalist is frequently read to illuminate the origins of
   the American constitutional order, it advances a powerful account of the
   political future to be created and encountered by the polity the
   Constitution would found. Central to this account is a proleptic mode of
   analysis used to anticipate probable political developments and future
   patterns of constitutional politics, depict their systemic consequences,
   and identify how those consequences would feed back into the political
   system. Publius' proleptic analyses comprise a descriptive theory of
   constitutional development according to which success on the terms
   stipulated-namely, the realization of a stable and well-administered
   constitutional union-would both bolster the new national government and
   supply the conditions for the expansion of its authority. Together, The
   Federalist's proleptic analyses and the developmental theory they
   comprise disclose a dynamic constitutional imagination characterized by
   the changeability of authority relations.},

Abstract = {It's now fifteen years since the death of Bernard Crick. His
   contribution to modern scholarship and political writing continues to be
   recognised largely with reference to `the book' and `the biography',
   namely the `mere essay' In Defence of Politics and his major work on
   George Orwell. The central contention of this article, however, is that
   Crick's corpus of work continues to have a wide contemporary relevance
   that reaches far beyond these two central reference points. Crick's
   arguments about ideology and political cultures remain hugely
   significant to anyone seeking to understand or contest the emergence of
   populism. Populism has, in recent years, reaffirmed its status as a
   highly effective mode of political galvanisation. Crick saw populism as
   the most urgent threat to politics and his concerns are widely echoed in
   academia and beyond. This article uses some of Crick's political
   `meddling' in his final years as a lens through which to examine Crick's
   active defence of politics. These include Crick's deep engagement with
   Scottish political life, and manifestations of his truculent moderation
   and intellectual pluralism. It argues that Crick embodied a positive
   faith that, though powerful and serious, threats to politics could be
   disarmed and repelled.},

Abstract = {The concept of Technical Object developed by Gilbert Simondon at the end
   of the 1950s is a theoretical-conceptual productions that has gained
   great recognition in recent decades among the studies of the links
   between technology and society. At present, where digital technologies
   have a wide presence and effects in all spheres of life, it is
   considered necessary to recover and problematize this concept. The
   objective of this article is to deploy the proposal for the concept of
   Digital Technical Object as a contribution to the current debates and
   discussions. An approach of definitions and categorizations is carried
   out, making a theoretical-conceptual effort to, based on putting
   Simondon's elaborations in dialogue with other authors, characterize the
   technical object not only in the digital age but also about the paradigm
   4.0 of personalization and algorithmic profiling.},

Abstract = {Recent research on clientelism has focused on the varieties of
   clientelism. They suggest that clientelistic exchanges differ in terms
   of the expected length of iterations, whereby politicians deliver
   benefits to voters in exchange for political support. Using newly
   collected V-Party data (1,844 political parties from 165 countries,
   1970-2019), we identify two prominent types of clientelism that recent
   studies have suggested: relational clientelism and single-shot
   clientelism. By demonstrating that our measures of clientelism
   outperform existing cross-national indices, we suggest that it is
   important to unpack clientelistic linkages at the party level to grasp
   the fine-grained differences in clientelism across parties within
   states. We then apply our measures to the analysis of the relationship
   between economic development and clientelism, one of the major topics in
   the clientelism study. Our analysis finds that relational clientelism
   persists even in relatively developed countries, whereas the effect of
   economic development on single-shot clientelism has a curvilinear
   relationship. Our applications of the new measures of clientelism also
   show that the gap in clientelistic practices between ruling and
   opposition parties varies depending on the types of clientelism, tenure
   lengths of incumbents, and the degree of political centralization.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {341-365},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {This article claims that the state and, more precisely, whether the
   state has a rational-legal or a patrimonial public administration,
   affects (1) the extent to which democratic standards are met and (2) the
   costs of abandoning office and the support leaders unwilling to accept
   electoral defeat can expect to have within the state and their party.
   Further, this argument is elaborated so as to account for the typical
   political regime in contemporary Latin America, durable poor-quality
   democracies. Latin America's semi-patrimonial states are held to
   determine this outcome through two mechanisms: selective collusion and
   political opportunism. The plausibility of the theory about mechanisms
   is gauged. Additionally, implications for the field of comparative
   democracy studies are spelled out.},

Title = {From solidarity to self-promotion? Neoliberalism and left politics in
   the age of the social media influencer},
Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to map the contested intersections of
   influencer culture and left/progressive politics within the current
   conjuncture. Furthermore, drawing on a combination of Gramscian and
   Foucaultian insights, the article considers the implications of these
   intersections for how we theorise the relationship between neoliberalism
   and left politics. In so doing, my argument is threefold. First, I
   suggest that social media influencers and influencer activists have
   turned to various forms of left politics as a means of establishing a
   distinctive personal brand, and heightening their social media clout.
   Second, I suggest that these developments have been met with something
   of a backlash among some left commentators, wary of the superficiality -
   and privileging of self-promotion over solidarity - that influencer
   activism entails, in keeping with a broader disaffection with what some
   consider to be the excessively individualistic flavour of contemporary
   forms of online `identity politics'. Third, I note that left critics of
   influencer activism often posit a distinction between `proper' - that
   is, materialist, solidaristic - left politics, on one hand, and
   superficial, individualistic influencer activism, on the other. But,
   drawing on a conception of neoliberalism inspired by Foucault's 1979
   lectures, I suggest that, in a neoliberal digital capitalist context,
   this distinction becomes hard to sustain. This argument has two further
   implications. First, it becomes very difficult to extricate oneself from
   the imperatives of neoliberal digital culture, even if one is
   politically opposed to neoliberalism; and, second, the figure of the
   social media influencer, far from being exceptional or anomalous, is
   merely a more overt or extreme manifestation of logics that are already
   endemic in contemporary cultural and political life.},

Abstract = {America's allies have reacted differently to the uncertainty surrounding
   US global leadership and the return to hard power politics in the 2010s.
   Some allies have remained steadfast in their commitment to Washington,
   while others distanced themselves from the United States. Why is it so?
   This article develops an integrated argument that brings together
   different strands of the literature on alignment, to better make sense
   of cross-national and within-case variations in allies' strategic
   behavior. By examining three case studies from distinct regional
   contexts - Japan, Poland and Turkey - the paper shows that although
   these allies all shared concerns about the Obama and Trump
   administrations' security commitment, it was their differing perceptions
   of the threats posed by China and Russia's power that influenced their
   pursuit of either stronger alignment with the US security patron -
   through internal balancing for `attractiveness' and internal hedging -,
   or increased strategic autonomy from Washington by pursuing hard
   hedging.},

Abstract = {Normative debates on migration control, while characterised by profound
   disagreement, do appear to agree that the state has at least a prima
   facie right to prevent the entry of security threats. While concern is
   sometimes raised that this `security exception' can be abused, there has
   been little focus by normative theorists on concrete practices of
   security, and how we can determine what a `principled' use of the
   security exception would be. I argue that even if states have a right to
   prevent migrants from entering on grounds of security, the practices
   required to implement this right will likely compromise core liberal
   democratic values in ways that have not been sufficiently appreciated. I
   draw on literature from Science and Technology Studies and Critical
   Security Studies to examine the proliferation of digital border control
   technologies which are increasingly dominating state security practices,
   and explain the challenges these technologies pose to
   non-discrimination, liberty and equality. I also highlight the
   difficulties of taking these principles as presumptive limitations on
   the operation of the security exception. A more sustained conversation
   among ethical theorists is needed to address the profound ethical
   challenges that the ever-increasing use of these technologies poses,
   particularly in pursuit of security.},

Abstract = {In July 2015, a legal duty came into force as part of the United
   Kingdom's Counter Terrorism and Security Act that included a requirement
   (referred to as the Prevent Duty) for schools and other education
   providers to ``prevent people from being drawn into terrorism{''}.
   Parallel to this initiative, schools in England were also required to
   include teaching on ``Fundamental British Values{''} as part of the
   curriculum, to ``build pupil's resilience to radicalisation{''}. Yet
   this latter element is not required in schools in Scotland. This paper
   argues that the absence of a requirement for teachers in Scotland to
   include teaching on Fundamental British Values simultaneously
   politicises and depoliticises the delivery of the Prevent Duty, and
   British identity in this context. In doing so, the paper contributes to
   existing debates on the relationship between the Prevent Duty and the
   Fundamental British Values, reflects on the political nature of these
   parallel initiatives and examines the security policy implications of
   the contentious nature of British identity in Scotland.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the growing body of literature on opposition
   coordination within competitive authoritarian regimes (CARs). Defining
   oppositional unity as the ability of key opposition parties to select
   one joint candidate for elections, it introduces the concept of an
   intermediary party that facilitates such unity. An intermediary party is
   perceived less threatening by other opposition parties in their
   opportunistic and ideological conflicts and has the potential to offer a
   more agreeable joint candidate or a more conciliatory method of
   selecting the joint candidate within the opposition bloc. The article
   illustrates this argument by examining the Budapest and Istanbul mayoral
   elections held in 2019 in Hungary and Turkey. Drawing on data from 30
   anonymized elite interviews and media statements of the opposition
   leaders in each country, the article demonstrates the significance of an
   intermediary party that facilitates oppositional unity in CARs, adding
   that the participation of intraparty actors with strong communication
   skills during the negotiations further reinforces this outcome.},

Abstract = {Considering the neoliberal commercialization of sexual politics, this
   article argues for a reconfiguration of sexual citizenship as activist,
   relational, and embodied. By doing so it aims to challenge the
   contemporary de-politicization, individualization, and hegemonic
   normalization of sexual citizenship. While the activist and relational
   dimension consider how the dominant manifestation of sexual politics may
   be disrupted, the notion of embodied sexual citizenship draws attention
   to the ways in which the ability of doing so is materially conditioned.
   This article proposes a framework through which sexual citizenship can
   be re-politicized as a collective and accountable project, moving beyond
   the need of self-production through consumption.},

Abstract = {That black and white Americans disagree about the carceral state is well
   established; why this is the case is much less clear. Drawing on group
   hierarchy theory and the state's role in perpetuating group
   subordination/domination, we theorize that differences in socialization
   and contact during emergent adulthood produce divergent priors for
   racial groups and gender subgroups within race. These different starting
   points shape how people integrate new information from recent contact
   into their belief systems. Using a survey of over 11,000 respondents, we
   find that, instead of all groups integrating information the same way,
   recent direct contact contributes most to negative attitudes among
   groups whose contact with government agents is least negatively
   valenced. While interactions with the American carceral state divide
   opinions considerably among white Americans and women, adulthood contact
   for black Americans, especially black men, appears to be but `a drop in
   the ocean' of political life.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, concern has grown regarding the risks generated by
   the use of artificial in-telligence systems. One of the main problems
   associated with the use of these systems is the harm they have been
   proven to cause to the fundamental right to equality and
   non-discrimination. In this context, it is vital that we examine
   existing and proposed regulatory instruments that aim to address this
   particular issue, especially taking into consideration the difficulties
   of applying the abstract nature that typically characterises legal
   instruments and, in particular, the equality and non-discrimination
   legal framework, to the specific instructions that are needed when
   coding an artificial intelligence instrument that aims to be
   non-discriminatory. This paper focuses on examining how article 10 of
   the new EU Artificial Intelligence Act proposal may be the starting
   point for a new form of regulation that adapts to the needs of
   algorithmic systems.},

Abstract = {How does the salience of clientelism in politics impact voter support
   for women legislative candidates? Existing research finds little bias
   against women legislative candidates in survey experiments. Where bias
   exists, it is due to ``role congruity,{''} where voters penalize women
   because of a perceived lack of specific traits or issue preferences
   suitable for the position. Building on existing work, I theorize that
   the ability to deliver patronage is a ``role{''} voters might find
   stereotypically incongruous with women. Using two waves of a nationally
   representative survey in Vietnam, I generate preregistered predictions
   about the impact of a clientelism prime on bias against women
   legislative candidates. I then test the prediction, with results showing
   that when clientelism is primed, bias against women candidates
   increases. These results provide evidence that clientelism has gendered
   effects on political representation. It also theorizes an additional
   ``role{''} that could penalize women at the polls.},

Abstract = {Under severe fiscal constraints that plagued colonial states, how did
   governments allocate their coercive power throughout the colonized
   territory? In this paper, I highlight the pre-colonial state
   consolidation as an important determinant of colonial coercion. When the
   state established control over society by appointing new local agents,
   the society became more compliant to state demands, reducing the need
   for coercion over the long run. To evaluate this argument in British
   Burma, I collected new data from indigenous land revenue inquests and
   colonial police reports, using the pre-colonial variation in local
   headman appointment after a plausibly exogenous extinction of a
   hereditary line. I find that places closer to locations that received
   new pre-colonial headmen experienced significantly lower colonial police
   presence. Neither spatial correlation nor the presence of other state
   institutions can explain the results. The findings emphasize the deep
   origins of contentious state-society relations that extend beyond
   colonial legacies.},

Abstract = {In autocracies, low-capacity protest campaigns that lack material and
   political resources are common, but these weaknesses make them
   vulnerable to reneging - the deliberate failure to implement concessions
   as promised. Reneging is critical to how and whether protests actually
   influence policy. Why are some autocratic concessions to low-capacity
   campaigns undermined by reneging? I argue concessions are most likely to
   be implemented when they matter least for meaningfully altering policy.
   Concessions that provide isolated conflict resolution without
   constraining state actors elsewhere are more likely to be implemented,
   while reneging affects concessions that would constrain state agents
   elsewhere. I find support for this argument using an original dataset of
   low-capacity protest campaigns in Moscow, Russia, from 2013 to 2018,
   which includes a novel approach to concessions data. Additionally, I
   show that reneging is less likely when the campaign demobilizes after
   the concession, though the effect on constraining concessions is
   limited. I also address why campaigns about some issues, like labour
   disputes, experience less reneging, and show that concessions from
   higher levels of government are just as prone to reneging as lower
   levels. This article advances scholarship on authoritarian
   responsiveness and non-violent political control by highlighting
   reneging as an overlooked response to protest.},

Abstract = {There is lively debate on the question if states have legitimate
   authority to enforce the exclusion of (would-be) immigrants. Against
   common belief, I argue that even non-cosmopolitan liberals have strong
   reason to be sceptical of much contemporary border authority. To do so,
   I first establish that for liberals, broadly defined, a state can only
   hold legitimate authority over persons whose moral equality it is not
   engaged in undermining. I then reconstruct empirical cases from the
   sphere of international relations in which what I call `colonial norms'
   continue to play significant structuring roles. I argue that it is
   sometimes only by unveiling these colonial norms and the roles they play
   that we can understand how some states today culpably contribute to
   undermining the moral equality of persons over whom they will come to
   claim immigration-related authority. I thus contend that paying
   attention to colonial norms distinctly enables us to reveal a set of
   instances in which all liberals should agree that states forfeit
   legitimate authority over would-be immigrants.},

Abstract = {This article examines the historical reality as well as the discourse on
   the singularity of the Holocaust in Germany. After an excursus on the
   Historikerstreit (Historians Dispute) in 1986, which resulted in a
   specific consensus on the interpretation of the Holocaust, the article
   describes the development of research since then, which led to a
   different result, namely to understand the Holocaust as a complex
   violent event with different groups of perpetrators and victims, which
   must be placed in the context of a European history of violence. The
   thesis of the singularity of the Holocaust not only no longer reflects
   this research development, but also blocks an appropriate culture of
   remembrance, which should be open and ``multidirectional{''} (Michael
   Rothberg) without relativizing the specificity of the mass murder of
   European Jews.},

Abstract = {The literature on early modern state-building in Europe has focused on
   war as its main driver and therefore on states' relationships with men.
   Feminist scholars have critiqued the Weberian conceptions this
   literature relies on as being gender biased. I suggest an alternative
   theoretical starting point for theories of early modern state-building:
   the political imperatives created by the demographic fluctuations of the
   Malthusian trap. Harnessing Foucault's concept of biopower and its
   application to the construction of gender, I argue that population
   fluctuations incentivized demographic regulation, in particular of
   childbearing, in order to keep birth rates high and maternal and infant
   mortality low, implying that early modern European states were
   constituted through the construction and maintenance of gender regimes.
   I propose strategies for empirical investigation and argue that a more
   accurate account of early modern European state-building needs to
   incorporate demographic regulation and therefore requires gender to be
   at its center.},

Abstract = {Since the inauguration of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC),
   researchers focused on various impacts on the region's economies. The
   project will have many economic, financial, and social effects in
   general and on both countries. Along with many economic and financial
   tasks, policymakers from Pakistan and China are also focusing on
   security issues. It is generally accepted among these policymakers that
   CPEC is a fate-changer for Pakistan and the region, which can only
   become true if it maintains a certain level of stability in Pakistan. In
   this regard, in line with the policymakers, law enforcement agencies
   took several initiatives within and on the country's borders. The study
   aims to analyze policies initiated so far to overcome security
   challenges critically. The analysis elucidates the possible security
   threats for the future and the policies undertaken by China-Pakistan to
   secure the CPEC.

Abstract = {Less-Lethal Weapons (LLWs) have been a topic of debate in law
   enforcement, with much of the literature focusing on their legality and
   convenience rather than their effectiveness, in particular for police
   agencies. To address this gap, this study employs advanced financial
   risk analytics and scenario simulation to model the return on investment
   (ROI) of LLWs usage. By using a type of LLW (The Alternative) as a case
   study, the results suggest that while extreme events in LLW occur
   relatively infrequently compared to conventional firearms, their impact
   on society is significant. For instance, police agencies can have ROI
   between 1564\% and 2728\%. For each dollar invested in acquiring,
   equipping, and training an officer with LLWs, the added benefit is seen
   between USD\$16 and USD\$28. Hence, LLWs not only reduce collateral
   damage, reputational and legal risk, but also prevent unnecessary deaths
   which erode police legitimacy and public trust.},

Abstract = {This article nuances the poverty-inducing effect of political dynasties.
   We argue that local dynasties in the Philippines can pursue different
   development trajectories based on their ownership of local businesses
   and their province's initial state capacity. Adapting a framework
   developed by Bourguignon and Verdier, we develop a typology of political
   dynasties that acknowledges heterogeneity in their motivations as well
   as in the political opportunity structures that they work in. This
   outlines a theory of change that fosters the necessary conditions for
   political and economic competition over time, even in areas ruled by
   political dynasties. While the focus is on the Philippines, research on
   the nexus between political and economic competition provides insight
   into issues of political dynasties, competition policy, governance, and
   accountability faced by a broader set of countries.},

Title = {Agnosticism on Racial Integration: Liberal-Democratic or Libertarian?},

Volume = {76},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1196-1208},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Theorists of racial justice in the United States have long disagreed
   about the respective merits of integration versus separatism. In an
   attempt to reframe this debate, Andrew Valls has developed a liberal
   approach that purports to cut across the integration/separation divide.
   On this approach, the goal is to establish fair choice conditions for
   individuals choosing where to affiliate; when fair conditions obtain,
   the theory espouses a normative agnosticism toward whatever patterns of
   spatial distribution result. If successful, Valls's choice-based
   framework represents a potentially transformative intervention in
   debates over racial justice. However, this article argues that the
   framework's agnostic approach is in tension with its putative
   applicability to liberal-democratic societies. Specifically, it contends
   that the theory's criteria for fair choice are excessively permissive,
   and that its conception of racial justice relies on an unwarranted
   assumption that under just conditions, individual choices will produce
   just aggregate outcomes. The maintenance of the theory's agnosticism
   requires it to adopt positions that are better described as libertarian,
   rather than liberal-democratic. These problems suggest that the
   integration-separation debate cannot be circumvented via an agnostic
   appeal to individual choice, because that agnosticism obscures questions
   about the nature of democracy which are at the heart of the
   disagreement.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the underlying factors that pushed Russia, the
   European Union (EU), Turkiye, and somehow the U.S. to offer mediation to
   settle the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The eruption of the
   fierce clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia ended the war that
   happened in 2020 when Russia brokered the ceasefire. However, Russia's
   war in Ukraine was signaling renewed fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Hence, some actors started to step into the hostility to facilitate
   diplomatic efforts to lower the temperatures of the conflicting parties.
   Meanwhile, Azerbaijan made a military assault on Artsakh in 2023 and
   gained a final victory over Nagorno-Karabakh. Amid tension, the EU,
   Russia, and Turkiye will hold a responsible role and bring hopes that
   diplomacy may bring Azerbaijan and Armenia closer to peace, and an
   eventual settlement will ensue. The research demonstrates that a new
   geopolitical change has been taking place in the South Caucasus region,
   which is causing complexities amid some options set by the mediators.},

Abstract = {The Turkic states began their collaboration in 1992. Over time, this

   Organization of Turkic States (OTS), which has evolved into a
   comprehensive international organization. The member states of OTS have
   expressed their commitment to pursuing coordinated policies on security
   matters that are of mutual interest. As a result, the security dimension
   has become increasingly prominent within the multidimensional areas of
   cooperation within OTS in recent years. In light of this, the present
   study aims to explore the positive outcomes of enhanced and fortified
   security collaboration among Turkic states under the umbrella of OTS.
   Specifically, the study will focus on systemic security, regional
   security, and key security issues such as counter-terrorism and military
   capacity, shedding light on the potential benefits derived from these

   Presidential Elections},

Abstract = {Candidate debates are increasingly organized during elections in
   democracies and electoral autocracies. How do debates impact partisan
   divisions and preferences in these contexts? One theoretical perspective
   suggests that debates should amplify these preferences and divisions,
   while another implies debates should attenuate them. This paper
   evaluates these expectations by studying presidential debates organized
   during Malawi's May 2019 elections. With an experiment and national
   panel survey, the paper provides evidence consistent with attenuation:
   debate watchers were substantially more likely to vote across partisan
   lines (cross-party voting), became more favorable toward out-partisan
   candidates, and became less favorable toward co-partisans. Suggestive
   evidence on causal mechanisms shows that these effects were driven by

Abstract = {Several nations have enacted gender reforms in policing, many of which
   are premised on the notion that women favor female officers, especially
   in the context of tackling violence against women (VAW). We investigate
   this topic in India. Evidence from the first nationally representative
   survey on policing (N \& AP; 15,000) demonstrates high levels of bias
   against policewomen, including among women and VAW complainants. To
   estimate the causal effect of police gender on officer evaluations, we
   design an unusual video experiment with assistance from the news
   corporation New Delhi Television (N \& AP; 1000). We find that
   policewomen are not generally preferred to policemen, and citizens have
   significantly unfavorable attitudes toward female officers when seen
   tackling VAW rather than non-VAW cases. These negative ratings are
   driven by female respondents. We highlight certain context-specific
   explanations and note that the manner in which policewomen are typecast
   may undercut the positive implications associated with representation.
   Our study is an example of shared identity increasing mistrust, and it
   expands the discussion about citizens using ascriptive characteristics
   to make inferences about politicians to include front-line bureaucrats
   like police officers.},

Abstract = {If opposition to ULEZ really did tip the Uxbridge by-election result, we
   should be surprised. Most voters drive compliant vehicles and might
   benefit from cleaner air. But the adversely-affected minority had loud
   voices, and opposition was mobilised against the very principle of road
   pricing, with substantial input from home counties Conservatives outside
   Greater London. It didn't help that the scientific case for ULEZ is not
   straightforward, although it certainly exists. Especially when a lot of
   people are giving `don't know' responses to pollsters, public opinion
   may be swayed by noisy dissent.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on the reasons why Erdogan and the Justice and
   Development Party (AKP) could still win in the recent 2023 presidential
   and parliamentary elections in Turkey despite, among other daunting
   issues, the deep economic crisis and their unsuccessful handling of the
   February 2023 earthquake. The article discusses the role of state
   apparatus and the media under a neopatrimonial system, as well as the
   role of the EU, which turned Turkey into a rentier state with the
   refugee deals. The discussion considers whether Turkey could still be
   seen as a competitive authoritarian regime and points to the
   difficulties in determining whether regimes such as the Turkish one are
   competitive authoritarian or not until the election results are seen and
   the opposition candidates actually win.},

Abstract = {Civil society is a bulwark against autocratic rule; its erosion
   contributes to democratic recession worldwide. Scholars and activists
   are calling attention to repressive laws non-democratic governments
   enact to undermine civil society organizations (CSOs). Yet,
   non-democratic governments do not only enact repressive laws; they also
   enact permissive, quasi-democratic legal rules. Evidence from case
   studies suggests that non-democratic governments enact such rules as
   part of a broader strategy to stabilize the regime. This article adds a
   within-case comparative study of Kenya's four CSO regulators to the
   growing evidence showing that non-democracies can choose to manipulate
   civil society rather than repress it. The government's words and
   documentation provide evidence: I triangulate elite interviews with
   elected officials and bureaucrats with archival data from government
   libraries and four CSO regulators. I find that the government enacts
   permissive legal rules and then uses several control and consultation
   tactics collectively, separately, and episodically to manipulate CSOs
   and legitimise the regime.},

Abstract = {Contemporary political theory often discards Montesquieu's political
   theory of climate. It is generally viewed as misguided and potentially
   offensive due to its perceived associations with Eurocentric and racist
   stereotypes, as well as its seeming justification of colonial injustice.
   However, this paper argues that Montesquieu's political theory of
   climate warrants a reevaluation for at least three reasons. First, the
   theory is more complex than is often believed. Second, it makes more
   sense than is commonly held. Third, it prompts intriguing inquiries
   about the challenges of integrating scientific findings from diverse
   fields and about implications of the human factor in relation to climate
   change.},

   Second World War till 1981 when the PCM ceased to exist and fusions with
   some other Left groups within almost the Socialist Unificated Party of
   Mexico. The author focuses, above all, on the analysis of the degree of
   independence and autonomy of the PCM's attitude toward Moscow taking as
   the main points of research the attitudes of the PCM over the
   Sino-Soviet rupture within the International Communist movement, the
   issue of the invasion into Checoslovakia and supposed evolution of the
   PCM toward ``Eurocommunist{''} ideas. Based on the documents of the
   International Department of the CC of the CPSU kept in Moscow and some
   published memories of the militants of the PCM, the author recover this
   aspect of the Party History which is not well-researched in the existing
   historiography.},

Abstract = {Many political theorists believe that a state cannot be neutral when it
   comes to languages. Legislatures cannot avoid picking a language in
   which to conduct their business and teachers have to teach their pupils
   in a language. However, against that, some political liberals argue that
   liberal neutrality is consistent with the state endorsement of
   particular languages. Claims to the contrary, they say, are based on a
   misguided understanding of what neutrality is. I will argue that this
   line of argument fails, for two reasons. First, the primary challenge to
   which political liberals should respond is not that of reconciling the
   promotion of languages with liberal neutrality but, rather, that of
   reconciling liberal neutrality with the fact that reasonable people
   disagree about the existence and nature of languages. Second, even if
   everyone accepted the existence of languages along essentialist lines,
   one should still doubt the possibility of state neutrality with respect
   to them, regardless of the conception of neutrality one prefers. The
   reason why is that human beings cannot care about or value languages so
   when a state promotes a particular language, it is not supporting the
   preferences of its citizens but, rather, acting on perfectionist or
   simply irrational grounds.},

Abstract = {Parliamentary oversight of executive power is a parliamentary system
   concern, considering weaker ex-post institutional oversight mechanisms
   and actor incentive challenges. Yet, institutional options are
   precondition for making parliamentary ex-post oversight work and this
   article investigates which type of options in fact exists within the
   vital committee system and how they are designed. The expectation is
   that ex-post oversight options depend on distributional power
   structures, being stronger for systems with traditions for minority
   compared to majority governments. For the design, the expectation is an
   institutional `efficient' outcome in terms of ex-post oversight options
   being placed in a controlled central oversight committee, and that this
   applies regardless of government traditions. Empirically, focus is on
   the five most similar Nordic state parliamentary cases that vary in
   committee settings and in government traditions. For the investigation
   focus is on specific ex-post oversight options, the design of these
   options and overall de-facto use. The findings show a clear difference
   between the Scandinavian minority cases and the Icelandic and Finnish
   majority cases. For the design, most cases have ex-post oversight
   options designed for specific oversight committees, but where the Danish
   Folketing deviates by providing several options in different committees.},

Abstract = {Many see the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, as a new Tony Blair, taking
   the party rightward to gain electability. However, Labour under Starmer
   has advanced a politics of anti-neoliberalism like that of Jeremy Corbyn
   and John McDonnell. As Shadow Chancellor, McDonnell developed a critique
   of neoliberalism which he holds responsible for widening inequality, the
   2008 financial crash and its aftermath. Key members of Starmer's Shadow
   Cabinet agree with this diagnosis and have advanced similar ideas to
   reform neoliberalism, embracing a decentralised, communitarian socialism
   which involves large-scale structural reform. Whilst Shadow ministers'
   politics of anti-neoliberalism has been rendered more culturally
   conservative by recent populist victories, it reveals fundamental
   continuities between Corbyn's and Starmer's Labour in a shared
   scepticism of globalisation. Labour under Starmer is best understood as
   a party aspiring to restructure an economic model perceived to have
   failed. In that sense, it differs markedly from New Labour.},

Abstract = {The article explores the problematic issues that arise between Bollywood
   films projecting homosexual relationships and the Central Board of Film
   Certification (CBFC) filtering their contents. Queer popular cultural
   representations in India face challenges to get release certification
   because of their inherently debatable contents including `non-normative'
   sexual relationships which are largely identified as a potential threat
   to the existing heteronormative, majoritarian culture. By giving
   reference to two queer films, Unfreedom and Angry Indian Goddesses, this
   article explores the politics of censorship in the light of Foucauldian
   power relations and the discourse of knowledge production. I argue that
   by proscribing representations of queer sexualities in films, the CBFC
   has acted on behalf of the state in decelerating the formation and
   proliferation of a counter cultural movement to balance homophobia
   discursively and to peddle majoritarian power politics, and thus the
   notion of heterosexuality as compulsory form of sexual behaviour is
   popularized and consolidated in Indian society.},

Title = {Regime Support and Gender Quotas in Autocracies},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 10},
Abstract = {Gender quotas are increasingly being adopted by autocrats in part to
   legitimize their rule. Yet, even in autocracies, these quotas increase
   women's political representation. It thus stands to reason that public
   support for gender quotas in autocracies might be shaped by this
   trade-off between advancing women's rights and granting the regime
   legitimacy. All else equal, regime opponents should be less supportive
   of gender quotas in autocracies, wary of legitimizing the regime. We
   uncover evidence of this proposition in an analysis of region-wide Arab
   Barometer surveys and a survey experiment in Algeria. We also find that
   evaluations of this trade-off are conditioned by other demographics,
   with women, gender egalitarians, and Islamists remaining more consistent
   in their support for/opposition to gender quotas regardless of regime
   gains. Overall, our findings suggest that gender quotas in autocracies
   are viewed through a political lens, creating a potential backlash
   toward women's empowerment.},

Abstract = {Despite an extraordinary degree of political turbulence in the UK, the
   2021 Scottish and Welsh election results were remarkably similar to
   those recorded at the previous elections in 2016. While this period
   spanned the 2016 EU referendum, Britain's exit from the EU, and the
   coronavirus pandemic, these upheavals appear to have had little impact
   on devolved election results. From a comparative perspective, however,
   such continuity only underlines the extent to which these nations'
   political trajectories have diverged since the establishment of
   devolution in 1999. Using individual-level survey data from twelve
   election studies over two decades, we show how changing patterns in the
   relationship between national identity and party support have driven
   these differing trajectories. In doing so, we provide the first
   comparative analysis of voting over time in both countries.
   Additionally, we show how national identity helps to sustain
   single-party dominance in Scotland and Wales.},

Abstract = {The central puzzle of persuasion is why a receiver would listen to a
   sender who they know is trying to change their beliefs or behavior. This
   article summarizes five approaches to solving this puzzle: (1) some
   messages are easier to send for those with favorable information (costly
   signaling), (2) the sender and receiver have common interest, (3) the
   sender messages are verifiable information, (4) the sender cares about
   their reputation for competence/honesty, and (5) the sender can commit
   to a messaging strategy (often called `Bayesian Persuasion'). After
   reviewing these approaches with common notation, I discuss which provide
   insight into prominent empirical findings on campaigns, partisan media,
   and lobbying. While models focusing on commitment have rapidly become
   prominent (if not dominant) in the recent theoretical literature on
   persuasion in political science and economics, the insights they provide
   are primarily technical, and are not particularly well-suited to
   explaining most of these phenomena.},

Abstract = {This essay focuses on Huseyin Cevahir, a revolutionary with roots in the
   Alevite-Kurdish formation and one of the forgotten student leaders of
   `68 in Turkey. The essay underscores Cevahir's presence within the
   Turkish Left as not merely a matter of cultural difference. On the
   contrary, his silent but transformative effects on the Turkish Left
   stemmed from his subaltern presence, embodied in a double memory.
   Cevahir incorporated his knowledge of the racialized community of
   Dersim, in which he was born, into his intellectual awareness,
   undermining any sovereign subjectivization under the pretext of the
   universality of the state. Simultaneously, his subaltern experiences
   helped him to transfigure the racial structures of domination that
   shaped the political imaginary of middle-class subjectivity among
   revolutionary Turkish youth under the pretext of class universality. One
   can thus infer that the main factor behind Cevahir's oblivion in the
   counterpublic in Turkey is this double criticism embodied in his
   persona.},

Title = {Presidential power and bargaining complexity in the party selection of
   Italian heads of state, 1948-2022},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ITALIAN POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3, SI},

Abstract = {Among political scientists, presidents in parliamentary democracies have
   received little attention as compared to their popularly elected
   counterparts. Yet, there is evidence of influential heads of state
   beyond semi-presidential and presidential systems, and the Italian one
   is a case in point. Scholars agree that the `informal power' of Italian
   presidents has grown substantially since the early 1990s, due to the
   combination of weak party organisations, the personalisation of
   politics, and the mediatisation of the presidency. While the literature
   shows that the choice of the president has become more salient for
   parties, hardly anything is known about the impact that the increased
   presidential power has on the complexity of the selection process. This
   article argues that, when presidents are powerful, parties face high
   adverse selection costs and, therefore, party leaders will be less
   likely to compromise on candidates. This, in turn, can lead to political
   stalemates. Using a novel measure of bargaining complexity, the
   empirical analysis supports this argument, which holds also after
   controlling for the contingent features of the parliamentary party
   set-up. The findings have implications for the study of political
   leaders and party behaviour at a time of party government decline.},

Title = {Special Interests in Foreign Policy Bureaucracies: Evidence from Foreign
   Aid},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 1},
Abstract = {Effective foreign policy necessitates a well-functioning bureaucracy.
   However, many states fragment foreign policy authority to bureaucratic
   actors with little interest or expertise in foreign affairs, such as
   labor, agricultural, and commerce ministries. This is especially common
   in foreign aid, where research suggests that fragmentation can be
   deleterious. Why do some states allow their foreign aid bureaucracy to
   become fragmented? I suggest that the fragmentation of the foreign aid
   bureaucracy results from domestic distributive politics. Leaders
   building electoral coalitions can fragment aid to many projects,
   programs, and bureaucracies to satisfy special interests. Using a novel
   coding of a bureaucracy-level foreign aid data set, I find that
   institutions incentivizing distributive politics increase aid
   fragmentation and that nontraditional aid bureaucracies are more open to
   distributive politics. I also qualitatively trace the theoretical
   mechanisms using a case of UK foreign aid. I find that special interests
   benefit from the existence and empowerment of nontraditional aid
   bureaucracies.},

Title = {Ius post bellum, positive peace and democratic memory: A
   theoretical framework for memory policies in Spain},

Abstract = {The academic reflection about peacebuilding and peacekeeping connects
   with theories such as the ius post bellum, which is a normative
   framework that connects with transitional justice and democratic memory.
   This paper proposes an encounter between these approaches. We analyze
   the extension of each concept, the points of intersection and
   differences. Finally, we move towards an incipient synthesis, as a
   contribution to the debate about the principles underlying the public
   policies of memory, peace, and human rights, in the context of
   implementation of the democratic memory law in Spain. For that purpose,
   this paper proposes to link three areas of study: the ius post bellum,
   the -transitional and transformative- justice and democratic memory. All
   this, in application perspective to manage the context of post-conflict
   situations and transition processes towards democratic systems after
   dictatorship scenarios, taking into account the Spanish case. In
   essence, the core of the article supports the utility of the ius post
   bellum theory -in a transformative and not merely restorative reading-
   for the normative foundation of public policies of democratic memory.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the short-term impact of the Russian invasion
   of Ukraine on Europeans' attitudes toward democracy. For this purpose,
   we leverage the coincidence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on
   February 24, 2022 with the fieldwork of the European Social Survey in 10
   countries. By means of an unexpected event during survey design, we
   analyze the impact of the invasion on 12 different attitudes toward
   democracy, including overt support for democracy, satisfaction with
   democracy, as well as the importance attributed to particular democratic
   principles. The results of this comprehensive analysis reveal that the
   invasion did not have a substantive impact on individuals' attitudes
   toward democracy. The invasion of a neighboring democratic country by an
   autocratic power did not alter Europeans' satisfaction with democracy,
   their support for this political regime, or the importance they
   attribute to different democratic principles.},

Abstract = {The object of the research was to consider the methods of protection of
   people's rights according to the administrative procedural order and
   also in administrative judicial proceedings.A number of normative legal
   acts regulating the use of tools for the protection of subjective public
   rights were considered. Attention has been drawn to the following
   methods of protection of people's rights, according to the
   administrative-procedural order and in administrative judicial
   proceedings: administrative procedure; administrative mediation;
   administrative appeal; subjecting guilty public administration officials
   to special disciplinary liability; compensation for damage caused by
   unlawful actions (inaction) of public administration entities; means of
   self-defense and legal means of protest. The methodological basis of the
   research was presented as comparative-legal and systematic analysis,
   formal-legal method, method of interpretation, hermeneutic method, as
   well as methods of analysis and synthesis. It was concluded that in the
   scientific literature it is very often the case that protection methods
   are not used, but tools, means and forms. The authors also examine the
   methods of protection of rights, freedoms and interests of individuals
   in the sphere of public administration.},

Abstract = {In Mexico, the LXIV Legislature of the Chamber of Deputies was called
   the legislature of gender parity, as it was the first to be composed of
   parity. Therefore, it is interesting to analyze the posi-tion of its
   members regarding gender parity and to verify its impact on the
   perception of democ-racy. Based on the \& DLANGBRAC;Parliamentary Elites
   \& drangbrac; survey, an index is created for each male and female
   legislator and provides information on their profile in favor of gender
   parity; the index is contrasted with questions about the perception of
   the stability of democracy, satisfaction with its functioning, as well
   as with the creation of a women's caucus and the elaboration of laws
   that develop the principle of equality. The results indicate a position
   in favor of gender parity responds positively in the previously
   mentioned contrasts. A Categorical Principal Component Analysis was
   applied, so that the variables are not chosen discretionally and allow
   capturing the essence of the variations in the data obtained from a
   survey that offers anonymous information.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the historical context of the emergence of human
   rights from the French Revolution and the Enlightenment to the
   International Bill of Human Rights, including the Universal Declaration
   of Human Rights and its covenants. Regional law in Europe and America
   are also analyzed to understand the context of human rights in these
   regions; and we look specifically at Portugal and Brazil, the countries
   focused on this study. Subsequently, some criticisms are made of the
   universalist, abstract, de-historicized and de-contextualized nature of
   the mainstream conception of human rights. The mainstream approach to
   human rights, by incorporating an abstract subject (man -white -western)
   for the recognition of rights, has had a history of successive
   exclusions and oppressions of people who do not fall on the category of
   ``man{''}, ``white{''} and ``western{''}. Nowadays, this platform has
   also been used by some groups of people, specifically by some trans
   people and/or collectives organized in favor of their rights. This
   article ends with a multicultural conception of human rights, as a
   theoretical and political proposal capable of intelligibly framing the
   realities of trans people. The meanings of rights need to be constantly
   monitored for the effective recognition of trans people's autonomy.},

Abstract = {The rise of subversive religious beliefs has been recently documented as
   related to the politico-economic radicalization of places that feel left
   behind. When is the traditional local religious institution so
   socio-economically inefficient in providing hope for ``not walking
   alone{''} to become substituted by subversive religious beliefs on the
   market for hope? This article suggests a detailed methodology, linking
   micro and macro levels, that starts from the quantification of the
   individual gain from religion as a source for well -being by providing
   the feeling of ``not walking alone.{''} This micro gain is next used:
   (i) to evaluate a religious institution in terms of the social welfare
   that it generates, and (ii) to monitor this religious institution for
   losing its market to subversive religious beliefs, related to radical
   politico-economic transformations. To illustrate this methodology, I
   analyze the socio-economic efficiency of the Church of England as a
   predictive tool for the Brexit vote.},

Abstract = {This essay reviews three recent books that address a range of policy
   issues currently affecting politics in Aotearoa New Zealand. Dominic
   O'Sullivan's Sharing the Sovereign illustrates how treaties between
   states and Indigenous peoples can provide the basis for power-sharing
   arrangements across various spheres of public policy. Paul Spoonley's
   The New New Zealand outlines the profound immigration-driven demographic
   changes experienced in recent decades and the failures of
   decision-makers to adjust to this new reality. Max Rashbrooke's Too Much
   Money analyses the issue of social class in New Zealand and the dangers
   of an apparently increasing class divide. The essay outlines some of
   these arguments in detail and evaluates each contribution to both
   scholarship and actual public policy debates as New Zealand arguably
   enters a more contentious political moment.},

Abstract = {Norway's geopolitical position as both a neighbour of Russia and a
   member of NATO places it at the forefront of Moscow's self-assertive and
   aggressive foreign and security policy. However, Norway's NATO
   membership reduces Russia's room for manoeuvre to actions below the
   threshold of armed conflict. In this article, Runar Spansvoll examines
   how Russia has made use of such aggressive and coercive sub-threshold
   activities in the political, information and military domains between
   2014-23 in a campaign to compel Oslo to comply with its foreign and
   security policy objectives.},

Title = {A Sami land-claims settlement? Assessing Norway's Finnmark Act in a

Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The Sami, the Indigenous peoples of Fennoscandia, assert ownership-,
   use-, and management-rights to their traditional lands. Norway's 2005
   Finnmark Act is the only legislation so far to broadly respond to those
   assertions. How to interpret the act has long been contested, and is now
   the subject of a legal case before Norway's Supreme Court. Despite
   parallels between the land-rights assertions of Sami and those of
   Indigenous peoples elsewhere, and despite abundant legislation
   responding to Indigenous land-rights assertions elsewhere, the Finnmark
   Act has seldom been analyzed comparatively. In this article, we study
   the act against the backdrop of Indigenous land-claims settlements in
   Canada-the state where such legislation is most institutionalized. We
   find the Finnmark Act features many of the same institutional and
   procedural elements as Canadian settlements. However, we also find that
   in Norway those elements have been legally integrated, and practically
   implemented, in a different and less coherent way, rendering the act
   dysfunctional. We conclude by drawing lessons from the Canadian example
   to prescribe adjustments to the understanding and ongoing implementation
   of the Finnmark Act, to potentially put the accommodation of Sami
   land-rights on a smoother path.},

Title = {Welfare as flourishing social reproduction: Polish and Ukrainian migrant
   workers in a market-participation society},
Journal = {GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {282-301},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The historical link between labour and welfare is increasingly
   considered in the transnational register, largely because labour
   mobilities demand a rethinking of nation-based social protection
   systems. Transnational labour mobilities also illuminate other
   dimensions of boundary-crossing, including formality-informality,
   citizenship-non-citizenship and production-reproduction. These
   additional considerations call for going beyond the problem of
   transnational welfare access. We argue that the prism of social
   reproduction enables such a rethinking of the labour-welfare
   relationship. In this article, we conceptualise an expanded notion of
   welfare as flourishing social reproduction, in contradistinction to the
   principle of welfare deriving primarily from paid work and labour market
   participation. We apply this theorisation of welfare to our qualitative
   case study of the experiences and interests of Polish and Ukrainian
   migrant workers in Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom employed in
   care provision, food production and housing construction sectors. In the
   geopolitical setting of uneven and combined Europe, embodying high
   levels of differentiation together with advanced transnational social
   protection, we explore the role of differentiation of migrants in labour
   markets (along work, migration and citizenship axes) and the extent to
   which transnational mobility facilitates the improvement of social
   reproduction. While the low-waged labour of Polish and Ukrainian men and
   women working in care, food and housing furnishes their own and local
   workers' social reproduction needs, we find that migrant workers'
   welfare as flourishing social reproduction remains wanting, even for
   those with already privileged access to the current `gold-standard'
   transnational social protection offered by the EUs freedoms of movement
   framework. Welfare remains centred on individualised paid work logic,
   leaving a vast range of needs unmet and work and workers excluded,
   bearing implications for prevalent transnational social protection
   efforts.},

Abstract = {How does witnessing regime atrocities influence the political attitudes
   of bystanders? We argue that observing regime violence against innocent
   civilians triggers psychological dissonance between beliefs about the
   regime and the witnessed moral transgression. As a result, regime
   support should decrease among bystanders of state atrocities. We analyze
   original, highly disaggregated archival data from the Nazi death marches
   at the end of World War II, which confronted ordinary German citizens
   with the regime's crimes. We find that locations with higher victim
   numbers had lower vote shares for right-wing nationalist parties after
   the war. Supporting our proposed mechanism, we show that (1) this effect
   was strongest when Nazi crimes were at the center of public discourse
   and (2) that witnessing Nazi atrocities was associated with individuals'
   rejection of Hitler 20 years later. The findings have implications for
   understanding democratization prospects and people's nostalgia for
   fallen autocrats.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the reformulations of citizenship, positive peace
   and democracy of both contemporary feminist theory and the feminist
   movement. In doing so, it will explain the interrelationship between the
   feminist movement as a democratic movement and its proposals for
   reformulating concepts and ideas that make up what we can call the
   ``grammar of politics{''}. Following Seyla Benhabib, the ``democratic
   iterations{''} that have been achieved in the framework of human rights
   will be presented, giving some examples at national and international
   levels. Finally, the changes and challenges in women's demands for
   rights in current scenarios will be analysed.},

Abstract = {Considering formative twentieth-century theories in relation to
   contemporary technosocial developments, this article examines ideas of
   spectacle and surveillance as ways of approaching visual politics. I
   argue that the historically important relationship between the visual
   and political fields is now intensifying and mutating. First discussing
   Guy Debord's The Society of the Spectacle, I show how his influential
   approach proves inadequate to the politics of image-saturated societies.
   I next show how critics of imperial and racial spectacles, from Michael
   Rogin to Claudia Rankine and Tina Campt, provide better ways of engaging
   power and political contestation in the visual field. Third, I examine
   how Michel Foucault deployed notions of spectacle in his own work but
   argued for leaving the term behind, presenting surveillance as not just
   a different modality of power but also spectacle's temporal successor.
   This account remains essential for both historical understanding and
   reckoning with contemporary surveillance. Fourth, however, as Simone
   Browne argues, Foucault's separation between spectacle and surveillance
   is too stark, his history too prone to occlude race. Furthermore, recent
   surveillance technologies and practices have changed in ways that
   confound his terms, while extending and also altering the racial
   dynamics explored earlier in the essay. Today, even surveillance based
   on optical media contributes to a ``postvisual{''} image world in which
   algorithmic, machine-machine communication abets forms of power neither
   tied to human perception nor graspable as subject formation. With
   surprising assistance from Debord, I end by discussing the significant
   theoretical and political challenges posed by the ironies of postvisual
   visuality.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {279-298},
Abstract = {Cognitive appraisal theory predicts that emotions affect participation
   decisions around risky collective action. However, little existing
   research has attempted to parse out the mechanisms by which this process
   occurs. We build a global game of regime change and discuss the effects
   that fear may have on participation through pessimism about the state of
   the world, other players' willingness to participate, and risk aversion.
   We test the behavioral effects of fear in this game by conducting 32
   sessions of an experiment in two labs where participants are randomly
   assigned to an emotion induction procedure. In some rounds of the game,
   potential mechanisms are shut down to identify their contribution to the
   overall effect of fear. Our results show that in this context, fear does
   not affect willingness to participate. This finding highlights the
   importance of context, including integral versus incidental emotions and
   the size of the stakes, in shaping effect of emotions on behavior.},

Abstract = {Through an analysis of the Israeli case, this paper explains why states
   add superfluous provisions that facilitate naturalization processes
   after military service. The Israeli Citizenship Law states that military
   service in Israel will confer exemptions from the list of requirements
   toward naturalization. Amendments in 1987 and 2004 and 35 proposed
   revisions also link military service with citizenship in Israel. I argue
   that those provisions were enacted mainly for symbolic reasons.
   Republicanism is not just a characteristic of a particular polity but a
   rhetorical trope for politicians in that state. In Israel, politicians
   wanted to emphasize the importance of republican participation,
   particularly through military service, as the ultimate sacrifice in
   constructing national identity.},

Abstract = {Two important puzzles characterize the development of pre-modern
   Eurasian polities. First, most rulers convened councils of nobles, but
   only European monarchs expanded them to create parliaments. Second, war
   was common throughout Eurasia, but only in Europe did it correlate with
   the formation of parliaments. We advance a new argument about the
   emergence of parliaments that accounts for both stylized facts while
   integrating the literature highlighting the rulers' need to finance wars
   with that emphasizing the importance of the medieval communal
   revolution. Using novel data, we document a `no communes, no
   parliaments' rule: monarchs established parliaments only after they had
   fostered the creation of self-governing towns (aka communes). We also
   show that war was a significant predictor of parliamentary births across
   medieval Europe - but only during a window of opportunity that opened
   after a polity had experienced the communal revolution.},

Abstract = {The start of the twenty-first century saw many changes in the way war
   was being conducted. Alongside war at sea, in the air, and on land,
   there is now psychological warfare (referred to as psywar), which has
   proven to be an extremely powerful military dimension. The power of
   psychological warfare is a result of the revolution in information and
   communication in the first years of the current century: the Internet,
   instant global communications, smartphones, and social media. All these
   channels have become arenas for warfare and powerful influencers on
   leaders, militaries, and entire populations. Historically, democracies
   have been reticent about employing psychological warfare for a number of
   reasons, but in recent years, they have been unable to ignore its
   existence and have increasingly been making use of it. However, in
   contrast with other forms of warfare for which there are international
   ethical rules, there is no ethical regulation of psychological warfare.
   This article assesses the challenges and dilemmas facing democratic
   countries in their use of psychological warfare and for the first time
   offers proposals for ethical rules toward that end by way of an Israeli
   test case: the long-term use of psychological warfare by the Israel
   Defense Forces.},

Abstract = {Although a growing body of research addresses the role of religion in
   the political engagement of Muslims, a dearth of studies scrutinizes
   whether intersecting power dynamics (i.e., gender and religion) shape
   Muslims' political participation. In this study, we apply an
   intersectional approach to study whether religious indicators (mosque
   attendance, religious salience, and religious discrimination) shape the
   (gendered) participatory patterns of Muslims. Drawing on ESS data of six
   countries (Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, UK, and France), we
   find religious attendance to dampen and religious salience to heighten
   Muslims' nonelectoral participation. Religious discrimination seems to
   have no effect. Although Muslims' religiosity is gendered, our study
   finds no effects hereof on political participation. Further research
   unraveling the motivations of Muslims' noninstitutionalized forms of
   participation is encouraged.},

   Effects of Oppression: Prussia, Political Catholicism, and the
   Alternative fur Deutschland and tests that article's thesis about the
   long-term effects of the Kulturkampf ({''}culture struggle{''}) on the
   voting behaviour of Catholic voters today. We offer an alternative
   explanation for the finding that the voting behaviour of Catholics with
   regard to the Alternative for Germany party (AfD) varies regionally
   between former Prussian and former non-Prussian areas. Our explanation
   focuses on differences in the programmatic-ideological position of the
   federal and state Christian Democratic Union associations and the
   Christian Social Union in the 2017 and 2021 federal elections. We find
   empirical evidence consistent with this alternative explanation, while
   the ``Kulturkampf thesis{''} is not confirmed upon closer examination.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to find in Hannah Arendt's thought indications
   to think about the deconstruction of citizenship. Bearing in mind that
   this challenge implies breaking the original acceptance of citizenship
   with the Nation-State, we propose an interpretative path that is
   enriched by critique. That is why we begin by making room for the
   observations made by Judith Butler regarding the postulate of the right
   to have rights, and the apparent sharp Arendtian division of private and
   public space. Then, we will go through the dissonances highlighted by
   Ana Paula Penchaszadeh, who, through the work of Jacques Derrida,
   exhibits keys to reflect on hospitality in politics and the
   impossibility of finding in Arendt plausible arguments to be adhered to
   the deconstruction of citizenship. Nevertheless, our conclusion
   distances itself from the Argentine thinker's considerations and argues
   that the vitality of politics implies visibility, as the only possible
   way to fight in the public space for the principle of the right to have
   rights, guaranteed by the birth event.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the work of Luciano Parinetto, this paper presents the
   identity of the witch both as the basis of capitalist exploitation and
   as a remedy that gives to different kinds of subjectivities an antidote
   to the toxic alienation of their desires. Parinetto's idea of a utopia
   of witches acts as a perpetual imaginary revolution against all
   mechanisms of subjugation that seek to prevent the inevitable
   ``hexification{''} (streghizzazione) initiated in the name of a diverse
   and horizontal community that is always disturbed and animated by the
   restless presence of the uncanny body of a new diabolic plurality.
   Nevertheless, without a process of self -identification, the very
   existence of witches will not fully ensure that the full possession and
   vital complexity of their own ``devilish{''} impulses have the concrete
   power to rebel against the capitalist exploitation of these new and
   liberated desires.},

Abstract = {This article presents the modus operandi of a game, the so-called Game
   of Shapes, which can be used as an active learning tool to teach
   Constructivism to introductory International Relations courses. While
   sharing our own experience of the development and application of the
   game in a laboratory with International Relations students, this paper
   aims to provide a teaching template that can assist in the
   problematization of the statist and individualistic ontology of
   rationalist theories. Hence it is an interactive dynamic that helps to
   introduce and open up the discussion of the contingency of the social
   world, which is the base to understand any of the several and intricate
   tenets of Constructivism and any other critical approaches. Most of the
   students' feedbacks were very positive regarding their comprehension of
   the content presented. They provided important feedback on how the
   activity was valuable in order to grasp complex concepts, important to
   constructivist theories in International Relations.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Do reserved seats yield substantive representation for traditionally
   marginalized groups? To answer that question, we turn to a remarkable
   and little-studied institution: reserved seats for Native American
   tribes in the Maine House of Representatives. Tribal representatives,
   who can participate in debate but lack a vote, have represented tribes
   in Maine's House of Representatives since statehood in 1820. We take
   advantage of a 1995 rule change that allowed tribal representatives to
   initiate legislation, and an original dataset of pro-tribal bills, to
   estimate the effect of reserved seats on the production of pro-tribal
   bills. We find that once tribal representatives were allowed to write
   bills, they produced over half of all tribal-related legislation during
   a 36-year period. Legislators with tribal constituents sponsored fewer
   relevant bills after the reform but continued to cosponsor pro-tribal
   legislation. Although our results show tribal representatives contribute
   to the legislative process, we caution that reserved seats are not a
   panacea for improving Indigenous representation.},

Abstract = {The Global Justice Index is a multiyear research project based at Fudan
   Institute for Advanced Study in Social Sciences that assesses the
   contributions made by each country to achieving greater global justice.
   We have published results from 2010 to 2019 in Global Justice Index
   Report, Global Justice Index Report 2020, Global Justice Index Report
   2021, and we are now presenting our fourth-year results for 2020 in
   Global Justice Index Report 2022, which is an updated version of
   previous years' reports. This year, we take into account changes to
   global justice influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The report consists
   of four sections: introduction, findings, main results, and conclusion.
   In the introduction, we discuss the development of the conceptual
   framework and evaluative principles to justify our selection of the
   dimensions and indicators for measurement. Next, in the findings
   section, we report the data, indicators, and our results for each
   country for each of the 10 issues we identify, and provide regional
   comparisons for Asia, Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, and
   Oceania. In the following section, we present the main results for the
   global justice indices, and report the ranking of each country's
   contribution to achieving greater global justice. In the final section,
   we discuss the applications and limitations of the index and potential
   further research trajectories.},

Abstract = {Whether educational attainment compensates for or reinforces family
   disadvantages in political participation is currently a debated topic.
   Previous research has shown a consistent relationship between social
   origin and political participation in Western societies: individuals
   originating from low-socioeconomic-status families participate in
   politics less than those from high-socioeconomic-status families, which
   violates the democratic requirement of equality of political voice. In
   this paper, we investigate whether secondary education compensates for
   or reinforces the political inequality shaped by social origin. We used
   a German representative sample of 1012 identical twins aged 21-25 and
   applied family fixed effects regression models, which allowed us to
   control for measured and unmeasured social and genetic confounding. We
   found a positive effect of educational attainment on participation,
   which is most likely causal. Family disadvantage resulting from low
   parental education is compensated for by children finishing the academic
   track (Gymnasium) as opposed to the lower vocational track
   (Hauptschule). At the same time, family advantage originating from high
   parental occupational status is reinforced for children completing the
   academic track. We found no advantage nor disadvantage, compensation nor
   reinforcement, related to parental income. We conclude that compensation
   and reinforcement of family disadvantage may remain unnoticed if
   components of parental SES are not distinguished.},

Abstract = {Despite the marked transformation in E. Asia's financial systems,
   regulators continue to employ hard paternalistic approaches to their
   stock markets that are viewed as counterproductive to their development.
   This article argues that the persistence of hard paternalistic
   regulatory practices can be explained by a regulatory vision-a common
   analytical framework to order complex uncertain environments that serve
   as regulatory first principles-centered on an irrational investor. A
   regulatory vision works alongside pressures emanating from foreign
   investment, state capitalism, and state-business relations. This
   understanding of investor rationality is in marked contrast to a liberal
   market variant, which emphasizes a rational investor, and thus provides
   a distinctive comparative lens to understand regulatory behavior in a
   moment of global financial hybridization. The study draws on over 90
   elite interviews of senior regulators, stock exchange officers, and
   market practitioners conducted in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, from
   2015 to 2019.},

Abstract = {The essay presents an exploratory study of the equub, a form of
   community-based finance that is well-established in the Ethiopian
   diaspora in Germany. Equubs render visible the financial expertise
   developed in the majority world and its circulation in diasporic space.
   As such, equubs exemplify the power of People of African Descent in
   Germany to organize against financial exclusion. The essay draws on the
   theory of diverse economies and its method of reading for difference to
   analyze the characteristics of the equub as a nonmarket financial
   institution, showing its praxis of building community economies and its
   linkages to the diverse economy at large. Processes of
   decommodification, collective governance, and ethical decision making
   around financial needs politicize finance, making the equub an
   interesting case of a postcapitalist-finance imaginary.},

Abstract = {We examine a phenomenon we call ``credit claiming by labeling{''} in
   which a sitting politician places her name on a project, program, or
   policy with the goal of claiming credit for it. While the prevalence of
   this practice suggests that many politicians believe that credit
   claiming by labeling will aid their careers, there is little existing
   evidence on this question. We examine the effects of credit claiming by
   labeling with a survey experiment in Argentina. We find that it has a
   negative, though small, effect on respondents' attitudes. Descriptive
   data suggests that these results stem from the perceived pervasiveness
   of the practice. We then use evidence from an additional treatment on
   the (un)biased selection of program beneficiaries to show that
   respondents actually reward politicians who neither label nor manipulate
   programs. These results suggest substantial obstacles to overturning
   citizens' negative baseline beliefs about the politicized implementation
   of government programs.},

Title = {Pork versus Policy: Experimental Evidence on Majoritarian Bargaining
   with Real-World Consequences},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 1},
Abstract = {Pork barrel politics has long attracted controversy; difficult to prove
   and vigorously denied by those accused of it, the practice is
   nevertheless defended by others who argue that pork facilitates
   compromise. We design a novel field-in-the-lab experiment to study how
   legislators bargain over pork and real-world policy. We first introduce
   a new incentivized method to measure subjects' ideological peak
   preferences and attitudinal strength. Subjects then bargain over a
   two-dimensional agenda: a donation to a political interest group and the
   division of a sum of money. Consistent with our theoretical model, we
   find that subjects trade off monetary and policy considerations.
   Subjects who are in the ideological majority and who prefer status quo
   policies extract better bargains, but minorities gain most from the
   possibility of compromise afforded by two dimensions. Finally, we show
   that artificially induced preferences fail to fully capture the
   bargaining dynamics observed using naturally occurring preferences.},

Abstract = {After twenty years of Putin's rule, Russia has become a full-fledged
   autocracy, with regional governors subordinate to the federal center,
   serving as agents of the president-principal. The country thus provides
   vivid empirical evidence for agency relations between the national
   leader and regional elites in a multi-level autocracy. This study
   focuses on the relationship between the federal center and regions after
   the 2012 revival of the direct gubernatorial election in Russia. It
   argues that within the general political contract, different
   principal-agent relationships coexist between the Kremlin and regional
   governors. Combining the problems of information asymmetry and goal
   conflict, discussed in the principal-agent theory, this article
   formulates theoretical expectations for four agency relations, with
   three of them having empirical evidence in Russia. It also shows that
   for each type of agency relations the president-principal develops a
   toolkit to handle the agents, which is based on repression, co-optation,
   and legitimation.},

Abstract = {Globalisation, as a strategy of rupture of the material relationship
   between the Constitution and the Social State form, has generated an
   erosion of the legitimising assumptions of state sovereignty of social
   constitutionalism in terms of depoliticisation. However, the multiple
   crises experienced by the globalising strategy, with particular
   reference to health, seem to have consolidated a revisionist discourse
   based on the revaluation of state sovereignty. Precisely, the aim of
   this paper is to analyse whether the health pandemic has led to a new
   context that makes possible the return of the state as a response to the
   problems of legitimisation posed by the global market order. To this
   end, the analysis will focus on the measures adopted by the European
   Union and its member states during the pandemic and post-pandemic
   phases. The special focus on the European order is due to the fact that
   it has given a normative nature to the structural principles of global
   market constitutionalism, being its most complete legal formulation. In
   parallel, the bulk of the reflection will be accompanied by the
   methodological premise of the material constitution for its explanatory
   force of the reality of the state form in the constitutional paradigm of
   the global market, diluting the mirages of constitutional politics and
   post-positivist-formalism.},

Abstract = {The Brazilian business community closely monitors national legislative
   process by way of interest groups. These organizations perform a
   sophisticated scrutiny and analysis of legislative propositions,
   classifying them according to the interests of the sectors they
   represent. In this article, using multivariate negative binomial
   regression, we assess and compare the impact of six factors on the
   behavior of Brazilian federal deputies in the 55th legislature
   (2015-2019) that may have prompted them to present bills classified as
   favorable to three business sectors: industry, agriculture, and
   commerce. The factors are: (i) campaign donations made by companies from
   these three sectors; (ii) the importance of each business sector as a
   source of jobs for the electorate; (iii) the ideological profile of each
   federal deputy; (iv) whether the federal deputy is an entrepreneur; (v)
   whether the parliamentarian belongs to standing committees that handle
   issues related to the three business sectors; and (vi) the
   parliamentarian's time in office. The results show that the introduction
   of favorable bills is strongly connected to the following factors: being
   a member of standing committees (committees that handle issues related
   to business sectors seem to attract more deputies in favor of these
   sectors), ideology (center and right-wing deputies present more
   favorable propositions than those on the left), and time in office
   (deputies with more time in office introduce a greater number of
   favorable projects). The evidence regarding the effect of the remaining
   three factors is mixed, as they seem to matter more to some business
   sectors than others.},

Abstract = {Taiwan's opposition to PRC demands such as acceptance of the `92
   Consensus' and `One Country, Two Systems' formula since 2016 has invited
   a series of retaliatory measures from Beijing, designed to coerce Taiwan
   into compliance. Given the stark asymmetry in economic size, military
   capability, and diplomatic status, Taiwan provides a case for studying
   coercive diplomacy that takes the form of threats to punish. Material
   differences suggest that Taiwan should capitulate, and `cheap talk'
   theses expect PRC threats to have no discernible effect, while balance
   of threat arguments expect resolve. In this article, we use the survey
   data collected in the 2016, 2019, and 2020 rounds of the Taiwan National
   Security Study to examine how Taiwanese respond to China's intensifying
   and expanding threats. Our paper identifies four strategies that the
   public sees as responses to PRC coercion: isolation, bandwagon with
   China, balance against China by allying with the USA and Japan, and
   hedge by deepening economic ties with China while aligning with the USA
   and Japan against China. We show that the popular support for balancing
   against China rises as PRC coercion grows and Taiwanese citizens
   increasingly perceive China to be a threat. Our findings imply that
   citizens in a liberal democracy can develop the will to pushback against
   pressure from an authoritarian regime despite sharp asymmetries in
   capabilities and material limitations.},

Abstract = {Clientelism is a widespread and persistent practice in Latin America
   with significant ramifications for political actors and systems. This
   paper analyses its impact upon ideological overlapping, which is one of
   the aspects of ideological competition that has received disparate
   levels of attention depending on the region of study. The hypothesis
   examined is that clientelism reduces the ideological differentiation of
   political parties because, firstly, a clientelist environment makes it
   difficult for political actors to use left/right categories, thereby
   contributing to a reduction in parties' ideological identities.
   Secondly, the use of clientelist practices by parties fosters
   ideological overlapping with other parties, given the lack of incentives
   for them to differentiate themselves ideologically from one another. To
   test this relationship, a multilevel regression analysis was performed
   of 86 Latin American parties since 2009.},

Abstract = {This article challenges the ``democratic backsliding{''} accounts of
   Turkey's recent regime trajectory that are conceptually premised on a
   neo-Weberian understanding of the relationship between the state and
   society/markets. It uses a ``modes of participation{''} (MOP) approach
   that is informed by a Gramscian theorization of the state-society
   complex. It is argued that Turkey's neo-liberal capitalist development
   during the Justice and Development Party (AKP) era has not been
   conducive to allowing for the formation of cohesive alliances in support
   of liberal democratic representation. Instead, the country's already
   oppressed and divided labour force has further been fragmented under the
   neo-liberal economic policy, while its middle and business classes have
   supported democracy only when it has been in their interest, and
   intellectuals have been co-opted. Hence, the way the AKP governs Turkey
   is not because of weak or ineffective state institutions. It is rather
   rooted in the structural tensions in Turkey's capitalist development
   that require the ruling elites' mediation through a variety of
   parliamentary and extra-parliamentary mechanisms of resource allocation
   to maintain their dominant position in the political arena.},

Abstract = {Why does the United States either continue to support or turn its back
   on a friendly dictator once that dictator is faced with internal
   uprisings? This study argues that a US president's decision to either
   remain loyal to or abandon dictators when they are in trouble ultimately
   depends on the preservation of acquired influence (PAI). This argument
   is tested by considering three crises in which the White House was faced
   with a choice between prolonging support or abandoning established
   alliances with Batista in Cuba (1956-1959), Mobutu in Zaire (1990-1991),
   and Mubarak in Egypt (2011). In all three case studies, the PAI argument
   is found to account for observed variations in US foreign policy toward
   friendly dictators in trouble.},

Abstract = {Over the decades, Middle Eastern security has been influenced by both
   strong regional and global security interdependence. Since the end of
   the Cold War, Washington has played a leading security role in the
   region, providing an extended nuclear umbrella for its allies in the
   Gulf Cooperation Council organization. However, the U.S. strategic pivot
   to the Asia-Pacific region and China's rising profile as a global power
   has set the Middle East's security dynamics again into flux. This
   article employs a regional security complex framework, paired with a
   realist theoretical lens, to analyze how the growing Sino-American
   rivalry is affecting Persian Gulf security by identifying the regional
   interests of these two powers and examining the emerging regional
   security dynamics.},

Abstract = {In the research on explaining public goods provision, political
   competition is usually linked with public goods provision and it is
   believed that political competition will have a positive or negative
   impact on public goods provision. However, others suggest that this
   relationship changes with the influence of other variables. This article
   which uses data analysis of 165 countries in 2013 to discuss the
   relationship between state capacity, political competition and public
   goods provision and its impact on public goods provision. The results
   show that public goods provision is good when there is only strong state
   capacity or a high level of political competition, or both. Then, the
   four cases of Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Laos are selected to
   illustrate the mechanism by which the interaction of state capacity and
   political competition affects public goods provision.},

Abstract = {This article is the first to show that gender shapes the degree to which
   legislators use formal mechanisms to oversee government activities.
   Extensive scholarly work has analysed the use of oversight instruments,
   especially regarding who monitors whom. Whether, how, and why the
   conformity of men and women with institutional roles differs, has not
   yet received scholarly attention. We hypothesise that women become more
   active than men in overseeing the executive when in opposition while
   reducing their monitoring activities even more strongly than men when in
   government because of different social roles ascribed to men and women
   as well as differences in risk aversity between sexes. We analyse panel
   data for three oversight tools from the German Bundestag between 1949
   and 2013 to test this proposition. Our findings imply that
   characteristics of political actors influence even a strongly
   institutionalised process as oversight and further clarify the gender
   bias in political representation.},

Abstract = {China's emergence as a key player in global politics and the declining
   role of the United States as a superpower are two greatest developments
   of the 21st century. This geopolitical transformation has compelled
   Washington to reconsider its traditional Eurocentric and Middle
   East-focused approach and shift strategic attention and resources to the
   Asia-Pacific region. In a bid to keep its superpower status, the United
   States is bolstering India as a bulwark against China. To balance
   China's growing influence, the United States has upgraded ties with
   India and other major players on China's periphery. The U.S-India
   strategic partnership is among the most visible result of these efforts.
   At the same time, this strategic realignment has serious consequences
   for regional stability in South Asia. India's military buildup rattles
   neighbors, particularly Pakistan, as it increases the risk of
   confrontation between the two nuclear-armed states. This changing
   strategic environment leaves Pakistan with no option but to look for new
   ways to maintain strategic equilibrium. This study provides an overview
   of the India-U.S. partnership and its impact on South Asian strategic
   stability. It also highlights various challenges Pakistan will likely
   face due to regional realignment and discusses possible options for
   Pakistan to maintain a favorable strategic equilibrium.},

Title = {The role of the Spanish university teaching staff in the new European
   model of higher education and the deployment of technology in teaching},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Number = {37},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Over the last decade, there has been a constant increase in regulations
   of various types that affect the tasks of university professors, as well
   as the extension of academic freedom as an individual freedom and, to a
   lesser extent, university autonomy. These limitations mainly affect the
   planning, organization and even decisions on content and teaching
   methodology. This paper identifies some of the main areas in which these
   limits are increasing, especially the deployment of the regulations that
   configure the European Higher Education Area in Spain. The continuous
   extension of the powers of organization of teaching that the
   institutions are obtaining from this regulation are, in most cases, to
   the detriment of the decision-making capacity of the teaching staff.
   Along with years of deployment of a multitude of technological
   possibilities and tools, their choice and implementation have also
   remained in the hands of universities, while teachers must usually adapt
   to those technologies that the institutions allow or force them to use.
   Once again, teachers' opportunities to choose the teaching methodology
   they use are mediatized. The text exposes the primacy with which the
   organizational powers of state, regional or even university institutions
   have been endowed, always in exchange for restricting teachers'
   individual academic freedom. I intend here to warn, in short, that the
   implementation of a modern university, consistent with the EHEA, does
   not mean and should not imply excessive imposition from public powers
   over professors: a prevention that is precisely the reason for the
   existence of academic freedom.},

Title = {Emission Reduction Tournament Would Postpone Carbon Peaking in China},
Journal = {CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {273-303},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The mitigation of climate change is one of the most serious issues in
   global public governance. To address the climate crisis, Chinese
   government has proposed a clear target of carbon peaking and carbon
   neutrality. Regional efforts are expected to play a key role in
   delivering China's pledge to peak CO2 emissions before 2030. However,
   the emission reduction tournament would result in rapid increases in
   emission transfers among provinces in China. If the current trend of
   provincial economic development and associated emission transfer mode
   remains unchanged, we forecast that 24 progressive provinces in China
   would peak their CO2 emissions before 2030, while 6 lagged provinces
   would peak later than 2030. However, if emission transfers were not
   existed, the nationwide carbon peaking time would be one year earlier
   and the corresponding carbon peaking level would be 13\% lower.
   Furthermore, compared to the situation in 2012, the emission transfer
   mode in 2017 would lead to a higher carbon peaking level, indicating
   that the switch to the emission transfer mode from 2012 to 2017 had
   increased the difficulty of carbon peaking in China. We suggest that the
   principle of common but differentiated responsibilities should be
   applied when decomposing the national carbon peaking targets into
   provinces, and China must avoid a tournament among local governments on
   carbon peaking.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates ruling parties' calculations in wartime
   legislative elections. The paper argues that ruling parties' strategies
   are shaped by opportunity structures and the party's desire to protect
   party insiders, rather than simply by considerations about
   `government-held' or `rebel-held' territory. Ruling parties may adopt
   several strategies: (1) ceding seats to popular opposition candidates,
   even in government-controlled territory; (2) allowing rebels to run on
   the ruling party's ticket; and (3) blatant electoral manipulation.
   Ruling parties may miscalculate, including about how much manipulation
   the population will countenance. The paper examines these dynamics
   through a case study of Mali's 2020 legislative elections.},

Abstract = {Diversionary War Theory (DWT) posits that leaders engulfed in a domestic
   crisis will attempt to divert the attention of citizens by initiating an
   armed conflict against an external actor. War, under this logic, is a
   mechanism designed to distract, boost the leader's popularity, or
   relegate the responsibility for the crisis to an outside scapegoat. In
   this article, I apply a discursive variation of DWT to account for and
   describe the shift in Donald Trump's approach to China during the
   COVID-19 crisis. This analysis concludes the domestic political and
   economic difficulties Trump was grappling with during the 2020
   presidential election motivated him to blame the Chinese government for
   the detrimental effects the pandemic had on the United States. Trump's
   strategic use of novel social media platforms was instrumental in his
   campaign to name, shame, and scapegoat China to divert attention from
   the domestic crisis as well as to boost his popularity.},

Abstract = {The literature that examines cross-national satisfaction with democracy
   seeks to discover a set of predictors that are associated with
   evaluations of regime performance. The most common way of examining the
   determinants of satisfaction with democracy is null hypothesis
   significance testing. While this approach has merit, this paper argues
   that the literature, as it stands, can be complemented to gain
   additional insights. To date, little research has focused on what
   variables best predict satisfaction. This is important because it helps
   guide researchers when determining which features to give attention to
   when devising theories about what causes (changes) in satisfaction. In
   this paper, I use machine learning algorithms to determine and evaluate
   the predictive power of variables identified as important in literature.
   Drawing on the sixth round of the European Social Survey, I find
   satisfaction with the economy, procedural fairness and responsiveness to
   be the most important predictors of satisfaction with democracy. These
   findings justify a stronger focus on the latter two topics in future
   studies of satisfaction with democracy, which has received little
   attention in the scholarly literature.},

Abstract = {In several US state legislatures, the number of women lawmakers has
   recently reached unprecedented levels. This raises the following
   question: what are the policy consequences associated with an increase
   in women legislators? While legislative scholars have uncovered that an
   increase in representation through women state lawmakers can result in
   different policy outcomes, one outcome that has not been considered is
   the size of the gender wage gap. In this research note, we develop the
   theoretical linkage that connects gender representation in state
   legislatures to the level of pay inequality within a state. We test our
   theoretical expectation with two different measures of pay inequality at
   the state level using panel data. Our results suggest that an increase
   in women state lawmakers corresponds to a smaller wage gap between men
   and women within the state. These findings deepen our understanding of
   the importance of gender representation in state legislatures.},

Abstract = {For decades, scholars, non-governmental organisations and observers have
   expressed concern about the use of sensationalised images of people in
   the developing world in non-governmental organisation fundraising
   advertisements. They fear that these negative messages, often known as
   `poverty porn', lead to a perception of people in developing countries
   as helpless and lacking in agency. Despite this ongoing concern, there
   has been no empirical assessment of the effect of exposure to these
   negative messages on the perceptions of people living in poverty in
   developing countries. Our research employs an online experiment of 450
   UK respondents to address this gap. It examines how watching charity
   advertisements affects people's perceptions of the agency of those in
   poverty in developing countries. We find that those who viewed negative
   portrayals of those in poverty were more likely to rate people in
   poverty lower on measures of agency. This empirically validates the
   criticisms of these types of negative advertisements.},

Abstract = {The strength and direction of the association between Christian religion
   and support for radical right-wing parties is strongly debated. On the
   one hand, there is work that shows that in Western European countries
   with a strong Christian democratic party, the relationship between
   church attendance and voting for populist radical right (PRR) parties is
   negative (Marcinkiewicz and Dassonneville 2022). Such findings
   contradict with the conclusions reached by Inglehart (2021), who
   reported that adherence to religious norms correlates positively with
   support for PRR parties. In this research note we shed light on the
   reasons for these contrasting conclusions, by systematically assessing
   the role of empirical choices in terms of the operationalizations of the
   dependent and the key independent variables, and how heterogeneity is
   dealt with.},

Abstract = {Populist chief executives tend to weaken democracies by undermining the
   rule of law and horizontal accountability. For insight into the
   resilience of American democracy against such threats, this article
   takes a close look at how the Republican Party in Congress responded to
   President Donald J.Trump's attack on the legitimacy of American
   elections following his loss in the 2020 elections. It examines
   post-2020 congressional Republicans' decisions about party positioning,
   legislative party leadership and membership, and Trump's status as party
   leader. In each set of decisions, congressional Republicans pursued
   their own interests rather than echoing Trump's claims or taking
   direction from him. Congressional Republicans, however, largely declined
   to criticize Trump directly in light of their voters' continued support
   for him, support that was evident in the 2022 Republican primaries. The
   overall conclusion is that the self-interest of separately elected
   members of Congress offers a significant, albeit imperfect defense
   against a populist chief executive's bid for hegemony.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {68},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1353-1365},

Abstract = {In a well-ordered society, democratic officials face an assurance
   problem. They want to ensure that others will act reasonably when they
   do the same. According to political liberals, public reason can solve
   this problem, but the details of how assurance is generated are unclear.
   This article explains the assurance mechanism in political liberalism.
   Apart from public reason, mutual assurance is also provided by a
   long-term record of civic deeds. By performing civic deeds over time,
   officials signal their reasonableness to each other. This record of
   civic deeds is costly to unreasonable officials and thus represents a
   reliable way to differentiate trustworthy fellows from others. The
   article also shows that a recent critique of political liberalism, which
   argues that public reason is merely cheap talk and thus political
   liberalism fails to provide mutual assurance, misses the point. It
   overlooks that assurance is created through talks and deeds together.},

Abstract = {This paper mainly deals with the relationship between citizens' levels
   of news exposure and their behaviors toward the president's corruption
   scandal in South Korea. In particular, we examine how an individual's
   level of news exposure affected his/her level of political information
   about the corruption scandal, perception of then President Park
   Geun-hye's responsibility for corruption, and participation in anti-Park
   protests or counter-protests. In this paper, we argue that more exposure
   to consistent news reports of the president's corruption increases the
   amount of information citizens with different political dispositions
   have in common. The more their sets of political information overlap,
   the closer their perceptions and behavioral choices regarding a
   corruption scandal are likely to be.},

Abstract = {This essay is part of a special issue celebrating 50 years of Political
   Theory. The ambition of the editors was to mark this half century not
   with a retrospective but with a confabulation of futures. Contributors
   were asked: What will political theory look and sound like in the next
   century and beyond? What claims might political theorists or their
   descendants be making in ten, twenty-five, fifty, a hundred years' time?
   How might they vindicate those claims in their future contexts? How will
   the consistent concerns of political theorists evolve into the questions
   critical for people decades or centuries from now? What new problems
   will engage the political theorists (or their rough equivalents) of the
   future? What forms might those take? What follows is one of the many
   confabulations published in response to these queries.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {239-263},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Parliamentarians receive public funding to employ local staff in the
   constituency. Local staff help members of parliament to execute their
   representative duties, but can also become an electoral asset. Drawing
   on theories of personal vote-seeking we study local staff as an example
   of constituency service. Modelling within-individual changes in local
   staff size among 1174 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), we find
   that the number of local staff increases before both European and
   national elections, and more so in candidate-centred than party-centred
   systems. Despite a single European Parliament (EP) staff system, EU
   citizens are represented differently depending on where they elect their
   members and the electoral system that applies. Attempts to mend the EU's
   democratic deficit by strengthening MEPs' contacts with citizens through
   local staff potentially means that European public money is used to fund
   EP incumbents' electoral campaigns. We discuss the implications of our
   findings for the democratic functioning of the European multi-level
   system.},

Abstract = {Can staying minorities who evade ethnic cleansing affect political
   outcomes in resettled communities? After World War Two, three million
   ethnic Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland, but some
   were allowed to stay, many of them left-leaning antifascists. We study
   quasi-experimental local variation in expulsion policies, a result of
   the surprising presence of the U.S. Army, which indirectly helped
   antifascist Germans stay. We find a long-lasting footprint: Communist
   party support, party cells, and far-left values are stronger today where
   antifascist Germans stayed in larger numbers. Postwar German Communist
   elites appear to be behind this effect along with the intergenerational
   transmission of values among active party members.},

Abstract = {There is no more analyzed image in the history of political thought than
   the frontispiece of Hobbes's Leviathan (1651), yet the tiny figures
   making up the giant have largely escaped scholarly attention. So, too,
   have their hats. This article recovers what men's failure to ``doff and
   don{''} their hats in the frontispiece might have conveyed to readers
   about their relationship to the Sovereign and each other. Sometimes big
   ideas-about the nature of representation, for example, or how to
   ``acknowledge{''} equality-are conveyed by small gestures. When situated
   textually and contextually, Hobbes's hats shed important light on the
   micropolitics of everyday interaction for those who, like Hobbes
   himself, hope to securely constitute a society of equals.},

Title = {Social trust and affective polarization in Spain (2014-19)},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {One overlooked aspect of the rising levels of affective polarization is
   its effect on general social trust. In the present article, we analyze
   the relationship between affective polarization and various measures of
   social trust using two separate panel surveys that were implemented in
   Spain in two different political periods (2014-2015 and 2018-2019), in
   order to assess whether the individual variations in the levels of
   affective polarization may affect people's trust in other members of
   society. Our findings suggest that affective polarization towards out
   -party members has a mutually reinforcing negative relationship with
   general social trust, generating a perva-sive equilibrium of social and
   political deterioration that might contribute to worsening democratic
   quality. This effect is not compensated by any significant bonding
   effect resulting from in-partisan identification, whose ef-fects seem to
   be restricted just to the very closest inner-circle individuals.},

Abstract = {As both India and South Korea build their ties on the basis of
   democratic partnership and ASEAN centrality, the need for Seoul to
   emerge as a strong partner in India's Indo-Pacific initiatives is vital.
   India's quest for a more serious multilateral network is continuously
   growing in the security sphere, and Korea's induction in the same via
   the ``Plus{''} framework of the quadrilateral hints at potential for
   successful connects with other multilateral frameworks or bodies like
   the AIIB to balance economic assistance and development. Ultimately, the
   natural upgradation of India-South Korea relations relies intensely upon
   the degree to which Seoul will embrace the Indo-Pacific account that
   India's AEP is pitching. The merging of soft and hard power by the
   middle and rising power is critical to India to ensure a rules-based
   international order; finding a formal place for Seoul in its
   Indo-Pacific prism must emerge as a necessary focus of New Delhi.},

Title = {How social infrastructure saves lives: a quantitative analysis of

Journal = {JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-40},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Observers have long debated how societies should invest resources to
   safeguard citizens and property, especially in the face of increasing
   shocks and crises. This article explores how social infrastructure - the
   spaces and places that help build and maintain social ties and trust,
   allowing societies to coordinate behavior - plays an important role in
   our communities, especially in mitigating and recovering from shocks. An
   analysis of quantitative data on more than 550 neighborhoods across the
   three Japanese prefectures most affected by the tsunami of 11 March 2011
   shows that, controlling for relevant factors, community centers,
   libraries, parks, and other social infrastructure measurably and cheaply
   reduced mortality rates among the most vulnerable population. Investing
   in social infrastructure projects would, based on this data, save more
   lives during a natural hazard than putting the same money into standard,
   gray infrastructure such as seawalls. Decision makers at national,
   regional, and local levels should expand spending on facilities such as
   libraries, community centers, social businesses, and public parks to
   increase resilience to multiple types of shocks and to further enhance
   the quality of life for residents.},

Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This research explores the conditions of parents in precarious
   employment in Italy (European Union) with an emphasis on (but not
   confined to) mothers from non-European Union countries of origin. The
   aim is to construct a critical understanding of the material conditions
   of workers and parents in precarious employment and their everyday
   struggles to achieve employment and income security, when this income
   security can be achieved only through the sale of labour-power in
   gendered and racialised labour markets. Their everyday lives are marked
   by their conditions of bearers of labour-power and crucially these
   precarious social conditions produce a pressure which tends to reduce
   precarious workers' lives to `bare life'. Bare life is connected to the
   `bare minimum' that these participants get in terms of income. This
   study aims to give a new interpretation to the concept of bare minimum
   through which precarious parents must arrange their lives. Gendered and
   racialising processes take place through the struggles around this
   `minimum'.},

Abstract = {This single-lesson simulation is designed to allow students to explore
   concepts related to bargaining, credible commitments, and the security
   dilemma in an anarchic environment. The simulation is designed assuming
   about 20 participants, divided into 4 groups, but is easily modifiable
   for either more groups or more participants. The goal of each group is
   resource acquisition, and a failure to acquire adequate resources can
   result in the elimination of group members from the simulation. Resource
   acquisition can be done either cooperatively or competitively. The
   design of this particular simulation is structured to make failure
   probable for a sizeable minority of participants. This design choice is
   intentional, as the simulation seeks to turn failure into a pedagogical
   device. Along with presenting the simulation itself, the piece also
   argues for the pedagogical merits of designing for failure in classroom
   exercises.},

Abstract = {The 2021 urban political protests in Russia in support of Alexei Navalny
   have swept the country, beginning in the Far East and reaching Moscow.
   They, however, displayed large variation in the number of protesters
   taking to the streets in the country's regional capitals. While the
   immediate driver of urban protests is usually a political event or a
   decision of authorities, the willingness to protest accumulates before
   that, creating protest potential. To explain why some Russian regional
   capitals accumulate protest potential while others do not, we perform
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis of 53 cases. It reveals that a high
   share of young and educated people and the presence of organized civil
   society, but not the Internet consumption or the performance of city
   authorities, are crucial for the accumulation of protest potential in
   Russian regional capitals. These findings advance our understanding of
   urban political potential in autocracies as well as of Russia's
   political geography.},

Abstract = {The objective of the research was to identify threats to individual
   rights in criminal proceedings during martial law. The research involved
   system methods, descriptive analysis, systematic sampling, doctrinal
   approach and forecasting. Martial law introduced as a result of armed
   conflict carries important implications for criminal justice. Ensuring
   the observance of individual rights in criminal proceedings during this
   period applies to several crimes, the common feature of which is the
   time of their commission. The classification of subjects of prevention
   of infringement of such rights is presented. The prospects for improving
   the protection of individual rights in criminal proceedings require
   international assistance in the detection of crimes related to the armed
   conflict. It is concluded that ensuring the observance of individual
   rights in criminal proceedings during martial law requires combining the
   efforts of national and international specialists. Prospects for
   improving this process envisage international assistance with increased
   use of its results as evidence in national and international courts. It
   is appropriate to develop international recommendations for national law
   enforcement agencies and judicial bodies.},

Abstract = {In Latin America, recent processes of democratic backsliding have tested
   the robustness of the Inter-American democratic system (IADS). Based on
   theoretical frameworks of democ-racy promotion, hypotheses stemming from
   institutionalist and normative theories suffer from important
   limitations in explaining the liberal democracies' motivations to act in
   the face of anti-democratic threats. Analyzing the cases of democratic
   regression in Bolivia, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, and the
   consequent responses from the Caribbean Community's (Caricom) liberal
   democracies vis-a-vis these autocracies, this article cor-roborates that
   democracy promotion responds to a materialistic-utilitarian hypothesis
   that prioritizes material cost-benefit calculations over democratic
   norms and institutions. The analysis reveals that the worrying but real
   prevalence of power politics over democratic principles challenges the
   solidity of the IADS.},

Abstract = {The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the subsequent arrival of
   people fleeing the war prompted remarkable mobilizations and responses
   throughout the EU. By focusing on the Italian context and, more
   specifically, on the case of the Piedmont Region, this paper conducts
   critical reflection on the different forms and expressions of solidarity
   that emerged at both the institutional and civic society levels. The
   paper builds on qualitative interviews carried out between February 2022
   and March 2023 with representatives of public institutions, third-sector
   organisations, and associations, and it intends to: I) frame the
   different expressions of solidarity in light of recent changes in the
   regulatory arrangements of the institutional asylum system; II) explore
   the relationship between formal and informal reception with respect to
   equity in terms of conditions, opportunities, and quality of the
   services provided; III) discuss the implications of the double standards
   and the ambivalent role of solidarity towards a specific category of
   refugees, especially as regards its sustainability over time and the
   growing fragmentation of the refugee reception systems.},

Title = {Not a Diatribe Joseph Brodsky's ``On the Independence of Ukraine{''}},
Journal = {OSTEUROPA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {73},
Number = {12},
Pages = {195+},
Abstract = {Joseph Brodsky's much-maligned verses ``On the Independence of
   Ukraine{''} (1991) are read by his critics as a lyrical poem. In it,
   there is a lyrical ego speaking, and this is supposed to represent the
   author's voice. Brodsky, they argue, is personally insulting Ukraine.
   This view is untenable. Rather, Brodsky is arranging several voices into
   a small dramatic work in verse. In the poem, he is putting on display
   precisely and straightforwardly the views of the Russian public at the
   time.},

Title = {Bayesian Rule Set: A Quantitative Alternative to Qualitative Comparative
   Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 1},
Abstract = {We introduce the Bayesian Rule Set (BRS) as an alternative to
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) when data are large and noisy.
   BRS is an interpretable machine learning algorithm that classifies
   observations using rule sets, which are conditions connected by logical
   operators (e.g., IF (condition A AND condition B) OR (condition C), THEN
   Y = TRUE). Like QCA, BRS is highly interpretable and capable of
   revealing complex nonlinear relationships in data. It also has several
   advantages over QCA: it is compatible with probabilistically generated
   data, it avoids overfitting and improves interpretability by making
   direct trade-offs between in-sample fitness and complexity, and it
   remains computationally efficient with many covariates. Our
   contributions are threefold: we modify the BRS algorithm to facilitate
   its usage in the social sciences, propose methods to quantify
   uncertainties of rule sets, and develop graphical tools for presenting
   rule sets. We illustrate these methods with two empirical examples from
   political science.},

Title = {HUMAN CAPITAL OF AN ACADEMIC COMMUNITY UNDER DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION: THE
   CASE OF JAPAN},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2023},
Number = {6},
Pages = {128-141},
Abstract = {The world's developed nations are working their way through a period of
   digital transformation (DX), which has been given a new impetus by the
   COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the field of the online R\&D/ teaching
   field. Each country is following its own unexplored path, but each of
   them can borrow from the others some of their experience. A discord
   inevitably arises between the linear logistic rationality of the ongoing
   transformations and the humanistic orientation of the nonlinear task of
   endorsing human capital. Thus, theneed to analyze this phenomenon from
   the perspective of political sociology arose in order to understand the
   direction in which we need to move and the risks that could arise along
   this path. In a technologically advanced country like Japan, DX has
   encountered formidable barriers. On the one hand, the `silver
   generation' is lacking the necessary digital competencies. On the other
   hand, the main obstacle to the digitalization of the R\&D sphere has
   been the omnipotent and well-organized Japanese bureaucracy, prone to
   dubbing functions. In addition, there are visible symptoms that the
   Japanese research and teaching community has reached the threshold of a
   crisis: for example, a young researcher with a freshly defended PhD
   dissertation faces great obstacles in his/her research and teaching
   career, since the growth of the bureaucratic apparatus contrary to the
   DX goals - results in a reduction of tenures for teachers and
   researchers. Some difficult questions emerge: how can it get out of this
   vicious circle? can Russia bypass this thorny path?},

Title = {Re-Conceptualization of Political Trust in Relation to Justice},
Journal = {SIYASAL-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {This study seeks to contribute to the conceptualization of political
   trust by uncovering its moral and affective dimensions, particularly its
   relationship with justice. In the current atmosphere of politics,
   political trust becomes a complex concept, especially in the face of
   injustices. Despite extensive discussions on trust and justice in the
   literature, the interplay between them within the political context
   remains underexplored. While analytic philosophy delves into a
   multifaceted exploration of trust, political science often limits its
   perspective to a performance evaluation grounded in rational
   calculations and interests. The deficiency in analytic philosophy lies
   in its failure to adequately address the socio-political dimension of
   trust, as it adopts a predominantly individualistic viewpoint that
   neglects politically significant aspects, including justice. The
   prevailing trend in political science tends to downplay the affective
   and moral facets of trust. This study endeavours to bridge this gap by
   re-evaluating our approach to political trust, emphasizing its
   importance and exploring its determinants, particularly in connection to
   justice. The argument posits that, in addition to and beyond rational
   evaluations in politics, a comprehensive understanding of political
   trust and its relationship to justice necessitates an examination of the
   affective and moral components, underlying perceptions of trust and
   justice in real political and social contexts.},

Abstract = {China and Russia have become close partners. Shared geopolitical
   interests do not provide a convincing explanation for this
   rapprochement. Positive norms hardly play a role either. Rather, the
   cause is to be sought in the increasingly similar authoritarian systems
   of rule in both countries. At the heart of this lies the principle of
   ``sovereignty,{''} which they want to defend against ``external
   interference.{''} The rulers share in their opposition to the liberal
   West and their enormous interest in maintaining power. Fear of
   democratic movements and ``colour revolutions{''} is a constant theme.
   To prevent this, Beijing and Moscow are working closely together. They
   act as protective powers for other autocratic regimes and weaken the
   influence of liberal democratic systems worldwide.},

Title = {Multiheaded Federations: The EU and Canada Compared},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {231-240},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to assess the merits of comparing the EU
   and Canada from a federal perspective. The point of departure is that
   both are federal-type entities that represent deviations from the
   standard or mainstream American model of federalism. That has given rise
   to alternative conceptions, multilevel governance for the EU, and a
   multinational federation for Canada. The article discusses the
   limitations of each such notion and instead argues for the merits of
   seeing both as different versions of multiheaded federation which is a
   useful analytical device for analyzing contestation over federalism
   within federal-type entities. This notion directs our attention to those
   with power and in the position to shape the political system's
   federal-constitutional nature and design, which normally happens in the
   realm of constitutional politics. It is the fundamental struggle over
   sovereignty within a federal-type structure that gives rise to the
   notion of a multiheaded federation-there are multiple heads because
   there is no willingness to accept a hierarchical arrangement. The notion
   of a multiheaded federation is particularly suitable for capturing
   (de)federalisation processes and dynamics.},

   Fernandez of the Frente de Todos to the profound economic, social, and
   judicial challenges it faced in 2022. While the measures adopted to
   address the pressing economic situation and rising social conflict
   intensified existing disputes in the governing coalition, threatening
   its unity, the judicial processes and the government's response to them
   deepened polarization between the government and the opposition,
   encouraging the internal unity of each coalition. The climate of
   polarization reached a peak with a failed assassination attempt against
   the vice president. Although these challenges and the internal disputes
   in the Frente de Todos severely weakened the president, the incumbent
   coalition remained stable and the ruling party remains competitive in
   the uncertain 2023 elections.},

   Governmental Decisions on Citizens' Trust?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {62-75},
Abstract = {For decades, scholars have discussed how to build greater citizen trust
   in government. I hypothesize that to increase trust in government, we
   should consider whether decisions made in bureaucrat-citizen encounters
   (e.g. applications for welfare benefits) are favorable to citizens.
   Building on insights from social psychology, I argue that in cases where
   citizens are presented with unfavorable decisions (e.g. rejection of
   applications), public employees can mitigate the negative impact on
   trust in government by appearing warm and friendly in the
   decision-making process. The argument is tested in a large-scale
   randomized survey experiment on a representative sample of Danish
   citizens, where I manipulate decision favorability and warmth. The
   findings reveal that outcome favorability and warmth strongly influence
   citizens' trust in government.},

Abstract = {The present paper presents notes on some critical reflections produced
   by academic -activists who invite to review the patriarchy category as a
   germ from which to (re)build meaning in the intense political life; thus
   shaking gender, as an analytical category, in light of the historical
   feminist processes in the region in the context of what in 2018 the
   Zapatistas enunciated as a multi-choral struggle to keep us alive. Thus,
   gender is revisited in the light of theoretical proposals of materialist
   feminisms, difference feminisms, intui-tive feminism, and of the
   emancipatory feminist economy, dialoguing in turn with the re-newed
   repertoires of feminist action such as strikes and the production of
   feminist justice, which dispute the social reproduction of life in a
   context of exacerbated violence against women and feminized beings.},

Abstract = {After many decades of a relationship defined primarily by commercial
   ties, Japan and Australia now have a robust security and defence
   partnership. While making their bilateral relations more all-rounded in
   the Indo-Pacific era, they also aim to promote a regional order where
   the United States remains engaged and like-minded nations come together
   to manage the ever-volatile strategic environment in the wake of China's
   rise and US-China strategic rivalry. These tasks are not easy due to
   strategic complexities; how the two key Indo-Pacific nations respond to
   each other and to their partners in managing the China challenge while
   ensuring US commitment to the region will be of deep interest to
   policymakers and analysts alike.},

Abstract = {I establish conditions for existence of pure strategy equilibria in
   K-candidate Downsian electoral competition (K >= 2) with valence when
   the voting rule is monotonic, generalizing existing results to
   non-proper rules and possibly continuous electorates. The conditions are
   sufficient when K >= 2 and (essentially) necessary in the K = 2
   candidate case. They compare the size of one candidate's valence
   advantage to the radius of a generalized median pivotal ball (P-ball). I
   flesh out the difference of this generalized median with a recent
   alternative which, in turn, I characterize both on the basis of a weaker
   median property and using pivotal hyperplanes.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to identify the expressions and
   understandings of institutionalized participation in SUS from the
   segment of municipal managers. The exploratory and documentary research
   sought in the publications of the National Council of Municipal Health
   Secretaries (CONASEMS) the central material of the study. The segment of
   users and workers within the spaces of participation in SUS has been
   widely studied, in turn, managers and providers have not been the
   subject of specific studies, hence the relevance of this research. The
   theme of participation with a view to democratizing State and society
   relations has always been present in the trajectory of CONASEMS,
   especially in its origin and institutionalization. The publications of
   the last decade have been privileging the technical and operational
   translation of the law in relation to participation, metamorphosing the
   political sense of the term and distancing itself from the bases of the
   Sanitary Reform Movement, making it an administrative problem. There
   were concerns about bringing popular segments to participatory spaces,
   without necessarily addressing social inequality and access to health
   services. The research highlighted the concern of CONASEMS, with its
   productions, to subsidize, align positions and mark the political
   position of municipal managers in the organization of the conferences.},

Pages = {255-277},
Abstract = {Cuba experienced continuing economic and political crises throughout
   2022, prolonging a slump that resulted from COVID's impact, the effects
   of US sanctions, and muddled economic policies. The popular anger and
   frustration that erupted in nationwide protests on July 11, 2021,
   deepened into a crisis of legitimacy for the government: the
   foundational social compact of the Revolution-to provide social equity
   and economic security for all-was not being kept. While ever greater
   access to communication technologies enabled the citizenry to impact
   some public policies, questioning of the political system remained off
   limits. Despite facing political and economic challenges that are
   frequently the prelude to instability, the Cuban system continued to
   enjoy sources of resilience characteristic of authoritarian durability.
   The prospect of a fundamental challenge to regime persistence was
   therefore unlikely in the near-term, but the corrosive effects of its
   problems posed significant risks for the future.},

Abstract = {It is widely agreed that durable authoritarian rule requires
   power-sharing institutions. But how do autocrats rule under such
   institutions? We analyze formally how an autocrat distributes
   information inside the coalition to preserve and consolidate power while
   remaining constrained by the power-sharing agreement. Collective
   governing bodies like the parliament or the cabinet of ministers create
   a common information environment in which the leader faces a low risk of
   removal (by the regime's insiders or outsiders), but opportunities to
   consolidate power are rare. To incite divisions inside the coalition,
   the ruler introduces informational asymmetries inside the coalition,
   which opens up opportunities to consolidate power at the risk of losing
   it all. This implies a trade-off between the durability of power and its
   extent. Our model illuminates the variation in the authoritarian
   styles-of-rule and examines when rulers subdue power-sharing
   institutions despite their commonly purported value.},

Abstract = {An empirical investigation on the acceptance of Chinese mining
   activities in rural Zimbabwe was done for this article. Its two main
   goals were to: (1) assess public opinion of Chinese mining operations;
   and (2) present a workable investment model that takes into account the
   main locals' complaints. Additionally, it touched on two related issues
   of concern: (1) what causes host community disputes with foreign mining
   companies in rural Zimbabwe; and (2) what investment model may be used
   to settle host community disputes between investors and host
   communities? It then assessed Chinese mining investments against the 3Ps
   of the Triple Bottom Line theory (TBL). Created by John Elkington in
   1994, TBL recommends a balance between people, profitability, and the
   planet (environmental conservation) in business operations. Based on the
   study's somewhat negative findings, the article created the PESE
   investment model (shortcut for people, environment, social, and economy)
   which it is presenting as an ideal framework that may have broader
   application for sustainable investment in Zimbabwe's mining industry.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study was to clarify the methodological foundations
   of the essence of public administration bodies as subjects of
   administrative procedural law. The methodology of scientific work is
   determined by the optimal combination of general and special methods of
   scientific knowledge, which made it possible to form a holistic
   understanding of the legal form of social phenomena accompanying the
   development of the state. It is proved that administrative procedural
   law has its own system, the primary element of which is the
   administrative procedural norm, so that its normative impact coincides
   with the purpose of administrative procedural law, namely the practical
   implementation of administrative and legal norms in the field of public
   law and, by extension, public administration, i.e. the transformation of
   substantive administrative law norms at the level of practical
   implementation of a particular right of a person. The system of
   administrative procedural law, consisting of rules, institutions and
   administrative procedural sub-sectors, stands out. Everything leads to
   the conclusion that the system of administrative-procedural law is in
   the formative stage and is structurally composed of
   administrative-procedural norms, institutions and sub-branches and is
   essentially related to the substantive norms of administrative law.},

Abstract = {The article presents the political discussion on the Danube-Oder-Elbe
   (DOE) international water corridor in the Czech Republic in the period
   2010-2021. The issue has become highly politicised among Czech political
   bodies in the last decade. The article presents the development of
   political interests in the DOE issue in the Czech Republic regard to the
   concept of the social responsibility. Due to the fundamentally
   contradictory changes in the Czech governments policy towards DOE during
   the period under study, the authors focus on analysing expert documents
   (e.g., expert strategies, action plans for the Czech Republic, DOE
   studies, government programme statements) and political decisions in the
   Czech Republic on the given topic in the last decade. The authors
   present the results of the research by content analysis of relevant
   documents, which were examined by cluster analysis on the relationship
   ``costs of solving negative financial externalities{''} and ``DOE
   ownership{''}. The methodology used is a combination of cluster
   analysis, PRISMA analysis and descriptive analysis. The research results
   show that the analysed documents show a high degree of mutual
   incoherence.},

Title = {Why programmatic parties reduce criminal violence: Theory and evidence
   from Brazil},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Extensive research suggests that electoral competition and power
   alternations increase violence in weakly institutionalized democracies.
   Yet, little is known about how political parties affect violence and
   security. We theorize that the type of party strengthened in elections
   shapes security outcomes and argue that the rise of programmatic
   parties, at the expense of clientelistic parties, can significantly
   reduce violence. In contexts of large-scale criminal violence,
   programmatic parties are less likely to establish alliances with
   coercive actors because they possess fewer incentives and greater
   coordination capacity. Focusing on Brazil, we use a regression
   discontinuity design that leverages the as-if random assignment of
   election winners across three rounds of mayoral races. We find that
   violent crime decreased in municipalities where programmatic parties won
   coin-flip elections, while it increased in those where clientelistic
   parties triumphed. Our findings suggest that whether electoral
   competition increases violence depends on the type of party that wins
   elections.},

Abstract = {``Generations in Genoa{''} is an article by Alessandro Portelli,
   unpublished in French and translated by Laura Brignon. Written by A.
   Portelli in 2005, based on oral narrative interviews from the time, it
   looks back at the days of the G8 in Genoa, cross-referencing first-hand
   accounts from young people, who were sometimes demonstrating for the
   first time, with those of their parents, swaying between pride, fear and
   anger. The death of Carlo Giuliani plays a particularly central role,
   from a chronological, political and psychological point of view, as a
   key point of identification in the parent-children relationships. By
   weaving together movements, narratives and emotions right up to the
   post-Genoa period, Portelli also shows how this event, like 68, is
   likely to reverse the direction of political tradition.},

Abstract = {The European University Viadrina, Frankfurt/Oder, is expanding its
   historical Ukrainian studies. The former ``Center for Interdisciplinary
   Polish Studies{''} has become the ``Viadrina Center of Polish and
   Ukrainian Studies{''}. Andrii Portnoy, who holds the Chair of Entangled
   History of Ukraine, modifies the classic question ``What does it mean to
   study history and to what end?{''} He warns against the politically
   motivated reductionism of post-colonial historiography and against
   falling back on a schematic national history. The complexities of
   Ukrainian history can only be studied and explained as a history of
   entanglements. Transnational, comparative history requires knowledge of
   local material. The development of Ukrainian Studies does not mean
   negating research on Poland or Russia.},

Abstract = {China's high-speed rail is an epochal project that marks the advent of
   infrastructural capitalism in the age of monopoly capital. It posits
   that China's infrastructure projects, a distinctive form of geographies
   of capitalism, play several roles including technological, social,
   spatial -economic, and geopolitical, aimed at addressing the preceding
   economic crisis of 2008 and further expanding and consolidating
   territorial power. To conceptualize the contemporary moment of
   capitalist dynamics as infrastructural capitalism and its relationship
   to class conflicts, this paper moves beyond a dichotomy of the logic of
   capital and the logic of territorial power. This paper underscores the
   infrastructural projects' political significance in creating invisible
   class contradictions, particularly leading to the individual and
   collective actions of a wide array of affected working-class masses. It
   contributes to the elucidation of the dialectical relation between the
   geographies of capitalism and labour geographies.},

Title = {A proposal for the analysis of technocratic political discourse: the
   case of Danilo Astori during the personal income tax reform in Uruguay
   (2004-2006)},
Journal = {ANALECTA POLITICA},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The elaboration of a theoretical framework that defines technocracy has
   been problematic and its research has concentrated the efforts of
   various schools and authors throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.
   Taking political and historiographical literature as a basis, it is
   intended to develop a theoretical and methodological framework capable
   of understanding the technocratic discourse. On the one hand, in terms
   of the strictly theoretical categories, the technocratic discourse is
   positioned as a fully political discourse because it keeps within it an
   implicit conflict when building a rationalist identity contrary to an
   irrational other. Although the conflict is not explicitly expressed (the
   technocracy presents itself as neutral and independent), said conflict
   is inextricable from its discourse, especially when it comes from
   political institutions, such as a ministry or a political party. On the
   other hand, regarding the methodological, a series of analytical
   categories inspired by the semiotics of Eliseo Veron are established:
   entities, components and recipients. Once these
   theoretical-methodological categories have been defined, we move on to
   their empirical application in the case of the speech by Danilo Astori,
   Uruguayan Minister of Economy during the first government of the Frente
   Amplio (Broad Front), on the reform of the Personal Income Tax, in force
   since July of 2007. In his defense of the reform, he attempts to
   depoliticize it through the use of impersonal verbal periphrases,
   meta-collective entities or percentage data. Despite this, the discourse
   is forced to express implicit conflicts and expose blurred pro-and
   counter-recipients. In conclusion, it will be possible to see how
   Astoris discourse is technical, not neoliberal and, therefore,
   political.},

   Spanish asylum},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {60},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the Spanish asylum procedure, taking into account
   the exercise of government over those who request international
   protection, with the aim of delving into the centrality of waiting as a
   mechanism that disciplines and introduces asylum seekers into
   recognition categories. Based on a qualitative methodology, based on
   in-depth interviews with technical personnel and forcibly displaced
   persons, a field work is developed that results in the possibility of
   understanding the asylum seeker as a ``patient{''}, in the sense of
   subject evaluated and in that of being a waiting subject. The starting
   hypothesis raises the possibility of understanding the temporality
   established by the asylum procedure as a mechanism that positions the
   applicant for protection in relation to the expected recognition,
   developing a central role in its subjective construction at destination.
   It is concluded that waiting produces manageable subjects, not only for
   demonstrating a lack of protection in the country of origin, but also
   for adjusting to the temporary demands of the procedure, noting that the
   State, while providing protection to an individual, is internationally
   constructed as humanitarian entity.},

Abstract = {Almost 160 years after the American Civil War, where the Union defeated
   the Confederacy and ended slavery in the United States, approximately
   1,910 tributes remain to Confederate military leaders located on public
   property in the 11 original Confederate states, particularly in cities
   with an exceptionally high density of Black residents. To Blacks, this
   iconography delivers a clear message of White supremacy. Six states have
   enacted laws to protect and preserve these memorials, making it almost
   impossible to use the court system to move them to private property.
   This paper explores connections between support for a myth called the
   Lost Cause, which is a revisionist history intended to spread
   misinformation about the true cause of the American Civil War, and
   attitudes toward placement of Confederate symbols on public land. We
   show that there is significant belief in the Lost-Cause myth among many
   White U.S. Southerners. Furthermore, we find those who believe most in
   the myth are the least likely to want to move the monuments or end
   taxpayer support for their maintenance.},

Abstract = {Our century in the political, social and humanitarian context has
   revealed the urgent need to identify both the dysfunctions in the field
   of communication, and their possible causes and consequences. The study
   tests the authors' hypothesis about the growing duality of the ongoing
   processes, which, on the one hand, are determined by the global
   communicative imperatives to expand the interaction space, ignoring
   national borders, and, on the other hand, by quite obvious centrifugal
   processes, which are caused, among other factors, by the desire to erect
   barriers along the lines of regional and territorial division. Observing
   the growth of antagonistic contradictions in allow for the possibility
   that the obvious polarization of opinions is not a consequence of the
   aggravation of real conflicts, but often their source. Taking into
   account the noted duality and complexity of the processes taking place
   during the transformation of the modern political media space, the
   authors offer general principles for diagnosing current political
   challenges from the standpoint of the noospheric paradigm, which goes
   back to the ideas of Vladimir Vernadsky, in combination with classical
   methods of studying communications.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article was to carry out a socio-philosophical analysis
   of the legal mentality in theE dc ontext of European integration
   processes. Comparative and observational methods Maria were the main
   methodological tools. The research revealed that the legal mentality of
   the EU population is characterized by respect for the law, human rights
   and freedoms. The rights of the individual are recognized as priority
   over the rights of the state. The Ukrainian legal ReCittaesv lientauc
   mentality is characterized by legal nihilism, legal idealism, statism,
   anomie, DrHumter detachment from legal culture and ambivalence. It is
   concluded that, the hiiloomr consolidation of civil society with public
   authority during the military aggression of the Russian Federation
   indicates positive changes in the legal mentality. There are some
   positive changes in the attitude of the EU population towards the future
   EU membership of Ukraine. Increased legal awareness is a necessary
   component for the development of Ukraine's legal mentality. The current
   achievements embodied in the national and European legal mentality in
   the EU countries can be guidelines for Ukraine to achieve its goal of
   European integration.},

Abstract = {Parliamentary privilege at Westminster derives from each House
   constituting part of the High Court of Parliament. The supreme court of
   England was part of Parliament when it enacted Article 9 of the Bill of
   Rights 1688, guaranteeing parliamentary privilege. The High Court of
   Parliament was a `supreme court - legislature', until specialisation
   separated the supreme court in O'Connell (1844). Following the creation
   of specialist and separate supreme courts, at Westminster and elsewhere,
   neither lower nor upper Houses, nor legislatures at large, can be
   considered courts. Further, lower Houses have been divided from upper
   Houses, a political division that obscures the separation of supreme
   courts from legislatures. The question then arises of how any
   legislature can be continue to be regarded as part of a High Court of
   Parliament, and so participate in parliamentary privilege. This paper is
   to help readers access, navigate and explore the key historical,
   philosophical and practical aspects of both Article 9 and its interplay
   with parliamentary privilege in Westminster parliaments.},

Abstract = {Usingan analytical and documentary-based methodology,the objective of
   the study was to establish the relationshipbetween the degree of
   decentralization and the speed of deliveryof administrative services at
   the local level in different fields inEuropean countries and Ukraine.
   The study involved indicatorsof the speed of delivery of administrative
   services (company registration, building permit and land registration)
   according to the World Bank's Doing Business methodology. The
   relationship identified between the degree of decentralization and the
   speed of administrative service delivery at the local level was the
   basis for establishing that the time to register a company and obtain a
   building permit decreases as a function of the higher degreeof
   decentralization. The time to register property increases as the degree
   of decentralization increases, which is partly explained by the
   complexity of the administrative procedure models and their duration. It
   is concluded that, a comparison of the speed of providing administrative
   services (business registration, construction permit, land registration)
   in Ukraine with the average indicator of a group of countries revealed
   significantly better results in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {This paper is about the current stage of the Cyprus conflict in the
   context of the recent developments in the Eastern Mediterranean. The
   en-ergy discoveries could have been a catalyst for a solution, but the
   opposite occurred. The Greek Cypriot administration aimed to expand its
   regional `allies' through maritime delimitation agreements. Meanwhile,
   Turkiye has continued its exploratory drilling. The trajectory that the
   Cyprus conflict followed after the Greek Cypriot administration's EU
   membership in 2004 is a case of a j'oint decision trap.' The EU's
   paralysis towards the conflict has pushed Turkiye, once proactive to
   resolve it with the expectation of be-coming an EU member, to slide back
   to its traditional hard power strategy.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyze the memories and autobiographies of six
   intellectuals who witnessed and contributed to the foundation of the
   Turkish Republic and played important roles in the cultural policies of
   the era of the early Republic of Turkey. In the analysis, the
   sociological concept of generation is utilized as a conceptual
   framework. Characterizing a group of people that not only share
   approximating birth dates and locations but also have experienced
   similar historical moments or political and socioeconomic
   transformations as a generation, this article regards Sevket Sureyya
   Aydemir, Suleyman Edip Balkir, Ismail Hakki Baltacioglu, Yakup Kadri
   Karaosmanoglu, Ahmet Emin Yalman and Hasan ali Yucel as members of the
   same generation. An in-depth analysis of the memoirs and autobiographies
   reveals two common themes among these people's memories: first, because
   they were born and grew up on the western side of the Ottoman lands,
   they were all strangers to Anatolia before World War I or the foundation
   of the Republic; and, second, all six intellectuals believed in the fact
   that the path of turning Anatolia into a modernized and secularized
   homeland passed through education. Their strangeness to Anatolia and the
   importance of education for its socio-cultural development were highly
   related because the transformation of Anatolia through education not
   only aimed to create a homeland but also ended the strangeness between
   these intellectuals and Anatolia.},

Title = {Ethnicity and Response to Internal Environmental Migrants in the United

Abstract = {We examine how responses to individuals displaced by environmental
   shocks vary based on the ethnicity of the migrants, the locals, and
   their ethnic groups' political status. We embed an experiment into a
   stratified sample of 2,188 white, Black, and Latinx Americans surveyed
   through Qualtrics Panels. The experiment shows respondents a photo of a
   flooded road, randomly assigning whether there are white, Black, Latinx,
   or no persons wading through the water. Results show no outward change
   in approval for migrants settling in respondents' neighborhoods based on
   their ethnicity. However, emotional responses to migrants, perceptions
   of migrants' economic backgrounds, and levels of tolerance and
   ethnocentrism among locals vary based on migrants' ethnicity. While
   there may not be outward xenophobia and conflict in the face of internal
   climate-related migration, the underlying attitudes of members of
   receiving communities suggest internal migrants from politically
   excluded groups lack local acceptance and may face more subtle
   prejudice.},

Abstract = {The Russo-Ukrainian war may have given democratic peace a new lease of
   (research) life. The stronger-than-expected reaction of liberal
   democracies coupled with the poorer-than-expected battlefield
   performance of the Russian military, invites us to re-apply the logic of
   democratic peace. To understand the strong reactions of liberal
   democracies, I apply a militant interpretation of Kant's perpetual peace
   and reexamine the role of trade interdependence in capitalist peace. To
   understand the battlefield performance of Ukraine, I examine theories of
   war-fighting with an emphasis on the legitimacy mechanism. To understand
   the battlefield performance of Russia, I examine the deleterious impact
   of corruption and preference falsification (vranyo). To the extent that
   the field is still generating novel research that advances our
   understanding of the impact of regime type on international conflict,
   democratic peace remains a progressive research programme.},

Abstract = {New forms of communication, participation and coordination are
   challenging democratic governments. The growing public demand for
   throughput legitimacy is changing the way politicians and civil servants
   find solutions in decision-making processes. The question is whether
   these changes affect the legitimacy of governments and how they manage
   the dynamics of accountability. By using process-tracing to examine one
   of the most critical situations of the third Grand Coalition under
   Chancellor Angela Merkel this article answers the question of how
   governments manage legitimacy and accountability in times of internal
   crisis. First, the article reveals the relationship between the
   throughput dimension of legitimacy and accountability. Second, both
   concepts may be useful in understanding current challenges for
   governments. Third, accountability dynamics lead to institutionalised
   and unquestioned patterns of government decision-making. From a
   new-institutionalist perspective, it argues that battles for
   accountability lead to legitimate decisions.},

Abstract = {Why does an authoritarian regime adopt meritocracy in its political
   selection? I argue that meritocracy can be used to co-opt large numbers
   of ordinary citizens by providing them with an opportunity of
   socioeconomic advancement instead of income redistribution, as long as
   the selection process is viewed as inclusive and rule-based. Focusing on
   the civil service examination in contemporary China, I examine how this
   meritocratic selection has shaped the relationship between college
   graduates and the Chinese regime. Exploiting a spatial-cohort variation
   in applicant eligibility, I find that the exam boosts college graduates'
   perceived upward mobility, which in turn weakens their demand for
   redistribution even in the face of growing inequality. These findings
   point to an alternative mode of authoritarian co-optation and highlight
   the role of upward mobility in regime stability.},

Abstract = {Populism comes in so many forms, both historically and in its
   contemporary manifestations, that we cannot assess its relationship with
   democratic institutions as if it were homogeneous. In this article, we
   reconnect with the history of the first movements that have called
   themselves populists and draw on an understanding of populism as an
   egalitarian impulse against oligarchic tendencies, centred on
   anti-elitism and the defense of a democratic common sense. This genetic
   approach goes against the dominant definitions which tend to overstretch
   its range of application while assuming a form of anti-pluralism as part
   of its common features. Then, we draw attention to the diversity of
   conceptions of democracy within populist thought and practices and show
   that the types of democratic institutions favoured by populist
   movements, and their attitudes towards intermediary bodies, are highly
   contextual. Finally, we argue that populism's inherent ambiguities shed
   some doubt on its capacity to respond to the current challenges faced by
   representative institutions.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how high-level bureaucrats evaluate the leadership
   of technocrat and partisan cabinet ministers in different roles of
   policymaking. The argument is that bureaucrats perceive ministers with
   policy expertise to have a central role in policymaking, especially in
   policy-directing tasks. Despite their essential contribution to
   coalition formation, ministers with political experience are negatively
   evaluated in all policymaking roles. The article presents evidence based
   on an endorsement experiment conducted with the high-level bureaucracy
   in Brazil. The results show that ministers with policy experience
   receive positive evaluations from the bureaucracy in policy formulation
   and implementation roles but not to carry out political coordination
   activities with the presidency or the legislature. Ministers with a
   partisan profile receive negative evaluations in all tasks of the policy
   process. Exploring the mechanism, we show that the negative assessment
   of ministers with a partisan profile is maintained even when the profile
   of the bureaucrat is considered. These results show the negative
   attitudes of high-level bureaucrats towards partisan ministers in
   contexts of substantial patronage and corruption and contribute to the
   debate on ministerial appointments and their implications for
   policymaking.},

Title = {Still sacrificial lambs? Yes! Minority groups in Canadian federal
   elections, 2015-2021},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {87},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper explores whether LGBTQ2S+, racial minorities, Indigenous and
   women candidates are more likely to be nominated in electoral districts
   in which they have a limited chance of being elected, that is to be
   ``sacrificial lambs{''}. We examine the Canadian case since it is
   well-known for its liberal attitudes regarding diversity (Pew Research,
   2020) which may, presumably, shelter candidates of minority groups from
   such discrimination in electoral politics. Our analysis mobilizes a
   dataset of candidates who ran for office in the 2015, 2019 and 2021
   Canadian federal elections. We consider how partisanship, incumbency,
   and intersectionality impact the likelihood of minority candidates to be
   nominated in (non-) winnable electoral districts. Our study shows that
   women and LGBTQ2S+ candidates are particularly overrepresented in
   hard-to-win districts. In addition, minority candidates running for the
   two largest parties are more likely to be nominated in districts their
   party lost by a landslide at the previous election compared to minority
   candidates of other parties. Our study also confirms that incumbency is
   a significantly impediment to the election of minority candidates.
   Overall, minority groups are still sacrificial lambs in Canadian
   elections.},

Abstract = {This article explores the trend of increasing nationalization in
   American politics and its effect on the U.S. Senate's federalizing
   dynamics, using campaign finance as an indicator. We analyze the
   geographic distribution of campaign contributions to U.S. Senate races
   from 1984 to 2020, tracing the nationalization of donor behavior in
   America. Key findings suggest that more ideologically conservative
   senators and those running for their first election are likely to rely
   heavily on out-of-state donations, with regional differences also
   evident. We argue that the nationalization of campaign finance
   challenges the Senate's representative structure and hints at another
   dimension of inequality in American politics-geographical versus
   national influence. This study offers no definitive normative argument
   but posits restricting out-of-state donations as a potential solution to
   address the growing inequality in the voting power of Senate members.},

Title = {The micro-foundations of social democratic welfare chauvinism and
   inclusion: class demand and policy reforms in Western Europe, 1980-2018},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {In Western European welfare states, research shows that support for
   welfare chauvinism, or the notion that welfare benefits for immigrants
   should be restricted, is highest among white, blue-collar working-class
   voters. On the other hand, higher-educated, middle-class voters are more
   likely to reject welfare chauvinism and support the inclusion of
   immigrants into the welfare state. For social democratic parties, this
   might pose an electoral dilemma between generous welfare states and open
   borders: They rely on both middle- and working-class constituencies and
   are ideologically tied both to a universal welfare state and the
   protection of (national) workers. To what extent does such an electoral
   dilemma between classes exist for social democratic parties? How do
   social democratic parties solve this dilemma when in government? In this
   paper, we postulate that a class divide around welfare chauvinism exists
   within the electorate for social democratic parties and that these
   parties' policies in government reflect these divides: If the social
   democratic electorate has a high share of working-class voters, they
   should act more welfare chauvinist than if their electorate is mostly
   middle class. We test these hypotheses by combining survey and
   macro-level policy data in 14 Western European countries from 1980 to
   2018. We find consistent evidence of the existence of a
   working-class/middle-class divide regarding welfare chauvinism, even
   within social democratic electorates. On the macro-level, we find
   partial evidence that social democratic parties in power respond to the
   class demands of their electorate: They are less welfare chauvinist when
   they have a higher proportion of middle-class voters, whereas their
   working-class vote share does not significantly condition their policies
   at all, contrary to assumptions in the literature. We therefore conclude
   that as social democratic parties become parties of the middle classes,
   the likelihood that they will retrench immigrant welfare rights reduces.},

Abstract = {Right-wing candidates have rallied against same-sex marriage, abortion,
   and `gender ideology' in several recent Latin American elections,
   attracting socially conservative voters. Yet, these issues are largely
   irrelevant to voting decisions in other parts of the region. Drawing on
   theories explaining partisan shifts in the US and Europe, we argue that
   elite and social movement debates on sexuality politics create
   conditions for electoral realignment. When politicians take polarized
   positions on newly salient `culture war' issues, the masses' voting
   behaviour shifts. Using region-wide multilevel analysis of the
   AmericasBarometer and Latinobarometro and a conjoint experiment in
   Brazil, Chile, and Peru, we demonstrate that the rising salience of
   sexuality politics creates new electoral cleavages, magnifying the
   electoral impact of religion and sexuality politics attitudes and
   shrinking the impact of economic views. Whereas scholarship on advanced
   democracies posits the centrality of partisanship, our findings indicate
   that sexuality politics prompts realignments even in weak party systems.},

Abstract = {How do governments manage expectations from international capital keen
   on pressuring them into adopting market-oriented economic policies
   during times of crises? Studying executive communication in 267 annual
   state-of-the-union speeches in 12 Latin American countries between 1980
   and 2014 reveals two broad options for strategic position-taking on
   economic policies. First, when times are dire, presidents not only talk
   more about the economy and less about social policy, but they also
   attempt to repurpose other policies as an investment in development.
   Second, economic turmoil encourages presidents to signal policies, which
   are appealing to international capital owners. However, while currency
   crises exert more enduring pressure, the effects of loan crises are more
   fleeting. Our results are particularly relevant to all who seek to
   understand how governments use public statements to address pressures
   from financial markets.},

Abstract = {In this article I recuperate a structure-oriented account of a politics
   of becoming from the work of Iris Young, one that rejects identity
   politics to focus instead on redressing structural injustice. Young
   offers a theorization of democracy that at once acknowledges our inner
   multiplicity and our individual capacity to shape our identity, and
   views equality and inclusion as important political goals that require
   eliminating structural injus-tice. For Young, fully embracing the
   multiplicity and fluidity of groups entails a shift away from
   conceptualizing groups in terms of identity, toward view-ing groups as
   structural positions. Emancipation thus cannot be achieved through
   including marginalized identities (e.g., through group-based
   rep-resentation) but only through attention to how particular social
   positions become the site of structural advantage or disadvantage.},

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the Factoring Regulation
   (Amendment) Bill 2021 in stabilizing the economic situation of micro,
   small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in India using doctrinal
   research methods and comparative study. It compared the factoring
   regulations of India and China. The authors analyse the ramifications of
   the recent amendments to the Factoring law via a comprehensive
   literature review, legal frameworks, and comparative analysis of India
   and China. This study seeks to cast light on the potential of the
   Factoring Law in addressing the financial challenges encountered by SMEs
   in India. The findings provide policymakers, stakeholders, and
   researchers with vital insights into the regulatory framework's
   effectiveness and potential improvement areas. The research concluded
   that factoring is an important worldwide trade financing tool for
   economic development and financial inclusion since it promotes
   entrepreneurship, private enterprise, and supply chain finance. In order
   to raise its standing, India may consider adopting features from the
   Chinese Civil Code, setting regulations for factoring rights transfer,
   and prioritising creditor interests.},

Abstract = {In the face of the growing and widespread use of Twitter as a tool for
   government communications, it is relevant to explore its relationship
   with the development of the Open Government. This article examines the
   technical, political, and social implications of Twitter in Open
   Government policies through a methodology that combines theoretical
   reflection and analysis of secondary sources. It focuses on analyzing
   the dimensions of Twitter as a social network, niche communication
   medium, and public opinion space. It becomes evident that Twitter
   presents both challenges and opportunities for the Open Government, as
   it offers greater visibility and transparency while also generating
   dynamics of polarization and disinformation that fuel post-truth.
   Furthermore, it is highlighted that Twitter plays a significant role in

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between media consumption and
   voting choices in India in the context of increasing exposure to media,
   both traditional and new. Using media exposure-related data from the
   Centre for the Study of Developing Societies' (CSDS) national election
   surveys since 1996, it makes a few key assertions. Historically, there
   has been a positive relationship between traditional news media exposure
   and voting for the BJP, i.e., the greater the voters' TV and newspaper
   consumption, the higher their support for the BJP. With respect to the
   Congress party, the tendency has generally been the opposite. This
   pattern now extends to social media exposure as well. However, this
   impact of media exposure on voting preferences that's visible at the
   broad level weakens considerably when slicing the data further by
   socio-demographic factors. It has been found that the trend of the BJP's
   vote share rising with increasing exposure to media is not consistent
   across the categories of age, education, and caste during many
   elections. If there is one election, however, that bucked this trend, it
   was the 2014 Lok Sabha election. The article argues that the BJP was
   successful in recognizing this and capitalized on it through an
   extensive media and communications campaign in 2014.},

Title = {Prelude to Genocide or Late-Stage ``Territorialism{''}? The Nazi
   ``Madagascar Plan{''} in Comparative and Colonial Context, 1936-1940},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-48},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Most scholars argue that the ``Madagascar Plan{''} constituted the
   penultimate stage in the development of the Nazi ``Final Solution,{''}
   representing a commitment to physical attrition presaging outright
   extermination. The idea of mass Jewish resettlement in Madagascar or
   another African colonial territory was no Nazi invention, however. It
   had been broached by various parties since the late nineteenth century,
   not least of which the Poles, French, British and even Jewish
   ``territorialists{''} seeking an alternative to Zionism. Nor was the
   Nazi Madagascar Plan, for all its problematic assumptions about race,
   space, minority rights, and ``permanent security,{''} inherently
   (proto-) genocidal. The goal of this article is to place the Nazi
   version of the Madagascar Plan back in this broader historical lineage
   of late-stage European colonialism and more specifically
   ``territorialism,{''} avoiding the teleological assumption that such a
   solution represented an attritionist prelude to genocide. After a brief
   summary of its pre-history, this article draws on extensive primary
   source research to reconstruct the Polish, French, and British
   discussions of such plans between 1936 and 1938. It then turns to
   similar investigations conducted by Nazi officials between Summer 1937
   and Summer 1940, based largely on primary sources, comparing the two
   projects and their implications for understanding the (Nazi) ``Jewish
   Question.{''} The article concludes that the Madagascar Plan constituted
   the Third Reich's last, most ambitious effort to ``solve{''} the
   ``Jewish Question{''} within the colonial framework that had defined
   most ``territorialist solutions{''} to Jewish and other refugee and
   minority ``questions{''} since the late nineteenth century. Such
   continuities between German and European colonialism and Nazi
   ``solutions{''} to the ``Jewish Question,{''} while racist and
   disdainful of Jews and indigenous populations, had less to do with
   Windhoek, much less Auschwitz, and more to do with pre-1940 plans to
   settle ``surplus{''} European minority and refugee populations in
   colonial spaces.},

Title = {What is The Employability Value of a Degree in Politics and
   International Relations?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Students entering contemporary higher education have the question of
   employability at the forefront of their minds, both when deciding which
   institution to study at and which subject to study. However, the notion
   of the ``employability agenda{''} is not often welcomed by academics.
   Focusing on teaching and learning in the UK, this article draws on
   Daubney's (2022) concept of ``extracted employability{''} to ask what
   students of Politics and International Relations can expect in terms of
   employability outcomes from their degree and how that employability
   value can best be communicated. Highlighting resistance from academics
   and students to integrating employability into a demanding curriculum,
   this article, referencing the 2023 QAA Subject Benchmark Statement for
   Politics and International Relations, offers a subject-specific
   employability proposal. This suggestion could enhance Politics and
   International Relations degrees and be incorporated into
   institution-wide curricula and student recruitment activities. The
   Subject Benchmark Statement is utilized as a common understanding of the
   nature and standards of study in a subject area; one that can be applied
   in the delivery and promotion of degrees to help answer the call for
   those delivering Politics and International Relations teaching and
   learning to be more confident in their articulation of the employability
   value of a degree in the field.},

Abstract = {Center-left parties in Western Europe and Japan have experienced a
   persistent decline in voter turnout. This study examines the factors
   contributing to this weakening support. Using data from the 2016
   European Social Survey across 13 countries and the 2017-2018 Japanese
   General Social Surveys, we tested three hypotheses: labor market
   dualization between insiders and outsiders; divergence in policy
   preferences between social investment and social compensation; and a
   cultural divide between liberalism and authoritarianism. Our findings
   provide little support for the labor market dualization and policy
   preference divergence hypotheses in both Western Europe and Japan. The
   third hypothesis, concerning a cultural divide in attitudes toward
   immigration, is supported only in Western Europe. Conversely, Japan is
   an anomaly because of the absence of a substantial left-liberal
   constituency. The scarcity of liberal values among Japan's sociocultural
   professionals suggests that center-left parties have underdeveloped core
   constituencies.},

Abstract = {Contemporary political theory (CPT) has approached questions of
   plurality and diversity by drawing rather implicitly on anthropological
   accounts of difference. This was the case with the `cultural turn',
   which significantly shaped theories of multiculturalism. Similarly, the
   current `ontological turn' is gaining influence and leaving a marked
   impact on CPT. I examine the recent turn and assess both the
   possibilities it offers and the challenges it poses for decentering CPT
   and opening radical, decolonial avenues for thinking difference
   otherwise. I take Paul Nadasdy's critique of the ontological turn as an
   invitation to reflect on the methodological precepts that inform how the
   field frames the scope and limits of comparison. In pursuit of this, I
   examine the Zapatistas' notion of a `world of many worlds', which
   provides a way of approaching difference that captures the generative
   aspects of the ontological turn while avoiding the pitfalls of
   relativism and political inertia. I argue that the Zapatistas' insights
   offer ethical guidance towards social and ecological thriving.
   Ultimately, my goal is to move CPT towards a more capacious form of
   making sense of what is out there in the world, and thus make room for
   better ways of inhabiting the Earth.},

Abstract = {Although space colonization appears to belong to the world of science
   fiction, private corporations owned by Silicon Valley billionaires-and
   supported by the US state-have spent billions making it a reality.
   Analyses of space colonialism have sometimes viewed these projects as
   distinct from earthly histories of colonialism, instead locating them
   within traditions of libertarianism, neoliberalism, or
   techno-utopianism. By reconstructing technology elites' political
   visions for celestial settlements within the literature on colonial-era
   corporations and property, this study argues that the idea of outer
   space as an empty frontier relies on the same logic of
   territorialization that was used to justify terrestrial colonialism and
   indigenous dispossession. It further traces how the idea of
   ``engineering territory{''} has inspired wider Silicon Valley political
   exit projects such as cyberspace, seasteading, and network states,
   which, rather than creating spaces of anarchical freedom, are attempting
   to recreate the territorial state in new spaces.},

Abstract = {Hegemonic practices of memorialization rely on narratives of heroic,
   morally untainted resistance, which cast traitors as the aberrant
   ``other.{''} This paper draws on Simone de Beauvoir's The Ethics of
   Ambiguity and historical and sociological accounts of betrayal to
   trouble this binary and construct a framework for memorializing betrayal
   in its ambiguity-in relation to the everyday reality of tragic dilemmas
   that resisters face. I show how attentiveness to the ambiguity of
   betrayal can help rethink heroic resistance myths beyond the
   exclusionary logic pitting moral purity against the depravity of
   treason-and warn against the reproduction of systematic practices of
   othering in the new political order. The paper develops the political
   relevance of this theoretical exploration via the example of a South
   African novel, The Texture of Shadows, examining how its insights into
   the ambiguity of betrayal challenge the myths of heroic resistance in
   South Africa.},

Abstract = {The sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the European Union in 2002 help
   demonstrate how postcolonialism functions in the international system. A
   corpus of literature has emerged on how these sanctions have harmed the
   economy and jeopardised the lives and livelihoods of the people,
   sanction effectiveness, and also on how Zimbabwe can navigate them.
   There remain gaps in empirically contextualising the imposition of the
   sanctions apart from the common narrative of human rights abuses. This
   article uses purposive document analysis to analyse Zimbabwe-European
   Union relations with a view to try to unpack the complexities of the
   relationship between these two blocs. It shows that the inconsistent
   relationship goes beyond human rights abuses. The ideology of
   postcolonialism helps in explaining the embedded conflict between Africa
   and Europe. When the interests of the centre are threatened, the
   backlash is severe as was the case with Zimbabwe.},

Abstract = {The profundity of Samir Amin's contributions to the quest for the
   development of Africa and the global South is beyond questioning. From
   the onset, Amin focused on ways to promote autonomous development in the
   periphery. He advocated delinking and remained true to these convictions
   till the very end when he concluded that the challenge was not so much
   about the South moving out of the crisis of capitalism as it was about
   its moving out of a global capitalist system in crisis; or moving beyond
   capitalism. This paper interrogates the suitability of this central
   plank of Amin's political economy vis-a-vis Claude Ake's contention that
   the greatest impediment to African development inheres in the nature of
   its politics and that the solution is to be sought therein. We argued
   that the challenge for contemporary Africa is not so much about exiting
   the anarchial global capitalist system as it is about striking internal
   balance in the context of the larger systemic perturbations. But beyond
   comparing, we mapped the place of contemporary African intellectuals in
   the continent's development schema along the path of Ake's proposition
   and in pursuit of the shared vision of these two illustrious
   scholar-activists for a democratic and prosperous Africa.},

Abstract = {Despite broad adoption of digital media literacy interventions that
   provide online users with more information when consuming news,
   relatively little is known about the effect of this additional
   information on the discernment of news veracity in real time. Gaining a
   comprehensive understanding of how information impacts discernment of
   news veracity has been hindered by challenges of external and ecological
   validity. Using a series of pre-registered experiments, we measure this
   effect in real time. Access to the full article relative to solely the
   headline/lede and access to source information improves an individual's
   ability to correctly discern the veracity of news. We also find that
   encouraging individuals to search online increases belief in both
   false/misleading and true news. Taken together, we provide a
   generalizable method for measuring the effect of information on news
   discernment, as well as crucial evidence for practitioners developing
   strategies for improving the public's digital media literacy.},

Abstract = {Studies of noncooperative transitions find that domestic balances of
   power shaped postcommunist regime trajectories in favor of the powerful.
   Then, what determined the balance of power during a transition? Drawing
   on relational-network analysis in IR, I argue that the configuration of
   international ties determined the relative strength of democrats and
   Soviet-era elites. States with diversified ties between the US and the
   Soviet Union - that occupy a brokerage position- were more likely to
   democratize. Their ties with the US funneled material and non-material
   assistance into democrats in postcommunist states. However, states
   deeply integrated into the Soviet order resisted democratization to a
   greater extent. Their extensive ties to the Soviet order resulted in
   stronger Sovietization and Soviet legacies impeding democratization. The
   interplay of states' ties with the US and the Soviet Union, as a
   function of brokerage and integration, shaped the domestic balance of
   power, conditioning postcommunist political changes. Empirical analysis
   using medium-N analysis and case studies on the former Soviet Union
   republics lends support to the argument. The finding contributes to the
   literature on international determinants of regime changes by
   highlighting how underlying global power structures frame the domestic
   balance of power.},

Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The article systematizes some effects of the socio-legal relationships
   digitalization on legal reasoning from the perspective of
   governmentality studies. To this end, it considers legal rules and
   public policies as part of the modern process of rationalizing
   uncertainty. In the contrast between clinical and actuarial forecast
   rationalities, it proposes that digitization reinforces the weight of
   actuarial forecasting on individualized decisions, such as legal ones,
   dominated earlier by the former. All of this has a reformalizing effect
   on legal reasoning. To present its hypothesis, the article draws on two
   examples. On the one hand, it shows how the new possibilities of
   modeling judicial decisions can increase the weight of the background on
   the reasoning and future conduct of all legal-social operators. On the
   other hand, it indicates how the digital recreation of the facts
   relegates their clinical appreciation in favour of automated
   appreciation. This is how the greatest weight of the background on the
   new reasoning is founded, but it also opens the door to explore those
   reasonings according to a transparent and, therefore, reprogrammable
   decision tree, with the consequent change in key legal-social operators.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom suggests that women can face a punishment from
   voters for engaging in self-promotion. Self-promotion, highlighting your
   accomplishments, can be detrimental to women because such behavior
   violates feminine stereotypic expectations that women be modest and
   humble. I argue and show that voters do not punish women for engaging in
   self-promotion but there are different styles of self-promotion that are
   more beneficial to women than others. I argue that women will be most
   successful when they use a communal style of self-promotion that
   emphasizes feminine stereotypic qualities, such as compromise.
   Conversely, I argue that agentic forms of self-promotion, which draw on
   masculine qualities, will be less successful for women because agency
   violates feminine expectations for women. I test the effects of communal
   and agentic self-promotion using two experiments. The result shows two
   key findings. First, voters do not punish women incumbents for using
   agentic styles of self-promotion, but women receive more positive
   evaluations with communal self-promotion. Second, voters are slightly
   more likely to reward men for communal self-promotion relative to women
   legislators.},

Abstract = {Since 2010, televised campaign ads have proliferated, raising questions
   about gender differences in the number of ads outside groups air.
   Assuming incumbent Democratic women and Democratic women with prior
   office-holding experience run with support from their party and interest
   groups, we expect Democratic-leaning groups air more favorable ads
   supporting Democrats in races that include experienced or incumbent
   Democratic women than they do in races that include experienced or
   incumbent Democratic men. Conversely, we assume Republican women receive
   less support from their party and interest groups. We expect outside
   groups air more favorable ads supporting Republicans in races featuring
   experienced or incumbent Republican men than races including experienced
   or incumbent Republican women. Given the potential for backlash to
   attack ads, we expect Democratic- and Republican-leaning groups air more
   ads in races including experienced or incumbent male opponents than in
   races that include experienced or incumbent female opponents. We test
   these hypotheses by focusing on 2010-2018 U.S. Senate races and
   combining original data with data from the Wesleyan Media Project, the
   U.S. Census, and the Cook Political Report. Democratic- and
   Republican-leaning groups both sponsor significantly fewer ads in races
   featuring experienced female Democratic candidates compared to races
   including experienced male Democratic candidates.},

Abstract = {Policies that promote the common good may be politically infeasible if
   legislators representing `losing' constituencies are punished for
   failing to promote their district's welfare. We investigate how varying
   the local and aggregate returns to a policy affects voter support for
   their incumbent. In our first study, we find that an incumbent who
   favours a welfare-enhancing policy enjoys a discontinuous jump in
   support when their district moves from losing to at least breaking even,
   while the additional incremental political returns for the district
   doing better than breaking even are modest. This feature of voter
   response, which we replicate, has significant implications for
   legislative politics generally and, in particular, how to construct
   politically feasible social welfare-enhancing policies. In a second
   study, we investigate the robustness of this finding in a competitive
   environment in which a challenger can call attention to a legislator's
   absolute and relative performance in delivering resources to their
   district.},

Abstract = {One European policy response to the so-called migration crisis is an
   accelerated implementation of information campaigns in potential origin
   countries. Whether and how these campaigns can influence decisions about
   irregular migration, however, remains under explored. I argue that
   information campaigns reduce intentions to migrate irregularly and
   expect the effects to be more substantial when anxiety-inducing messages

Title = {A modern theodicy: John Rawls and `The Law of Peoples'},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 16},
Abstract = {John Rawls' The Law of Peoples has typically been read as an
   intervention in the field of `global justice'. In this paper, I offer a
   different and widely overlooked interpretation. I argue that The Law of
   Peoples is a secular theodicy. Rawls wants to show that the `great
   evils' of history do not condemn humankind by using a secularised form
   of moral faith to search for signs that the social world allows for the
   possibility of perfect justice. There are, I show, striking homologies
   between this argument and the Christian theodicy that Rawls wrote in
   1942, A Brief Inquiry into the Meaning of Sin and Faith. Perhaps more
   significantly, I draw out how there is, as Rawls himself appears to
   acknowledge, an intimate relationship between this redemptive project
   and Rawls' idealistic and moralistic approach to political philosophy.},

Abstract = {In South Korea, conservatism and progressivism were formed under major
   political and socioeconomic challenges since the establishment of the
   country in 1948. Moreover, the intensifying ideological polarization
   between conservatives and progressives since 2010 is discussed.
   Considering that these ideological terms were developed while overcoming
   national challenges, it is highly likely that deepening ideological
   polarization is related to the new challenge of economic inequality,
   which became rampant at the time. This article argues that the Korean
   government's measures to address inequality have affected ideological
   polarization. Specifically, the development of conservatism and
   progressivism in the Korean context are discussed and conservative
   governments' market-oriented policies and progressive governments'
   policies to address inequality are examined. Conservatism expanded
   during this process while progressivism strengthened, which was critical
   to the deepening of ideological polarization. Finally, the implications
   of this study are discussed.},

Abstract = {IMF interventions are often associated with rising political discontent
   in countries where the Fund intervenes. Studies examining this
   relationship, however, face the challenge of disentangling the impact of
   the IMF from the impact of the crisis that triggered the intervention.
   To address this challenge, we conduct survey experiments in Greece,
   Ireland, Portugal, and Spain and directly assess how voters evaluate the
   costs and benefits of an IMF intervention. We find that voters believe
   that the crisis will more likely be solved when the IMF intervenes, but
   they are also critical of the corresponding loss of national
   sovereignty. Because the former consideration, on average, dominates
   their assessment, IMF interventions increase the support of voters for
   unpopular economic policies. Nonetheless, cross-country differences
   suggest that continued public support for intervention hinges on the
   IMF's ability to deliver on its promise to help resolve the crisis.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {86},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The socio-economic gradient in political participation is a growing
   concern in Germany and many other democracies. We investigate whether
   campaigns that politicize socio-economic conflicts can mobilize the poor
   to become more politically active. Using a mixed-methods design that
   draws on party manifestos, election surveys, and focus group
   discussions, we show that the 2021 election followed a trend of
   re-positioning of the SPD, shifting their focus again towards
   redistributive issues. However, these changes were only partly perceived
   by citizens on the micro level. While greater politicization of
   socio-economic issues was followed by greater political involvement of
   the poor in recent elections, the SPD could not capitalize much on that
   development. Our qualitative findings indicate that the poor paid little
   attention to the SPD campaign discourse outside the minimum wage issue.
   Furthermore, it becomes obvious that the SPD faces a greater credibility
   problem among its former electorate.},

Abstract = {How does emigration affect tax preferences in migrant-sending countries?
   Experiencing public services in a high tax-capacity destination may
   reduce support for tax increases by throwing fiscal failure at home into
   stark relief (the socialization hypothesis). Alternatively, migrants'
   exclusion from certain public services may increase desire to fund these
   services in migrant origin countries (the exclusion hypothesis). We test
   these competing hypotheses with an online survey experiment in Mexico
   and explore variation in US healthcare access on fiscal policy
   preferences of migrant households. Migrant households, especially those
   with returned migrant members, are more supportive of taxation when tax
   revenue is earmarked for healthcare, a service to which many Mexican
   immigrants in the US lack access. It is migrants' exclusion from, rather
   than their socialization into, the fiscal contract in destination
   countries that influences fiscal policy preferences in their countries
   of origin.},

Abstract = {The expansion in the wealth of the extremely wealthy has received much
   attention in recent public and academic debate. In political theory, the
   phenomenon has only recently begun to be scrutinized. This article
   builds on these preliminary steps, exploring the normative reasons we
   have to worry about extreme wealth. Looking at the issues, first,
   through a distributive lens, we reveal that the excess wealth of the
   extremely wealthy compounds the injustice of inequality and
   insufficiency, making the situation distinctly unjust. Through a
   relational lens, we see that extreme wealth may create societal
   segregation, which poses distinct threats to solidarity. Finally, when
   the two previous perspectives interact, the particular ways in which the
   wealthy can influence society, change rules and norms and bend existing
   regulation to their advantage open up the possibility of vicious
   societal feedback loops.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explore why the `demolition' of values promoted by
   Matteo Renzi had profoundly different effects on the factions within the
   Partito Democratico (Democratic Party, PD). While several studies have
   examined the PD's political culture, few have investigated the changing
   attitudes of its factions. We help fill this gap in the literature by
   analysing the PD's intraparty divisions on the main dimensions of party
   competition in the new millennium. We draw inspiration from the theory
   of party change, arguing that changes in a party's dominant coalition
   craft a new party image. Based on a unique dataset from PD delegates to
   national assemblies, this article offers new empirical evidence on
   intraparty cohesion. Our multivariate analysis offers fresh evidence
   that under Renzi intraparty divisions on economic issues widened, while
   cohesion on ethical issues increased. Our work indicates that opening
   the black box of party politics sheds light on new party images.},

Abstract = {Avia Pasternak's Responsible Citizens, Irresponsible States makes a case
   for concluding that `intentional citizens' of states should be held
   liable, in the sense of being chargeable for remedial costs, when their
   state has caused wrongful damage to another state. In making this case,
   the book steers a course between purely ascriptive views that assign
   liability on the basis of membership alone, and intentionalist views
   that require a stronger connection with the fault. The exemptions from
   liability that the book acknowledges, however, may raise questions about
   its overall case, by implicating more individualized ideas of intention.
   Even so, the argument may be read as a compelling forward-looking
   warning about the risks of citizenship.},

Title = {Replicating the effects of Facebook deactivation in an ethnically
   polarized setting},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The question of how social media usage impacts societal polarization
   continues to generate great interest among both the research community
   and broader public. Nevertheless, there are still very few rigorous
   empirical studies of the causal impact of social media usage on
   polarization. To explore this question, we replicate the only published
   study to date that tests the effects of social media cessation on
   interethnic attitudes (Asimovic et al., 2021). In a study situated in
   Bosnia and Herzegovina, the authors found that deactivating from
   Facebook for a week around genocide commemoration in Bosnia and
   Herzegovina had a negative effect on users' attitudes toward ethnic
   outgroups, with the negative effect driven by users with more ethnically
   homogenous offline networks. Does this finding extend to other settings?
   In a pre-registered replication study, we implement the same research
   design in a different ethnically polarized setting: Cyprus. We are not
   able to replicate the main effect found in Asimovic et al. (2021): in
   Cyprus, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect. We do,
   however, find a significant interaction between the heterogeneity of
   users' offline networks and the deactivation treatment within our 2021
   subsample, consistent with the pattern from Bosnia and Herzegovina. We
   also find support for recent findings (Allcott et al., 2020; Asimovic et
   al., 2021) that Facebook deactivation leads to a reduction in anxiety
   levels and suggestive evidence of a reduction in knowledge of current
   news, though the latter is again limited to our 2021 subsample.},

Abstract = {Why are women strongly underrepresented in top political positions? We
   analyze the effect of party leaders' gender on their ability to
   capitalize on political power during negotiations to form a new
   government after elections. We leverage the as-if random assignment of a
   bargaining advantage in close local elections in Spain through a
   regression discontinuity design and find that women are about 25
   percentage points less likely than men to secure the mayor's position
   when they win elections by a narrow margin, even if their parties manage
   to join the governing coalition anyway. This article contributes to the
   understanding of the role of personal characteristics in the political
   process and has far-reaching implications for gender equality and the
   quality of democratic representation.},

Title = {Machine-learning applications to authoritarian selections: The case of
   China},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Elite selection in China has drawn significant attention given the
   importance of the country. Instead of relying on qualitative assessments
   from historical and personal insights, this study utilized
   machine-learning techniques to evaluate the promotion prospects of
   Chinese elites. By incorporating over 251 individual features of 18,179
   officials from 1982 to 2020, I built up an ensemble model to calculate
   the promotion probabilities of the previous Politburo members of the
   Communist Party of China (CPC). Methodologically, this study finds that
   the machine-learning predictions yielded approximately 20\% higher
   accuracy compared to the classical model, which employed the generalized
   linear model with theoretically identified variables. Moreover, this
   paper offers valuable insights into Chinese politics by highlighting
   that Xi Jinping's selection of central officials has diverged from
   historical patterns, while his decisions on provincial promotions do not
   exhibit notable differences from those made by his predecessors.},

Abstract = {The electoral tacha is an appeal that any Peruvian citizen can file
   against any candidate in subnational, non-presidential, elections. This
   article identifies the profile of the candidacies that are relatively
   more affected by the tachas. More precisely, it analyzes the role of
   political factors in electoral competition -such as the configuration of
   the competition (number of candidates) and the electoral strength of the
   candidate. Through the econometric analysis, I show that, indeed, the
   tachas are more likely to affect the strongest candidacies. The results
   of this study suggest that the use of the tachas could be contributing
   to further compromising representation and increasing confrontation
   among Peruvian parties.},

Title = {What's Wrong with the Critique of Populism},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Democracy is in crisis. According to a dominant view, the problem is
   populism. Populists, critics argue, undermine democracy through its own
   procedural and normative logic. This essay calls the critique of
   populism into question. I argue that critics misrepresent the
   significance of populism for democratic politics in three ways. First,
   by reducing populism to a single political logic, critics confound
   important differences between different instances of populism. Secondly,
   by blaming populists for the maladies of contemporary democracies,
   critics wrongly exonerate centrist political forces. Thirdly, critics
   underestimate the structural deficiencies of contemporary democracy. The
   main task for proponents of democracy today is not to fight populism,
   but to address the more fundamental sources of democratic decay: rising
   inequality, the decline of mass democracy, maltreatment of immigrants
   and ethnic minorities, and climate change.},

Abstract = {Racial capitalism depends on the reproduction of an existing racialized
   economic order. In this article, I argue that the disavowal of past
   injustice is a central way in which this reproduction is ensured and
   that market-based forms of knowledge production, such as for-profit
   predictive practices, play a crucial role in facilitating this
   disavowal. Recent debates about the fairness of algorithms, data
   justice, and predictive policing have intensified long-standing
   controversies, both popular and academic, about the way in which
   statistical and financial modes of accounting and predicting articulate,
   represent and produce ascriptive categories of hierarchically ordered
   social difference, and reproduce unjust social hierarchies and
   inequalities. These debates have productively problematized the racial
   lives of seemingly apolitical predictive technologies and demanded the
   re-politicization of predictive practices. What has been missing from
   these debates so far, however, is a more explicit engagement with ways
   in which anti-racist movements and activists themselves have contested
   the entanglements of prediction and race making. I turn to a recent
   prominent example, namely the contestation over racial discrepancies in
   subprime lending to examine how fair lending activists have
   conceptualized and troubled the reproduction of a racialized economic
   order through for-profit predictive practices in the decade before the
   Great Financial Crisis. I situate this particular example in the broader
   historical and political context of politicizing prediction that first
   emerged with the ascendancy of a liberal, individualist-proprietary
   conception of risk, and the political problem space to which this has
   given rise. My analysis shows that actuarial conceptions of fairness
   continue to reverberate in anti-racist contestations of for-profit
   predictive practices, and that they tend to marginalize and undercut
   more radical strands of critique of the racialization of financial
   markets. Insofar as these modalities of contestation implicitly
   reproduce a liberal, proprietary-individualist conception of risk, I
   argue, they fail to effectively challenge the quasi-alchemical
   transformation of injustice into personal responsibility, and thus
   contribute to the disavowal of past injustice.},

Abstract = {Presidents occupy a unique role as both the head of the executive branch
   and a de facto party leader. They nationalize politics and polarize
   lawmaking. Members of Congress know this, and they leverage the
   president's symbolic power to heighten political conflict. I argue that
   lawmakers, particularly those in the nonpresidential party, invoke the
   president to nationalize legislative debate and polarize constituent
   opinion. Using the text of House and Senate floor speeches between 1973
   and 2016 and a within-member panel design, I find that legislators
   reference the president more frequently in the out-party and
   increasingly so as a district's media environment becomes more
   nationalized. Presidential references are also moderated by constituency
   partisanship. I support the behavioral implications with a vignette
   experiment: when a Republican Senator invokes President Biden in a
   policy speech, Republican respondents increase approval of that Senator
   and oppose political compromise. This research highlights the
   institutional consequences of nationalization and negative partisanship.},

Abstract = {Why do people's preferences towards trade liberalization fluctuate? And
   why do we observe the eventual return of public support towards free
   trade? The traditional literature in international political economy has
   typically calculated individuals' preferences based on their comparative
   advantage as income-earners, which arises from their specific or general
   skill level or employment status. What needs to be taken into account,
   however, is that their economic preferences are constructed based upon
   their intertwined identities as both income-earners and consumers. We
   designed and conducted an experiment in Japan (2015) that would
   impartially elicit answers regarding respondents' daily consumption
   patterns or (and) employment concerns rather than deliberately or
   artificially informing them of the potential benefits or harms of trade
   liberalization. The results display that consumer priming offsets
   negative impacts arising from employment priming. The consumer effect
   reduces individuals' concerns on income level or employment when they
   are exposed to consumer and employment primings simultaneously.
   Furthermore, our subgroup analyses reveal that the consumer effect
   remains even among those experiencing economic fragility such as low
   income or job insecurity. This suggests that potential losers have
   incentives to support free trade by appreciating consumer benefits.},

Abstract = {This article examines the implications of the Association of Southeast
   Asian Nations (ASEAN) centrality in East Asian regionalism. It seeks to
   address the question of how ASEAN created and maintained its central
   position in East Asian regionalism by managing regional cooperation in
   general and institution-building in particular. This article addresses
   the question by relying on the theoretical concept of productive power
   and tangible attributes associated with the concept. This article makes
   three arguments. First, ASEAN maintained its central position in East
   Asian regionalism by exerting productive power that works in generalized
   and diffuse social processes and through constitutive social relations.
   Second, the Association developed and employed specific meanings and
   norms that constituted the foundation for regional cooperation. Third,
   ASEAN maintained its central position in the complicated Sino-Japanese
   rivalry by embedding them in constitutive social relations and avoiding
   exclusive links with each of the two states.},

Abstract = {This article reconstructs the bureaucratic and legal processes that
   culminated in the creation of the modern national security
   classification system in Executive Order No. 10,290, issued by Harry
   Truman in 1951. It argues that classification was shaped by processes of
   improvisation endogenous to the federal bureaucracy, which produced the
   problems of overclassification, definitional vagueness, and ambiguous
   constitutional status that have haunted the secrecy regime until the
   present. In so doing, it provides new insight into the development of
   the modern presidency, the national security state, and American
   democracy, and suggests possible paths to reform the contemporary
   pathologies of the classification system.},

Abstract = {On the premise that issues of fairness are important to voting behavior
   but often unrecognized, we explore how feelings of unfairness increase
   support for populist parties. We distinguish personal unfairness, the
   view that one's own economic situation is unfair, from social
   unfairness, the view that the economic situation of others in society is
   unfair. Based on findings in psychology, we argue that uncertainties
   associated with the transition to a globalized knowledge economy
   heighten people's feelings of personal unfairness and find empirical
   support for that contention. We develop arguments about why feelings of
   personal unfairness should increase support for the populist right and
   feelings about social unfairness should increase support for the
   populist left and find empirical support for them. Our results
   contribute to explanations for why people vote for the populist right
   rather than the left and underline the roles that uncertainty and issues
   of fairness play in electoral politics.},

Abstract = {A growing body of comparative public policy research examines the
   effects of delegated delivery of public services and the related
   emergence of what is labelled a submerged state that obscures the role
   of government in the provision of public services. Data limitations have
   constrained investigations of these dynamics in Canada, including for
   K-12 education. In this research note, we draw on charitable tax records
   and provincial and federal spending data to present the evolution of
   provincial and federal financial support for independent schools over
   time, drawing on the case of British Columbia (BC). By factoring in
   indirect support through various tax mechanisms, we establish that BC
   independent schools have seen increasing financial support from both the
   federal and provincial governments in recent decades, primarily via tax
   expenditures tied to their charitable status-a ``not hidden but not
   visible{''} shift in public expenditure that has substantial political,
   distributive and accountability implications.
   De plus en plus de recherches comparatives sur les politiques publiques
   mettent l'accent sur les effets de la delegation des services publics et
   sur l'emergence de ce que l'on appelle un etat submerge qui obscurcit le
   role du gouvernement dans la fourniture des services publics. Le manque
   de donnees a limite les recherches sur ces dynamiques au Canada, y
   compris pour l'education de la maternelle a la 12e annee. Dans cette
   note de recherche, nous nous appuyons sur les registres fiscaux des
   organismes de bienfaisance et sur les donnees relatives aux depenses
   provinciales et federales pour presenter l'evolution du soutien
   financier provincial et federal aux ecoles independantes au fil du
   temps, en nous appuyant sur le cas de la Colombie-Britannique (BC). En
   tenant compte du soutien indirect par le biais de divers mecanismes
   fiscaux, nous etablissons que les ecoles independantes de la
   Colombie-Britannique ont beneficie d'un soutien financier croissant de
   la part des gouvernements federal et provincial au cours des dernieres
   decennies, principalement par le biais de depenses fiscales liees a leur
   statut d'organisme de bienfaisance - un changement << non cache mais non
   visible >> dans les depenses publiques qui a d'importantes implications
   politiques, distributives et de responsabilisation.},

Abstract = {This article reconstructs the use that Hobbes makes of the concept of
   the << person >> in Leviathan, through an examination of the
   characteristics of the three subjects of his civil philosophy: the
   Multitude, the Commonwealth, and the Sovereign. Building on previous and
   extensive literature on the subject, I propose a new interpretation of
   what the Commonwealth is in Hobbes's civil philosophy, an ideological
   projection of the Sovereign for use by the Multitude. I also argue that
   this << production >> of some-thing inexistent, i.e. the will of the
   people, is always unstable and represents the birth of consensual
   politics in modern political theory.},

Abstract = {Scholars and policymakers widely view identity as a key driver of
   African citizens' political engagement. In doing so, however, they have
   emphasized ethnicity and largely sidelined other identities, including
   gender, local origin, shared residency, and partisanship. In this paper,
   we explore which identities drive political engagement and why they do
   so. We employ an original survey experiment that includes various
   identities and other incentives that may drive citizens' participation
   around Zambia's 2021 national elections. We find that partisanship most
   influences individuals' stated willingness to campaign for a candidate
   or meet with an MP, while ethnicity and social incentives play less
   significant roles. Finally, we explore the mechanisms underpinning these
   results and find that citizens anticipate sanctions if they fail to
   support a co-partisan but not a co-ethnic candidate. These findings have
   important implications for understanding political engagement and
   democratic development throughout the region.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the conflicting literature about indirect rule
   by delivering a new theoretical explanation for the persistent effects
   of indirect rule on contemporary provision of public goods. It looks at
   a single region of India which has areas that historically experienced
   both direct and indirect rule. The theoretical mechanism focuses on the
   principal-agent problem and the incentives that it produces for local
   leaders. Unlike local princes, colonizers were under stricter oversight
   and had to be more accountable to the top due to the obligations to
   extract resources. A spatial regression discontinuity design is used to
   compare directly and indirectly ruled territories. The empirical results
   show that indirect rule has predominantly long-term negative effects on
   the provision of selected public goods.},

Title = {Manufacturing Scarcity: Understanding the Causes of Conflicts Between
   Farmers and Herders in Asante Akim North Municipality of Ghana},

Abstract = {Farmer-herder conflicts are widespread in many parts of Africa. Scholars
   disagree on their causes. One strand associates conflict with absolute
   scarcities caused by for example population growth and climate change.
   Other scholars emphasize politically established scarcities: scarcities
   caused by policies, legislation, and development programs. This paper
   examines the causes of farmer-herder conflict in the case of Asante Akim
   North Municipality of Ghana; an area that has suffered from severe
   conflicts for the past two decades. The study relies on documentary
   materials and interviews with 53 respondents representing all main
   agents with a stake in the conflict. The paper argues that absolute
   scarcity (population growth and climate change) may play a role in
   conflict, but the key driver of conflict is political. The paper shows
   how the traditional authorities have allocated land to outside cattle
   owners without effective institutions to guide cattle herding. This has
   created conflicts between traditional farming and new herding interests.
   The paper contributes to the literature on farmer-herder conflict and
   political scarcity by presenting a case where scarcity is not produced
   by state-led policies and interventions at large-scale but by
   local-level traditional authorities and small-scale enclosures.},

Abstract = {Since Donald Trump's presidency and the diverse efforts to undermine the
   transfer of power after the 2020 election, the risks of extreme
   polarization and democratic backsliding in the United States (US) have
   been highlighted in the literature. Yet the epistemic dimension of these
   developments remains underresearched. Embedded in a genealogical
   Foucauldian governmentality/counter-conduct approach, this contribution
   addresses the puzzle of how election denialism and related (violent)
   anti-system activity are being rationalized, legitimized, and anchored
   in political subjectivities as efforts to `protect' American democracy.
   This perspective allows to inquire into liberalism's authoritarian
   potential that can be mobilized through different forms of
   counter-conduct. The study analytically disentangles these forms based
   on their prime targets, modes of operation, and the forms of knowledge
   they rely on. Focusing on the swing state of Arizona, the empirical
   analysis furthermore highlights the role of the subnational level in
   interlinking counter-conduct and (autocratizing) governmental practices
   in a federal system. Conceptually, the study renders visible a profound
   struggle over the epistemic foundations of the current liberal
   constitutional and political order that clearly transcends the issue of
   the 2020 election, Donald Trump, and even the context of the United
   States. Indeed, similar patterns of subjectivation and counter-conduct
   can also be detected for example in Germany. Moreover, this paper
   expands the scope of the concept of counter-conduct to study radical
   right-wing contestations and related questions of epistemic (in)justice.
   It thereby seeks to encourage debate on how political science can
   address the pluralization and polarization of contents, standards, and
   forms of knowledge as they become relevant to democratic backsliding.},

Abstract = {New Zealand has a very plural policing landscape, though little is known
   about many of its facets. This article provides initial answers to three
   crucial questions: Who plays a policing role in contemporary New
   Zealand, how is state power exercised, and what shapes
   state-society-policing relations? The findings show that neoliberalism
   has strongly affected state-society-policing relations, and several
   actors across the state and society divide partake in police-centred
   partnerships. It also finds that state-society-policing relations
   reflect ideological, political and socioeconomic divisions inherent in
   contemporary New Zealand but arching back to its founding days. This
   emerges through analysing how the two main community-led policing
   initiatives, the Community Patrols New Zealand and the Maori wardens,
   relate to the police and the state. The findings matter beyond New
   Zealand and academia. They reiterate that plural policing is one of the
   primary expressions of how power is exercised in society, and it affects
   issues related to state legitimacy and social justice.},

Abstract = {What factors shape different levels of pro-government mobilization in
   authoritarian regimes? The existing literature has considered the threat
   of anti-regime protests as the primary driver of pro-government
   mobilization. While we confirm this finding in the literature, we argue
   that the regime's organizational infrastructure significantly
   contributes to pro-regime mobilization. We identify places of worship,
   university campuses, and state bureaucracy as three main sites where
   states could extend their organizations for pro-government mobilization.
   Previous scholarship has considered universities and places of worship
   as free spaces for oppositional activities, but we argue that states
   might try to penetrate these sectors to extend their organizational
   reach. The statistical analyses of our original data on pro-government
   mobilization in Iran from 2015 to 2019 at the district level (n = 429)
   provide robust support for this argument.},

Abstract = {Specialized anti-corruption agencies (ACAs) aim to address corruption
   problems when conventional institutional mechanisms are dysfunctional.
   Yet, we still lack thorough understanding of the conditions that enable
   ACAs to withstand undue influences of the overarching political regime.
   Informed by the judicial politics literature, we examine the value of
   public opinion in empowering ACAs. Leveraging the evolving political
   conditions of Hong Kong, we argue that a lack of public support for
   other government organs offers opportunities for an ACA to distinguish
   itself from the rest of the regime and establish operational
   independence. We find that a signature ACA of Hong Kong, created by the
   British colonial government, has been uniquely sensitive to public
   complaints of corruption. The agency is the most responsive when other
   government branches are perceived to be lacking integrity. Also,
   negative appraisals of the political regime encourage the ACA's
   institutional functions and increase the degree of enforcement
   discretion entrusted to it. Our findings suggest a mechanism of ACA
   empowerment whereby the public is committed to sustaining agency
   independence because of their distrust and the unpopularity of other
   government organs. Therefore, potential institutional threats posed by
   an unpopular regime to the ACA may actually strengthen the latter's
   power and autonomy.},

Abstract = {Rumination, or negative repetitive thinking, is a significant risk
   factor for depression and a common and pervasive habit of thought. Using
   original data from two online surveys of British adults conducted in
   March 2021 and February 2022, we examine associations between measures
   of political engagement and the two types of depressive rumination
   computed from Nolen-Hoeksema's Response Styles Theory: brooding (the
   maladaptive component that assesses negative aspects of self-reflection)
   and reflective pondering (the adaptive component focused on
   problem-solving). We show that (1) higher brooding is associated with
   lower internal political efficacy and voting; (2) higher reflective
   pondering is associated with higher external political efficacy; and (3)
   reflective pondering increases voting propensity for nonpartisans but
   not for partisans. Thus, while maladaptive rumination is detrimental to
   political engagement, adaptive rumination appears to be beneficial. Our
   findings advance our understanding of the role of reflection in
   democratic citizenship.},

Abstract = {Despite advising on thousands of important decisions, who serves on
   presidential transition teams in the United States is largely unknown.
   The secretive and transient nature of transition planning explains why
   this is the case, but also reinforces why it is important to have a
   better understanding of who a president-elect might choose at this
   critical moment of the transfer of power. This article develops a theory
   of the transition team as well as a typology based on two factors:
   expertise and status. Original interviews with members of the 2020-2021
   Biden-Harris transition team then demonstrate the utility of this
   typology for better understanding the transition period.},

Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {There are potentially multiple sources that make it difficult to compare
   the typical survey measure of the left-right self-placement
   cross-nationally. We focus on differential item functioning (DIF) due to
   the different use of response scales when the left-right is framed as an
   aggregate dimension of policies. We also examine whether and to what
   extent ordinary citizens' use of the scale is cross-nationally
   comparable. Our goal is twofold. First, we assess the cross-national
   comparability of the left-right self-placement scale using the anchoring
   vignette method used in nine European countries. Second, we propose a
   measure that quantifies the extent of DIF at the country level. Our
   original survey and other benchmark studies suggest that the size of
   cross-national DIF (CN-DIF) in citizens' use of a left-right scale is
   relatively small when the left-right concept is considered in policy
   terms and when a comparison is made between Western European countries.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the political factors that explain state
   responses to demands for indigenous territorial autonomy in Ecuador and
   Bolivia. Specifically, we aim to explain why the 2009 Bolivian
   constitution limited indigenous territorial autonomy to the departmental
   level, not allowing indigenous peoples to establish autonomous regions
   that lay beyond a single departmental jurisdiction, whereas the 2008
   Ecuadorian constitution allows indigenous jurisdictions to exceed
   provincial boundaries. We argue that, in Bolivia, a strong conservative
   autonomy movement led by the country's eastern departments forced state
   officials to negotiate with regional elites, thus limiting the window of
   opportunity for indigenous movements and their allies to demand
   territorial autonomy. In the absence of a strong territorialized threat
   in Ecuador, indigenous movements and their allies had larger windows of
   opportunity to press their claims for territorial autonomy. This study
   contributes to comparative research on how states have simultaneously
   affirmed and limited indigenous autonomy.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the argumentative turn amongst farmers and the
   other different stakeholders in the case of land disputes, Kebumen,
   Central Java, Indonesia. While policy makers insisted that the land
   function conversion from agriculture and tourism to mining was needed to
   support local development as through the absorption of labors into
   employment sector, as well as to improve local people's income, local
   farmers insisted that the conversion merely uprooting their ownership of
   land and let them back to periods where they were jobless and lack of
   source of income decades ago. This paper applied qualitative research
   supported with observation and interviews with parties involved in the
   case, to highlight the argumentative turn within land policy, which in
   the case of Kebumen leads to policy conflict. This paper identifies the
   elite-driven policy in the land dispute cases in Kebumen has led policy
   close to discussions with various stakeholders, which are necessary to
   be heard in the policy making. This finding highlights the idea that
   policy creates within itself politics that is in-line with the interest
   of the elites, and yet, resulted in the feedback loop, manifested
   through the strong resistance of the community.},

Abstract = {It has long been established that the presence of the so-called ``Ghent
   systems{''} of unemployment insurance greatly enhances unionization
   rates. This paper investigates the political determinants of the choice
   for and against the introduction and continuation of these systems.
   Based on a diachronic analysis of three paradigmatic cases, Belgium, the
   Netherlands, and Sweden, and two shadow cases, Germany and Britain, it
   shows that all major actors were well aware of their organizational
   effect during the first half of the 20th century. At the same time, it
   shows that long-term strategic thinking only played a major role in
   shaping party attitudes toward ``Ghent{''} in countries where the
   prevailing party system ensured that its introduction produced clear
   partisan ``winners{''} and ``losers.{''} In all other countries, cost
   considerations were central in shaping party views on Ghent. The
   analysis shows how cost considerations can explain both bourgeois party
   support for its introduction and left-party support for its
   discontinuation.},

Abstract = {Harriet Gray, Nicola Lester and Emma Norton present the first
   peer-reviewed, empirical academic study that explores servicewomen's
   lived experiences of sexual assault, and its aftermath, in the British
   military. They argue that responses to sexual violence within the
   military space are often shaped by gendered military culture and by the
   prioritisation of institutional needs over individual wellbeing and,
   moreover, that this can be experienced as a form of institutional
   betrayal. In response to these findings, the authors call for a much
   broader reckoning with the British military's problem with sexual
   violence that goes far beyond present reforms to its criminal justice
   system.},

Abstract = {Political philosophers rarely take on the topic of political corruption,
   despite the fact that corruption is so costly to human wellbeing, and so
   clearly separates well-governed from poorly governed polities. Ceva and
   Ferretti's book is the most complete attempt to remedy this deficit to
   date. Their key contribution is to conceptualize institutions in such a
   way that the offices they define link clearly to public ethics.
   Officeholders are accountable for their power mandate, not just within a
   hierarchy, but ethically, because their duties serve the public purposes
   that justify the institution. This said, their approach works best for
   impartial institutions in which the public duties of offices are clear
   and actionable, such as professional bureaucracies. We also need an
   ethically driven conception of political corruption for political
   institutions that contain and channel political partiality, especially
   democratic institutions within which the ethical purposes of public
   legislation are argued, deliberated, and voted. Extending a public
   ethics account of political corruption to democratic institutions can
   and should be a next step in this important project.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {77},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-44},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A growing literature finds that social identity attachments to
   ideological and partisan groups often generate mistrust, hostility, and
   prejudice toward opposition groups. Yet, there are no studies of whether
   attachments to ideological groups (i.e., left, right, liberal, and
   conservative) contribute to political intolerance-defined as an
   unwillingness to extend basic liberties to groups one opposes-a widely
   studied and politically consequential form of outgroup hostility. Using
   both observational and experimental data, we examine how social identity
   attachments to left-right groups in Israel influence Jewish Israelis'
   political intolerance of disliked domestic groups, that is, least-liked
   groups and Arab citizens. In contrast to other studies-mostly in the
   US-that find roughly parallel levels of political and social prejudice
   toward opposition groups, we theorize and find that more strongly
   attached rightists and leftists in Israel become more polarized in their
   levels of political tolerance toward disliked groups. Among rightists,
   stronger identities decrease tolerance, whereas among leftists,
   political tolerance increases. Thus, outside the US, identity strength
   can actually be a protector of democratic values, leading some groups
   (i.e., Jewish leftists) to become more tolerant.},

Abstract = {In light of the German government's long-held preference against EU-wide
   fiscal burden-sharing, a hallmark of the Euro crisis, its support for an
   EU-wide debt-instrument during the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a
   dramatic policy U-turn. To make sense of the `Berlin puzzle', we develop
   a theoretical mechanism that explores why an initially reluctant German
   government heeded to the call for transnational fiscal solidarity:
   First, to avoid a `common bad' of a large-scale economic contraction,
   proposals for an EU-wide fiscal response became a political imperative.
   Second, the successful framing of the crisis as `nobody's fault'
   rendered the call for European solidarity as the dominant standard of
   legitimacy to which all governments subscribed. Third, governments whose
   preferences were not aligned with this standard faced mounting normative
   pressure and isolation. As a result, governments changed their
   positions, but not their preferences. We probe this mechanism by
   carrying out a process-tracing analysis of the German government's
   fiscal policy U-turn in the crucial months preceding the adoption of the
   Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery plan in July 2020. The paper
   contributes to the growing literature on fiscal burden-sharing in the EU
   by demonstrating when and how member states can change their stance on
   transnational fiscal burden-sharing.},

Abstract = {Are demands for equality motivated by envy? Nietzsche, Freud, Hayek, and
   Nozick all thought so. Call this the Envy Objection. For egalitarians,
   the Envy Objection is meant to sting. Many egalitarians have tried to
   evade the Envy Objection. But should egalitarians be worried about envy?
   In this article, I argue that egalitarians should stop worrying and
   learn to love envy. I argue that the persistent unwillingness to embrace
   the Envy Objection is rooted in a common misunderstanding of the nature
   of the charge, what it reveals, and what can be said in response to it.
   I develop what Bernard Williams might call a vindicatory genealogy of
   envy, thereby allowing us to see that envy, rather than undermining
   egalitarian intuitions, can in fact play a distinct justificatory role
   (when it is fitting), which undermines the Envy Objection.},

Abstract = {Many documented cases of policy transfer in Asia involve small and
   medium enterprises as well as public enterprises but little is known
   about how and why these local private actors participate in
   transnational policy transfer networks. We propose a relational view of
   policy transfer to examine how agency is exercised in these kinds of
   transfer networks. We develop a typology of the engagement of these
   private actors-solutionist and entrepreneur-based on their relational
   position in the policy transfer process and illustrate its usefulness
   using two cases of policy transfer between: (1) Yokohama (Japan) and
   Cebu (Philippines) and (2) Singapore and New Clark City (Philippines). A
   common theme in these networks is the diffused nature of agency where
   local private actors are pulled in to provide epistemic resources.},

Abstract = {How does a crisis of the state and its `emergency politics' lead to a
   crisis of the intellectual, or what does it mean to be an intellectual
   in our contemporary conjuncture beyond Western cliches and the
   universalistic bias of their declinist arguments? In responding to these
   questions, we draw upon data collected from Turkish and Syrian academics
   living in exile to argue that the critical commitments exiled
   intellectuals presume are under threat as rising authoritarianisms take
   hold globally and advanced neo-liberal practices tighten their grip on
   universities. The promise of Said's figuration of the `intellectual in
   exile' and its political potential is also under threat as displaced
   scholars navigate democratic backsliding and structural precarity in the
   contemporary university and in the nation-states to which they have
   found themselves tied, eroding even further the conceptual idea of the
   critical intellectual and the potential power of the `post-colonial
   intellectual'. In our research, this crisis of the intellectual is
   recounted by exilics paradoxically in both the autocratic and the
   `nominally democratic' higher education (HE) context where in some cases
   the very idea of the intellectual can represent, at least in part, a
   banal political figuration epitomised in what Nancy Fraser refers to as
   progressive neo-liberalism. This is largely so because both
   authoritarian and nominally democratic states, whilst different in
   political charge, are simultaneously invoking `states of emergency' and
   culture wars that are eroding their own intellectual constituencies'
   ability to disturb existing institutional norms and the taken for
   granted problems that emerge in everyday HE practices.},

   and especially in times of economic crisis or political turmoil, Italian
   presidents have actively intervened in a significant way to safeguard
   the Constitution and improve the working of the Italian political
   system. In this context, the `extended presidency' of Sergio Mattarella,
   originally elected in 2015 and then re-elected for a second, exceptional
   term in 2022, is no exception to the rule. As a matter of fact, the
   re-election of Mattarella (after the - at the time unprecedented -
   re-election of Giorgio Napolitano in 2013) has not only strengthened the
   role of the head of state vis-a-vis other political institutions and
   even more so the political parties, but it has even raised a number of
   questions concerning the very nature of Italy's parliamentary regime.
   Against this backdrop, this article analyses, from different analytical
   perspectives, the evolving role of the president of the Republic within
   the changing Italian political system by taking into consideration
   presidents' relationships - not always smooth - with the political
   parties, their atypical style of political communication (both online
   and offline), their exercise of executive power and, finally, their
   peculiar contribution to that process of more or less covert
   presidentialisation that has characterized Italian politics since the
   early 1990s.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Abstract = {The endogenous consequences of competition between the Roman Catholic
   Church and lay political rulers set into motion by the Investiture
   Controversy contribute new insights into European economic, political,
   and religious development. The resolution of the Investiture Controversy
   in the concordats of London (1107), Paris (1107), and Worms (1122)
   resulted in an increase in the bargaining power of lay rulers over the
   selection of bishops in wealthier dioceses relative to poorer dioceses.
   Empirical evidence exploiting the timing of the adoption of the
   concordats interacted with a variety of time-invariant measures of
   diocesan wealth yields results consistent with this account-adoption of
   the concordats led bishops to become more aligned with lay political
   authorities in wealthier dioceses relative to poorer dioceses. These
   findings suggest the incentives created by the concordats played a role,
   hundreds of years before the Protestant Reformation, in the rise of lay
   political authority and its association with economic prosperity.},

Title = {Spectacles, Political Education, and Democracy: Re-reading Rousseau's
   Letter to M. D'Alembert},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 1},
Abstract = {In his writings on aesthetics, Jacques Ranciere argues that Rousseau's
   criticism of the theater in The Letter to M. D'Alembert on the Theater
   is significant because it calls into question the possibility of the
   uniform transmission of the artist's knowledge to the spectator. Despite
   this important point, Ranciere largely adopts the commonly accepted
   reading of the Letter that Rousseau finds the theater politically
   pernicious because it separates and isolates audience members, turning
   them into passive spectators. According to this reading, Rousseau
   proposes to replace the theater with the ethical immediacy of the
   festival. Situating the Letter in its historical context and reading it
   with Ranciere to argue against his own reading, I challenge this
   interpretation. I argue that for Rousseau the theater is problematic
   because as a spectacle that calls attention to its difference from what
   it represents, it invites the spectators to actively engage with the
   performance, preventing the uniform transmission of the artist's ideas
   to the spectators. For Rousseau, this democratic potential of the
   theatrical spectacle transforms it from a possible means of moral
   instruction to a risk to the existing social order, which relies on a
   distinction between those who should instruct and those who should be
   instructed. Insofar as the spectators refuse to act as passive
   recipients of knowledge and do something they are not supposed to do,
   including taking part in the idle pleasures of the rich and judging the
   quality of the plays, they reconfigure the distribution of the sensible.
   Rousseau's alternatives to the theater, the marriage ball and the public
   festival, seek to close off this possibility by carefully concealing
   their representational status. By presenting the representations of an
   ``ideal{''} community as the immediate expressions of the community's
   truth, these spectacles achieve, or so Rousseau hopes, what the theater
   fails to do, the effective delivery of moral instruction.},

Abstract = {The Eastern Mediterranean is within the center of a transition period.
   Therefore, understanding the interests of local and extra-regional
   actors would help to understand the possible future of this region. Due
   to its geopolitical significance, this area has developed into a
   battleground for regional and global entities that have competing
   interests. The authorities in the area were motivated to conduct
   exploratory operations and multilateral cooperation in the Eastern
   Mediterranean region after new gas resources were found in the waters
   off the coasts of Egypt and Cyprus. This process led to an increase in
   Turkey's, Israel's, and the neighboring states' geopolitical activities
   in the Eastern Mediterranean on both a regional and an international
   scale. These geopolitical requirements are tied to these nations'
   strategic requirements. The goal of this essay was to use game theory to
   evaluate geopolitically the competition between the Eastern
   Mediterranean nations and to offer answers to any issues that may have
   arisen. The research was descriptive-analytical, and the information was
   gathered through online and library resources, depending on historical
   material and available proof.},

Title = {The Supply-Equity Trade-Off: The Effect of Spatial Representation on the
   Local Housing Supply},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 1},
Abstract = {Institutions that structure representation have systematically
   disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. We
   examine an understudied dimension of this problem: how local electoral
   rules shape the provision of collective goods in relation to racial
   groups. We leverage the California Voting Rights Act of 2001, which
   compelled over 100 cities to switch from at-large to district elections
   for city council, to causally identify how equalizing spatial
   representation changes the permitting of new housing. District elections
   decrease the supply of new multifamily housing, particularly in
   segregated cities with sizable and systematically underrepresented
   minority groups. But district elections also end the disproportionate
   channeling of new housing into minority neighborhoods. Together, our
   findings highlight a fundamental trade-off: at-large representation may
   facilitate the production of goods with diffuse benefits and
   concentrated costs, but it does so by forcing less politically powerful
   constituencies to bear the brunt of those costs.},

Abstract = {The political turbulence, the power vacuum, and the security challenges
   that emerged in post -ISIS Iraq changed and shifted the state's power
   structure. Iraqi security apparatus and military institutions in 2014
   almost collapsed and could not resist the challenges they faced from
   ISIS. Simultaneously, Grand Shia cleric Sistani issued a fatwa, called
   to arms for Shiites, and fought for their survival. In this disordered
   situation, an increasing number of Iran-backed armed groups have started
   to manage security challenges, most of which operate independently
   outside Iraq's national security agencies. The most important group was
   the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), from Iraq's Shia community. PMF
   is gradually convoluted in Iraq's financial affairs and political system
   and wields tremendous influence. There are two consequential types of
   militias in Iraq: Al-Atabat al-Muqadasa paramilitary (AAMP) and Loyalist
   militias (LM). In May 2021, four divisions of (AAMP) decided to
   integrate into the Iraqi army, while (LM) has almost 70 different
   divisions and has not integrated into the government's institutions. In
   this paper, we look at the possibility of implementing the DDR model for
   post-war societies such as Iraqi and the obstacles that faced it.
   Integrating these armed groups became a complicated task for the Iraq
   Post-ISIS state. First, we look at the history of the state-building
   process. Then, we develop a conceptual framework for the article. Third,
   we identify the factors that shape DDR outcomes, define the role of
   Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), and analyze how their activities
   became an obstacle to rebuilding the Iraqi state in the post-ISIS era.},

   Rebel Governance in Post-FARC Territories},
Journal = {DESAFIOS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},

Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {This article explores the political and institutional legacies of rebel
   governance in a context in which, after the demobilization of the
   FARC-EP, there was no reconfiguration of the dynamics of presence and
   violence developed by legal and illegal armed actors. I argue that from
   the rebel governance built by the insurgency and the local community
   boards (jAas) there emerged social processes that held, even after the
   signing of the Peace Agreement, and influenced the way in which local
   orders were reconstructed following the FARC's exit from the area. The
   paper presents a case study of San Andres de Tello-a rural locality in
   the north of Huila, Colombia, with historic FARC presence--based on
   ethnographic fieldwork that privileged contact with key informants and
   concrete observations. This work contributes to the understanding of the
   legacies of rebel governance and how it is possible to use them to
   generate par- ticipatory processes of state formation that incorporate
   communal institutions as protagonists in the configuration of community
   governance in regions with a differentiated presence of the State.},

Abstract = {The prospect of a new party can significantly change political
   landscapes. In Germany, a potential new party is currently being widely
   discussed-Sahra Wagenknecht may splinter off from her party, The Left,
   to form a new radical party in Germany. Above all, Wagenknecht is known
   for her anti-immigration stance and could potentially bridge the gap
   between the right and left by forming a left-authoritarian party. What
   does the demand for such a left-authoritarian party look like in
   Germany? To explore this, we examined individual-level data to
   understand the structural factors that cause people to rate Wagenknecht
   higher than her current party, The Left. The results indicate that
   Wagenknecht is preferred over The Left by individuals who are more
   socioculturally right-wing, critical of migration, and dissatisfied with
   democracy. These findings provide valuable insights into the electoral
   potential of a potential left-authoritarian party led by Wagenknecht.},

Abstract = {What explains the variation in the interpretation and enforcement of
   international law by domestic judges? Can independent judiciaries
   control the enforcement of countries' commitments to international law?
   In this paper, we leverage a unique source of data-cases related to the
   Alien Tort Statute-to investigate how independent judges might be able
   to enforce international commitments to human rights without concern for
   whether the state (here the United States) has opted into the
   commitments in the first place. We show that behavioral factors in
   judicial decision making, and particularly those related to judicial
   ideological preferences, are potent predictors of judicial enforcement
   of international law. This implies that states with highly independent
   judiciaries are right to be worried about their abilities to control
   enforcement domestically, although we also find evidence that the U.S.
   government get a special degree of deference in these cases.},

Abstract = {The Free Voters (Freie Wahler) party is becoming a more serious
   competitor in the German party system. It gained parliamentary
   representation in the Rhineland Palatine in 2021 and has been governing
   with the Christian Social Union in Bavaria since 2018. In addition, the
   Free Voters party now holds two of the 96 German parliamentary member
   positions in the European Parliament and is, at the federal level, the
   extraparliamentary opposition party with the greatest number of votes.
   Nevertheless, there has, to date, been no analysis examining people's
   motives for voting for the Free Voters or exploring their future
   openness to voting for the party. This article addresses this oversight
   by identifying factors, based on population-representative data from the
   2021 Bundestag elections, that favour openness and voting for this
   increasingly influential party. Our analysis shows that a more general
   dissatisfaction with democratic outputs, a conservative attitude, and
   low perceptions of spatial distance from the political positions of the
   Free Voters have significant positive effects.},

Abstract = {The stability of divided societies is an important and recurring concern
   in political science research. It has been suggested that distinctive
   socialization processes in the different regions of divided societies
   will lead to diverging trends in public opinion. Therefore, we
   investigate trends in public opinion on key political issues and
   attitudes in three divided societies: Canada (Quebec), the United
   Kingdom (Scotland) and Spain (Catalonia). Using over two decades of
   survey data, we show that these distinct communities indeed have a
   particular ideological profile but also that there is no indication
   these differences become larger over time. In other words, we do not
   observe any evidence for an increasing lack of public opinion coherence
   in these divided societies. We conclude with some observations on why
   divergence could not be observed at the level of public opinion but
   might still be present at the level of party elites.},

Abstract = {State attorney general (AG) lawsuits have led to judicial limitations on
   federal agencies' powers, including the Supreme Court's formal adoption
   of the major questions doctrine in the West Virginia v. EPA case in
   2022. These limitations empower states to further challenge federal
   agencies and shape national policy while correspondingly weakening
   agencies' ability to defend such lawsuits and aggressively regulate
   important issues of the day. AG lawsuits against the Biden
   administration regularly asserted the major questions doctrine leading
   up to the West Virginia decision, setting the stage for the Court's
   adoption of the doctrine, and states continue to rely on the doctrine in
   the aftermath of the opinion. The major questions doctrine has important
   implications for relationships between the federal government and the
   states and among the states, exposing patterns of cooperation and
   conflict. Such conflict and cooperation will likely be heavily
   influenced by ideology and policy outcomes, further exacerbating
   political partisanship and polarization.},

Title = {Broadcasting party information: Can the introduction of community radio
   reduce the effective number of parties?},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {84},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The introduction of a more majoritarian electoral system is expected to
   result in the consolidation of a party system as predicted by
   institutionalists. However, voters must have information on party
   viability and be able to coordinate with other voters within a
   constituency for an electoral system reform to have the expected
   outcome. I argue that the introduction of independent local radio
   frequencies can promote party consolidation by enabling coordination on
   viable candidates because of better information that becomes common
   knowledge. The effective number of parties (ENEP) is expected to be
   lower in constituencies where a larger proportion of voters listen to
   local radio. To test this hypothesis, access to television signals is
   used as an instrument for radio listening behavior to address potential
   reverse causality. Using 2SLS, I find that an increase in one standard
   deviation in regular radio listening is associated with a decrease of
   0.42 ENEP in Thailand.},

Abstract = {Racial classifications are a social construct with no basis in biology;
   yet, race is an omnipresent and powerful factor in U.S. politics,
   shaping electoral boundaries, disbursement of resources, and political
   alliances (Omi and Winant 1994, Haney Lopez 1994). Race, then, is a
   malleable construct wielded by varying interests, with racial
   definitions changing in response to social and political battles. Some
   new immigrant groups initially classified as not white have been
   reclassified as white over time, thereby benefitting from associated
   legal, economic, and sociopolitical privileges. More recently, however,
   some Latinos have sought recognition as a distinct non-white racial
   group, in acknowledgment of the racialization of their identities over
   time. We seek to better understand who is most likely to support a
   racialized Latino identity, and the political consequences of this
   choice. Using data from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-election
   Survey, we test whether individuals who believe that a Latino identity
   is a racial identity are also more likely to be interested in and
   engaged in politics. We also examine the extent to which support for a
   racialized Latino identity is associated with progressive attitudes on
   racial issues.},

Abstract = {While there is a common awareness of wartime media censorship in both
   Ukraine and Russia, there has been less research on Western media
   coverage and expert analysis of the war in Ukraine. This essay considers
   the extent to which a skewed and partisan version of the war's evolution
   has been presented in UK media. Five stages are identified in the
   emergence and evolution of a British meta-narrative on the war in
   Ukraine, replete with `cheering' and `jeering', that works against a
   realistic understanding of the war's nature and reasonable consideration
   of possible future scenarios. It is argued this coverage has sidestepped
   critical questions of the war's stage-by-stage escalation and has
   essentially avoided serious debate of the risks, costs and benefits of
   such a course.},

Abstract = {Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 consolidated the West
   which seeks to secure the Putin regime's strategic defeat in Ukraine.
   While refraining from a direct support of the Kremlin, China has
   demonstrated throughout this conflict a ``pro-Russian neutrality{''}
   declaring a ``no limits partnership{''} with Moscow which might result
   in a new bipolar confrontation between the West and the non-Western
   power centre with China and Russia on top of it. Being unable to
   directly confront the consolidated West, Beijing and Moscow have
   embarked on the path of a hybrid warfare strategy to modify America's
   hegemonic behaviour by shifting global normative narratives,
   delegitimising the US leadership in the eyes of the broader
   international community and gaining support among the countries of the
   Global South.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},

Abstract = {This article explores the experience of the Progressive Social Movement
   (PSM), a case little studied by history and political sociology research
   in Peru. The PSM emerged in the mid -twentieth century in Peru, in a
   context of crisis of the oligarchic state. Through its proposal to forge
   an integral democracy from a socialist position, the PSM proposed an
   alternative solution to the crisis of that period. Based on the
   contributions of Eliseo Veron and Ernesto Laclau, we use the methodology
   of political discourse analysis, focusing on the recipient of the
   social-progressive enunciation, its main components and its structuring
   nodes. For this purpose, a review of hemerographic sources is carried
   out. We argue that the experience of the PSM allows us to analyze the
   testing of new meanings of three key concepts of modern politics to
   respond to crisis situations: democracy, socialism and revolution.},

Abstract = {Prominent theories propose that commitment problems drive phenomena such
   as war and democratization. However, existing work disagrees about a
   basic question: how does a challenger's coercive strength affect
   prospects for conflict and/or institutional reform? We establish that
   the relationship depends on how challenger strength affects the average
   and maximum probability of winning a conflict in a given period
   ({''}threat{''}). We analyze a formal model with a general distribution
   of threats, and conceptualize challenger strength as affecting this
   distribution. If the maximum threat is fixed and stronger challengers
   pose a higher average threat, then weak challengers will rebel (absent
   reform) during the rare periods they pose a high threat. However, if
   stronger challengers pose a greater maximum threat, then they are harder
   to buy off. Applying these insights advances theoretical and empirical
   debates about democratization.},

Abstract = {This study assesses the role of freedom of communication in modulating
   the effect of political participation on electoral outcomes in Africa
   since the turn of the 21st century. The freedom of communication is
   proxied in terms of freedom of academics and cultural expression,
   freedom of speech, the freedom to express one's opinion, and men's and
   women's freedom of communication. After adopting robust cross-sectional
   dependence estimates of the Driscoll/Kraay strategy, the findings reveal
   that freedom of communication is essential for a free and fair electoral
   process. Similarly, the findings depict that political participation
   increases the probability of a fair election process and outcomes in
   Africa. The study recommends that African countries' design platforms in
   their respective legislations that ensure freedom of speech and
   expression, and political inclusion with the open debate concerning
   governance to promote free and fair consistent elections that respect
   human rights and ensure political stability.},

Abstract = {This article examines, first, how environmental concerns have shaped
   British politics since 1945, making the environment an object of
   governance; and second, how political developments have an environmental
   history, focussing on the environmental demands of social democracy. It
   contends that environmentalism should be considered alongside other
   political ideologies, such as socialism and feminism, as helping to
   constitute the modern British state and the evolving relationship
   between government and the citizen. It considers how the management of
   the terrestrial environment became a hotly contested matter in the
   postwar decades, drawing a distinction between the politics of
   `landscape preservation' and `nature conservation'. This discussion is
   related to access politics and questions of rural governance and
   regulation, particularly with respect to the agricultural sector. The
   article concludes with a discussion of some current environmental
   concerns, reflecting on the possible transition from today's `carbon
   democracy' to tomorrow's `renewable democracy'.},

Abstract = {We introduce new data resources to enable spatial and nonspatial
   research on Canadian elections, electoral history and political
   geography. These include a comprehensive set of distinct identification
   codes for every federal electoral district in Canada from 1867 to the
   present, a complete set of digital boundary files for these electoral
   districts, historical census data aggregated to federal electoral
   districts, and tools to connect our district identification codes to
   federal election results. After describing the construction and content
   of these new resources, we provide an example of their use in a
   comparative-historical analysis of district compactness in Canada and
   the United States. We find that, in contrast to the United States,
   postwar institutional changes to district boundary-drawing processes had
   little effect on district compactness in Canada.},

Abstract = {In the midst of the recent wave of climate activism, a group of
   scientists formed the initiative Scientists for Future (S4F) to support
   the Fridays for Future movement and emphasise the scientific evidence
   their activism is based on. While scientists have participated in
   policymaking by taking roles as advisers to policymakers in the past,
   forming a social movement is an unprecedented form of communicating
   scientific evidence. In this contribution, we assume that the S4F
   initiative aims to voice dissatisfaction both with prevalent
   decision-making processes and with the substance of these decisions.
   Using novel data from a survey conducted among members of this movement
   in the summer of 2021, we investigated their motivations and
   perspectives on the role of scientists in democratic processes and their
   attitudes about a reformist or more radical pathway towards a
   climate-neutral society and sustainable development. Our analysis shows
   that the majority of S4F members support democratic reforms rather than
   fundamental systemic change. Furthermore, most respondents show signs of
   a conviction that scientific expertise should take a superior role in
   climate policy rather than make room for wide participatory practices.
   Overall, the S4F is aimed at the diversification of political arenas to
   raise the impact of scientific knowledge in environmental and climate
   policymaking.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has seen opponents of public health mandates
   deploy a range of populist and anti-elite arguments. The 2021 Canadian
   federal election was an exceptional ``pandemic election{''} in which the
   COVID-19 health crisis took centre stage. But the election campaign also
   saw the populist People's Party of Canada (PPC) rise to prominence by
   opposing pandemic-related public health restrictions. While the party
   failed to win a seat, it did manage to triple its vote share (1.6 per
   cent to 4.9 per cent). It is unclear, however, what factors led to the
   rise in support for the PPC. To explore this issue, we draw on an
   original post-election survey (n = 18,950) and focus on populist
   attitudes and opposition to COVID-19-related public health restrictions.
   Results from regression models and structural equation models (SEMs)
   indicate that opposition to public health restrictions was a much
   stronger factor than populism in shaping support for the PPC.},

Abstract = {Roe v. Wade was overturned in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
   Organization in June 2022. The pro-choice movement, like the pro-life
   movement after Roe, has suffered a major legal loss after Dobbs and
   should learn from the pro-life movement's incrementalist legal
   strategies to slowly rebuild a constitutional right to abortion.
   Post-Dobbs, the pro-choice movement should pursue state constitutional
   level to create state constitutional rights to abortion. However, the
   pro-choice movement should also pursue incrementalist federal
   constitutional litigation in ``hard cases,{''} cases where women with
   life-threatening pregnancy complications are denied abortion care, to
   rebuild a federal constitutional right to an abortion. While a federal
   constitutional case for a right to an abortion may not initially
   translate into legal victories, such arguments can increase public
   support for the pro-choice movement by reframing abortion as health care
   and transforming public perceptions of the women who seek abortions.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the quality of civil resistance and, in
   particular, the democratizing qualities of various civil resistance
   practices. There is a great amount of research on civil resistance and
   its capacities to foster social change, and in particular its impact on
   increased democracy. However, we still have an empirical bias in this
   research since these studies mainly focus on mass-mobilized breaking
   resistance. This paper provides an analysis of various civil resistance
   practices' democratizing qualities based on a case study - namely the
   Palestinian village Bil'in's campaign against the Israeli plans to build
   a `security barrier', through the village's farmlands. The process of
   the campaign began in 2002 and lasted until the Supreme Court of
   Israel's decision from 2007 to re-route the building of the `security
   barrier' away from the farmland from was implemented in 2011. Based on a
   `process tracing' (PT) methodology, an analysis of, primarily,
   interviews that were made with Bil'in activists and proxy activists
   (mainly Israelis) is presented, where the tracing underlying mechanisms
   could explain why the campaign had an impact on democracy.
   Theoretically, the paper applies the concept of `democratizing
   qualities' (Munck 2016), as well as the analytical toolbox that is
   labelled the ABC of civil resistance. The paper will conclude with a
   presentation of potential causal mechanisms that may explain why the
   civil resistance campaign impacted on democracy. The guiding overarching
   research question is: In what ways can different practices of civil
   resistance have democratizing qualities?},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the relationship between the ideas of cruelty and
   injustice in Judith Shklar's political theory. Shklar's The Faces of
   Injustice is sometimes read as an instantiation of the liberalism of
   fear, which regards cruelty and the fear that it inspires as the summum
   malum. I challenge this interpretation and instead argue that her
   account of injustice should be read independently of her commitment to
   the liberalism of fear. In doing so, I show how her exploration of the
   faces of injustice-especially the importance she accords to passive
   injustice and the sense of injustice-raises important challenges for the
   liberal case for putting cruelty first. Although democratic attitudes
   and institutions constitute the best available remedy for the sense of
   injustice, on Shklar's account, those who focus too much on the
   requirements of democratic citizenship risk treating injustice as a
   greater evil than cruelty, which could, in turn, facilitate cruelty and
   undermine liberal democracy. I conclude by suggesting that the
   republican-inspired theory of citizenship from The Faces of Injustice,
   which Shklar outlines in response to the problem of passive injustice,
   reflects a distinct strand of her political theory that goes beyond the
   more familiar defense of law-bound constitutional government associated
   with the liberalism of fear.},

Abstract = {The lawsuits challenging the 2020 election tried and failed to overturn
   the results of the election. This article positions their contribution
   to constitutional decay by considering the affidavits filed by
   Republican election challengers who observed the processing of absentee
   ballots in Detroit. Using the concepts of legal consciousness and legal
   mobilization, this article traces the mechanisms that carried doubts
   about the election processes from politics to law, returning that doubt
   as legally acknowledged truth that could be deployed in ongoing
   politics. Features of the affidavits allowed the voter fraud narrative
   to borrow a legal concept seemingly detached from politics. Given that
   constitutional theories recognize strict legality as a tool of
   authoritarians, this article considers the affidavits' use as a legal
   and political tool, indicating particular ways that it can be wielded
   for antidemocratic purposes.},

Abstract = {In the last forty years, central banks have gained enormous importance
   in all capitalist economies. At the same time, their actions and the
   ideological justifications for those actions have undergone profound
   transformations. This essay attempts to trace the transformation of
   central banks from the era of classical Keynesianism, through
   neoliberalism and monetarism, to our present situation of permanent
   crisis and shadow monetary financing. In doing so, the aim is twofold.
   On the one hand, to criticize and move beyond the most simplistic
   accounts of the role of central banks in the economy. On the other hand,
   to try to identify the contradictions and windows of opportunity for
   political intervention at this conjuncture, when for the first time in
   decades a real possibility of societal transformation is opening up.},

   aims at rescuing the contributions of John Kingdon (1995), based on the
   analysis of the system of subsidies for bread in Egypt in the context of
   the 2014-2016 critical juncture. This approach will allow us not only to
   illuminate central aspects of the case under analysis, but also to be

Abstract = {After leadership changes, how do new leaders recast the composition of
   their surrounding elites to ensure support and secure their tenure?
   Using original data on African cabinets, this article contributes to the
   debate on leaders' survival with new theoretical inputs and empirical
   evidence about senior level changes new leaders introduce after assuming
   office to ensure a longer and more stable tenure. The article
   concentrates primarily on leaders emerged from an under-theorized and
   yet frequent type of leadership change, which is neither violent nor
   electoral, such as after a predecessor's resignation. Because these
   leaders lack the authority generally granted, albeit through different
   means, by electoral and violent takeovers, the article builds on regime
   cycle frameworks to develop a sequential interpretation of elite
   management for such hybrid types which is distinct from both
   violence-born and electoral regimes. The comparative analysis of two
   recent such cases in Ethiopia and Zimbabwe empirically illustrates how
   the timing and sequencing of post-change elite management eventually
   affect leadership stability over time. These findings ultimately
   reinforce the view that the survival debate needs to dilute its focus on
   leaders as the organizing principles of regimes, and instead concentrate
   on wider senior elite coalitions.},

Abstract = {This paper revisits Tocqueville's famous portrait of the American
   female, which begins with assertions of her equality to males but ends
   with her self-cloistering in the domestic sphere. Taking a cue from
   Tocqueville's extended sketch of the ``faded{''} pioneer wife in ``A
   Fortnight in the Wilderness{''} and drawing connections to Tocqueville's
   criticisms of the division of industrial labor, I argue that the
   American girl's ostensibly free choice to remove herself from public
   life is not an act of freedom. Rather, it is a manifestation of a
   particular type of unfreedom that reveals underappreciated connections
   between the two great dangers about which Democracy in America warns:
   tyrannical majoritarianism and soft despotism. My argument that the
   girl's choice to withdraw from public life is coerced rather than free
   thus highlights the nonpolitical sources of oppression that exist within
   democratic societies. The paper concludes by raising questions about the
   need for coercion within Tocquevillian democracy and the implications of
   this for Tocqueville's ``new{''} political science-indeed, for his
   liberalism more generally.},

Abstract = {Some work in political methodology recommends that applied researchers
   obtain point estimates of quantities of interest by simulating model
   coefficients, transforming these simulated coefficients into simulated
   quantities of interest, and then averaging the simulated quantities of
   interest (e.g., CLARIFY). But other work advises applied researchers to
   directly transform coefficient estimates to estimate quantities of
   interest. I point out that these two approaches are not interchangeable
   and examine their properties. I show that the simulation approach
   compounds the transformation-induced bias identified by Rainey (2017),
   adding bias with direction and magnitude similar to the
   transformation-induced bias. I refer to this easily avoided additional
   bias as ``simulation-induced bias.{''} Even if researchers use
   simulation to estimate standard errors, they should directly transform
   maximum likelihood estimates of coefficient estimates to obtain point
   estimates of quantities of interest.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {118},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-53},

Abstract = {Why do some Indigenous communities experience assimilation while others
   obtain government protection for their long-standing institutions and
   cultures? I argue that historical experiences with state-led labor
   conscription play a key role. In the early twentieth century, Latin
   American governments conscripted unpaid Indigenous labor to build
   infrastructure. Community leaders threatened by this conscription were
   more likely to mobilize their communities to resist it. The mobilization
   of this collective action later empowered community leaders to achieve
   state protections for Indigenous institutions and cultures, or
   ``accommodation.{''} I test this argument using a natural experiment
   where communities' eligibility for labor conscription to build a 1920s
   Peruvian highway was as-if randomly assigned. I develop a measure of
   accommodation that considers both the existence and enforcement of laws
   protecting Indigenous institutions and cultures. I evaluate the
   mechanisms using data on Indigenous mobilization. The findings
   demonstrate how historical extraction shaped contemporary
   Indigenous-state relations.},

Volume = {68},

Abstract = {Prevalent counterinsurgency theories posit that small development aid
   projects can help stabilize regions in conflict. A widely assumed
   mechanism runs through citizen attitudes, often called ``winning hearts
   and minds,{''} where aid brings economic benefits and sways public
   perceptions, leading to more cooperation and, eventually, less violence.
   Following a preregistered research design, we test this claim using
   difference-in-differences, leveraging original survey data, and new
   geocoded information about infrastructure projects in northern
   Afghanistan. We find that aid improves perceived economic conditions but
   erodes attitudes toward government and improves perceptions of
   insurgents. These attitudinal effects do not translate into changes in
   violence or territorial control. Testing mechanisms, we find projects
   with robust local consultation have fewer negative attitudinal effects,
   as do health and education projects. These findings challenge the
   ``hearts and minds{''} theory but complement the wider literature on
   legitimacy, suggesting that foreign aid can improve human development
   but rarely meaningfully brings political stabilization.},

Abstract = {Interest groups seek to influence public policy and are often thus
   perceived to be crucial to the functioning of advanced democracies and
   to be important contributors to the policy formulation process. Business
   associations, in particular, specifically seek to influence policy
   related to the business environment, with the intention of making it
   easier for their members-and the wider private sector-to ``do
   business{''}. Even in democracies, scholars question whether interest
   groups are influential and, if so, the degree to which their activity
   influences public policy. Very little, however, is known of the approach
   to advocacy adopted by work and impact of business associations in
   one-party states. This paper, therefore, explores the efforts of
   business associations in Vietnam to engage with government. It takes a
   broad view of their activities and includes examples of success in
   influencing policy reform. It appears that, whilst business associations
   in Vietnam avoid direct confrontation, they not only engage successfully
   with government but also persuade them to do things differently to
   reduce the burdens imposed on business. Key factors include building
   trust and mobilising the technical expertise of their members, careful
   and systematic research, engaging across government, collaborating with
   other business associations and with research institutes, supplying
   information, and providing evidence and good argumentation. Lacking the
   challenges of an opposition party, public private dialogue provides an
   effective channel for Vietnam's ministries and agencies to seek feedback
   from the business community. Indeed, the dynamics of dialogue
   effectively create some of the democracy observed in multiparty systems
   of government. This paper makes a clear contribution to our knowledge of
   the role and strategies of interest groups in a one-party state and
   finds that they behave similarly to those working in democracies.},

Abstract = {Concerns about polarization and the difficulty moderate candidates have
   in winning primary elections have driven several electoral reform
   efforts in recent decades. In this article, we leverage reforms prior to
   the 2022 elections in Alaska to assess whether the top-four primary is
   likely to help moderate candidates succeed. We evaluate three mechanisms
   by which the top-four might help moderates: by allowing them to advance
   from the primary and compete for votes from the more moderate general
   electorate, by changing the composition of the primary electorate and/or
   by facilitating crossover voting during the primary. Our analysis
   suggests that the top-four primary creates opportunities for cross-party
   voting that can enhance the electoral prospects of moderate candidates.},

   the political and economic circumstances it reflected, and to which it

   beginning of Mattarella's second term, which was marked by a number of
   highly significant national and international events: the war in Europe;
   the seamless transition from the COVID to the security emergency; the
   end of the Draghi government; the dissolution of Parliament; the
   election of 25 September; the decisive victory of the centre right; the
   rapid formation of the Meloni government. The article concludes with
   some reflections on the meaning of the second successive re-election of
   an Italian president, and its significance for the Italian political

Abstract = {As a research objective, the article presents a classification of myths
   and scientific orientations of world mythology, as a condition of
   possibility to explain the national and political formation of cultures,
   for which the historical and cognitive method was used. Myths are part
   of the primitive religious imaginary. The political sphere, in which the
   principles and technologies of management of society are developed, is
   the one most in need of producing effective means of influence, so that
   its results have an intense load of mythogenesis. In the space of the
   political most of the characteristics of myth are the perception of
   accessibility and openness of empathy, regardless of a person's age,
   gender, nationality. Everything allows to conclude that, the history of
   the search for the underlying essence of the universe also goes back to
   the distant past of science. For example, some philosophers of ancient
   India and China, Egypt and Babylon, ancient Central Asia and Greece,
   among others, believed that some substance or certain element lay at the
   base of the universe.},

Abstract = {Women have a crucial role in the fishery value chains, from pre-fishing
   to post-fishing activities; however, the lack of sex-disaggregated local
   level data aggravates the women.s invisibility and marginalization in
   the informal fishing industry and community. Generating local knowledge
   and representation, this study presents women.s role and challenges
   working in small-scale fisheries in Perez, Quezon, Philippines. Fifty
   female fisherfolks from the said sector participated in this case study.
   The results from the field survey indicate that the participants widely
   dispersed to inland capture fisheries, marine capture fisheries,
   non-food use production and food fishery production categories. The
   results also showed that the respondents are scattered across the value
   chain: active fishing, processing, subsistence fishing, marketing, and
   pre-fishing activities, in varying intensity and pattern. In contrast to
   stereotypes that exclusively associate women to gleaning invertebrates,
   the majority target fish species and other marine invertebrates.
   Environmental, socio-economic, personal and gender factors are the
   common constraints that limit their productivity, output, and more
   importantly their equitable roles and identities. Although coming from a
   small fishing community, the findings of this study may provide baseline
   information for relevant local government agency to further intensify
   profiling on the grounds and to strategically implement gender-sensitive
   mainstreaming programs.},

Abstract = {How do authoritarian regimes punish ordinary opposition voters? I argue
   that elected community politicians help make ``punishment regimes,{''}
   which discourage opposition support, credible. Strengthened by
   decentralization reforms, community politicians have information and
   leverage necessary to identify and punish opposition supporters. When
   the regime wins community elections, these politicians extend the
   regime's reach deep into communities. When opposition parties win, their
   reach is constrained weakening their electoral control. Using
   mixed-methods evidence from Tanzania, I show regime-loyal community
   politicians use their distributive and legal-coercive powers to
   ``deliver the vote{''} leading voters in these communities to fear
   individual reprisals for opposition support. In contrast, voters fear
   individual punishment in opposition-run communities significantly less.
   This study demonstrates the importance of local institutions and
   elections when understanding regime durability.},

Abstract = {The fundamental aim of this paper is to test the symmetric and
   asymmetric effects of geopolitical risk on the five selected prices of
   energy commodities, consisting of coal, crude oil, gasoline, heating
   oil, and natural gas, during the period 2 January 2020-29 July 2022 by
   application of linear and nonlinear ARDL models. Moreover, we also study
   the impact of anticipated financial volatility on energy commodities.
   Our results suggest that, over the long term, there is no linear
   relationship between geopolitical risk, financial volatility, and energy
   prices. On the other hand, we find statistically significant
   asymmetrical effects of geopolitical risk and financial volatility on
   crude oil, gasoline, and heating oil prices in the long and short run.
   We also identify that coal and natural gas prices do not respond to
   changes in geopolitical risk during the analysed period.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {83},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study investigates whether and how experiences of winning and
   losing at the ballot box shape voters' views about the integrity of the
   electoral process in Germany's mixed-member proportional system. Relying
   on comprehensive data from the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES)
   2021, the analysis provides evidence for a consistent winner-loser gap
   in voters' electoral-integrity perceptions, with electoral losers
   evaluating the electoral process systematically more negative than
   electoral winners. Moreover, the analysis shows that the winner-loser
   gap is particularly pronounced for voters who lost in two consecutive
   federal elections ('repeated losers') as well as for those who suffered
   electoral defeat with both their list and district votes ('double
   losers'). These findings provide novel insights on how voters in
   mixed-member proportional systems cope with winning and losing at the
   ballot box, highlighting that electoral losers place (part of) the blame
   for their electoral defeat on the electoral process and procedures as
   such. In addition, the findings point to the relevance of specific
   features of electoral systems in shaping winner-loser gaps in
   electoral-integrity beliefs.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a distinctly affective methodological approach to
   Hansard transcripts using feminist affect theory and Pierre Bourdieu's
   reflexive methodologies. Expanding the `toolkit' of analysis available
   to parliamentary and legislative researchers to understand the political
   worlds we inhabit, I contend scholarship engaging with Hansard is
   shaped-but not limited-by the format and editorial decisions that inform
   its publication. Feminist scholarship on affect enables both (i)
   generative methodological approaches to so-called limitations of
   Hansard, and (ii) empowers a critical advancement of how researchers can
   engage Hansard as data. Considering the Hansard corpus as a process
   (rather than a thing) enables analyses to begin not with the question of
   can affect and emotion be present in transcripts, but rather how can
   emotion and affect proliferate throughout a genre designed and mediated
   in such a way as to occlude these emotional and affective speech
   patterns. I conclude by offering methodological strategies through an
   exploration of research vignettes drawn from my work with Canadian
   provincial Hansards.},

Abstract = {The concept of ``eco-populism{''} has been used by the political
   theorist Timothy Luke to designate the possibility of open-ended green
   political futures which might be constructed beyond the limited
   ecological imaginaries of technoscience, neoliberalism, and Marxism.
   This article interrogates the conceptual origins through which
   ``eco-populism{''} became the preferred name for this alternative.
   Eco-populism is taken to rightly critique some of the class
   characteristics of ecological destruction, but it obscures their
   extension into the realms of reactionary politics, private property, and
   North American agrarian settler colonialism. This article develops an
   immanent critique of the formal limits of populism, while also
   demonstrating its historical formation in the US steers it away from
   more radical orientations towards climate justice.},

   interest. However, the resurgence of leaders with `populist' tendencies
   presents an empirical puzzle, which may reveal intriguing political
   patterns in the context of comparative democratization (and
   autocratization). This study theorizes that citizens' need for economic
   deliverance and social stability develops agreeable attitudes towards
   prevailing public institutions even though political incumbents project
   authoritarian tendencies. Using public opinion data from the seventh
   wave of World Values Survey (WVS7), this study finds that citizens in
   Indonesia and the Philippines-two of the region's post-authoritarian
   democracies i.e. fragile democracies with spells of authoritarian rule
   manifest high support for a political system with a strong leader
   unconstrained with electoral and congressional intervention.
   Consequently, this favourable attitude makes them more likely to express
   higher institutional confidence. Overall, the findings shed light on the
   paradoxes of contemporary politics confronted not only with
   authoritarian resilience, political illiberalism and personalist rule
   but also of the enduring nondemocratic psychological disposition among
   citizens in settings with troubled democratic transitions.},

Abstract = {The China-U.S.-Iran relationship offers an intriguing strategic triangle
   in which the United States has always loomed large and
   disproportionately influenced the relationship between the other two
   actors. Although Tehran and Beijing had a relatively friendly
   relationship that endured the volatile Cold War era, neither treated the
   other as a strategic priority in their foreign relations. The Obama
   administration's diplomatic overture and the subsequent multi-nation
   nuclear deal helped relieve persistent restrictions on Tehran and
   Beijing and created a relatively permissive environment for both to
   foster more resilient economic, political, and strategic ties. The U.S.
   factor has long compelled China to adopt a dual policy toward Iran -
   restricted cooperation and limited distancing. But more recently, in an
   evolving global geopolitical and geoeconomic landscape, Beijing has
   begun to tilt more frequently toward Tehran, telegraphing its growing
   frustration with Washington's unilateralism and protectionism on the one
   hand, and a greater willingness to raise its profile in the Middle East
   on the other.},

Pages = {337-359},

Abstract = {In the intricate tapestry of global geopolitics, China's ascent as a
   potential preeminent power in a new world order has become a compelling
   narrative. This paper explores Beijing's multifaceted rise by delving
   into the diplomatic, economic, technological, cultural, and
   environmental dimensions of the nation's ascent. China's adept
   diplomacy, exemplified by its active participation in international
   organizations, introduces profound implications for global governance
   and cooperation. Economically, its transformation from an agrarian
   society to the world's second-largest economy redefines the dynamics of
   international trade and development, epitomized by the far-reaching Belt
   and Road Initiative. China's technological prowess, particularly in
   fields like artificial intelligence and 5G technology, reshapes the
   landscape of innovation, while the influence of its soft power through
   cultural exports and educational outreach resonates across borders. The
   ethical and moral dimensions of global governance are at the forefront
   of this narrative, with questions of universal values and human rights
   taking center stage. China's commitment to environmental sustainability
   and its role in addressing climate change also have profound
   implications for global environmental protection. Looking ahead, two
   potential scenarios, a bipolar world order and a multipolar world order,
   come into focus, each with its own implications for international
   relations, trade, technology, and environmental cooperation. In this
   evolving global narrative, international organizations adapt to
   accommodate shifting power dynamics, emphasizing the need for equitable
   representation and multilateral collaboration. Ultimately, the paper
   underscores the interplay of nations in the recalibration of the global
   order, urging proactive engagement and foresight in navigating the
   complex terrain of China's rise and its impact on the future of
   international relations.},

Abstract = {Human rights due diligence (HRDD) is spreading fast as national laws
   mandating it multiply across the world. It appears that the due
   diligence process is about to shape the way we regulate the
   environmental and human rights impacts resulting from economic
   activities for years to come. While much of the existing scholarship on
   the topic is focused on HRDD's content and its concrete implications for
   businesses, this paper takes a step back to investigate its foundations.
   In particular, it outlines the core intellectual assumptions behind the
   approach of John G. Ruggie, the former UN Secretary-General's Special
   Representative for Business and Human Rights, and his embrace of HRDD.
   The paper suggests that Ruggie's turn to HRDD is grounded in a
   commitment to a double movement, comprising both the privatisation of
   the transnational governance of human rights through the empowerment of
   corporations as governance entities and the publicisation of corporate
   governance through the introduction of participatory spaces,
   transparency requirements, and external accountability processes. I
   argue that the tension between privatisation and publicisation is at the
   heart of the HRDD process and reflective of Ruggie's ambition to
   reassemble the private and the public into a new governance approach
   fitted to economic globalisation.},

Abstract = {How are foreign policies developed during times of conflict? This
   question is often approached by scholars. Here I focus on individual
   policymakers' decisions and employ a novel game-theory-inspired
   analytical framework in foreign policy analysis. The article studies
   Ukrainian leaders' decision-making in relations with Russia and the
   European Union in the first turbulent months of the war in Donbas
   (April-August 2014). Understanding the beginning of this war holds high
   relevance in light of the current full-scale Russian invasion of
   Ukraine. This research is based on analysis of 38 interviews with EU,
   Ukrainian, and Russian policymakers, and analysis of documents.},

   to legitimize and enhance their positions of domination. Despite the
   growing literature on populism, few studies have attended to this
   counterintuitive construction of ``the people{''} as an underdog
   struggling against a power bloc from a position of relative privilege.
   By examining the Catalan independence movement during the 2010s, this
   study draws on discourse theory to conceptualize the ``populism of the
   privileged{''} and explore how various dimensions of sociological
   privilege are used to legitimize and reinforce dominant positions within
   Catalonia and Spain by means of populist politics. Finally, the article
   engages with the implications of the ``populism of the privileged{''} in
   terms of inter-group relations, political integration, and the
   democratic principle of equality. By offering a nuanced analysis of this
   underexplored phenomenon, this article contributes to the growing
   literature on populism and provides insights into the complex
   relationship between populism, privilege, and power.},

Title = {How active are right-wing party members? Portuguese right-wing
   delegates, from a comparative and a General Incentives Model (GIM)
   perspective},

Abstract = {This contribution explores the role of the incentives and benefits of
   party affiliation, along with the ideological reasons for being
   politically active, in particular as a party delegate. The rational for
   party affiliation and for activism has developed over recent decades,
   ranging from individual to collective reasons. The incentives that
   explain activism have been an essential part of the discussion on the
   reasons for becoming a party member, particularly following the seminal
   study on the General Incentives Model (GIM)'s, Seyd and Whiteley (1992).
   Later developments from Whiteley et al. (2019) provided evidence on the
   activism of radical political forces, as is the case of UKIP in the
   United Kingdom. Following the GIM framework, this study explores these
   themes within a Portuguese context, and from a comparative perspective.
   To date, investigations in this field have rarely focused on Portugal.
   The research question is: how do delegates view their party's incentives
   and benefits, and how is this influenced by their ideological
   self-positioning on the left-right scale? We argue that the larger the
   party, the lower the members' assessment will be of the incentives and
   benefits achieved. In methodological terms, this study is based on the
   MAPP project and surveys, applied to Portuguese political party members,
   including delegates from right-wing parties. The relevance of this
   article lies in the application of the GIM to delegates of right-wing
   political parties, in a comparative perspective, considering a downward
   trend and a Southern European country that has, to date, been little
   explored in this context (Sierens et al. 2022). The goal is to find
   evidence of how right-wing party members and delegates view the
   incentives and benefits that play a role in party activism.},

Abstract = {Not least in view of the past decade, crises in the European Union (EU)
   have attracted much scholarly attention. At the same time, difficult
   decision-making situations and turning points have always been parts of
   the European integration process. Moreover, as founding and the two
   largest member states, France and Germany have been key drivers in the
   development of today's EU polity. Strikingly, a systematic analysis of
   major crises covering the entire integration process and the comparative
   role that France-Germany have played, so far is lacking. Scholars tend
   to focus on instances of `successful' crisis resolution or, more
   recently, on a presumably hegemonic Germany. This article, by contrast,
   argues and demonstrates why and how France and Germany, together, have
   been essential for the management and resolution of European-level
   political controversies and deadlock. To do so, the article considers
   nine major integration crises. It highlights different ways and means of
   bilateral leadership and their resulting impact on European integration.
   Case selection includes both successful crisis management and instances
   of failed or absent leadership.},

Abstract = {Republicans were initially optimistic that the 2022 midterms would
   result in a sizeable red wave that would lead them to win back control
   of the House and Senate in light of President Biden's low levels of
   approval and high rates of inflation. Although they did win enough seats
   to narrowly control the House, they failed to pick up a sufficient
   number of seats in the Senate to control that chamber during the next 2
   years. This article examines the candidates, outcomes, and implications
   of the 2022 midterm elections. In doing so, we analyze the effect that
   former President Donald Trump had on the election while also considering
   the impact of factors such as inflation and abortion on congressional
   election outcomes. The article closes with a discussion of the effects
   of the 2022 midterms on both the incoming 118th Congress as well as the
   upcoming 2024 Presidential election.},

Abstract = {While in the civil wars literature grievance is often considered as a
   cause of violent conflict, this paper investigates how grievances are
   meaningful to the people who experience violence, and how these meanings
   are expressed in everyday actions. Through the case of the Maoist
   conflict in India, in this paper I explore how grievance is socially
   constructed and related to action according to local people's own
   narratives. This study reveals that perceptions of grievance are related
   not only to violent actions, but also to everyday strategies to resist
   violence and achieve durable peace and social change at the local level.},

Abstract = {Most of the research about participatory institutions has neglected the
   analysis of the role played by ideological preferences in their
   development. Do different political ideologies of governing parties
   develop different participatory processes? Our starting point is that
   diverse views on the core values of democracy should lead to different
   positions concerning the role and expected benefits of citizen
   participation. This article discusses two main questions. First, in case
   ideology matters, which is the crucial difference? Is this a matter of
   ``right versus left{''} or is there a particular party family with
   special attentiveness to developing participatory institutions? Second,
   in case any difference exists, how exactly does it translate into the
   development of participatory institutions? Analyzing data from Spanish
   municipalities in the period 2003-2010, we show that the party families
   that had a relevant presence in local administrations in this time frame
   show more similarities than differences in the participatory activities
   implemented. However, some relevant differences are found related to the
   constituencies addressed and mobilized and the type of participatory
   processes developed.},

Abstract = {Examining recent developments in deliberative democracy alongside
   growing attention to system-wide racism, I look at the ways deliberative
   systems theory and practice deals with the tension between the theory's
   normative claims and the structural injustice against which deliberative
   systems unfold. I focus on work aimed at deepening inclusion in
   deliberative systems, noting that this focus on inclusion into unjust
   systems stops the deliberative literature from taking full
   responsibility for structural and systemic racism. Taking a critical
   approach to the deliberative literature's capacity to confront systemic
   racism and live up to its normative principles of treating all people as
   equals, I argue that we need to reframe power to centre the relationship
   between race and democracy. As I do so, I propose ways to begin
   dismantling foundational injustice in deliberative systems, centring
   foundational inequalities in deliberative theory and design, and setting
   out differential responsibilities for listening as deliberative
   theorists confront the problem of white supremacy in deliberative
   systems.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {82},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Does party organization shape candidates' electoral mobilization
   efforts? I develop a novel theoretical account linking candidate
   selection rules to electoral mobilization. Nomination rules that require
   aspiring candidates to compete in electoral races, such as primary
   elections, create incentives for them to make considerable investments
   in order to win the party's nomination. Using a decision-theoretic
   model, I show how these initial investments at the nomination stage
   shape the candidates' mobilization expenditures in the general election.
   The main theoretical result establishes that primaries increase
   candidates' mobilization efforts only when the general election is not
   expected to be competitive; when a close race is expected, candidates
   mobilize at the same rates regardless of how they were nominated.
   Analysis of an original dataset on candidate selection and electoral
   mobilization in Mexico provides strong support for the theory.},

Title = {How Patronage Delivers: Political Appointments, Bureaucratic
   Accountability, and Service Delivery in Brazil},

Abstract = {The political appointment of bureaucrats is typically seen as
   jeopardizing development by selecting worse types into the bureaucracy
   or by depressing bureaucratic effort. I argue that political
   appointments also affect outcomes through a third, less studied channel,
   namely, by changing how bureaucrats work. Patronage provides connections
   between bureaucrats and politicians, and thereby grants access to
   material and nonmaterial resources, enhances monitoring, facilitates the
   application of sanctions and rewards, aligns priorities and incentives,
   and increases mutual trust. Political appointments can thus enhance
   bureaucrats' accountability and effectiveness, not just for rent-seeking
   purposes but also, in certain conditions, for public service delivery. I
   test this theory using data on Brazilian municipal governments,
   leveraging two quasi-experiments, two original surveys of bureaucrats
   and politicians, and in-depth interviews. The findings highlight the
   countervailing effects of connections on bureaucratic governance in the
   developing world.},

Abstract = {The article researches the Russian Night Wolves Motorcycle Club from the
   perspective of the sharp power concept. It is argued that NWMC serve as
   a proxy for Russian sharp power, playing the role of messenger for
   pro-Kremlin propaganda in European countries through Victory Roads
   events. Using a mixed-methods Google Search data and media content
   analysis, the article analyzes the effectiveness of the Victory Roads
   events as a sharp power propaganda tool. It provides evidence that the
   physical presence of NWMC is indeed a powerful tool of Russian sharp
   power, increasing interest among the targeted population and creating
   long-lasting political impact.},

Title = {Electoral (non)alignment between resident and non-resident voters:
   evidence from Spain},

Abstract = {Over the past decades, diasporas' engagement in homeland elections has
   become a highly salient issue, especially given the widespread
   implementation of enfranchisement policies for citizens living abroad.
   Spain stands out in the European context with its long emigration
   history, its sizeable population abroad, and the enactment of the
   so-called `voto rogado' ('begged vote') system that hindered external
   voting by requiring non-resident citizens to submit a separate voter
   registration application to become eligible for casting the ballot in
   Spanish elections. Yet, little is known so far about the voting patterns
   of Spaniards abroad. This article aims to fill this gap by examining the
   electoral (non)alignment between resident and non-resident voters in the
   Spanish general elections held over the past three decades. We argue
   that a comprehensive assessment of electoral (non)alignment must
   consider two different analytical layers of turnout and party choice.
   The article shows that changing electoral rules on extraterritorial
   voting, the increasingly diverse profile of Spaniards abroad, and
   Spanish parties' strategies towards the diaspora interact to account for
   differences in overseas Spaniards' turnout rates and party choices when
   compared to resident voters.},

Abstract = {Public policy is often about numbers that affect people's lives in
   fundamental ways. Given the central importance of numbers, we examine
   anchoring, a heuristic in which people are influenced by an initial
   number in expressing a preference. Across a series of experiments and
   three unique surveys, we find evidence of anchoring effects, but not
   uniformly so. In contrast to experiments in psychology and behavioral
   economics, we find no evidence that irrelevant or arbitrary anchors
   shape policy preferences. Yet, when provided politically relevant
   anchors that clearly correspond to the policy proposal, we find evidence
   of strong effects, even in the face of party cues or in the absence of a
   status quo policy point. Taken together, our results demonstrate that
   there is a psychological explanation for why the status quo occupies a
   powerful position in policy debates as well as why agenda setting is so
   influential.},

Abstract = {This paper is on cordons sanitaires - coordinated refusals to
   collaborate with a given political party on principle - and the
   behaviours associated with it. I argue that, once established, the
   cordon is properly classified and analysed as a social meta-norm, rather
   than a mere strategy (the common classification in the literature).
   First, I examine the merits of a mere strategy model, and conclude that
   a cordon may well be instituted for strategic reasons, but that aspects
   of party behaviour are not well accounted for within this model. Second,
   I show that once established, the cordon is best classified as a social
   norm, and I discuss the empirical and theoretical implications of this.
   Finally, I illustrate these theoretical points, through the example of
   the isolated Sweden Democrats (SD) at the local level. Conceptualizing
   the cordon sanitaire as a social norm, rather than as a strategy gives
   new insights into the conditions under which it is complied with,
   violated, and enforced through sanctions. It also provides an
   explanation for previously puzzling outcomes, such as the failure of
   mainstream parties to abandon the cordon once it proves ineffective in
   limiting the challenger's growth and influence.},

Abstract = {Legitimacy is a bulwark for courts; even when judges engage in
   controversial or disagreeable behavior, the public tends to acquiesce.
   Recent studies identify several threats to the legitimacy of courts,
   including polarization and attacks by political elites. This article
   contributes to the scholarly discourse by exploring a previously
   unconsidered threat: scandal, or allegations of personal misbehavior. We
   argue that scandals can undermine confidence in judges as virtuous
   arbiters and erode broad public support for the courts. Using survey
   experiments, we draw on real-world judicial controversies to evaluate
   the impact of scandal on specific support for judicial actors and their
   rulings and diffuse support for the judiciary. We demonstrate that
   scandals erode individual support but find no evidence that
   institutional support is diminished. These findings may ease normative
   concerns that isolated indiscretions by controversial jurists may
   deplete the vast ``reservoir of goodwill{''} that is foundational to the
   courts.},

Abstract = {Democratic theory tells us that citizens should be engaged, informed,
   passionate, reasonable, willing to speak up, ready to listen, and
   militant but also restrained. Yet we are rarely told how they might
   achieve this. The challenge is particularly relevant for theories that
   distinguish between the liberal and democratic principles of our regime
   with their contradictory ideals of citizenship. This article draws on
   Plato's reflections on drinking wine with friends in the Laws to argue
   that the political psychology suggested therein fits the complex ideal
   of citizenship in a liberal democracy. Furthermore, it shows how
   extrapolitical and even disreputable social practices can not only help
   prepare citizens for political life but also enable them to deal with
   the inequalities that inevitably contaminate it. Weaving together law,
   contestation, reason, and passion, the Platonic account articulates the
   psychological burdens of citizenship in a liberal democracy and suggests
   ways to cope with them.},

Abstract = {This study aims to explain why some anti-systemic parties come to power
   while others remain as permanent opposition or disappear over time. The
   evidence is sought from the comparative analysis of the socialist
   Workers' Party of Turkey (Turkiye Isci Partisi, 1961-1971, permanent
   opposition) and the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (Refah Partisi, 1983-1998,
   in power). In particular, the parties are compared and contrasted in
   terms of their organizational style, leadership structure, and linkage
   with the voters. The paper argues that while the TIP built a loose and
   vertical local organization, the RP had a strong grassroots organization
   cemented through Islamic ideology. Second, while the RP had an
   unchallenged leadership of Necmettin Erbakan, the TIP had a fragmented
   leadership resulting from multiple ideological conflicts which
   undermined the efficiency of the decision-making process and its
   implementation. Finally, while the TIP was a textbook example of a
   programmatic party under the guidance of socialist ideology, the RP
   heavily relied on the distribution of clientelist resources - mostly
   emanating from its control in the municipalities and central government
   - to address voters. Overall, the RP took advantage of these strategies
   to rapidly extend its voter base beyond core voters, particularly in
   metropolitan areas, while the TIP largely remained restricted to narrow
   constituencies.},

   Germany},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {How does executive power-sharing in multiparty democracies influence
   voter decision-making? The current scholarship has identified two
   strategies that voters use to target coalitions and that involve voting
   for a minor party: Coalition insurance voting and compensatory voting.
   Yet these strategies are not differentiated conceptually, and
   empirically, are observationally equivalent. By foregrounding the role
   of policy signals in strategic voting for minor parties, the present
   study disentangles these strategies at the theoretical and empirical
   levels. It also proposes a new, hybrid, strategy. To do so, it uses data
   on the 2013 and 2017 German federal elections from campaign-period
   surveys, polls and an original dataset of the candidates' tweets about
   policy issues. The results show evidence of policy-driven voters using a
   hybrid strategy in 2013 and a compensatory strategy in 2017. There is no
   evidence of coalition insurance voting in these elections.},

Abstract = {Are dominant governing parties with discretion to call early elections
   better able to negotiate their return to office? Dominant incumbents in
   parliamentary democracies sometimes have extensive powers to dissolve
   parliament, which enables them to affect coalition bargaining. Yet,
   whether these powers advantage them in forming the next coalition
   remains poorly understood. To address this gap, this article develops a
   theory of coalition formation in the shadow of parliamentary
   dissolution. Incumbents who can dissolve the assembly, it argues, are
   more likely to return to government than their peers who lack this power
   because they enjoy greater bargaining leverage and reputational
   advantages in coalition formation. The article tests this expectation
   using mixed and conditional logistic regression analysis of data on 631
   government formation opportunities and 433,401 potential coalitions and
   finds that coalition leaders with discretion to dissolve parliament
   secure significant advantages in negotiating their return to power.},

Abstract = {The traditional media are currently immersed in an accelerated
   structural change, driven by the irruption of Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICT), which cause the emigration of their
   audiences towards other forms or modalities of reception and
   consumption. The appearance and popularization of the so-called social
   networks in the framework (ICT) brings with it a set of challenges for
   traditional radios. Consequently, the objective of the research
   consisted of describing some political challenges of the radio in the
   scenario of the digital revolution, as a condition of possibility to
   stop its extension as mass media. To achieve the proposed objective, the
   phenomenological and hermeneutical methodology was used with a
   predominance of documentary sources in digital format, which were
   analyzed and discussed to draw up the conclusions of the study. The
   results obtained allow us to conclude that the Ecuadorian state does not
   establish the necessary political guidelines to carry out a systematized
   and orderly transition from analog to digital broadcasting, which
   implies a technological backwardness in terms of ICT in the country.},

Abstract = {The paper presents the results of a survey of 1062 Russian political
   scientists, conducted in 2021. It provides data on their demographic
   characteristics, employment, interests, intellectual authorities,
   methods and languages used, as well as on their views on science and
   politics. A model Russian political scientist is a woman, 30-39 years
   old, PhD (kandidat nauk), teaching at a university between 800 and 900
   contact hours a year, but finding time to consult state and municipal
   authorities, interested in international relations, considers Samuel
   Huntington's work exemplary, holds that Vladimir Gelman is the most
   important political scientist in Russia, uses historical methods and
   thinks that history is the most important discipline for a prospective
   political scientist, reads in Russian and in English in equal shares,
   believes that Russian political scientists should cherish their own
   national intellectual tradition, at the same time impartially and
   objectively observing political processes, gives comments in press,
   votes in all elections and self-identifies politically as an etatist
   (state-minded).},

Abstract = {Based on an analysis of the historiography produced in the last two
   decades on the his-tory of women, gender and sexuality in Peru, this
   study proposes to reflect on the gender gaps in the Peruvian academy and
   their effect on the production of historical knowledge. In par-ticular,
   it analyzes the impact of the academic field on the reproduction and
   invisibilization of historically rooted forms of inequality, as well as
   the challenge of addressing the histori-cal foundations of some of the
   most pressing problems in contemporary Peru: gender-based violence, the
   masculinization of political power, gender factors in the reproduction
   of the cycle of poverty, the unequal distribution of care
   responsibilities and, above all, the denial of gender inequality.},

Abstract = {``Independence{''}, being a philosophical category, acquires
   concretization in political science and political discourse when it is
   binded to the notion of ``sovereignty{''}. Using the example of the
   post-Soviet countries of Central Asia, the author examines the dynamics
   of the change in the notion of ``independence{''} and attempts to
   conceptualize it. The study considers the speeches of the presidents of
   the Central Asian republics on Independence Day. The purpose of these
   speeches is to ``explain{''} the meaning of ``independence{''} to the
   people. The speeches of the presidents are analyzed using qualitative
   content analysis taking into account the historical context. The working
   hypothesis is that the mobilization and integration potential of the
   notion of ``independence{''} is leveled by the narrativization of the
   notion. In the article, the historical and legal starting point for the
   development of the notion of ``independence{''} is 1) the Soviet
   understanding of ``sovereignty{''} and the Constitution of the USSR. The
   dynamics of attempts to comprehend and conceptualize the notion 2) by
   the intelligentsia in perestroika times, 3) by the authors of the CIS in
   1991, who radicalized the notion, and 4) the post-Soviet official
   ``presidential{''} understanding and interpretation are examined step by
   step. The author comes to the conclusion that the notion of
   ``independence{''} still needs to be conceptualized, since it has not
   gained a systematic understanding through existing narratives. The
   notion has not yet been defined by considering its essential features
   and its manifestations in the political life of the society of
   post-Soviet Central Asia (i.e., no ontologization of the term has been
   carried out). The causes and consequences of the events of 1991 were not
   articulated in society and by academics in Central Asia.},

Title = {NUCLEAR METAMORPHOSES},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2023},
Number = {5},
Pages = {7-28},
Abstract = {The international community that brings together civilized politicians
   and strategic experts generally accepts the sacramental maxim that
   ``nuclear war cannot be wan and it should never be fought{''} and that
   ``nuclear weapons-as long as they exist-should serve to deter aggression
   and prevent war{''}. However, thesewell-intentioned principles are
   easier to proclaim than translate into practical policy. While the
   development of all nuclear weapons in all countries is justified by the
   imperative of deterrence, all of these weapons are, in fact, designed
   for the actual conduct of nuclear war, thus serving as a material basis
   of the doctrines of nuclear deterrence. Depending on the scenarios of
   using nuclear weapons, under the influence of technological development
   and amid intense international conflicts, these deterrence doctrines
   undergo frightening transformations (metamorphoses), turning into their
   opposite, i.e. plans and practical options of unleashing a nuclear war.
   Recently, this has been manifested in the Russian strategic discourse on
   ways to quickly and successfully complete the military special operation
   in Ukraine. Such initiatives are prone with the danger of Russian
   national suicide. There is no acceptable alternative to a peaceful
   settlement of the Ukrainian conflict, and disagreements on its terms are
   not worth the risk of a nuclear apocalypse. It is only through nuclear

Title = {From Geopolitical Anxiety to Assertive Stance: The Historical
   Construction and Transformation of Turkish Naval Strategy},
Journal = {INSIGHT TURKEY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {117-143},
Abstract = {This article traces the evolution of Turkiye's naval strategy from a
   defensive coastal-based concept to an assertive one within a broader
   geopo-litical perspective. The shift began during the Cyprus crisis of
   the 1960s and was made possible by the Navy's desire to return to the
   seas. The ``Toward Open Seas{''} strategy of the 1990s and the
   development of the Turkish defense industry in the 2000s under the AK
   Party government further enabled this shift. By 2015, the Navy had
   become more active and was mobilized under a comprehensive strategic
   reorientation, reflecting its expanded role beyond coastal defense. It
   examines the various contextual factors that have influenced the
   transformation of Turkiye's naval forces, including the
   intra-in-stitutional context under the Turkish Armed Forces, the
   discursive context regarding dominant geopolitical narratives, and the
   geostrategic context concerning the operationalization of Turkish naval
   strategy. The article's main aim is to contribute to the existing
   literature on Turkiye's naval strat-egy by drawing on primary sources
   that have not yet been fully examined.},

Abstract = {This study explores the potential of digital civic activism, considering
   the existing contributions of migration, political, social movements,
   and media studies on solidarity towards contemporary migration flows in
   Europe. The study investigates how the unbalanced techno-symbolic
   assemblage of power exercised on European borders can be challenged
   through spontaneous acts of online solidarity. It looks at bottom-up
   solidarity on social media platforms, holding together two dimensions:
   the communicative practices of specific singular makers of solidarity,
   seen as potential activation elements; the response of the users reached
   and involved by their content. To this end, two activists located on the
   real borders of the Balkan route and on the digital borders of the
   social media platform Facebook have been studied, namely Nawal Soufi and
   Lorena Fornasir. A quali-quantitative analysis was carried out on posts
   and related comments published in the last two years on the Facebook
   pages of the two activists. We argue that in today's fragmented digital
   public sphere, their communicative practices are acts of citizenship
   insofar as they represent a form of resistance to the European fortress
   system and re-appropriation of the use of social media. Indeed, they can
   empathically -emotionally and cognitively -connect networked citizens to
   the reality of migration flows, conveying awareness and soliciting the
   participation of a possible mediapolis that casts on/offline acts.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of conflicts surrounding the
   approval procedure for the head of the Russian government in 1996-1999.
   The procedure was formed under the conditions of the acute confrontation
   between the President and the State Duma, with both aiming to fill the
   procedure with their own different content. While the presidential
   branch of power assumed that the appointment of the head of government
   was its prerogative, and the functions of parliament were purely
   advisory in nature, the deputies insisted on expanding their own
   participation in the process, demanding, in particular, that the State
   Duma should take part in determining a range of candidates proposed for
   its consideration.The author documents the gaps in the mechanism for
   approving the head of government described in the 1993 Constitution and
   examines in detail the positions of the State Duma and the President on
   the procedure provided for by this mechanism. After that the author
   turns his attention to the conflict that occurred in August-September,
   1998. According to his assessment, the legislative branch's victory in
   this conflict was largely explained by the fact that, given the
   confrontation experience they already had with the president, the
   deputies began in advance to work out possible strategies for pressuring
   him. The launch of impeachment procedure and consultations with voters,
   the Federation Council, and extra-parliamentary political associations,
   appeared to be the most efficient strategies.However, the State Duma's
   victory was not consolidated at the institutional level. As a result,
   the legislative branch, out of all its gains, retained only ceremonial
   and consultative components of the approval procedure for prime
   minister. The presidential branch of power has returned all the
   positions it lost in 1998, regaining its decisive role in appointing the
   government.},

Abstract = {This article aims to look at Genoa Bolzaneto Nino Bixio barracks through
   a perspective that combines reality and fiction. Just like in the two
   texts: Genova, il posto sbagliato written by Enrica Bartesaghi, the
   president of the Truth and Justice Committee for Genoa, and Teorema
   dell'incompletezza written by the demonstrator and novelist Valerio
   Callieri. In July 2001, during the G8 Summit, the barracks became a
   temporary prison, and a crime, which at the time did not exist in the
   Italian Penal Code was committed there: torture. Despite the
   extraordinary nature of such an experience, many people managed to write
   their own first-hand accounts and, even in turn, to obtain a form of
   justice, albeit partial. The story of Bolzaneto has also been expressed
   through a literary style that has given voice to the incredible: where
   expectations, but also the fear of not being believed, are taken to new
   heights. A style in which traces of memory can come to life and inhabit
   places and landscapes like the scenes of a drama: the novel.},

Title = {The Romanian Electoral Management Body: Between the Governmental Model
   and the Independent Model},
Journal = {ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This study examines the Romanian Electoral Management Body (EMB),
   focusing on its dualistic structure. It distinguishes between the formal
   independence and functional independence of electoral management
   institutions and proposes a qualitative evaluation of the Permanent
   Electoral Authority (AEP) and the Central Electoral Bureau (BEC). The
   analysis is anchored in the context of the three EMB models,
   independent, governmental, and mixed, providing a framework for
   understanding the Romanian system. The findings indicate that the
   Romanian EMB exhibits formal independence but faces a political
   influence that cannot be neglected. The analysis employs the criteria
   proposed by Bishop and Hoeffler to evaluate the EMB's independence and
   impartiality. The study finds that two out of five criteria are fully
   met, two are only formally respected, and one is notmet. This highlights
   a significant discrepancy between the formal and functional independence
   of the EMB, distancing it from the ideal independent model. While
   Romania formally adopted an independent EMB model, practical realities
   reveal a closer alignment with a governmental model, influenced by
   political and financial dependencies. The research observations can be
   used both to advance studies in this field and to propose
   recommendations for improving the legal and institutional framework with
   the aim of strengthening democracy and public trust in electoral
   processes},

Journal = {STATE CRIME},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda's historic judgment in
   the Akayesu Judgment established that rape and other forms of sexual
   violence can be an actus reus of genocide as defined by the United
   Nations Convention on Genocide Article II. The Akayesu Judgment
   therefore provides a logical framework to analyze a hidden episode of
   extreme post-colonial state violence in the newly independent Zimbabwe,
   namely a state policy of mass atrocities in Matabeleland and parts of
   the Midlands, targeting the minority Ndebele ethnic group during
   Operation Gukurahundi. The specific foci of this study are the patterns
   of mass rape and sexual violence in the military operation between 1983
   and 1984 in Matabeleland. Drawing on 36 in-depth interviews with
   survivors from throughout Matabeleland, this study provides a critical
   new lens on Operation Gukurahundi through its identification of uniform
   systematic patterns of rape and other forms of sexual violence across
   Matabeleland. The article concludes that the patterns of rape and other
   forms of sexual violence identified in this study are indicative of a
   state policy of systematic genocidal rape between 1983 and 1984,
   deployed with the intent and effect to destroy, in part, a specific
   ethnic group, namely the minority Ndebele of Zimbabwe, thereby
   fulfilling every condition of the Genocide Convention principles of
   genocide.},

Abstract = {A large number of governments are currently in an adaptation process of
   their institutional and political frameworks to the 2030 Agenda for
   Sustainable Development, an international commitment that, for the first
   time, promotes the implementation of a set of public policies inside the
   States. However, the theoretical foundations of this agenda have not yet
   been analyzed by the literature. This is a crucial aim for to know the
   depths implications of this agenda and for to guide political action in
   a reflective way. This article carries out an analysis of the 2030
   Agenda from Political Theory, trying, firstly, to place it in the
   traditions of Western political thought, and secondly, to address the
   need of incorporate a more conflict-oriented dimension that allows the
   politicization of the agenda, in order to increase its
   discursive-symbolic value and its potential contribution to the
   transformations pursued.},

Title = {{[}en] The emergence of political innovations to communal democracy.
   Contributions from a feminist organization experience: Casa Comunidad},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {60},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Assuming communal democracy as an emerging process of experimentation,
   struggle and continuous construction, directs our gaze towards the
   assessment of the contributions made by those political movements that
   are forged in the heat of resistance to the relationships and
   institutions of the current capitalist, patriarchal, racist and colonial
   society. This article pulls the reflection towards an experience of
   political activism which is part of the contemporary feminist movement
   in Argentina. From a qualitative case approach, we address the following
   question: what are the emerging political contributions that the
   experience of the feminist organization Casa Comunidad, in the city of
   Cordoba, Argentina, makes to communal democracy? The main result
   explains that there are two emerging political innovations: community
   self-defenses and a reorganization of care work as community work. But
   the emergence of these meanings and practices is inseparable from
   claims, demands and needs not only of its direct protagonists -women
   from popular neighbourhoods in the city of Cordoba- but also from other
   organized and struggling social sectors, contemporary and past. Our
   results aim to provide theoretical and empirical elements to, on the one
   hand, specify what the emerging nature of communal democracy practices
   means; and, on the other, to value the contributions of the feminist
   movement in Argentina which, as part of a broader Latin American
   experience, offers keys to ``doing democratic{''} that dispute the
   diagnoses that simply assume the stagnation, low quality or political
   disaffection of our societies regarding democracy.},

Title = {U.S. - CHINA RIVALRY IN LATIN AMERICA: AT THE ORIGINS OF TECHNOLOGICAL
   DECOUPLING},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2023},
Number = {3},
Pages = {20-38},
Abstract = {Increasing U.S. - China competition revealed the leading role of the
   technology sphere in the terms of global leadership. Ongoing rivalry
   between two states led to the appearance of decoupling process which
   results in severance of economic, technological, and political ties.
   This phenomenon was taken on a global scale, with the U.S. and China
   seeking to form techno-economic blocs (technological ecosystems). Based
   on this hypothesis, the authors investigates the processes of
   technological dissociation on the example of U.S. - China competition in
   Latin America. For this purpose, the paper uses the technology transfer
   theory by K. Krause, transnational relations theory by J. Nye, R.
   Keohane, and international political economy approaches, as well as
   comparative and network methods of analysis. The authors take economic
   statistics, including data on value added from the TiVA database and on
   high-tech trade from UNCTAD dataset, and consider the 5G market as a
   field of political competition. The authors investigate the region's
   value-added structure and high-tech trade of LA countries. The article
   concludes that the U.S. and China form network structures in value
   chains that meet the needs of national security, and a ``new
   bipolarity{''} in the network of high-tech trade. In the context of
   Krause's theory, the authors propose a structural scheme of
   technological decoupling in which the spread of 5G technology plays a
   key role. It is the use of new telecommunication standards that is main
   reason to technological decoupling in the region. In this regard, the
   authors investigate the LA market and the individual cases of MNCs,
   which are the key drivers of competition in this field and thus
   influence the technological sovereignty of the states in the region.},

   without political recognition?},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {60},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The Poderes Populares Locales (PPLs) emerge as a figure under which the
   non-combatant civilian population was organised during El Salvador's
   past armed conflict (1980-1992). Specifically, PPLs emerged in areas
   where the civil war had its main combat scenario between the Salvadoran
   Armed Forces and the FMLN guerrillas. Existing literature attributes
   three reasons for their existence to them: self-protection among the
   civilian population, community organisation in the absence of Salvadoran
   state representatives, and self-management of the most basic needs
   (water, education, health and food) to survive human existence. Despite
   its importance, there has been little reflection on the power structure
   that existed within the PPL and, after the conflict, on the direction
   taken by this organisation. In view of this, an important question
   arises: were the PPLs a form of communal democracy during the past armed
   conflict in El Salvador which, in political terms, has not been
   recognised? What role did the PPLs play in the community sphere after
   the end of the war and the signing of the peace agreement?},

Abstract = {The general objective of this research is to analyze the emergence,
   formation, and consolidation of environmentalist discourse in Argentina
   through the study of print media. The media are considered, on the one
   hand, as bearers of symbolic power and, on the other, as a source of
   historical information that allows us to understand socio-environmental
   dynamics and their cultural repercussions in the recent past. To achieve
   this objective, a holistic and interdisciplinary approach is adopted,
   establishing the interconnection between environmental history,
   communication, and critical discourse studies. The selected sources
   include countercultural magazines such as Eco Contempor \& aacute;neo
   (1960s), Expreso Imaginario (1970s), and Mutantia (1980s), as well as
   national newspapers such as La Nacion, Clarin, and Pagina/12. This
   research is conducted through a historical-environmental approach
   focused on the emergence of environmentalist discourse and its
   implications for social and environmental justice. By integrating the
   perspective of peace and conflict studies, it demonstrates how the
   Argentine environmentalist movement contributes to the construction of
   sustainable peace, understood as a process that includes environmental
   and social justice.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Abstract = {Separation-of-powers studies of judicial decision-making largely focus
   on congressional influences. Less attention is given to the role of
   presidents, which is surprising given their vast policy-making powers.
   Accordingly, we develop a new theory of how presidents influence the
   Supreme Court's review of statutes through potential legislative and
   administrative action. Using a data set of all federal laws passed
   between 1948 and 2015, we find, like others, that judicial review is
   less likely to occur when the court faces an ideologically hostile
   Congress. Unlike previous work, we reveal that such constraint is only
   effective when Congress is aligned with the president, who is less
   inclined to veto court-curbing legislation. We also find that the
   court's distance to the president is constraining given threats of
   nonenforcement, but only when the law is salient, the president and
   public align, and the president exerts more control over implementation.},

   Agreements in Federal Systems},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {312-326},
Abstract = {Federal systems face specific challenges in fulfilling their
   international commitments. In cases of shared jurisdiction, the federal
   government needs the sub-federal level to contribute to the
   implementation process. Both Canada and the EU have used side-payments
   to bring and keep on board reluctant and opposing provinces and member
   states in the implementation of international agreements. However, both
   cases have experienced the limits of this strategy. This article aims to
   make a theoretical contribution by identifying the causal conditions and
   processes that help explain the success and failure of using
   side-payments to encourage sub-federal support for the implementation of
   an international agreement. Based on the study of the implementation of
   the Paris Agreement in Canada and the EU, I develop a two-fold argument.
   First, side-payments can be an effective tool to persuade sub-federal
   governments if they are generally interested in contributing to
   implementation. They do not work for governments of powerful entities
   that are unwilling to implement. Second, sub-federal governments react
   to other actors' conduct. Side-payments can keep reluctant governments
   of weak entities on board only as long as no alliance of powerful
   sub-federal entities is formed that resists the implementation of an
   international agreement.},

Title = {Polarization and Campaign Spending in Elections},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 1},
Abstract = {I develop a Downsian model of electoral competition in which candidates
   with policy and office motivations use platforms and campaign spending
   to gain the median voter's support. The unique equilibrium involves
   randomizing over platforms and spending and exhibits the following
   properties: (i) ex ante uncertainty about the winner, (ii) platform
   divergence, (iii) inefficiency in spending and outcomes, (iv)
   polarization, and (v) voter extremism. I show that platform polarization
   and spending move in tandem, since spending is used by candidates to
   gain support for extreme platforms. Factors that contribute to both
   include the candidates' desire for extreme policies and their capability
   at translating spending into support for them. I also show that strong
   incumbents parlay an advantage into more extreme platforms, consistent
   with the classic marginality hypothesis but contrasting with a large
   theoretical literature in which candidates with an (exogenous or
   endogenous) valence advantage tend to moderate their platforms.},

Pages = {121-138},
Abstract = {This article challenges the narrative that portrays the digital economy
   as environmentally friendly, harmless, and devoid of material
   consequences. In the first section, I examine the smartphone supply
   chain to illustrate how everyday items in the digital economy contribute
   to and reinforce environmentally detrimental industrial and extractive
   practices. The second part conducts an analysis of the ideological and
   discursive tools employed by digital capitalist institutions to
   systematically mask extensive environmental damage. Within this
   framework, I identify and analyze three fundamental axioms of the
   political ecology of digital capitalism: perpetual capitalism and
   growth, technological solutionism, and the choice between a green and
   digital civilization or impending catastrophe.},
