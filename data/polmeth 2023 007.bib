Abstract = {While we are familiar with socialist and fascist aesthetics, liberalism
   is not usually thought to permit a political role for literature.
   Nussbaum has attempted to fill this lacuna. She sketches a ``liberal
   aesthetics{''} by linking three aspects of literature to her normative
   proposal. The representation of suffering is connected to the capability
   approach; the presentation of ethical dilemmas to political liberalism;
   and the reaction of pity to legal and political judgment. Literature is
   thus hoped to contribute to the stability of liberal democracies.For
   over 25 years, individual works by Nussbaum on the value of literature
   have been critiqued on aesthetic grounds: for not dealing with form, for
   denying the polyphony of texts, for having a limited conception of
   readerly identification, and for using an elitist and generically
   limited selection of material. As of yet, no criticisms have, however,
   considered the full oeuvre of Nussbaum's defense of literature, and none
   have examined this aspect of her work in light of her political
   philosophy.By placing the aesthetic and political aspects of Nussbaum's
   work in conversation, this article investigates the proposed
   relationship between literature and liberalism. It argues that each
   component of Nussbaum's liberal aesthetics contains a political danger:
   foreclosing discussion of intergenerational responsibility; obscuring
   questions about which doctrines are permissible in the public sphere;
   and encouraging stereotypes of marginalized people. Literature,
   understood like this, may risk exacerbating present tensions within
   liberalism, rather than bolstering its stability.},

Abstract = {This article employs the theoretical concept of racial capitalism as an
   intellectual framework with which to theorise and explain racialised
   inequality in South Africa. Historical evidence shows that the
   accumulation of Whiteness in South Africa has historically been
   inseparable from the accumulation of capital. This work illustrates that
   the African National Congress (ANC) used the Truth and Reconciliation
   Commission (TRC) to launder and legitimise racial capitalism in
   post-apartheid South Africa. It identifies Black Economic Empowerment
   (BEE) as one of the ANC government's economic laundering schemes that it
   employs to legitimise racial capitalism in post-apartheid South Africa.
   I use the insight of scholars such as Marzia Milazzo to conclude that,
   as a full-blown laundered discourse, racial capitalism allows a White
   middle class to continue to own and manage the means of production and
   intergenerational wealth, while a Black middle class continues to endure
   intergenerational poverty and dispossession.},

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, ad hoc direct relief payments were used
   extensively as a means of economic stimulation and individual
   compensation. Current studies are focusing on the economic impact of
   these policies, but they seldom consider how these payments affect
   individual beliefs and attitudes. This study used a survey with
   quasi-experimental elements to examine how these payments affected
   tertiary students in Hong Kong by focusing primarily on a cohort
   including both eligible and noneligible students. Whereas satisfaction
   with the economy and government and support for democracy were not
   affected, nonrecipients assigned greater importance to meritocratic
   factors in improving life outcomes. The findings of this study shed
   light on how governments inadvertently may be affecting the outlook of
   young adults with transfers during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {The Albanian-Chinese alliance existed between 1960 and 1978, an unusual
   relationship due to the roles and influences of both in and out of the
   Communist Bloc. Although ideological affinity is generally regarded as
   essential to the performance of an alliance, contingency and
   circumstance also matter. The main factors that influenced the character
   of the Sino-Albanian alliance will be revealed through the official
   correspondence of that time between the two countries, founded mainly in
   Central State Archive. Albania and China collaborated for 18 years and
   after their ideological conflicts Albania followed a self-isolation
   policy. After the fall of Communism in Albania, bilateral ties developed
   under the new circumstances for several years. It was China's Belt and
   Road Initiative (BRI) that helped create new conditions for cooperation.
   Through a descriptive analysis, this paper presumes/hypothesizes whether
   being old allies in the past can be considered as a prerequisite for
   cooperation in the present. In the beginning, Albania assessed the
   potential of BRI and proposed some important projects with China, but
   lately it has shown more ambivalence and reluctance toward the
   ``16+1{''} mechanism. We also examine the main factors on the Albanian
   side that may bolster or undercut future bilateral cooperation under the
   ``16+1{''} framework.},

Volume = {12},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Discriminatory attitudes towards racial minorities are prevalent
   throughout society. However, there is mixed evidence of electoral
   discrimination for racial minority candidates beyond the American
   context. This paper investigates the effect of racial attitudes on the
   electoral performance of Canada's New Democratic Party (NDP), by
   examining the case of Jagmeet Singh, the country's first major federal
   party leader of color. Relying on three surveys from the Canadian
   Election Study (2015-2021) and controlling for demographics, ideology,
   and partisanship, we find voters with more negative attitudes toward
   racial minorities were significantly: (1) less likely to vote for the
   NDP under Singh's leadership; (2) more likely to abandon than join the
   party in his first federal election; and (3) more likely to view Singh
   negatively than his predecessor. The findings suggest that some racial
   minority candidates likely face significant electoral penalties, which
   may contribute to the consistent underrepresentation of racial
   minorities throughout democracies.},

Abstract = {How does protest affect political speech? Protest is an important form
   of political claim-making, yet our understanding of its influence on how
   individual legislators communicate remains limited. Our paper thus
   extends a theoretical framework on protests as information about voter
   preferences, and evaluates it using crowd-sourced protest data from the
   2017-2019 Fridays for Future protests in the UK. We combine these data
   with similar to 2.4m tweets from 553 legislators over this period and
   text data from similar to 150k parliamentary speech records. We find
   that local protests prompted MPs to speak more about the climate, but
   only online. These results demonstrate that protest can shape the timing
   and substance of political communication by individual elected
   representatives. They also highlight an important difference between
   legislators' offline and online speech, suggesting that more work is
   needed to understand how political strategies differ across these
   arenas.},

Abstract = {This study explores the main building blocks of participatory activism
   utilised by sympathisers of the Islamic State within their online media
   networks. The organisation has named this militant practice ``media
   jihad{''} or militancy (munasara), which is built on the cultural
   patterns of traditional ground-based jihad. The practice involves
   transferring cultural values and war manoeuvres into the virtual
   ecosystem. The virtual tactics used by sympathisers are linked to the
   cultural norms of jihad, resulting in a combination of battlefield jihad
   values and digital resistance practices. The term ``Jihacktivism{''} is
   introduced to describe this complex combinative Jihadist contention
   model promoted by the Islamic State. It is a digital resistance paradigm
   that decentralises the production and dissemination of the Islamic
   State's propaganda and empowers sympathisers to contribute to the
   organisation's communication of jihad. By doing so, sympathisers may
   foster a sense of solidarity and become more identified with the group's
   cultural schemas and ideological beliefs.},

Abstract = {Children affected by armed conflict are disproportionately impacted by
   humanitarian crises and rising global fragility. Changing conflict
   dynamics, emerging tactics by armed groups, and evolving radicalized
   violence are increasing children's vulnerability, including the threat
   of being recruited and used in violence. And yet, there is a glaring
   omission of consideration for children in conflict early warning and no
   early warning indicators focused on children's engagement in violence.
   Our study explores how children are considered in early warning systems
   and the need to focus on recruitment and use as a relevant conflict
   indicator, to inform more effective and child responsive prevention.},

Abstract = {This article examines the construction of national identity in the
   context of the post-9/11 counter-terrorism sanctions regime established
   by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373. The study focuses on
   the written reports of three member states - Cameroon, Kenya, and
   Nigeria - arguing that these documents not only serve as inventories of
   national capacity but also as performances of national identity within a
   specific historical moment. Two overarching arguments are made. First,
   constructions of terrorism play a crucial discursive role in demarcating
   self from other in these reports, consistently portraying terrorism as
   an external and morally reprehensible threat to national security.
   Second, despite this relatively consistent framing of terrorist
   otherness, the reports contain creative and diverse reflections on, or
   articulations of, national identity and its associated characteristics.
   In making these arguments, the article contributes to existing
   literature on the post-9/11 UN counter-terrorism regime by offering an
   original reading of national submissions to the UN Counter-Terrorism
   Committee, focusing on relatively neglected states from the global
   South, and develops new conceptual insight into the plasticity of
   terrorism as a form of discursive otherness capable of sustaining
   diverse representations of national self-identity},

Abstract = {Since 2010, waves of protest have ebbed and now largely faded across the
   Arab states of the Middle East, and authoritarian politics there appear
   to be stronger than ever. Has dissent disappeared, or merely become
   harder to notice? I argue in this article that clientelism serves as an
   important locus of latent dissent in the Middle East, one that calls
   into question the legitimacy of authoritarian regimes, though it often
   happens away from public view. Employing data from four waves of the
   Arab Barometer, however, I show that the more citizens perceive
   clientelism to be prevalent in society, the less likely they are to
   willingly obey their government when they disagree with it. This finding
   is most pronounced among those most on the fence about obeying the
   government in the first place, and during periods in which overt dissent
   is least apparent. Clientelism beliefs also increase support for
   democratic alternatives in the most recent data. In addition, while
   clientelism should increase voting and election-related mobilization, I
   find inconsistent results across time. This article complicates our
   current understanding of the role clientelism plays in authoritarian
   states, and it sheds new light on the ``client side{''} of the
   patron-client relationship.},

Abstract = {We show that current levels of democracy in Africa are linked to the
   nature of its independence movements. Using different measures of
   political regimes and historical data on anticolonial movements, we find
   that countries that experienced rural insurgencies tend to have
   autocratic regimes, while those that faced urban protests tend to have
   more democratic institutions. The association between the type of
   independence movement and democracy is statistically significant for the
   post-Cold War period and robust to a number of potential confounding
   factors and sensitivity checks. We provide evidence for causality in
   this relationship by using an instrumental variables approach and a
   difference-in-differences design with fixed effects. Furthermore, we
   adjudicate between two potential mechanisms and find support for a
   behavioral path dependence hypothesis. Urban protests enabled
   participants to develop norms of peaceful political behavior, which
   provided cultural bases for liberal democracy. In contrast, armed
   rebellions generated behavioral patterns that perpetuated political
   exclusion and the use of violence as a form of political dissent.},

Title = {American Philanthropy in the Age of Political Polarization: Conservative
   Megadonors and Foundations and Their Role in Spreading Climate
   Skepticism},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},

Abstract = {Wealthy citizens have influenced public debates and the political
   process in the United States in many ways, for example through donations
   or campaign finance. Philanthropy is viewed increasingly as another
   vehicle of more indirect elite influence. Although institutionally
   designed to stay above the partisan fray, philanthropy has increasingly
   been politicized over the last decades against the backdrop of growing
   partisan polarization. The conservative side in particular has
   consolidated influence through conservative foundations, think tanks,
   and new tools of giving such as donor-advised funds. Climate change is
   one issue in which conservatives have pushed skeptical views and
   disinformation over the last decades. Conservative actors backed by
   philanthropic activity have shaped public discourse according to
   climate-skeptic views and have worked to block political action on
   climate change while also forming global networks and practices across
   the Atlantic. While trying to retain the image of academic research and
   political neutrality, right-wing European think tanks are spreading
   climate change disinformation, often with connections to their American
   counterparts and with the support of American conservative donors and
   foundations. Overall, this paper argues that parts of the philanthropic
   sector in the United States have abandoned early notions of public
   charity in order to pursue considerable societal and political goals
   under the guise of philanthropic activity that provides tax benefits and
   the image of political neutrality. This paper builds on research that
   shows how much the interests of the wealthy are reflected in political
   decision-making in the United States (Bartels 2008; Page, Bartels, and
   Seawright 2013; Gilens and Page 2014), dark money debates in U.S.
   politics (Mayer 2017; Oklobdzija 2019), and discussions around the role
   of philanthropic foundations in a democratic society (Reich 2013, 2018).},

Abstract = {The study is devoted to strategic coordination represented as a list of
   ``smart voting{''} candidates for single-member districts at the State
   Duma election on September 19, 2O21. There is a great deal of skepticism
   in the literature that patterns of strategic voting can be found
   nationwide in Russia because of the prevalence of the personal vote in
   ticket splitting. The analysis of the election has confirmed that the
   effect of ``smart voting{''} is rather small in contrast to the personal
   vote. Therefore, the attempt of the Russian non-systemic opposition to
   coordinate electorates strategically has not yet been an effective tool
   to mobilize voters on a country-wide scale. The study has also revealed
   strong counterbalances to ``smart voting{''} like the incumbency
   advantage of United Russia's nominees and the spoiler effect produced by
   candidates from the spoiler parties like the Communists of Russia and
   Party of Pensioners.},

Abstract = {Much has been made of the rise of English nationalism, reflected in the
   strong association of `being English' and voting Leave in the Brexit
   referendum in 2016. This article examines recent books on Englishness,
   arguing that this is a complex and nuanced matter embedded in accreted
   myths. If there is a thoroughgoing `nationalism' emerging in England, it
   requires not only significant and long-lasting shifts in national
   identity, but a conception of `England' as an imagined community which
   is robust and relevant to modern social and cultural life. Furthermore,
   it requires a nationalism which is part of wider and ongoing political
   project, rather than a short-term political expedient such as
   Conservative mobilisation post-Brexit. The article argues that an older
   debate in the 1960s and 1970s, between Tom Nairn and E.P. Thompson sheds
   significant light on the origins and nature of Englishness, such that it
   has progressive rather than reactionary potential.},

Abstract = {Russian President Vladimir Putin has demonstrated a keen interest in
   questions of history and political theory over his more than two decades
   at or near the apex of Russian power. These questions became
   particularly salient in Russia's political discourse after Putin
   returned to power in 2012 and inaugurated the so-called ``conservative
   turn.{''} This paper examines how Putin characterized liberalism between
   his return to power in 2012 and the start of the ``special military
   operation{''} in Ukraine on 24 February 2022. It contends that, over
   this decade, Putin consistently positioned himself as a moderate critic
   of Western liberalism as opposed to an uncompromising ideologue, even
   after the 2014 Ukraine crisis. To highlight this tendency, this paper
   simultaneously examines two prominent Russian state television
   personalities - Dmitrii Kiselev and Vladimir Solov'ev - who have used
   strident rhetoric in describing Western liberalism, notably after the
   2014 crisis in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the role of collective memory in the activism of
   pobladoras (shantytown women) in Santiago in the 21st century. Based on
   in-depth interviews with pobladoras who play an undisputed leadership
   role in the current social movement for the right to housing, I show
   that memory plays a fundamental role in understanding their actions and
   the meanings they give to their struggle. Memory provides models of
   leadership, repertoires of action, and projects of social transformation
   that contribute to rooting their movement and affirming them as
   historical and political subjects.},

Abstract = {How might we engage global or transnational practitioners in talking and
   thinking about policy? This article offers a particular kind of
   practitioner, already concerned with advocacy, engagement and
   organizational development, a way of thinking about what they do and, in
   turn, what policy is and does and how it is made. It presents a
   research-based, narrative account of a policy officer visiting a country
   for the first time, as the trip - and the policy work on which the
   officer has embarked - is reconstructed in conversation with a
   professional mentor. This dialogue generates a reflexive self-awareness
   in the protagonist-practitioner, and the reporting of it prompts a
   similar reflexivity in the reader: The reader-practitioner learns
   vicariously, by watching a counterpart learn. A supplementary discussion
   engages with the very different presumed academic readership of this
   journal, reflecting on the credibility and validity of the story as a
   mode of academic writing and on its design and form as pedagogy.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2024},

Number = {2},
Pages = {1349-1374},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Do surveys measure sincere belief in Donald Trump's ``big lie{''} that
   fraud decided the 2020 election? We apply a comprehensive approach to
   detecting expressive responding: three honesty encouragements, a list
   experiment, two opportunities to express related sentiments, and two
   opportunities to bet on related predictions about the future. We find
   that nearly all respondents who endorse the big lie appear to genuinely
   believe it. These ``believers{''} are evenly split between those who
   confidently accept the big lie and those who find it plausible but are
   not deeply convinced. Similarly, those who predicted that evidence of
   fraud would enable Trump to retain power in January 2021 or be
   reinstated in August 2021 were overwhelmingly sincere. Our findings
   indicate that Trump's big lie is unique in terms of the size and
   veracity of belief differences between Democrats and Republicans. We
   discuss implications for democratic stability.},

Abstract = {Although a wide range of activities constitute legal mobilisation, a
   long-standing area of neglect in this research tradition has concerned
   the role of collective or aggregative mechanisms such as class actions,
   particularly outside the American context. This essay situates class
   actions in the legal mobilisation research tradition, drawing on
   insights from the two comparator regimes of Canada and Sweden, and
   offers a critical exploratory account of their role in facilitating
   collective legal mobilisation. The first section establishes the
   theoretical foundations for incorporating class actions into the
   tradition, exploring the main approaches to conceptualising legal
   mobilisation and identifying ways in which this incorporation expands
   and contributes to conventional approaches. The second section
   undertakes a comparative analysis with a focus on key design points and
   legal opportunity structures that promote or hinder collective legal
   mobilisation. Finally, the third section explores new and future
   trajectories of research, with a focus on benefits of comparative
   sociology of law and a critical orientation towards the promises and
   perils of collective legal mobilisation.},

Abstract = {Political participation by the former FARC-EP in Colombia remains
   challenging. Yet, despite limited acceptance of ex-rebels by Colombian
   society, ex-insurgent Guillermo Torres successfully ran for office in
   the municipality of Turbaco. We observe how he negotiated his identity
   as former rebel, revolutionary musician, and son-of-the-soil, to make
   himself a credible candidate, and to implement a progressive agenda. We
   challenge mainstream perspectives on `political reintegration' and
   localise the `rebel-to-party' debate. We suggest four elements to
   understand ex-insurgents political participation in local realms:
   identity and sense of belonging, insurgent and post-insurgent relations
   with local society, interaction with regional elites, and partisan
   competitiveness.},

Abstract = {International law is divided into functionally detached treaty regimes
   which lack clear hierarchies between them. Specific rules on how to
   prioritise among conflicting norms, e.g. between international patent
   rights under the World Trade Organisation TRIPS regime and the
   fundamental right to health under United Nations human rights law, are
   missing. Political sentiments and economic policies often tend to
   prioritise business interests, including the protection of
   pharmaceutical patents held by multinational corporations, over
   contrasting societal interests, which has direct negative impacts on the
   realisation of economic and social human rights. In this context, this
   article takes account of moral philosophical reasoning, with particular
   consideration to the needs-based hierarchy established by Alan Gewirth
   in his conceptualisation of the principle of generic consistency. The
   article shows how, when applied to the concept of human dignity, the
   needs-based hierarchy can provide guidance on adequate prioritisation
   among conflicting legal norms, suggesting the necessity of protecting
   the most fundamental human needs over less essential economic interests.},

   political elites},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {84},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Elections in many democracies have come under attack ``from within{''},
   with political elites challenging the integrity of the electoral process
   and calling its outcomes into question. Such allegations may
   delegitimize democratic outcomes and compromise citizens' confidence in
   elections. Yet aside from their rhetoric, little is known about
   political elites' electoral-integrity beliefs. This study breaks new
   ground by investigating how political elites perceive the integrity of
   elections, and which factors may account for differences in their
   electoralintegrity beliefs. Using innovative data from the 2021
   candidate survey of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES), the
   empirical analysis shows that political candidates exhibit mostly
   positive views about the integrity of the electoral procedures and the
   2021 election, while being more skeptical about the fairness of the
   campaign period. Moreover, the findings show that negative campaign
   experiences, an affiliation with a populist political party, and
   electoral defeat are important drivers of candidates' skepticism about
   the integrity of elections. These findings provide novel insights on the
   nature, background, and diagnostic significance of political elites'
   electoral-integrity beliefs in modern democracies.},

Abstract = {Why do some people resolve disputes through the state, while others use
   religious or customary justice? We address this question by conducting a
   vignette experiment in Kosovo. We design hypothetical situations in
   which fictitious characters are involved in disputes regarding
   inheritance, debt, domestic violence, and murder. We vary information
   concerning (i) vignette characters' resources, (ii) their beliefs about
   the efficiency of state justice, and (iii) dispute settlement customs in
   the characters' communities. Survey respondents assess whether a
   vignette character is likely to seek informal justice, given the
   described circumstances. We find that respondents associate informal
   justice with characters who believe that the state would resolve their
   disputes very slowly, and whose other community members would not use
   state justice. These findings generalize to respondents' own justice
   preferences and patterns of actual informal dispute settlement in Kosovo
   and beyond. Our article highlights efficiency concerns and local
   conventions as explanations of informal justice.},

Abstract = {Partisans' stated beliefs about the economy vary dramatically depending
   on the party that holds the presidency. Do these responses represent
   genuine differences in beliefs about the economy, or do they reflect
   partisans' expressive reporting on surveys? To answer this question, we
   rely on a novel dataset of Bing searches related to housing,
   automobiles, and stock market purchases by partisans from February 2016
   to July 2017. We find that in the aftermath of the 2016 election,
   Democrats, as members of the losing party, were modestly less likely to
   search for both house and car purchase terms. Republicans showed no
   change. This shift in investment behavior among Democrats suggests that
   partisans' survey responses are at least partially due to different
   beliefs about the economy, rather than just expressive reporting.},

Abstract = {This article reviews myths about English identity, using `myth' in a
   social scientific way, a truth held to be self-evident; not something
   which is patently untrue. It argues that there must be three defining
   dimensions of English `nationalism' if it is to be treated as such:
   first, whether there has been a significant increase in the proportion
   of people claiming `English' as their national identity; second, how
   `England' is treated as an `imagined community'; and third, the degree
   to which the Conservative Party is the political vehicle for English
   nationalism. These dimensions are labelled the social, the cultural and
   the political. Only if there is sustained evidence for all three aspects
   might we consider English nationalism to be a significant phenomenon.},

Title = {It takes two to toyi-toyi: one party dominance and opposition
   party failure in South Africa's 2019 national election},
Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {30},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1313-1334},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Why do dominant parties continue to win elections despite significant
   governance failures? Scholars of one party democracies tend to locate
   explanations at the macro-level: manipulation of rules, control over
   state media, or selective distribution of benefits to supporters. Other
   scholars emphasize ethnic or religious identities which trump
   consideration of policy and performance. We employ a multinomial
   regression model of voter decisions in South Africa's 2019 general
   election to explore how the ruling African National Congress managed to
   secure 58\% of the vote amidst a massive corruption scandal and waning
   public services. We find that dissatisfied government supporters do not
   ignore poor performance, but must perceive a legitimate alternative
   amongst the opposition before they switch their vote. Otherwise, they
   exit the electorate. This allows the governing party to win significant
   proportions of a diminishing electorate. Thus, decisions about whether
   to vote are not just a result of resources, mobilization or efficacy,
   but are also rooted in perceptions of governing and opposition parties.
   Thus, voter turnout and voter choice are intimately linked, rather than
   separate causal processes. Moreover, continued one-party dominance may
   be as much a function of opposition party failure as it is of government
   control over rules, rents or resources.},

   Candidates in Brazil},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the effects on violence of electing law-and-order
   candidates at the local level. It argues that law-and-order politicians
   embedded in the police will divert resources to favor their
   constituency, which in violence-prone areas could generate more murders.
   Using ballot names of council candidates in thousands of local elections
   in Brazil to accurately classify law-and-order candidates, it shows that
   the election of police law-and-order candidates causes more homicides.
   Moreover, georeferenced data on police activity and homicides show
   neglect in areas that did not support a winning police law-and-order
   candidate, despite these areas being home to the majority of individuals
   vulnerable to violence. This favoritism, however, is not present in
   places where preexisting local institutions make policing more
   transparent. Instead of persecution directed against minorities or the
   incapacity to battle criminal gangs, this research shows that surges in
   violence can be the result of typical forms of democratic
   representation.},

Abstract = {The global financial crisis resulted in a re-examination of the business
   sector as a whole and its lobbying activity. Nevertheless, research has
   not analysed the impact that the global financial crisis had on the
   coalitions within the business interest group community. This article
   describes in detail how coalitions within the business interest group
   community have emerged in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
   I focus my attention on the Swiss case because of the importance of its
   financial sector as well as its neo-corporatist system. The empirical
   approach consists of a process tracing on three policy areas: financial
   regulation, tax policy and corporate governance, which is elaborated
   through an extensive document analysis and 28 in-depth interviews. The
   advocacy coalition framework is used to analyse business interest
   groups' beliefs. The findings suggest that different beliefs
   materialise, especially in the field of financial regulation and
   partially in tax policy.},

Abstract = {The living constitution was considerably transformed in the delicate and
   lengthy transition between the First and Second Italian Republics. These
   changes have also concerned the role and functions of the president of
   the Republic. In the last three legislatures, there has been much use of
   the renowned metaphor of the accordion of presidential power, which
   expands and contracts according to the role played by the parties in the
   political system. For although the Constitution has remained unchanged,
   this period has seen two important `exceptional' responses by presidents
   to serious political crises: first, the appointment of prime ministers
   from outside of Parliament and the parties, the so-called governments of
   the president; and second, the second terms of Giorgio Napolitano in
   April 2013 and Sergio Mattarella in January 2022. But is this extreme
   expansion of the accordion really sufficient to demonstrate that we have
   stronger presidencies? An in-depth analysis of Napolitano's and
   Mattarella's responses to the critical junctures in the political system
   in fact paints a more complex picture. This article is divided into four
   parts. The first part analyses the two `longest presidencies' from the
   perspective of the presidentialisation of the political system. The
   second outlines the key critical phases of Napolitano's and Mattarella's
   periods in office, with a focus on their `governing' function, as
   permitted by the silent constitution. The third focuses on the dynamics
   of the second elections. Finally, the fourth highlights the most
   significant transformations within the silent constitution over this
   period.},

Title = {From Gender Equity to Gendered Assignments? Women and Cabinet Committees

Volume = {60},

Pages = {39-62},

Abstract = {This article explores women's access to ministerial power in an
   important but understudied arena of executive politics: cabinet
   committees. Specifically, we analyse the gendered patterns in the
   distribution of cabinet committee assignments in two `typical'
   Westminster cases, Canada and the United Kingdom, and under two prime
   ministers, Justin Trudeau (2015-2021) and David Cameron (2010-2016), who
   both made explicit gender-equity pledges. Informed by previous research
   into gendered allocation of ministerial portfolios, we investigate the
   overall extent of women's committee assignments, the gendered dimensions
   of these assignments and the status of assignments, namely the
   `prestige' of committee remits, whether committees were chaired by the
   prime minister and the allocation of chairing responsibilities across
   committees. In both cases, overall assignment broadly matched shares of
   women ministers at the cabinet level, but less so during the
   Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in the UK (2010-2015). Women's
   shares of committee assignments were likely to be lower on `masculine'
   and `high-prestige' committees compared to `neutral', `feminine' and
   `low-prestige' committees, but commitment to gender equity is more
   evident in the Canadian case. While our aim is exploratory and
   descriptive, we offer several explanations for these patterns, including
   the supply of women ministers, departmentalism, party branding and the
   low public profile of cabinet committees.},

   order-making and a new demand to centre research ethics in our work.
   Among other things, this introduction calls on scholars of civil wars to
   cultivate and maintain spaces for critical dialogue and reflection - not

   processes and politics of knowledge production - to ensure the health

Abstract = {Daniel Bensaid's Moi, la Revolution revolves around remembrances of the
   French Revolution, with the word ``remembrance{''} already resisting any
   commemorative embalming. But the book also queries the return of the
   feminine, that which is perhaps ``without limits,{''} being a return to
   permanent Revolution. Exploring such poetics, this essay shows how the
   choice to make the Revolution speak as a woman ventriloquist then
   bequeaths a political and philosophical actuality to the revolutionary
   stake. Bensaid's book highlights an ironic, worried historian who gives
   the critical function a real existence in society without taking himself
   as a spokesman for the social. Accepting discomfort, uncertainty, and
   even intellectual torment, such a historian is confronted with their own
   ethics, without the aid of a preauthorized compass, and must build
   reference points by use of the ``sensitive reason{''}: a reflexive tie
   to the sensitive experience of the world and to a position in it.},

Month = {2023 JUL 1},
Abstract = {This study seeks to correct several prominent misreadings of Judith
   Shklar's liberalism of fear in recent scholarship. By exploring and
   developing overlooked elements of Shklar's thought, I argue that the
   liberalism of fear motivates a perspective on the political world that
   can spur more clear-eyed political reflection on concrete realities in
   order to improve the plight of the weak and the powerless. I illustrate
   that this fatally compromises the interpretative line recently defended
   by critics who position themselves to Shklar's left that regards the
   liberalism of fear as a stifling form of Cold War liberalism.},

Abstract = {The main objective of the article was to evaluate the quality assurance
   system of the university's academic virtue in the context of regulatory
   security. In order to achieve the stated objective, dialectics and the
   historical method were used. In addition, the following methods were
   also used in the research process: the structural logical method, the
   method of scientific abstraction, analysis and synthesis, modeling and
   the method of abstract conclusion. According to the results of the study
   it is concluded that the approached system has a complex internal
   structure, with significant impact on the educational process.
   definitely, it is proved that an objective evaluation in the system of
   quality assurance of academic virtue of the university, in the general
   framework of legal certainty, plays an important role in the institution
   of higher education and cannot be ignored. After all, it is precisely
   such components of academic virtue as: justice, trust, respect,
   responsibility, honesty that are at the same time universal values,
   moral and ethical ideals of a highly developed society and,
   fundamentally, the key to the successful development of the state as a
   whole in the democratic system.},

Abstract = {The advent of Entrepreneurship in the global economy has made Consumers
   to worry about the state of the global environment, and as a result,
   they prefer products/services that are environmentally beneficial.
   Concomitantly, Entrepreneurial Businesses have begun to develop
   marketing tactics to cater for this rising environmental consciousness.
   In Nigeria, this consciousness is just starting. Hence, this study
   examined the impact of Green Advertising (with emphasis on Advertising
   Claim Specificity) on customer purchasing behaviour, (focusing on
   Customer Feedback) on Coca Cola products among the residents of
   Alimosho, Ajeromi-Ifelodun, and Mushin local governments in Lagos State,
   Nigeria. The study employed a descriptive survey research approach to
   collect data from a sample size of 367 respondents. The result revealed
   that green advertising has a statistically significant effect on
   consumer buying behaviour and also has significant effect on customer
   feedback (boxed times =.226; t = 4.439; p<0.05). The study concluded
   that green advertising has significant effect on customer buying
   behaviour of Coca Cola products in Lagos State, Nigeria. The study
   therefore recommended that fast moving consumer goods firms like Coca
   Cola firm should put in place adequate mechanisms to ensure that the
   feedbacks from customers are used to improve their green efforts and
   Firm's performance.},

Title = {Leopard and Conflict Between Ardo Sabga and Fon of Babanki Tungo,
   1937-1946},
Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Number = {44},
Pages = {19-35},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the nature of disagreement over the treatment of
   leopards be-tween Ardo Sabga and the Fon of Babanki Tungo between 1937
   and 1946 in the North-West Region of Cameroon. It argues that this was a
   result of differences in the cultural backgrounds of these two eminent
   personalities greatly respected by the people under their leadership.
   Ardo Sabga was a Fulani Muslim and leader of the Fulani community and
   the Fon of Babanki Tungo was the indigenous traditional ruler of Babanki
   Tungo within whose territory the Fulani had been allowed to settle. Ardo
   Sabga, a later migrant into the North West Region, found no fault in
   killing leopards. One reason for doing so was that his cultural
   background did not recognize the leopard as a sacred animal that should
   be revered. Secondly, leopards were preying on the young calves of the
   Fulani which was greatly detested by the cattle owners. In the tradition
   of Babanki Tungo, like elsewhere in the North West Region, the killing
   of a leopard was prohibited because it was associated with royalty and
   respect. The animal is accorded enormous divine characteristics. As a
   sacred animal, it is expected that everyone should treat it with
   reverence. In this paper, the qualitative method has been used to
   understand people's perceptions of the leopard as a sacred animal. Some
   statistics have also been presented to explain this phenomenon that is
   buried in the traditions and customs of different people around the
   world. The killing of leopards as sacred animals led to a clash be
   -tween Ardo Sabga, who committed the act, and the Fon of Babanki Tungo,
   who vehemently de -tested it. The British colonial administration was
   drawn into the conflict to mediate between the belligerents.},

   gathering narratives from a social leader and the researcher's personal
   history. The findings unravel pivotal moments within these accounts,
   revealing the evolution of political subjectivities associated with
   mobility, exile, resistance, and togetherness through organizational and
   community processes. These processes occur when subjective sensibilities
   are constructed in association with the significance of experiences
   relating to social segregations in terms of sexism, racism,
   territoriality, and social class. In the face of these processes,
   feelings of anger, frustration, fear, and love, which are interweavers
   of tensions associated with instituted and instituting processes
   concerning being a black woman, emerge.},

Abstract = {This study delves into racial discrimination within educational
   settings, specifically focusing on universities such as the Universidad
   Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas in Colombia. Using quali-tative
   research based on semi-structured interviews with students, professors
   and operators, this study intends to understand the discriminatory
   practices along the institution and the percep-tions of the actors
   involved. The objective is to pinpoint various forms of discrimination,
   such as the exclusion of Afro-descendant students from academic
   activities and the stereotypes regarding certain ethnic groups. The
   methodology employed facilitated an in-depth exploration of the
   participants' experiences and an understanding of the factors underlying
   racial discrimina-tion at the aforementioned university. The results of
   the research reveal that people interviewed in fact experience
   discrimination and exclusion in different spheres, such as when
   accessing education and employment, due to their physical appearance and
   skin colour. These findings support the idea that pigmentocracy
   influences the way people are treated in society, creating inequalities
   based on skin colour.},

Title = {Designing Electoral Districts for Proportional Representation Systems:
   How Electoral Geography and Partisan Politics Constrain Proportionality
   and Create Bias},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 1},
Abstract = {Proportional representation (PR) electoral systems have become
   widespread because they are expected to ensure the representation of
   interests with small or geographically inefficiently distributed voter
   bases. Yet in reality, most PR systems consist of a large number of
   districts that vary substantially in size, and some have surprisingly
   low magnitude. Existing research shows that such differences matter
   greatly for political outcomes but offers no explanation for their
   origins. We argue that the design of electoral districts in newly
   adopted PR systems is systematically linked to electoral geography and
   partisan politics. If parties with concentrated voter bases can
   influence the design of the new electoral system, they will create a
   significant number of low-magnitude districts. In general, parties
   involved in designing districts benefit from electoral
   disproportionalities under the new PR rules. Empirically, we use newly
   collected district-level data for several Western European countries in
   the early twentieth century.},

Abstract = {The production of berries has become a relevant issue over time due to
   the increasing popularity of this berry. Its use extends to more markets
   every day. The fact that its production requires specific geographical
   conditions and care restricts the supply in the international market. It
   is noteworthy that Michoacan presents the appropriate characteristics
   for planting and harvesting. Therefore, the objective of this work is to
   determine the profitability and comparative advantage of Mexican
   raspberry production in Michoacan for the year 2021 through the Policy
   Analysis Matrix (MAP). Among the main conclusions, it stands out that
   with values of 0.35 and 0.23, it can be deduced that raspberry
   production is a competitive activity with an advantage for Michoacan
   producers.},

Abstract = {In contemporary armed conflict, the spatiality of violence and the
   constellation of actors involved in it change frequently, but how these
   changes affect one another remains poorly understood. What explains the
   spatial shift of areas affected by violence in multi-actor conflicts? We
   argue that the emergence of a new dominant conflict actor facilitates a
   shift in conflict-related violence. We theorize the causal mechanism as
   `low-risk/high-opportunity attraction'. It exists in territories where
   these actors can draw on a local support base and enhance capacities to
   engage in violence. To demonstrate our theory's validity, we conduct two
   plausibility probes: on the conflict in Colombia paired with the
   conflict in the Lake Chad region, and on the conflict in the
   Afghan-Pakistani borderlands paired with the conflict in Iraq/Syria. We
   adopt a mixed-methods approach integrating visualizations, spatial
   analysis, network analysis and process tracing, drawing, inter alia, on
   interviews from remote regions of war-torn Colombia and Iraq.},

Abstract = {Relevance is a key concept in the study of political parties. This
   article argues that the conceptions of relevance used in the study of
   political oppositions in authoritarian settings need to be clarified and
   reformulated. More specifically, and in light of current knowledge on
   electoral authoritarianism, the notion of relevance must go beyond the
   electoralist conceptions traditionally used when studying democratic
   contexts. Drawing on the case of Morocco, the article highlights the
   obscuring effect that such conceptions can have. It then provides an
   alternative framework, adjusting the concept of relevance to the
   specificities of the context and the evolving nature of the actors
   operating within it. The case of al-Nahj al-Dimoqrati, a Moroccan
   radical-leftist opposition party, is used to illustrate the analytical
   power of the framework.},

Abstract = {Did the demographic composition of American school boards influence a
   given school district's reopening responses and social safety measures
   to the COVID-19 pandemic? We explore how factors of race and gender of
   school board members influences how districts implement remote,
   in-person, or hybridized schooling measures. Using an original data set
   of 1893 school districts and 11,186 school board members, we test
   whether the demographic composition of a school board is predictive of
   school reopening plans and masking policies. We find that race and
   partisanship are influential in determining the usage of remote
   instruction and safety measures. Importantly, the congruence between
   local- and state-level partisanship is also found to be influential in
   determining the intensity of safety measures. We find that the influence
   of identity characteristics of school board members is less critical to
   shaping decision-making processes than the partisanship of a state's
   governor. In Democratic states, the governor's executive orders tend to
   override the influence school board members' racial and gender
   identities, versus in Republican states the school board's demographic
   composition is more predictive of school reopening plans and masking
   policies.},

Abstract = {This article draws attention to the ``Gorkha{''} as a constructed
   identity, given or adopted by Nepali-speaking community. The idea of
   ``Gorkha{''} in general and the demand for the territory of
   ``Gorkhaland{''} of India have remained an elitist project, and the
   employment of this idea/term ``Gorkha{''} has been a political
   instrumentalization that failed to bring any form of development. The
   period of 1980s gave rise to the ``Gorkhaland{''} movement in India for
   its subjugation and alienation, which sparked questioning about the
   identity of the Gorkha in Indian politics. The question arises: Why
   Nepali people are mobilized as ``Gorkha{''} in its history? How is the
   ``Gorkhaland{''} movement in India a developmental problem in contrast
   to ethnic politics? This paper is divided into two parts, such as (1)
   ``Gorkha{''} and its origin in general and (2) Indian ``Gorkha{''} and
   the ``Gorkhaland{''} demand. The process of such movement led by elites
   brings both domestic and international attentions due to cross border
   and regional politics. This paper uses a thematic approach in analyzing
   the leader's role in relation to the last Shah King, a recruitment
   policy of colonial British raj, and legitimization process by the
   ``Gorkha{''} leaders in the ``Gorkhaland{''} Movement.},

Abstract = {In Canada, there is renewed attention to the violence experienced by
   Indigenous peoples in residential schools, by police, through
   hyper-imprisonment and child removal, in hospitals, and in the
   contemporary education system. All of these issues are interlinked and
   outcomes of the carceral state-defined as the policing, monitoring,
   surveillance, criminalization and imprisonment of people, especially
   Indigenous and other racialized peoples. In this article, I define and
   illustrate what the carceral state looks like in Canada. I articulate
   the current approach to studying the carceral in political science, note
   the paucity of research in the Canadian context and show where attention
   has been cast previously. I describe an improved approach to studying
   the carceral, arguing that a decolonized approach to studying the
   carceral must be relational and abolitionist, seeking to reduce and
   eliminate the use of carceral interventions.},

Abstract = {The imperative to conduct research ethically has been firmly
   established. Biomedical and applied research in the Global North has
   dominated the development of an ethical framework based on four broad
   principles: respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and
   justice. The prevailing research ethics can become significant
   constraints to political scientists focussing on non-democratic
   settings. The appropriateness of these codes in guiding political
   scientists' research, especially in authoritarian contexts of Central
   Asia, is examined. The article outlines the need for a more culturally
   and contextually nuanced approach to research ethics and an
   understanding of the discipline-specific ethical dilemmas for
   researchers within political science.},

Abstract = {This article analyses Statutory Instruments passed between 2010 and 2019
   to evaluate the embeddedness of the UK Government's regulatory
   off-setting and business impact target initiatives. It begins by
   outlining the origins of those initiatives and their scope, technical
   details and compliance mechanisms. After describing the methodology for
   the analysis, it reports results, showing that a range of exclusions and
   exemptions limit the number of Statutory Instruments covered by the
   initiatives, that the intensity with which burden reduction is pursued
   declines over time and that the largest savings are incidental rather
   than being motivated by a desire to reduce burden.},

   conflict},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-93},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article asks: how do art practice and research give form to
   changing dynamics of conflict? Its argument is two-fold: art's
   contribution can be developed from empirical considerations (what art
   finds out), and from methodological ones (how art finds something out).
   Bringing in art practice and the research methods it informs into
   political science helps understand conflict and its changes: by engaging
   simultaneously with the interaction between the collective and the
   personal, art practice and research elucidates those complex and layered
   narratives used by various actors in conflict that often resist
   approaches rooted in social and political sciences. By paying attention
   to everyday interactions and emphasizing dynamism, art provides a
   different way to chart changes in armed conflict. Art documents
   discourses that are difficult to communicate otherwise and allows us to
   detect and engage with the grey areas, transformations, processes and
   ambivalences of conflicts that escape neat categorizations.},

   permaculture, les modalites de sa diffusion transnationale et sa
   presence actuelle en Italie et dans d'autres pays du sud de l'Europe,
   l'article propose une analyse de l'evolution du mouvement sous l'angle
   du poids croissant en son sein des formes d'appropriation individualisee
   mais egalement de << prefiguration ouverte >>. La prefiguration suppose
   l'inscription de la vision du changement social d'un mouvement non
   seulement dans ses objectifs declares mais egalement dans ses pratiques.
   Alors que la << prefiguration fermee >> preconise la creation de
   communautes avec une identite forte et partagee et une frontiere
   nettement delimitee separant l'interieur de l'exterieur, la <<
   prefiguration ouverte >> favorise les << collaborations >> entre les
   activistes de la permaculture et d'autres mouvements et groupes sociaux.
   Dans les conclusions, l'article revient sur les risques associes a la <<
   fluidite >> de la permaculture comme methode de prefiguration
   ecologique, mais egalement sur la contribution de ce mouvement aux
   luttes pour la justice environnementale et climatique et a la
   transformation culturelle necessaire a l'emergence d'une societe civile

Abstract = {No statue raised in a public place should stand there indefinitely. Any
   such monument should have a set date when it is due to be replaced. I
   make three arguments to support this principle of non-permanence for
   public commemorative art. First, the opportunity cost of permanent
   statues is too high. States have a duty, grounded in their need for
   legitimacy, to support and cultivate democratic values. Public art is a
   powerful tool that is being drastically underemployed because existing
   statues are already taking up so many prominent sites. Second,
   permanence undermines stability by unnecessarily raising the stakes of
   change and so exacerbating predictable tensions between social groups
   who ought to be able to respect one another as honourable civic
   partners. My proposal reduces the significance of replacing a monument
   by making removals a commonplace event. Third, we ought to do away with
   permanent statues as a means of increasing democratic control for both
   current and future generations over public spaces. Each generation
   inherits a more cluttered civic landscape which makes it progressively
   more difficult to shape it in accordance with their needs, preferences,
   and cultural vocabulary. Taken together, these arguments tip the balance
   of reasons decisively against the status quo.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to establish the basis of Obama's mandate as
   the first e-president in history, a concept that in itself implies a
   high degree of novelty. To do so, we first describe the political
   communication of the American administrations of the 20th century and
   the beginning of the 21st century until 2008. A theoretical framework
   directly related to political communication and the concepts of
   e-democracy, information and communication technologies, cyberdemocracy,
   e-administration, etc. is provided. It then establishes and analyzes the
   disruptive elements of Obama's mandate as an agent of change from before
   his presidential term, as a candidate, during his term, and then as an
   ex-president since his Foundation. This is an article based on
   consultation of books, journals, academic articles and currently
   available presidential websites. The results establish a leadership
   principle that far surpasses social networks.},

Abstract = {``The world will never be the same again{''} - so the saying goes in
   Europe and elsewhere. And as we, in early April 2022, see the horrible
   pictures from Ukraine, it is hard to think otherwise, knowing well that
   things may become even worse if the war spreads and weapons of mass
   destruction are used. European countries have traditionally differed in
   their contacts with and their attitudes to Russia. As for the Nordic
   region, the geographical closeness to their powerful neighbor has made
   people sensitive to Russia's policy and its implications for Nordic
   security. This closeness is undoubtedly among the reasons for the
   considerable changes that took place in 2014 following the annexation of
   Crimea and the aggression against Donetsk and Luhansk. Not only did the
   Russian activities affect the Nordic countries' views on Russia, but
   also their cooperation with each other. The issue now is which impact
   the aggression of 24 February 2022 will have on these countries.},

Abstract = {A partisan divide over LGBT rights has emerged in the U.S. Yet unlike
   other issues on which the parties have traded places or polarized, most
   of the change on gay rights has occurred within one party, the
   Democrats. How did this unusual change occur? LGBT rights was originally
   a fringe cause, rejected by most politicians in both parties. As gay
   rights activists slowly became more prominent in the Democratic Party,
   many politicians adapted, abandoning earlier positions informed by their
   personal backgrounds and state or district constituencies. Meanwhile,
   incorporating the religious right led most Republicans to maintain the
   anti-LGBT rights stand that was once common to both parties, even as
   public opinion shifted. The result was a partisan divide in this issue
   area that had consequences for policy. The role of adaptation by
   incumbents in producing it-contrary to some prominent models-is evident
   in both Congressional co-sponsorship and roll-call data. The growing
   party divide is also evident in platforms. These findings contribute to
   a broader understanding of how party position change occurs.},

Abstract = {The popularity of `the witch' in the Italian feminist imagery was
   spurred by the publication of two influential works at the peak of the
   1970s feminist wave: the Italian translation of Witches, Midwives, \&
   Nurses: A History of Women Healers by Ehrenreich and Englisch (1975) and
   La signora del gioco. La caccia alle streghe interpretata dalle sue
   vittime by Muraro (1976). In such works, the history of witches and
   witch-hunt was retrieved and read in light of central issues to the
   1970s demonstrations, such as practices of control over female bodies,
   the marginalization of women from science and power, the suspect towards
   women's community practices of mutual aid, with witches affirming as a
   landmark symbolic figure still invoked by contemporary transfeminist
   movements. In this article, I will retrieve the figure of the witch as
   absorbed in the feminist political imagery in the belief that Muraro's
   operation of retelling the history of witch-hunt from the perspective of
   the accused in order to give them back their voices through an ``extreme
   narration{''} (2006) can be a useful contribution to the international
   philosophical debate that has been developing in recent years on
   epistemic injustice (Fricker 2007) and on possible restorative (Walker
   2010; Song 2021; Page 2021) or transformative (Palomba 2023) processes
   to react to such injustice, and thus inspire contemporary practices of
   reparation/transformation that involve not only the institutions that
   specifically promoted the injustices committed, but the communities that
   are historically and symbolically connected to such violence1.},

Abstract = {What are the opportunities and challenges of faculty-undergraduate
   collaborative scholarship that involves student participation at every
   stage of the research process? Drawing on interviews with comparative
   politics faculty members and undergraduate students, this article
   discusses the themes of reciprocity, incentives, and ``off-ramps.{''}
   First, we find that an unequal division of labor can give way to a more
   reciprocal work dynamic as long-term projects unfold. Second, we
   consider the use of incremental incentives to sustain student
   motivation. Third, we propose the creation of off-ramps to allow an
   undergraduate to gracefully exit a project early. Grounded in these
   themes, we argue that-with a few guardrails-faculty members and

Abstract = {Civil society has re-entered the standard social sciences vocabulary,
   and important contributions have been made in recent years to advance
   the historical understanding and conceptual development of this sphere
   analytically located between the state and the market. Such
   contributions have been mostly within a political science perspective
   that examines civil society in the context of a particular country or
   region or in reference to the emerging field of non-profit studies. What
   has been missing is a broader perspective within a comparative
   institutional framework that places the capacity of civil society for
   self-organisation and self-correction relative to the capacity of the
   state to control and regulate. Frequently, these two capacities are in
   conflict with each other, and exploring their relationship may suggest
   new answers to the question of what makes civil society develop and be
   sustainable in the long run.},

Title = {Toxic friend? The impact of the Russian invasion on democratic
   backsliding and PRR cooperation in Europe},
Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {46},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1178-1204},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {Following the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the
   `democratic backslider' parties in Hungary (Fidesz) and Poland (Law and
   Justice) took differing stances on Russia, bringing their positions on
   the Rule of Law (RoL) conflict and within the broader alliance of
   Populist Radical Right (PRR) parties into question. Building on and
   advancing the theoretical framework of democratic backsliding and PRR
   party cooperation, this article assesses the impact of exogenous shocks
   triggered by external authoritarian actors on these types of
   collaborations. A detailed examination of the voting patterns of Fidesz,
   Law and Justice and other PRR parties in the European Parliament (EP) is
   undertaken, and their stances towards Russia and the RoL conflict before
   and after the invasion are weighed. The findings show that the invasion
   did not influence the dynamics of democratic backsliding. Despite the
   rhetoric, it actually brought Fidesz and Law and Justice closer
   together. While the attack led to a convergence of assertiveness towards
   Russia among the PRR parties, the Putin regime remains a divisive issue
   within the PRR family. The different positions towards Russia did not
   affect the support of PRRs for the backsliders.},

Abstract = {We know little about how coalitional strategy affects the electoral
   fates of political parties in presidential democracy. The literature on
   coalitions in parliamentary systems shows a negative impact of entering
   government, while the coattail effects literature on presidential
   systems suggests some benefits. Combining elements from both approaches,
   we argue that there is a conditional electoral effect of joining the
   cabinet under coalitional presidentialism. Even considering
   presidentialism's heightened attribution of responsibility to a
   unipersonal executive, we find that coalition parties do indeed place a
   meaningful electoral wager whenever they choose to enter the president's
   cabinet as identifiable allies. Leveraging data on Brazilian elections
   held at national and local levels over 24 years and employing an
   innovative measure of portfolio salience, we show that the payoff of
   this wager is contingent on control of the most highly-valued cabinet
   positions and on the popular approval of the president.},

Abstract = {The vote to leave the European Union in 2016 and the political crisis
   that followed offer obvious subjects for the political historian. Yet,
   the study of Brexit raises serious challenges for academic writing,
   concerning method, the political preferences of the historian and the
   implication of history as a discipline in the European debate. This
   article explores some of the dilemmas and opportunities confronting the
   historian of Brexit, focussing, in particular, on the challenges to be
   addressed, the utility of conventional political methods and the
   insights that might be drawn from allied fields. It argues for a greater
   emphasis on the imaginative resources on which the different campaigns
   could draw, urging greater attention to conventional wisdoms, languages
   of class, collective memory and the forging of cultural or
   exceptionalist identities.},

Abstract = {Influential voices contend that democracy is in decline worldwide and
   threatened in the US. Using a variety of measures, I show that-while
   there has been some recent backsliding-the global proportion of
   democracies remains close to an all-time high. The current rate of
   deterioration is not historically unusual and is well explained by the
   lower income and unseasoned institutions of many new democracies swept
   upwards in the Third Wave. Historical data suggest the probability of
   democratic breakdown in the US is extremely low. Western governments are
   seen as threatened by weakening popular support for democracy and an
   erosion of elite norms. But systematic evidence for these claims is very
   limited. While eroding democratic quality in some countries is indeed a
   cause for concern, the fear of a global slide into autocracy appears
   premature.},

Abstract = {It is being increasingly recognized that a post-truth phenomenon has
   arrived where lies and deception inform politics and everyday life as a
   normal state of affairs in (advanced) capitalist societies. In the
   post-truth world, feelings are more accurate than facts, and lies are
   constantly told for the purpose of the political subordination of
   reality. The post-truth condition is deeply skeptical of objective truth
   and experts/scientists. This article discusses the various traits of the
   post-truth phenomenon, explains its connection to post-modernist
   idealist philosophy, and its association with Far Right politics. It
   also explains the post-truth phenomenon in terms of the crisis-ridden
   bourgeois political economy and bourgeois politics, including the
   contradictions of imperialism. It argues that the post-truth phenomenon
   is only partly because of Far Right politics and that its ultimate cause
   lies in the capitalist system as a whole. This article concludes by
   pointing out what is to be done to counter the post-truth condition.},

Abstract = {Prior research has shown that public participation initiatives may have
   positive effects on how participating citizens view government. However,
   little is known about whether and how priming citizens to think about
   such initiatives influences the view of government among the larger
   public. Using a survey experiment, we find that the effect of priming
   citizens to think of a public participation initiative that includes a
   small group of citizens on their view of government is conditional on
   how proximate the service, which the initiative resolves around, is to
   citizens. Notably, across outcome measures we a find a negative priming
   effect among those for which the service is not proximate. These results
   are highly important, as they suggest that among the larger public,
   public participation initiatives-that involve few citizens-may have
   mixed results on the view of government, thus questioning the legitimacy
   of decisions reached by such initiatives.},

Abstract = {We study the extent to which personal connections among legislators
   influence abstentions in the US Congress. Our analysis is conducted by
   observing representatives' abstentions for the universe of roll call
   votes held on bills in the 109th-113th Congresses. Our results show that
   a legislator's propensity to abstain increases when the majority of his
   or her alumni connections abstains, even after controlling for other
   well-known predictors of abstention choices and a large set of fixed
   effects. We further reveal that a legislator is more prone to abstain
   than to take sides when the demands from personal connections conflict
   with those of the legislator's party.},

Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 1},
Abstract = {This essay argues that delimiting the settler colonial analytic to
   colonial legacies in the ``Anglo-world{''} risks disavowing its
   congruent relationship with other colonial ideologies such as those of
   the Spanish imperial world. In examining Alexis de Tocqueville's
   comparisons of Anglo- and Spanish American colonization alongside Latin
   American writers like Lorenzo de Zavala and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento,
   it shows how they occupied a common discursive terrain in grappling with
   the prospects for democracy in the new world. For Tocqueville, the
   failure of Spanish American democracy compared to the United States
   stems from the different systems of land colonization at work in each
   context. Sarmiento and Zavala provide different accounts of American
   colonization that exhibit both intersections with and departures from
   Tocqueville. Bringing these writers together shows how settler colonial
   ideologies and imaginaries in the Americas circulated in a shared
   hemispheric space and reciprocally shaped one another in contingent
   ways.},

Abstract = {The large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into the territory of
   Ukraine has significantly destabilized the processes of functioning of
   representative authorities in Ukraine and, moreover, has led to
   destructive changes due to the annexation of the country's territories.
   The article aims to study the theoretical and applied foundations of
   peculiarities of functioning of representative institutions in Ukraine,
   during the war. The methodological basis of the study consists of
   general and special scientific methods of cognition and economic and
   legal analysis, in particular: systems analysis, synthesis, abstraction,
   comparison, analogy, statistical analysis, functional analysis,
   clustering, cluster analysis (based on the k-means method), correlation
   and regression analysis, graphical, tabular, generalization and
   systematization. The results of the theoretical studies carried out
   allow us to establish a significant impact on the destabilizing factors
   of the external and internal environment, the most important of which
   are the military factors. In conclusion, significant imbalances have
   been revealed in the process of ensuring the implementation of the
   principles of democracy in the activities of representative
   institutions.},

Abstract = {The research exposed problems related to socio-economic,political and
   social factors that directly or indirectly affect thesecurity of the
   population on the European continent and theworld. The analysis of
   cause-and-effect relations of the large-scalemilitary invasion of the
   Russian Federation allows developingalgorithms for implementing
   democratic processes for Ukraineand for the countries of the European
   Union EU, and the wholecivilized world. The main scientific-research
   works devoted to the formationof democratic societies were also
   analyzed, defining the specificities andmain features and strategic
   vectors of development. The population'sperception of democracy, human
   rights and civil liberties in variousEuropean nations was evaluated by
   using a sociological survey. As a resultof the research conducted, a
   model for the formation of democratic valuesas a basis for the
   establishment of a democratic society was developed. Itis concluded
   that, it is desirable to develop further recommendations onpractical
   measures to protect freedom and democracy as the basis of
   valueorientations in the fight against military aggression and, the
   formation ofthe foundations of the future security architecture in the
   world},

Title = {Bureaucratic Revolving Doors and Interest Group Participation in Policy
   Making},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 1},
Abstract = {There is growing concern about the movement of individuals from private
   sectors to bureaucracies, yet it is unclear how bureaucratic revolving
   doors affect connected firms' political participation. We argue that
   when connected individuals enter government, connected firms reduce
   their proactive forms of participation because their connected
   bureaucrats possess firm-specific technical and legal knowledge to help
   them achieve their policy objectives. We test our intuition by
   constructing a novel data set on career trajectories of bureaucrats in
   the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) and firms that are
   connected to USTR's revolving-door bureaucrats. Empirical results show
   that firms with connections to USTR bureaucrats decrease their lobbying
   spending and participation on advisory committees under the USTR. The
   decrease in political participation is stronger when connected
   bureaucrats are more influential in policy production. Our findings
   suggest that decreases in interest groups' political activities might
   not imply that their influence on policy making is diminished.},

Abstract = {The state responded to the issue of violence against women by
   establishing an independent state agency, namely National Commission on
   Violence against Women. However, National Commission on Violence against
   Women faced numerous obstacles in its handling of cases, particularly
   regarding gender-based violence online, which had become the most
   discussed topic, and the largest case was revenge porn type in
   Indonesia. The purpose of this study was to analyze the authority of
   National Commission on Violence against Women in handling victims of
   revenge porn in Indonesia from 2020-2021. This study utilized theories
   of authority, state auxiliary organs, government administration, and
   revenge porn. The method used in this study was qualitative with a
   descriptive qualitative approach because the researcher wanted to
   describe the phenomenon found regarding National Commission on Violence
   against Women handling of the surge in revenge porn cases. Data
   collection techniques included observation, interviews, documentation,
   and a literature review conducted at National Commission on Violence
   against Women. The results of this study, viewed from the theory of
   authority, could be reviewed in terms of regulation, management, and
   supervision, it indicating that National Commission on Violence against
   Women had implemented its mandate in accordance with applicable
   Presidential Decrees. However, the process still faced many challenges,
   such as regulations, budget allocation, and access. National Commission
   on Violence against Women implemented various programs to address these
   challenges, including annual reports, publication and documentation,
   learning forums, monitoring, campaigns, and advocacy, and these programs
   were carried out by enhancing cooperation among government institutions,
   NGOs, and the public.},

Abstract = {Hindu-Muslim conflict and riots in India are enduring intergroup
   conflicts in south Asia, destabilizing the region for a long time.
   Despite having federal democracy and secular nationalism in the
   political system of India, the state and its various technology of power
   take sides with religious groups abetting the persecution of minority
   Muslims as religious or ethnic groups. Among the various ethnic groups
   and communities living in India, Muslims are among the most deprived
   communities in contemporary times. In the issue of minority conflict, a
   permanent solution in the federal system of government has become a
   dream. This paper analyses India's divergent political systems and state
   ideology and its failure and success in respective cases to counter
   communal and ethnic violence. We argue that, rather than focusing on the
   weakness of the existing political systems of India, the common failure
   to adequate power sharing can better explain these conflicts and
   successive persecution of minority Muslims.},

Abstract = {Using the scientific method, the main objective of the study was to
   identify key legal norms and aspects of anti-corruption policy in order
   to form the legal and professional competence of students of higher
   education institutions. One of the most pressing issues is corruption in
   public authorities and administration, which to a greater or lesser
   extent affects almost the entire system of public administration. A
   small number of criminal cases of bribery indicates a high level of
   latency of these crimes. The spread of this negative phenomenon is
   facilitated by the imperfection of legislation, in particular, economic
   legislation. A large number of laws, departmental instructions, orders,
   etc., which often contradict each other and thus create significant
   difficulties for the officials themselves and deprive them of any
   opportunity to understand the legislation regulating the matter. It is
   concluded that, many laws contain ambiguous language in the text, which
   allows officials to interpret their content in their favor.},

Abstract = {In public health crisis governance, effective communication has been
   shown to move people from awareness to compliance. This article examines
   the effectiveness of the communication strategy developed by
   stakeholders in the European multi-level governance during the COVID-19
   pandemic. An original dataset of over 40,000 tweets from 65 actors in
   Switzerland, France, the UK, the EU and the UN is used to measure the
   timeliness, consistency and connectivity of tweets about mobility
   restrictions in the first phase of the pandemic. Analysis shows that the
   discourse surrounding mobility restrictions gradually becomes more
   politicised after an initial phase of high consistency and connectivity
   among actors. Additionally, low inter-level connectivity suggests a lack
   of coordination across governance levels, despite a strong consistency
   in the message. The study concludes that this pattern of communication
   could worsen the rising infodemic issue.},

Abstract = {This case study reviews a social movement course that centered on a
   10-week simulation of a contemporary contentious event in Washington,
   DC, involving six movement organizations and four police agencies. To
   our knowledge, it is the first classroom simulation of a Trump-era
   police-protester contentious episode or of any political science
   simulation that places an episode of insurrection in the contemporary
   United States. Three goals animated this project: (1) promote learning
   concerning extra-institutional political conflict in the American case;
   (2) combine scholarship and role playing to explore the dynamic
   interaction of movement, countermovement, and enforcement organizations;
   and (3) teach the complex relationship between social science theory and
   political practice in an engaging way. Students used theoretical
   frameworks drawn from the literature to assess and develop protest
   capacity and repertoires for their assigned organization and chose
   strategic goals and tactical means to attempt to generate political
   leverage. Student organizations made concurrent ``moves{''} and
   instructors iteratively developed the contentious episode. This article
   discusses the results of students' evaluations of the simulation. In
   addition to extensive online appendices, it provides a detailed
   explanation and design for instructors who are considering a similar
   approach.},

Abstract = {Families are not only the first institution ever created, they are also,
   for most people, the first institution ever encountered. The
   preindustrial family structure, which was a function of local ecology
   and cooperation needs, instilled family members with different values,
   such as trust in strangers and respect for elders. These values passed
   through generations and, as we show in three studies, impact today's
   political attitudes and policies. First, using surveys of
   second-generation immigrants representing roughly 180 ethnicities living
   in 32 European countries, we show that the tighter kinship structure of
   a person's ancestors predicts right-wing cultural attitudes. Among those
   who are less engaged in politics, tighter ancestral kinship structure
   also predicts left-wing economic attitudes. In a second study, we
   control for country-level differences by comparing ethnic groups within
   countries and find that ancestral kinship strength predicts right-wing
   cultural attitudes but not left-wing economic attitudes. Finally, in a
   third study, we examine the policy implications of ancestral kinship. We
   show that stronger country-level ancestral kinship strength also
   increases anti-LGBT policies and welfare spending. Finally, we examine
   whether value systems link preindustrial kinship with modern political
   attitudes. In total, this work indicates that our political beliefs are
   rooted in the value systems and familial institutions created by our
   forebears.},

Abstract = {Given the sensitive nature of cybersecurity in authoritarian regimes,
   the existence of semi-autonomous patriotic hackers raises questions
   about their function because no security-adjacent actor can survive
   without at least tacit regime approval. Reflecting the attention that
   the phenomenon has received from scholars of defence and cybersecurity,
   the hackers' presence has to date been viewed as a pragmatic strategy
   that either compensates for autocrats' own lack of technological
   capacity, or that deflects blowback from high-stakes cyber operations.
   But less is known about how the hackers' presence relates to
   authoritarian stabilization and survival agendas. This prompts this
   article to ask: How does the devolution of cybersecurity functions to
   patriotic hackers influence regime stabilization and survival agendas?
   Observing patriotic hacking in Syria through work on authoritarian
   devolution, space and cybersecurity, the article argues that while there
   is much precedent for authoritarian power devolution, digital devolution
   has novel mechanisms and effects. This is because the internet enables
   regimes to consciously and instrumentally manipulate the process,
   thereby creating a sense of constantly shifting space between themselves
   and the hackers that facilitates new opportunities for authoritarian
   stabilization and survival.},

Abstract = {Early warning systems purport to help decision makers act more
   effectively. But what does it take to develop, deliver and use warnings
   or predictions for rare and uncertain events in data-poor and rapidly
   changing environments? What key lessons can be learned from teams who
   have confronted these challenges over the last 10 years? The paper
   answers these questions using in-depth analysis of the experiences of
   teams developing and applying early warning systems (EWS) for coups,
   organised violence, mass atrocities, and child soldier recruitment. The
   purpose of this paper is to improve understanding of the development and
   use of conflict-related EWS.},

Abstract = {Supreme Court oral arguments are often characterized as the Court
   rapidly firing questions at attorneys who struggle to keep up; however,
   nearly half of the Court's utterances come not as questions but as
   statements. I ask whether patterns of questioning and commenting
   behavior during oral arguments can predict case outcomes and justice
   votes. To answer this question, I develop a theory of strategic
   communication that accounts for the differential ways justices-and other
   strategic actors-use queries and comments during arguments. Using
   transcripts from 1981 to 2019, I code for use of questions and
   statements, finding the two theoretically and empirically distinct:
   where questions increase a party's chances of winning, statements
   increase their chance of losing.},

Abstract = {The current study followed the need for more research concerning the
   understanding of the relationship between simulation design and
   self-efficacy in negotiating development within role-play simulations of
   political decision-making. More specifically, the purpose of this study
   was to investigate the relationship of social persuasion as a source for
   self-efficacy in negotiating with simulation design elements. The
   research was conducted in a three-day simulation about the EU
   decision-making process. By means of daily diaries and semi-structured
   interviews, critical incidents about the emergence of social persuasion
   influencing self-efficacy development were defined. Data were analysed
   by applying thematic content analysis. Findings show that social
   persuasion was largely facilitated by the simulation design that offered
   possibilities for informal contact.},

Abstract = {The expansion of NATO in the Arctic has been greeted with enthusiasm by
   its Arctic member-states. However, states are not the only actors in the
   Arctic, and there is the real risk of opposition to NATO's ambitions in
   the Arctic from Indigenous peoples living there. The success of NATO's
   strategy in the Arctic will depend on its abilities to strike
   collaborations with Indigenous peoples. The way to do that is to
   indigenize NATO. Indigenous knowledge ought to be identified as a
   significant resource which NATO needs in order to be able to operate in
   the Arctic, and especially Indigenous capacities for resilience can
   contribute much to NATO's strategy in the region.},

Abstract = {This article charts the trajectory of Putin's economic policy. All
   countries face the challenge of preserving national interests and
   identity while reaping the benefits of global economic integration.
   These pressures are particularly acute in the case of Russia, given its
   historical legacy as a global superpower. From the outset, Putin's
   pragmatic embrace of global integration and market incentives was in
   tension with his authoritarian centralization of power at home and
   hostility towards the West abroad. Up until 2008, Putin was able to keep
   these two conflicting worldviews, and rival policy teams, in balance.
   But after 2012, geopolitical confrontation won out over economic
   development, culminating in the reckless invasion of Ukraine in February
   2022.},

Abstract = {Prior studies have documented incumbency advantage for electoral
   candidates. A largely unrelated strand of literature has shown that
   perceived competence of candidates, as inferred from their physical
   appearance, also predicts their electoral success. We draw upon the
   framework of statistical discrimination and the dual-system theory of
   human cognition to understand the relationship between a political
   candidate's vote share, physical appearance, and incumbency status.
   Voters possess relatively richer information about incumbents compared
   to challengers. Perceived competence of candidates, as inferred from
   their physical appearance, is therefore expected to have a relatively
   weaker influence on voters' decisions to vote for incumbents. Data from
   Australian state elections support this prediction.},

Journal = {CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Previous literatures have indicated a positive link between social media
   and social protest. However, there has been no clear elaboration on how
   social media influence the result of environmental protest. In this
   article, by analyzing 20 cases of environmental protest in China using
   fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), we aim to explore
   which combinations of diverse conditions drive citizens to successfully
   protest China's environmental project in the age of social media. The
   findings indicated that the internet policy, mobilization pattern and
   visibility can be a key condition of successful protest in social media.
   This combination of high visibility, resonance and legitimacy levels can
   facilitate favorable outcomes. The tripartite relations drive successful
   protest to China's environmental project in the social media age among
   political opportunities, mobilization structure, as well as framing
   process that social media created. Three contextualized paths can be
   summarized to explain how social media influence the result of
   environmental protest in China. These findings increase our
   understanding of protest outcomes in China and further enrich the
   literature about the relationship between social media and protest
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the puzzle of how what could have been initially
   regarded as a decline in populist support became compatible with
   widespread conspiracy beliefs during the Covid crisis. Analyzing survey
   data collected in 16 countries in June-July 2021, we explore how support
   for Covid conspiracies is embedded in the attitudinal map of individuals
   and offer three contributions to the literature on conspiracy beliefs
   and populism. First, we employ an original scale for measuring
   conspiracy beliefs benchmarked both on a general conspiratorial mindset
   item and on a non-conspiratorial item. Second, building on the
   multidimensionality of the concept of populism and its empirical
   distinction to neighboring anti-technocratic attitudes, we employ a new
   scale developed and tested by Bertsou and Caramani (2022) that allows us
   to highlight the differential role that these attitudes play into
   conspiracy beliefs. Third, we inquire into the role played by previous
   factors associated with populist attitudes, such as trust and ideology,
   but also understudied ones such as performance evaluations and
   (dis)satisfaction with the management of the crisis at the domestic and
   at the EU level. Our results show that conspiracy, populist, and
   anti-technocratic attitudes are highly prevalent and related to each
   other, despite an initial ``rally `` effect in the beginning of the
   pandemic. Furthermore, government and EU performance in the crisis
   matter, net of trust and ideology, playing a moderating role in the
   populism-conspiracy nexus.},

Title = {The deepening of the Pacific Alliance's commercial agenda: The role of
   policy networks in regulatory governance},
Journal = {LATIN AMERICAN POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-108},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {From a complementary perspective to intergovernmental approaches, this
   article emphasizes the seldom explored role of policy networks in
   regional regulatory governance to explain the factors that have enhanced
   or limited the deepening of the Pacific Alliance's trade agenda 10 years
   after its launch. Within a context of a proliferation of trade
   agreements in Latin America, but with limited knowledge about their
   regulation since there are no developed countries in the agreement, it
   is argued that the horizontal dynamics of interaction established by
   trans-governmental and transnational networks, as well as the greater
   articulation among them, have facilitated the deepening of a mutual
   working scheme. By contrast, the vertical interaction dynamics
   associated with a North-South economic pattern between Mexico and the
   other members of the bloc have placed limits on the model of deep
   integration designed by the group. This article is based on a multiple
   case study that uses process tracing to consider a process observed from
   the Global South, considering its particularities and overcoming
   state-centric visions. Desde una perspectiva complementaria a los
   enfoques intergubernamentales, este trabajo enfatiza el poco explorado
   papel de las redes politicas en la gobernanza regulatoria regional para
   explicar los factores que han potenciado o limitado la profundizacion de
   la agenda comercial de la Alianza del Pacifico a diez anos de su
   lanzamiento. En un contexto de proliferacion de acuerdos comerciales en
   America Latina, pero de limitado conocimiento sobre su regulacion en
   ausencia de paises desarrollados, se argumenta que las dinamicas
   horizontales de interaccion establecidas por las redes
   transgubernamentales y transnacionales, asi como la mayor articulacion
   entre estas, han facilitado la profundizacion de un esquema de trabajo
   propio. En cambio, las dinamicas verticales de interaccion asociadas a
   un patron economico Norte-Sur entre Mexico y los demas miembros del
   bloque han puesto limites al modelo de integracion profunda disenado por
   el grupo. Este articulo se basa en un estudio de casos multiples que
   utiliza el rastreo de procesos para abordar un proceso que es observado
   desde el Sur Global, atendiendo sus particularidades y superando
   visiones estado-centricas.},

Title = {Depression and the gender gap in political interest},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {82},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {It is well-documented that women report less interest in politics than
   men on average. We argue that depression-and the differential strategies
   used to cope with its symptoms-contribute to this persistent gender gap
   in political interest. While women tend to rely on rumination when
   experiencing depression, there is less agreement on men's coping
   strategies. Depressive symptoms should thus more greatly reduce
   political interest among women than among men. We analyze data from the
   European Social Survey and the German GESIS Panel Study. We find some
   evidence that depressive symptoms, even those that are sub-clinical and
   short-lived, reduce political interest among women, but have little or
   no effect on the political interest of men. These findings have
   implications for political and gender equality, especially with the
   rising prevalence of depression around the world, and contribute to our
   understanding of the impact of depression on political engagement.},

Abstract = {Citizens' perceptions of the alt-right are not well explored in
   political science. We view the alt-right as a successor of the Tea Party
   movement. While the Tea Party described itself as organized around
   spending, the size of government, and the American Constitution,
   examinations of the movement found that the unifying concerns of people
   who identified with it or viewed it favorably were negative feelings
   about racial minorities and patriarchal views of gender roles. Using
   panel survey data, we show that whites with higher levels of hostile
   sexism, racial resentment, perceptions of discrimination against whites,
   and who were more favorable towards Donald Trump evaluated the alt-right
   movement more positively. We find no evidence that self-placed ideology
   informed these evaluations. On the whole, latent cultural conservatism
   appears to inform evaluations of the relatively unknown - at the time -
   alt-right movement.},

Abstract = {This article examines the use of social media during the 2021 Mexican
   legislative election. Political candidates were contacted through the
   email addresses they had listed and sent a questionnaire to fill out.
   Thus, the research is based on original data directly collected from
   political candidates. Political candidates commented on their use of
   social media during the election campaign. The research used closed
   questions. The assumption was that political candidates would use social
   media if they felt that the benefits outweighed the costs associated
   with managing social media accounts. The utility of social media can
   also lie in the opportunity to gain new votes. The results show that
   political candidates used social media more if they perceived that it
   was being used in their constituency. If few voters in a constituency
   use social media, then the potential utility of using social media
   declines. Furthermore, they used them more if they perceived that from
   an economic point of view, managing an account and sending a message
   were not that costly.},

Title = {Can foreign aid improve the donor country's image among a third-party

Abstract = {This study explores whether and under what conditions foreign aid can
   help improve the donor country's image in countries that did not receive
   aid. We identified a world heritage site restoration project, which is
   visible, localized, has no political strings attached, and deals with
   global public good, as a most-likely type of foreign aid that can
   generate this positive effect. In light of the literature suggesting
   that tensions with the target country undermine public diplomacy
   effectiveness, we expect the positive effect will be more pronounced in
   non-recipient countries with which the donor country has a more amicable
   relationship. To empirically investigate our argument, we field a survey
   experiment in a developed non-aid-recipient country, Australia. We
   provide information to the Australian public about an aid project to
   restore the Angkor Monument in Cambodia conducted either by China or
   South Korea. We find that information on Korea's aid to Cambodia
   improves the image of Korea and the willingness to cooperate with the
   Korean government among Australians. No such effect, however, is
   observed in the case of similar aid by China whose relations with
   Australia have been strained in multiple domains. Our findings have
   policy implications for donor countries seeking to utilize the soft
   power element of foreign aid as a public diplomacy tool.},

Abstract = {With international election observation subject to increasing criticism,
   this article evaluates how effectively domestic observers can play the
   role of impartial arbiters relative to their international counterparts.
   It reviews academic arguments about the strengths and weaknesses of
   domestic and international observers, with a focus on 1) their
   methodologies, resources, and reporting practices; and 2) their
   credibility. It presents a case study of Zambia's 2021 elections,
   detailing the major observation missions and their activities. It then
   compares the media coverage and popular perceptions of domestic and
   international observers, showing that many Zambian citizens still have
   reservations about the partiality of domestic election observation
   initiatives. The article concludes by theorizing the conditions in which
   domestic election observation can 1) provide impartial evaluations of
   election conduct; and 2) be perceived as trustworthy sources of these
   evaluations.},

Abstract = {The persecution of certain minorities due to their place of origin or

   of discrimination, the European Union has backed a series of mechanisms
   that enable all member states to have a common framework based on the
   approval of the Union's Bill of Rights. It is also worth highlighting
   the challenges faced by European institutions in relation to these acts
   and to the ease of their spread via internet, particularly on social
   media, where fast and easy communication facilitates the dissemination
   of such messages and allows people to find groups of individuals who
   share this ideology, contrary to Human Rights, and who can create
   networks that endanger the Rule of Law, which is one of the basic
   principles underpinning the European Union.},

Abstract = {Are the sociological profiles of radical right-wing populist parties'
   (RRPPs) representatives really unlike those of their counterparts in
   mainstream parties? Once RRPPs occupy positions of legislative power for
   an extended period, do their MPs' profiles increasingly converge with
   those of more mainstream parties? This paper examines three right-wing
   parties in Austria, Italy, and Switzerland (FPo, LEGA, and SVP), and
   shows how RRPPs' MPs persistently contrast the ``diploma democracy{''},
   that is the increasingly dominant high-educated trend in political
   representation. Inspired by the current scholarship's diachronic and
   comparative perspectives of political elites and MPs, the analysis
   focuses trends since the 1980s.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the state-of-art literature in the field of
   citizenship studies based on relational approaches. It does so by
   differentiating between field relationalism (FR) and process
   relationalism (PR) and comparing, in this context, the framing of
   citizenship by three leading relationalist scholars in the field: Engin
   Isin, Margaret Somers and Gurminder Bhambra. In doing so, we focus first
   on the ways in which they envisage overcoming the analytical dualisms
   responsible for social exclusion and the hierarchies related to
   citizenship, and second on their normative assumptions concerning the
   emancipation of society. We demonstrate that the differences between the
   two metatheoretical assumptions have important implications for
   understanding each author's research objects and methodology, as well as
   the normative assumptions present in their study of citizenship.},

Abstract = {At their yearly summit, the bloc of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South
   Africa (BRICS) countries issues an annual intergovernmental declaration.
   While these declarations are scrutinised for challenges they allegedly
   represent for global affairs, how they self-construct a positive
   representation about their global purpose is little studied. Notably,
   there is insufficient examination of the political deliberations behind
   the statements among the five different countries. By conducting a
   thematic content analysis based on coding content of the first ten
   intergovernmental declarations from 2009 to 2018, it is found that BRICS
   countries speak positively of their cooperative role to solve world
   problems without mentioning any internal disagreement. In parallel, they
   present Western institutions negatively in their communication strategy.
   An absence of deliberations does not imply an apolitical discourse. On
   the contrary, it can be a deliberate political communication strategy
   especially among the five different countries aiming to showcase
   alignment about their purpose in world politics.},

Abstract = {This article explores the effectiveness of political parties in relation
   to political finance and intra-party democracy in Pakistan. The aim of
   the article is to offer an objective understanding of these variables
   and suggest a model for the effectiveness of political parties. Primary
   data was collected from a sample of 1000 respondents from eight
   different but politically relevant parties. The respondents have diverse
   socio-political backgrounds and positions in parties hailing from all
   the provinces of Pakistan and Azad Jammu \& Kashmir - a semi-autonomous
   territory under the administration of Pakistan. The instrument was
   developed and its validity and reliability were ensured. For empirical
   verification, extensive statistical tests were carried out, including
   validity and reliability analysis, standard regression and correlation,
   to test the assumptions of the research. Statistical analysis
   established that the independent variables are very significant in
   explaining the relationship with the dependent variable. Overall, most
   of the political parties are not internally democratic as they do not
   follow laid-down democratic processes in electing leadership and
   candidate selection, the findings revealed. Political parties are
   monopolized by personalities with weak organization and are
   institutionally fragile and compromise on their ideological foundation
   by preferring political expediency while decision making. Likewise,
   parties also rank poor in political finance as they rarely follow legal
   and administrative requirements laid down by the Election Commission of
   Pakistan on political finance. This has a direct bearing upon party
   effectiveness, as poor intraparty and weak political finance hinder
   party development as effective institutions aiming to aggregate the
   interests of the masses. The parties must ensure inclusiveness in choice
   making, build formal democratic decision-making structures and reinforce
   the key procedures for political financing. Moreover, political parties
   should be transparent and responsive towards democratic values and
   institutional practices to increase their effectiveness.},

Abstract = {For more than a decade, the importance of urban social movements has
   been systematically increasing in the Polish public sphere. However,
   available theories of social movements cannot account for the variety of
   forms of urban mobilization or for the ideological differences between
   organizations. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the relevance of
   Pierre Bourdieu's theory of social class for research on urban
   movements. Using the concepts of ``capital `` and ``habitus, `` the
   paper explores the social vision and process of the emergence of two
   activist organizations in Warsaw, Poland. The study is based on
   qualitative research conducted from 2016 to 2019, which included an
   analysis of secondary resources and individual in-depth interviews with
   members from each organization. Bourdieu's theory of social class
   facilitates consideration of different aspects of the functioning of
   urban social movements, including the role of resources and competences,
   ideological divisions, and chances of success. The theory also provides
   an explanation for the importance of class within urban social
   movements. The article shows that, even though the demands of social
   movements appear to be values-led, in fact, they are based on the class
   interests of their members.},

Abstract = {We analyze the effects of veto institutions in a dynamic model where
   control of the legislative and executive branches fluctuates between two
   parties. In our setting, there are universal projects (benefiting both
   parties) and partisan projects (benefiting one party at the expense of
   the other). When government is divided, the legislature can leverage the
   universal project to achieve a lopsided and dynamically inefficient
   distribution of partisan projects under the absolute veto. While the
   line-item veto eliminates this type of hostage-taking, it also prevents
   beneficial logrolls. A novel institution, the alternating line-item
   veto, can both eliminate hostage-taking and preserve beneficial
   interparty logrolls. No veto institution prevents dynamically
   inefficient, lopsided outcomes under unified government; this can only
   be done through norms, and we show that a no-veto regime, or a regime
   with a line-item veto, best facilitates such a cooperative norm.},

   space, as confirmed by the invasion of Ukraine. In the present article,
   the author shows why modern Russia represents a geopolitical project
   called ``Putin's Empire,{''} and what the ideological justifications for
   this empire are. The author also proposes to consider what is happening
   as a clash of different forms of imperial orders-neoliberal democracy
   and the concept of the ``Russian world.{''} The author concludes that
   Russia, as an empire, is in a protracted political crisis, but this does
   not mean the empire will disintegrate.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether individuals can accurately predict trust and
   trustworthiness in others based on their appearance. Using photos and
   decisions from previous experimental trust games, subjects were asked to
   view the photos and guess the levels of trust and trustworthiness of the
   individuals depicted. The results show that subjects had little ability
   to accurately guess the trust and trustworthiness behavior of others.
   There is significant heterogeneity in the accuracy of guesses, and
   errors in guesses are systematically related to the observable
   characteristics of the photos. Subjects' guesses appear to be influenced
   by stereotypes based on the features seen in the photos, such as gender,
   skin color, or attractiveness. These findings suggest that individuals'
   beliefs that they can infer trust and trustworthiness from appearance
   are unfounded, and that efforts to reduce the impact of stereotypes on
   inferred trustworthiness may improve the efficiency of trust-based
   interactions.},

Abstract = {Until its success at the election of 2013, the Five-star Movement had
   not paid a great deal of attention to foreign policy. In 2017, in
   preparation for the election the following year, the Movement's MPs
   began collating what they considered the most relevant policy proposals
   in order to draft a new electoral programme. Using the Movement's web
   platform, Rousseau, the M5s asked registered members to choose the three
   most important issues of foreign policy from a list of ten. The aim of
   this article is to see how the Movement defined its foreign policy. This
   analysis helps us to understand the EU turn that has characterized the
   foreign-policy agenda of the Movement in recent years. Having embraced
   the possibility of Italy's exit from the Eurozone in 2013, the Movement
   today appears to be in favour of strengthening the European
   institutions.},

Abstract = {The Kilosa area of Tanzania has been affected by conflicts between
   pastoralists and farmers, leading to interferences in daily economic
   activities in the district. To resolve this growing issue, a study was
   conducted to establish the underlying causes of conflict and provide
   alternative and sustainable solutions for resolving disputes in the
   area. The study employed qualitative methods to investigate the
   conflicts between farmers and pastoralists. The saturation method was
   used to draw a sample size of 115 respondents from five villages which
   were purposively sampled. In-depth interviews and focus groups were
   conducted with farmers, pastoralists, and governmental officials to
   gather complete accounts of the causes and effects of these conflicts.
   Also, a detailed literature review was undertaken to provide theoretical
   support from previous studies. Multi-stakeholder analysis was emphasised
   to ensure a complete understanding of the conflict dynamics from
   multiple perspectives. The study revealed the interrelated factors,
   which include resource competition, climate change, inadequate land
   tenure systems, weak governance structures, and poor resource management
   policies, that intensify conflicts between farmers and pastoralists.
   Therefore, the proposed conflict resolution mechanism includes proper
   land use plans, diversification of their economies, peace-building
   committees, embracing good governance, and frequency of police patrol in
   conflict-prone areas.},

Journal = {STATE CRIME},

Abstract = {Cultural appropriation or exploitation in settler colonial studies
   occurs when a settler group adopts the cultural practices of the
   Indigenous group. Appropriation often compounds the marginalization and
   silencing of the Indigenous group, and therefore overlaps with, and
   facilitates, the settler colonial tactic of cultural domination. The
   latter seeks to eliminate the Indigenous group by way of forced
   assimilation into the dominant settler culture. In this article, I focus
   on the purpose and intended effect of the parallel pursuit of cultural
   exploitation and cultural domination. I argue that the side-by-side
   enactment of such settler colonial strategies amounts to cultural
   robbery: the settler state ensures exclusive use or possession of
   Indigenous cultural practices, markers and heritage. It adopts the
   latter as its own whilst simultaneously prohibiting-through the carceral
   system-the use and practice of the culture by the Indigenous community.
   Using the case of Moroccan-occupied Western Sahara, I focus on the
   evolution of Morocco's settler colonial strategies in the cultural realm
   from its 1975 invasion of Western Sahara until today. I argue that
   Morocco's policy of cultural domination over the Indigenous Saharawi
   population, initially enacted alongside other settler colonial genocidal
   policies, has made way for cultural appropriation alongside domination.
   This is, I argue, part of a wider Moroccan regime effort to mobilize
   ``multiculturalism{''} to quell political opposition.},

Abstract = {Based on a series of expeditions to the northern area of the Irkutsk
   region, the article examines the process of the formation of a special
   kind of quasi-political actors, denoted in the text by the term ``taiga
   baronet{''}. These actors emerge under the conditions when, as a result
   of the ``optimization{''} of the structures responsible for collecting
   information about social space, the latter, from the point of view of
   authorities, becomes ``empty{''}. Along with the array of interpretable
   markers of the filled space, a number of operators capable of
   interpreting them decreases and at the end disappears. As a result, the
   government turns out to be blind, physically deprived of the ability to
   perform managerial functions. At the same time, having become invisible
   to the eye of the authorities, this space retains itself as an
   administratively and politically structured territory, in which
   representatives of local authorities are forced to carry out the
   activities prescribed to them and legally assigned to them. Due to the
   ``blindness{''} of the authorities, this activity inevitably turns into
   an imitation. The problem, however, is that the space that the
   authorities perceive as ``empty{''} still have residents, for whom this
   space remains both social and ``filled,{''} and who continue to expect
   from government institutions that they provide a certain amount of
   public goods. Thus, a conflict arises, manifested in complaints, appeals
   to law enforcement agencies and higher authorities, which poses a threat
   to the favorable picture drawn in the reports. It is the need to somehow
   neutralize this threat that gives rise to the need for an agent who is
   not bound by the restrictions associated with the authorities' view and
   is able to focus on the ``here and now{''} situation, without universal
   standards. This agent not only assumes a number of functions of the
   local government, but also acts as a universal mediator between the
   ``empty{''} and ``filled{''} space, between the local community and the
   state structure.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to highlighting the issue of the use of special
   knowledge in the way of conducting an examination during the
   investigation of crimes committed with the use of violence. The study
   illustrates that the proposition that the expert's participation in the
   evidence in criminal proceedings is based on the laws and categories of
   dialectics and formal logic and, moreover, is carried out by combining
   practical and intellectual activity. Also, the main and atypical types
   of examinations are distinguished: forensic medical; forensic
   psychiatric; forensic psychological; forensic biological; ballistics;
   cold weapons examination; trans- and dactyloscopic. Depending on the
   investigative situation at the time of the forensic examination and the
   available evidence, a list of issues to be resolved by the expert is
   indicated, such as: forensic chemistry during the investigation of
   violent crimes; forensic and orological; soil science; molecular and
   other genetic examinations, depending on the type of crime, the
   situation under investigation and the physical objects available. It was
   concluded that the theoretical and methodological foundations of such
   examinations need to be updated and adapted to the latest technology and
   the best state-of-theart world experience.},

Abstract = {The 2020 regularisation for irregular migrant workers in Italy relied
   extensively on civil society actors' (CSAs) involvement to provide
   information, legal support and handle the bureaucratic procedures of the
   programme. Based on qualitative research carried out with CSAs, migrants
   and employers involved in the programme, the article describes the
   heterogeneity of the CSAs involved as well as the different
   politicisation routes they followed. We show that, through a series of
   activities - information provision, preparing and sending applications,
   institutional lobbying and case advocacy, civil disobedience and protest
   - CSAs have attempted to repoliticise the amnesty through four different
   avenues: solidarity, debordering, empowering and contention.},

Abstract = {The super -accelerated (high-speed) life experiences and coercive
   practices of the new world order (Covid and post-Covid periods) have
   affected and changed the negotiation and conflict resolution skills of
   international actors. Today, with the pandemic and technological
   developments, acceleration has become a necessity in many fields. Many
   international mediators, especially the United Nations (UN), have also
   benefited greatly from digital technologies that pierce space and time
   during the most severe times of the Covid-19 pandemic. So, in today's
   world, where economic, social and technological development continues at
   high speed, should negotiations and policies keep pace? If so, how
   should accelerated and virtualised political practices be discussed over
   conflict resolution? What is the impact of digitalisation on
   international mediation? This article critically discusses the
   relationship between digitalisation, speed, politics and conflict
   resolution through content and discourse analysis of political reports
   on peacemaking practices of different UN missions, especially during the
   most traumatic period of the pandemic (March 2020 -March 2021). The
   study concludes that politics and negotiations need speed barriers
   because they need time, but they cannot be isolated from the
   developments and space of the high-speed society, so they need to follow
   the virtual space at all times and get involved when needed. As the
   analyses of the missions' reports show, the effective use of digital
   technologies, especially during the pandemic, has led to a rapid
   transformation in mediation (from traditional to cyber-mediation) and
   conflict resolution activities have been able to continue uninterrupted,
   but the dangers of digitalisation have not disappeared},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2023},
Number = {144},
Pages = {99-123},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the role of social, economic, and environmental
   inertia in the industrial renewal resulting from the contemporary
   ``energy transition{''}. To do so, it draws on a comparison of two case
   studies: the reopening of a copper mine in Andalusia and the massive
   installation of wind turbines in northern France. A localized analysis
   of industrial trajectories in these two regions shows, on the one hand,
   how zones of sacrifice propitious to industrial renewal are constructed
   over the long term, in which the production of new environmental
   degradations takes its place among the past damage. On the second hand,
   the article describes how the extraction of new mining or renewable
   resources is spatialized differently in these territories dedicated to
   industry. Finally, it shows the centrality of work in the acceptance or
   rejection of these new industrial activities of ``transition{''}.},

Abstract = {This article examines policy change in the EU's financial assistance
   regime through a collective learning perspective. By defin-ing a
   financial assistance regime as the set of rules governing the
   disbursement and withdrawal of funding to the mem-ber states in the
   context of crisis management, the article seeks to address the following
   research question: How can we explain the exact form of change in the
   EU's financial assistance regime between the euro crisis and the
   Covid-19 pandemic? The article finds that financial assistance in the EU
   moved from ``intergovernmental coordination{''} with the European
   Stability Mechanism to a form of ``limited supranational delegation{''}
   with the Recovery and Resilience Facility and argues that such a change
   is due to a collective policy-learning process. This finding suggests
   that the EU tends to learn from past crisis experiences, freeing itself
   from established institutional constraints, only when the next crisis
   becomes a concrete cause for concern. However, when the next crisis
   strikes, the EU is indeed able to radically alter its practices based on
   previous policy failures.},

Abstract = {Virtual land refers to implicit land resources displaced between
   countries in the trade of agricultural products. Virtual land flows can
   be measured using trade volume and country and year -specific yield data
   of products. This study aims to measure and reveal the long-term changes
   in virtual land flows in Turkiye's crop trade from 1986 to 2020. The
   results show that Turkiye's net virtual land imports in crop trade had
   increased from approximately -670 thousand hectares in 1986 to 7 million
   hectares in 2020. Turkey's annual average net virtual land import is 1.8

Abstract = {Assessing political efficacy is considered one of the most challenging
   topics in the social and political sciences. While traditional measures
   of political efficacy include a common number of indicators ranging from
   analyzing the economic state of countries and their military
   capabilities to examining soft power indicators, this article proposes
   to consider rhetoric as an alternative measure of political efficacy.
   Drawing on evidence from linguistic and cognitive sciences, the author
   argues that rhetoric also plays a significant role in achieving
   political goals. To prove this hypothesis, the article analyzes T.
   Docherty's recent work << Political English: Language and the Decay of
   Politics{''} for fresh ideas about the influence of rhetoric on
   political efficacy. In addition, the author mentions the principles of
   rhetoric, which have already become fundamental, as well as the tools of
   language influence on political efficacy. By emphasizing the importance
   of rhetoric as an indicator of political efficacy, this article
   contributes to a deeper understanding of the cognitive and communicative
   aspects of political influence.},

Abstract = {Regime complexes entail a variety of institutions with a degree of
   overlap in terms of thematic issues and participating actors. The EU is
   such an actor engaging with other governmental and non-governmental
   entities in the formation and evolution of regime complexes. In this
   article, we examine the role of the EU in the international transport
   regime com-plex, and more specifically in two of its core international
   organizations, namely ICAO and IMO. Our actor-based approach focuses on
   how the EU navigates between these two constitutive components of the
   global transport regime complex, advancing climate change mitigation
   measures. Our empirical material shows how the EU's active engagement in
   ICAO con-tributed to the organization's shift vis-a-vis the role of the
   aviation industry in greenhouse gas emissions. Besides the EU learning
   process that occurred and led to a more engaging and less conflictual EU
   approach in IMO, the ICAO achievement increased pressure and created a
   more conducive environment for the respective recognition of the
   maritime industry's share in climate deterioration. In this respect, the
   EU benefited from the structure of the transport regime complex to
   pursue its own preferences.},

Abstract = {Reflections on the impact of the application of Fundamental Rights over
   the organization , action of public authorities. Take as an example the
   right to information whose constitutional formula-tion is very recent
   and which is not the most studied or best understood of those contained
   in the system of Title I of the Spanish Constitution. And yet, the new
   rules of transparency can be very effective if they are linked to the
   right to information as the foundation of all advanced democracy. But
   the fact that the Spanish Con-stitution has recognized, along with such
   a fundamental right, the constitutional right of access to documents ,
   administrative files has generated great controversy by wanting to
   recognize both without due distinction in their respective structure and
   functionality. Some clarification is attempted here on the basis of the
   political and democratic significance of the right to information, of
   which transparency would be one more technique to make it a reality in
   the administrative sphere but without exhausting it. The vicarious right
   can be nourished by the fundamentality of the right to be informed as
   long as the legislator regulates it in this sense, at least in some
   cases. But until now I believe that the doctrine and the legislation are
   opting for a more organic approach than a dogmatic one, thus
   contravening the principles with which this work begins and sliding the
   problem towards its administrativeization.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to analyze some of the silences that
   have occurred around the development of political science, which have to
   do with the gender variable, and how these silences have been turning
   into voices that are transforming academic work, in teach-ing and
   research. The starting point is that political science was born as a
   discipline con-ceived by and for men, with a markedly androcentric and
   universalist character that meant that, for decades, women were absent,
   both in terms of its content and the possibility of developing knowledge
   about it. Through documentary work, focused on Latin America and, more
   specifically, on Mexico, some of the changes brought about by the
   inclusion of women in a double dimension are outlined, as subjects
   (subjects) and as part of the contents of politi-cal science. For this,
   the way in which they were occupying spaces traditionally assigned to
   men is analyzed, to subsequently take stock of what it meant to study
   women and include the gender category, forcing us to rethink basic
   categories of the discipline, such as those of power and the centrality
   of the state.},

Abstract = {Elections to representative bodies are the basic tool for exercising
   power in democratic countries and the most recognizable external sign of
   democracy. Much ink has already been spilled about the institute of
   local elections and many scientific contributions have been written,
   which also applies to Slovenian local elections. In the analysis of the
   previous eight local elections, which have been held since 1994, the
   conclusion that local elections are somewhat underestimated and
   neglected compared to parliamentary elections is emphasized, as
   political parties have had lot less success at the local levels of
   authority. At the same time, it remains relatively unnoticed that local
   elections have a similar role and meaning to parliamentary elections,
   except that they are held on a significantly smaller territory, in
   significantly smaller communities and have a different substantive sign.
   However, local elections represent the most important influence of the
   inhabitants of the local community on the operation of the local
   self-government, therefore they represent the fundamental element of
   local democracy. In this article, we analyse the essential
   characteristics of the eight local elections in independent Slovenia so
   far, with an emphasis on the most recent elections, which took place in
   late November 2022.},

Abstract = {The Visegrcid countries have similar administrative systems, therefore
   the major characteristics of their development policies are similar, but
   several differences can be observed. These similarities and differences
   are analysed by this paper. Poland has a regionalized system and a
   partially merged 1st tier municipal model. Therefore, local development
   has a significant role. Hungarian, Czech and Slovakian local development
   policies are limited by the fragmented spatial and municipal systems,
   however the Slovakian regions have a strong development characteristic.
   Centralization tendencies can be observed but their intensities are
   different. The Hungarian model is significantly impacted by the strong
   centralization of the last ten years. Similar structures evolved among
   the local development policies of the 1st tier municipalities: the
   detailed development policies can be observed among the larger, mainly
   urban municipalities, the local development policies of the smaller,
   rural municipalities are based on the personal cooperation and
   neighbourhood activities. The COVID-19 pandemic influenced the local
   development policies, their focus has been transformed partially, but
   the structure of the local policies did not change significantly, the
   differentiated structure remained untouched.},

Title = {ART OF GOVERNMENTALITY IN CONSTRUCTION OF RUSSIAN WOMAN'S NATIONAL
   IDENTITY},
Journal = {SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {122-134},
Abstract = {Russia's heteronormative policies have been receiving substantial
   attention mainly from Western scholars, who condemn the gendered-based
   regularization of identities in Russian cultural politics. I investigate
   the potential of these policies in legitimizing domestic power, creating
   a counter-hegemony, and the potential of geopolitical influence
   confronting Western global hegemony. The paper addresses the discursive
   construction of auto-governing subjects to illuminate the way national
   identity is fashioned by the art of governmentality. Methodologically it
   is mapped on the Foucauldian reading of Gramsci, assuming that the art
   of governmentality can be a way to win the consent of subjects to ensure
   hegemony. To examine governmentality, I demonstrate how the liberty of
   women is controlled in a rational as well as an affective milieu. The
   article demonstrates that Russian dominant discourses, such as
   commercials, depict viable female identity in line with traditional
   gender norms. However, social promotion and idealization of the female
   body are new aspects of a Russian woman in contrast to the USSR
   discourse of sexual silencing. Women in a rational milieu calculate and
   decide to choose the viable, rather than marginalized nonheteronormative
   female identity. In the affective milieu, women's identity construction
   is controlled by the affections produced by various discourses, such as
   media. Self-governing subjects consent to traditional female identity,
   which gives them subjectivity while legitimizing the state power.
   Depiction of corrupted western moralities in opposition to Russian
   ethics elicits a sense of threat versus promise, alien versus us. These
   affections secure against non-heteronormative female identity. It is
   concluded that delineating the borders between morally deviant West and
   ethical Russia has the potential of creating a geopolitical hegemony of
   Russia as the global savior.},

Abstract = {Milan Kundera's novels combine a sense of the fragile and tragic with a
   robust affirmation of life. They are full of ambivalence and
   contradictions. Deadly seriousness alternates with irony. Aesthetic
   purpose is paired with lightness. Aphorisms that stand next to
   philosophical excursions against kitsch, against idyll, nostalgia,
   forgetting. Kundera was always accompanied by accusations of being an
   erotomaniac who saw only the male perspective. This is not wrong, but in
   totalitarian times, he was above all concerned with a counterforce to
   the impositions of crude collectivism. Born in the Czech city of Brno
   and living in exile since 1975, Kundera died in Paris in July 2023.},

Title = {DECONTESTATION OF THE CONCEPTS OF SOVEREIGNTY AND STRATEGIC SOVEREIGNTY

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2023},

Pages = {23-36},
Abstract = {The article focuses on the concept of strategic sovereignty that has
   proliferated in the EU's official discourse over the last few years. The
   EU has turned to sovereignty relatively recently; the very identity of
   the Union previously developed in direct opposition with this national
   phenomenon. In contrast, sovereignty is the key attribute of state and
   society in the Russian official discourse; its significance has grown in
   connection with the recent Ukrainian crisis. The author of the article
   compares the semantic content of sovereignty in the EU's and Russian
   official discourses using the methodology based on the morphological
   analysis of ideology by M. Freeden with the special focus on
   decontestation and adjacent concepts. Official discourse in the EU and
   Russia, including speeches of top politicians and key foreign policy
   documents, provide an empirical basis for this analysis. The author
   shows that the EU and Russian concepts have little in common. For the
   European Union, strategic sovereignty is the ability to make independent
   decisions, primarily in the economic, digital and security spheres, in
   order to deal with challenges above the national level. In the Russian
   semantic system, it is described as the most important social object
   associated primarily with state security, which must be protected from
   threats and interference. Despite some semantic intersections, the two
   concepts differ both in terms of paradigm, and in terms of specific
   semantic content.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the problem of memory functioning as a
   symbolic resource for adaptation to a crisis as a situation of high
   uncertainty. The author analyzes public practices of articulating memory
   about the early period of the post-Soviet transformation when discussing
   social and economic problems associated with the special military
   operation in Ukraine, that was declared by president Vladimir Putin on
   24 February, 2022, and subsequent unprecedented extension of
   international sanctions. The study is based on Iwona Irwin-Zarecka's
   theory of frames of remembrance. By revealing typical ways of framing
   the experience of the 1990s in media discourse during the first six
   months after 24 February, 2022, the author attempts to identify how this
   experience was tied to the current problems and thus determine the role
   of memory as a resource for adaptation to the new crisis. The analysis
   is based on publications in printed and online media that target
   different audiences. In order to reveal ways of framing statements about
   the 1990s, the author utilized the method of qualitative content
   analysis using the MAXQDA application The results of the study confirm
   that in a situation of uncertainty caused by the forced restructuring of
   economic relations, social expectations and political goal-setting, the
   memory of a collective traumatic experience acts as an adaptation
   resource, which is associated with a partial transformation of its
   semantic framework. At the same time, the ideological splits tied to the
   memory of the 1990s persist and continue to determine the structure of
   the public discourse about the past.},

Abstract = {The subject of this essay is the reconstruction of some formal aspects
   of the relationship be-tween memory and oblivion. The reference context
   is that of the interpretation of the sociological theory of collective
   memory into cultural memory. The essay is also concerned with outlining
   a further shift from cultural to political theory through reference to
   counterfactual memory. The thesis it expresses, however, is that with
   respect to the political hypertrophy of memory, which operates as a
   guarantee of the identity of collective subjectivities, the critical
   work of historiography must always be guaranteed, which allows equal
   access to arguments based on evidences.},

Abstract = {In her early essays, A Room of One's Own (1929) and Three Guineas
   (1938), Virginia Woolf uses the figure of Mussolini (at first associated
   with Napoleon and then with Hitler) as an example to demonstrate the
   complicity between fascism and patriarchy, insofar as they have despised
   women and reduced them to their procreative role. Two questions arise:
   what was the reception of Woolf's essays in Europe?; and to what extent
   and in what form does Mussolini appear in 1930s European literature,
   especially among early feminist writers?
   The Argentine writer Victoria Ocampo met Mussolini after reading Woolf's
   first essay and before meeting her in 1934. As French translator of The
   Waves Marguerite Yourcenar met Woolf in 1937, whereas she already wrote
   a dreamlike narrative about a failed attempt on Mussolini's life (A Coin
   in Nine Hands, 1934). Although not connected to the other women writers
   mentioned above, the Polish writer Zofia Nalkowska made occasional
   references to Mussolini in her diary between 1928 and 1939, like Woolf
   herself did, even if the latter soon focused on Hitler.
   In a word, this study aims at reconstructing the networks of sociability
   or at least a common sensibility that may have contributed to
   understanding fascism as a feminist issue.},

Abstract = {Statecraft, under democratic principles in Tanzania in partic-ular, is
   often considered as a total heritage from former colonial masters.
   Ju-lius Kambarage Nyerere (1922-1999) disputed this by advancing an
   African theory of democracy, articulated to inform modern statecraft in
   Tanzania. His theory advances a form of democracy characterized by a
   merger of some prac-tices from the African past and others from the
   western world. In this way, he articulated the centrality of democracy
   in organizing public affairs without compromising its African origin but
   also acknowledging the influence of other democratic cultures in the
   modern organization of a polity. This article articu-lates Nyerere's
   contribution to African democratic discourse and the extent to which his
   theory of democracy is relevant in the organization of contemporary
   politics and democratic trajectories in Tanzania and Africa in
   particular.},

Abstract = {For decades, Russian political science developed in an atmosphere
   dominated by the American schools of political science, and from now on,
   it will have to ascend independently through the generalization of
   empirical material accumulated by other social sciences, including
   sociology. Some sections of sociology are traditionally not in the focus
   of attention of political scientists, as it seems that they cover areas
   far from politics. Such areas included the sociology of health care. But
   during periods of political crises, politics invades seemingly distant
   spheres. Vlad Kravtsov, the author of the monograph Autocracy and Health
   Governance in Russia published in 2022 by Palgrave Macmillan, skillfully
   integrates his work into the conceptual design of his American
   colleagues who set themselves the goal of proving the inconsistency of
   Russian statehood in its current form. In his book, Kravtsov pays
   special attention to the issues of combating and preventing the HIV
   epidemic/AIDS, he considers periods when efforts were made to counter
   the epidemic, but which during its spread claimed the lives more than 40
   million people, according to the UNAIDS. Kravtsov argues that the
   Russian healthcare, with its conservative orientation on traditions and
   ``ignoring international approaches{''}, cannot cope with the
   catastrophic scale of the HIV epidemic/AIDS. Noting sometimes the real
   shortcomings of the Russian management system, V. Kravtsov does not
   think about how to eliminate them, but suggests a complete dismantling
   of the system, which is an undoubted reason to carefully consider the
   political aspects and implications of the problem.},

Abstract = {The article sheds light on memory politics in Mongolia. It focuses on
   the memorial complex dedicated to G.K. Zhukov, which includes a museum,
   a monument and a street. The research design is tailored to identify the
   ways of using history for political purposes. The study draws on three
   groups of empirical sources, that are the author's personal
   observations, the publications in Mongolian and Russian media as well as
   public statements made by the heads of states. The paper analyses how
   the political status of the memorial has evolved since the 20 th
   century, by emphasizing different cultural and political meanings
   attached to the exposition and the facade of the museum. The article
   also considers commemoration practices associated with the memorial
   complex. The study concludes that the inclusion of the museum in the
   sphere of public commemoration at the head -of -state level is linked to

Abstract = {How does the 2020-2022 civil war in Ethiopia contribute to our
   understanding of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine? This
   study seeks to revisit the debate over the effectiveness of the R2P
   doctrine in the wake of increased intrastate conflicts. The objective is
   to assess the dilemma that arises with the implementation of R2P when
   governments are involved in the conflict and the international community
   is reluctant or unable to intervene. The study adopts the systematic
   review approach (PRISMA) to identify the shortcomings, trends, and
   debates around R2P. It uses the Ethiopian civil war to contribute
   further to the existing body of literature. The paper finds that,
   indeed, the R2P doctrine is facing serious challenges with its
   implementation. It shows that when governments fail to acknowledge the
   other actors as legitimate combatants and instead describe them as
   terrorist groups, it becomes difficult to uphold the R2P doctrine. The
   paper also identifies a lack of leadership and coordinated efforts at
   regional and international levels as contributing factors, which further
   undermine the effectiveness of R2P. The paper concludes that the
   Ethiopian civil war exposes serious shortcomings in the R2P doctrine
   that need to be reviewed and reformed urgently. It proposes the adoption
   of a systems-thinking approach that can streamline the actors and
   processes of response during civil wars.},

Abstract = {``Banning the Box{''} refers to a policy campaign aimed at prohibiting
   employers from soliciting applicant information that could be used to
   statistically discriminate against categories of applicants (in
   particular, those with criminal records). In this article, we examine
   how the concealing or revealing of informative features about an
   applicant's identity affects hiring both directly and, in equilibrium,
   by possibly changing applicants' incentives to invest in human capital.
   We show that there exist situations in which an employer and an
   applicant are in agreement about whether to ban the box. Specifically,
   depending on the structure of the labor market, banning the box can be
   (1) Pareto dominant, (2) Pareto dominated, (3) benefit the applicant
   while harming the employer, or (4) benefit the employer while harming
   the applicant. Our results have policy implications spanning beyond
   employment decisions, including the use of credit checks by landlords
   and standardized tests in college admissions.},

Abstract = {Abolishing alienated labour requires the radical democratization of
   economic production. Complex systems theory offers tools for theorizing
   how this radical democracy could be constructed. In complex systems
   theory, the same structures and transformations appear across multiple
   domains in the physical and life sciences. Evolution is one such
   concept. Rather than being linear and gradual, evolution is a nonlinear
   process in which stable equilibria are punctuated by bursts of
   catastrophic change. Even catastrophic change, however, happens through
   an incremental process: the production of new forms through new
   combinations of existing forms. Each evolutionary permutation of a
   system is a step into its space of adjacent possibilities. The task of
   revolutionary theory can be conceptualized as that of plotting a course
   through capitalism's adjacent possibility space, bringing the system to
   a benign catastrophe that triggers a phase transition into socialism.
   The complexity of this mapping requires a distributed processing
   approach to theorizing that prefigures the distributed processing, or
   socialist general intellect, that must characterize any radically
   democratic worker control of production. This project suggests the
   expansion of a new role for professional intellectuals: that of tool
   makers, developing conceptual materials that feed a recursive process of
   the construction of socialist networks.},

Abstract = {The objective of the paper is to show the increase in rural municipal
   inequality using fuzzy logic for the state of Jalisco, Mexico, from 2000
   to 2015. Methodology: a fuzzy index was developed to measure municipal
   inequality, considering rural activity, both sugarcane and non-cane,
   public spending, economic performance, urbanization and the Gini Index.
   Results: the index showed a trend of increasing inequality between
   sugarcane and non-cane municipalities. Limitations: The study should
   ensure a clear conceptual relationship between the analysis tool and the
   measurement. Value: The use of fuzzy logic reveals that the role of the
   Mexican state has been important in this, and the proposed index
   highlights the pattern. Conclusions: during the first sixteen years of
   the 21st century, municipal and rural inequality in sugarcane and
   non-cane municipalities in Jalisco increased.},

Abstract = {Hate, naturalized as a universal human emotion, is an increasingly
   popular analytical container in which to put terrible crimes of
   violence, crimes that are ineluctably racial. Hate as analytic does not
   offer a promising path towards understanding the oppressive systems and
   structures, war-making, race-making and colonial projects that produce
   and require considerable violence. There is, however, obvious political
   capital to be gained by employing hate as analytic, capital related to
   the work hate performs in turning our gaze away from the structural and
   from historical injustice and towards the psychosocial and even the
   biological. Through a focus on exceptional perpetrators with unique
   characteristics, hate as analytic establishes the innocence of the state
   and of dominant collectivities. Significantly, those contesting colonial
   dispossession can be deemed hateful, as Palestinians protesting the
   occupation of Palestine have been considered. Hate as analytic achieves
   its finest political utility when it provides the rails along which
   liberal solutions travel. If the hateful few are the problem, then
   empathy and tolerance are the answer, a ``corrective liberalism{''} that
   takes us far away from the abolition of unjust systems.},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2023},
Number = {6},
Pages = {52-65},
Abstract = {The article examines the formation of the negotiation process between
   the USSR and the USA on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in the
   context of agreements on the prohibition of nuclear tests in three
   environments. The main approaches of Russia and the United States to the
   problem of nuclear disarmament were formulated in the 1950s, and the
   analysis of historical events allows us to answer the main research
   question: how, in conditions of an irreconcilable ideological struggle,
   distrust and competition, the two powers managed to take the first steps
   to find compromise solutions that led to the creation of the nuclear
   disarmament and non-proliferation regime. The historical analysis allows
   us to create analogies with the current situation and look at the
   current crisis in the field of nuclear disarmament retrospectively.
   Special attention is paid in the article to 2nd track diplomacy and to
   the political activity of scientists connected with the development of
   atomic and hydrogen weapons, that, according to the author, allowed to
   formulate the concept of nuclear responsibility, which was an important
   component of the policy of nuclear deterrence. Drawing an analogy with
   the current situation, the author comes to the conclusion that the
   crisis in the field of nuclear disarmament is associated with a return
   to the policy of deterrence without its key component - nuclear
   responsibility, which allowed to balance the power policy and keep
   nuclear powers from plunging the world into an uncontrolled conflict.},

Abstract = {From the second decade of the 21st century onwards, debates about the
   memory of the Second World War in Ukraine and Russia radicalised.
   However, the underpining tensions dated back to the 1990s. In post-1991
   independent Urakine, memory politics oscillated between two poles. On
   the one hand, the nationalisation of the Soviet myths about the Great
   Patriotic War (1941-45), and their subsequent adaptation to Ukrainan
   national narrative. This became evident when russophone and
   national-communist parties ruled. On the other hand, ethnic views of the
   Ukrainian past took the lead when nationalist and ukrainophone parties
   governed. This included the restoration of the memory of Ukrainian
   ``freedom fighters{''} of the 1940s, who were to a great extent
   characterised by pro-Fascist and anti-semitic views. An additional
   emphasis was put on the commemoration of the Ukrainian famine of 1932-3
   and its interpretation as a genocide, while Jewish victims of the
   Holocaust on Ukrainian soil were barely remembered. This article
   addresses the evolution of the memory battles in Ukraine about the
   Second World War, and also highlights the emergence of some trends that
   may reconcile different sensitivities of the fragmented collective
   memories of the recent past in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {This article examines the strategic politics of an Indigenous network
   called las Mujeres Amazonicas (the Amazonian Women) that is resisting
   the expansion of extractive projects in Ecuador's Amazon rainforest. It
   asks, what are the Mujeres Amazonicas' political strategies to resist
   extractive occupation and how do they develop and deploy these
   strategies in their territorial struggle? To answer this question, I
   analyze how their organizing is characterized by a political design that
   merges public expressions of resistance - such as mobilizations, protest
   marches, and other public actions - with communitarian practices that
   reproduce human and more -than-human life in the Amazon. To illustrate
   this strategic fusion, the article turns to an image that the Kichwa
   leader Elvia Dagua wove into an artesania (handicraft) called la Arana
   Tejedora (the Weaving Spider). By analyzing Dagua's artesania and other
   self-descriptions of the Mujeres Amazonicas, the article shows how
   practices of communitarian reproduction are used and transformed by the
   Amazonian Women, thus enabling their political work and sustaining their
   lives at the same time. The strategic deployment of reproductive
   practices reveals how Indigenous women's cultural and social identities
   are neither static nor unchangeable. It also illustrates that the
   Mujeres Amazonicas' organizing should not be interpreted as a simple
   example of local politics responding to extractive occupation. By
   contrast, the article shows how the Mujeres Amazonicas are historical
   and political subjects with the power to shape the lines of political
   confrontation vis-a-vis the state and extractive capital, and to build
   global connections between Indigenous and non-Indigenous ways of living.},

   decisions. Using a case study, the researcher conducts a comparative
   analysis of the budgets and security policies of international
   organizations (UN, NATO, EU) and countries from 2014-2022 to demonstrate
   the feasibility of revitalizing existing security institutions or

Abstract = {Questions have abounded as to what Burundi's motives and interests have
   been in sending troops and spearheading the intervention in the eastern
   DRC. With reference to the case of Burundi's intervention within the
   framework of the East African Community's (EAC) response to the growing
   conflict in the eastern DRC, this article considered a broad range of
   what Burundi's motives and interests might be. This included security
   and stability, both nationally and regionally, regional political
   dynamics and the position of Burundi within this, and trade and business
   opportunities.
   However, this article argues although all of these have explanatory
   power, some of the complexity and nuance of the intervention is missed
   if we do not place it within the context of Pan-Africanist
   considerations, including that of African integration, African
   self-reliance and agency, and African ownership of and control over its
   own resources.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article examines the exploitation of political war myths within
   military patriotic youth clubs in Russia, predominantly based on content
   from social media accounts. These clubs frequently propped up the
   ongoing warfare in Ukraine with narratives and symbols, visual imagery,
   and reproduced slogans - all originating in the Second World War. The
   article coins the term `war merging' to conceptualize the phenomenon and
   discusses its characteristics and implications. Only occasionally
   referring to actual historical events, this form of myth exploitation
   makes blatant appeals to learned symbolic attachments and dominating
   narrative templates of Russia at war. The practice seeks to legitimate
   the current warfare in Ukraine among the Russian youth, but also serves
   to guide the plotting of new memories for how this war will be
   remembered in the future. By merging these wars symbolically, the
   invasion of Ukraine is inscribed into Russian collective memory as just,
   defensive, and heroic - as a continuation of the mythologized `eternal
   war' in Russian hegemonic culture.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {In this article, we start from the assumption that the pharmaceutical
   industry accumulates material, instrumental, ideational and
   institutional power. Considering this, we expect that it would be very
   difficult for governments to reduce the rents of pharmaceutical
   companies in the long-term, even when the former are externally
   constrained to reduce their spending. We test our argument by carrying
   out a qualitative analysis of a paradigmatic case study, the Portuguese
   economic adjustment programme (2011-2014). We demonstrate that the
   conditionality associated with the international bailout was welcomed by
   Portuguese reformist ministers as an opportunity to decrease public
   pharmaceutical spending. However, the representatives of the industry
   took several initiatives to make sure that the decrease of its profits
   would be limited in scope and time. As a result, as soon as the bailout
   terminated, the industry was able to regain its rents.},

Abstract = {Trust in the integrity of the electoral process is essential for a
   functioning democracy. However, doubts about the legitimacy of electoral
   processes have increased in established and emerging democracies. We
   analyzed electoral integrity perceptions and related variables across 26
   elections and 18 countries using post-election surveys conducted between
   2004 and 2021 as part of the Comparative National Elections Project. We
   found that citizens' experiences of electoral integrity failures, such
   as bribery and intimidation, are crucial in shaping their perceptions of
   electoral integrity. Additionally, we found that autonomous electoral
   offices have little effect on citizens' perceptions of integrity and
   freedom in the electoral process. Finally, electoral integrity
   perceptions significantly impact attitudes towards democracy. Our
   results emphasize the importance of well-functioning electoral processes
   and institutions in upholding the legitimacy of democracies.},

Abstract = {When municipalities merge, they grow and, at the same time, experience a
   comprehensive reform process, both of which may affect political trust.
   We explore whether and how the large-scale municipal amalgamation
   reforms in Norway in the 2010s affected citizens' trust in local and
   national elected officials and assemblies. We examine the effects of
   both changes in size and reform processes using survey data on trust in
   local and national political officials and assemblies before, and at the
   time, of the merger. In contrast to studies conducted in Denmark, we do
   not find evidence that the Norwegian Local Government Reform had
   significant negative effects on political trust. We argue that this
   difference between Denmark and Norway can be explained by differences in
   how the two reform processes were implemented.},

Abstract = {Far-right parties often depict their ideas as `common sense' and as
   self-evident, natural, just, and proper. This article examines the
   extent to which there is a uniform `far-right common sense'. Using a
   mixed-methods computational approach, we analysed Twitter posts
   mentioning `common sense' from the accounts of far-right parties in the
   UK, France, Italy, and the USA between 2008 and 2022. Results from our
   comparative study suggest that uniformity in far-right constructions of
   common sense is limited by varying socio-economic/political contexts.
   Meanwhile, our analysis also opens the door for future research on the
   role of mainstream actors in the legitimisation of reactionary common
   sense narratives.},

Abstract = {In December 2020, Romania held elections for its new Parliament amid the
   pandemic crisis. The voter turnout was historically low, at 31.84\%. The
   Alliance for the Union of Romanians, a new party, won 9\% of the vote,
   making it the fourth largest party in the Parliament. Having received
   only 0.29\% of the votes in the local elections held 2 months prior,
   Alliance for the Union of Romanians' success was unexpected. To explain
   this outcome, we analyse its programmatic choices, political strategy
   and symbolic and electoral geographies. The pandemic crisis allowed the
   consolidation of a nationalist and conservative constituency originating
   in the 2018 constitutional referendum to ban same-sex marriages.
   Romania's example shows that a nationalist-conservative radical party
   can become viable if extra-political groups, networks and organisations
   are willing to lend significant local support to it.},

Abstract = {This article offers a comprehensive assessment of territorial solutions
   for ethnic conflicts, with a specific focus on Cyprus. Despite its
   prominence, scholarly study has not adequately explored the complexities
   of territoriality as exhibited in the Cyprus conflict. To address such a
   gap, this study tackles the territorial dimension of the Cyprus problem
   from a unique perspective: the potential effects of international
   organizations acting as agents of socialization on the two community
   leadership. Despite the acceptance of bizonal, bicommunal federal state,
   which have become permanent UN parameters as a basis for the settlement,
   the Greek Cypriot side insisted on `loose bizonality' suggesting
   ethnically mixed regions, whereas the Turkish Cypriot side demanded a
   `monolithic bizonality' amounted to ethnic segregation. There are
   indications, however, that the UN, the EU, and the international
   judiciary support' pluralistic bizonality', as an alternative to `lose'
   or `monolithic' bizonality encouraging revisions in territorial
   approaches of the two sides.},

Abstract = {Examining the impacts of ranked choice voting (RCV) on voter efficacy is
   important as more areas consider adoption. The greater number of choices
   provided by longer RCV ballots may introduce opportunities for voters to
   misunderstand the ballot, make errant marks, or accidentally mark two or
   more candidates for one ranking, resulting in voidable ballots due to
   ``overvoting.{''} Using ballot data from the 2013 general election, the
   2017, and 2021 New York City democratic mayoral primaries, this paper
   asks whether voidable overvote ballots are more concentrated in
   constituencies with lower levels of educational attainment, average
   household incomes, and differing racial make-ups, and if this
   relationship is more pronounced under RCV than traditional elections. In
   the first RCV election in 2021, voters in locations with lower levels of
   educational attainment and median household incomes had higher shares of
   overvote voidable ballots than those in locations with higher
   educational attainment and incomes.},

Abstract = {This article examines the utility of a revised postfunctionalist theory
   in explaining regional (dis)integration dynamics. The case study
   employed to test the theoretical framework is based on Ukraine's
   regional integration processes with respect to Eurasian and European
   regional organizations in the early 2010s. The principal research
   question posed is: what factors contributed to Ukraine's decision to opt
   out of deeper integration with Eurasia in the early 2010s and pursue
   integration with the European Union insead, and how can this case study
   move the postfunctionalist theory forward? Three assumptions proposed by
   postfunctionalism, enriched with insights from social constructivism,
   were applied to the (dis)integration processes: salience,
   politicization, and collective identity. The analysis suggests that the
   revised postfunctionalist framework is indeed instrumental in explaining
   both integration and disintegration, providing insights into the role of
   collective identity mobilization once public discussion reaches a
   critical juncture in the politicization process.},

Abstract = {Why are university lecturers more leftwing than other professionals?
   Existing explanations point to differences in social background,
   knowledge production, and self-selection. This paper proposes an
   additional explanation for the phenomenon: the role of personal values.
   By applying the Schwartz human values scale to the 2002-2020 European
   Social Survey, I show that personal values are a highly significant
   predictor of political views, almost exceeding all other factors
   combined. Moreover, values are more important in moulding political
   views among lecturers than for almost every other major profession. The
   findings also provide suggestive evidence that individuals with specific
   value goals choose a university career, but that socialization also
   occurs from mid-career onwards. These results provide a better
   understanding of the political views of university lecturers and what
   drives them.},

Title = {What Is It Like To Be a Partisan? Measures of Partisanship and Its Value
   for Democracy},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3, SI},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {What is it like to be a partisan? How do individuals experience their
   relationship to political parties? The most common answer today, both in
   popular discourse and much political science, is identity, but many
   individuals do not identify with parties. Rather, they relate to parties
   in terms of psychological closeness or affinity-they do not say ``we{''}
   about the party, as do identifiers, but rather ``they.{''} In this
   article, I argue that both the empirical and normative study of
   partisanship would be improved by recognizing that these are two
   fundamentally different ways for individuals to be attached to parties
   and that these distinct experiences coexist within most democracies
   today. Acknowledging this basic plurality of partisanships would remedy
   the current tendency among empirical studies to homogenize partisanship
   as either identity or closeness and so would avoid falsifying the
   experience of many citizens who fall into the opposite category. In
   polarized contexts, moreover, it could help break up dualistic and
   antagonistic thinking about how to perform partisanship and diversify
   public understandings of how to be a partisan. Recognizing the plurality
   of partisanships would also improve the explosion of normative
   theorizing about partisanship found in the ground-breaking work of
   scholars like Nancy Rosenblum, Russell Muirhead, and Jonathan White and
   Lea Ypi. I show how identity and closeness partisanship-and the
   interaction between them-have transformative consequences for each of
   these scholars' theories of partisanship, either furthering or
   threatening them. The article aims to improve the conceptualization of
   partisanship and to model a salutary engagement between normative and
   empirical inquiry within political science.},

Abstract = {The literature on deliberative mini-publics (DMPs) establishes a link
   between political dissatisfaction and support for DMPs. However, little
   is known about the sources of political dissatisfaction that trigger
   this support. Our research tackles this specific question and claims
   that citizen dissatisfaction is rooted in a position of `losers of
   representative democracy', which leads citizens to be more open to
   reforms that move away from the representative model. Building on the
   literature on loser's consent, we focus on the effect of voting for a
   party not associated with the government and of descriptive and
   substantive (under)-representation in support of DMPs. We rely on a
   comparative survey conducted across fifteen Western European countries.
   Supporters of opposition parties and those who are badly represented,
   both descriptively and substantively, are more supportive of DMPs. These
   findings have important implications for understanding the public appeal
   for deliberative democracy instruments.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In recent years there has been a rapid advancement and deployment of the
   use of automated decision-making systems (ADS) in both the public and
   private sectors around the world, including Colombia. On the other hand,
   most of the guidelines and ethical frameworks associated with the
   development and use of AI include ``transparency{''} as one of the main
   values. Paradoxically, few public sector bodies at the national and/or
   local level report systematically and in a standardized manner on the
   use of these systems. Furthermore, few States open spaces for citizen
   participation and accountability in the different stages of the life
   cycle of these systems. This article studies the relationship between
   the principle of algorithmic transparency and the Open Government model
   in the Colombian context. In addition to exploring these concepts from a
   conceptual point of view, we address their synergies and tensions
   through different policies and public policy instruments and cases that
   have reached the Colombian courts. The study addresses the transparency
   of public administration with respect to its algorithmic systems from a
   ``macro{''} perspective, how formal and informal institutions affect
   transparency, and from a ``meso{''} perspective, how transparency is
   implemented at the organizational level. For this purpose, we conducted
   a comparative case study in which we addressed six cases in Colombia,
   three on passive transparency (CoronApp, election scrutiny, and BETTO)

Abstract = {The BRICS group has exhibited increasing international relevance,
   surpassing the G7 in GDP/PPP and attracting new members. Despite diverse
   political and cultural backgrounds, BRICS shares a critical stance
   towards the neoliberal global order. However, some challenges persist,
   particularly in countering Western cultural imperialism. Even though
   BRICS countries made notable progress in politics and economic
   articulation, culture remains a weak point of the BRICS. Without
   addressing these obstacles, achieving a more diverse and inclusive
   global order remains uncertain. The paper underscores BRICS' evolving
   role and the imperative of addressing cultural barriers to international
   cooperation.},

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {This article deals with the impact of intra-party transformations and
   access to power on the visions of political participation of activists
   taking part in populist anti-establishment parties with a strong
   emphasis on digital participation, using the Five Star Movement (M5S) as
   a case study. Going beyond studies conceiving the M5S as a populist and
   digital party, we argue that activists support a democratic ideal based
   on a civic culture involving a demanding role for ordinary citizens, who
   should be highly interested in politics and involved locally on a
   day-to-day basis. A negative vision of the Italian citizen judged as
   incapable of playing this role accompanies this ideal. Our article also
   demonstrates how political involvement in the M5S transformed the
   visions of activists, making them warier of direct democracy and more
   disillusioned about their fellow citizens. The analysis relies on
   qualitative semi-directed interviews with former and current M5S
   activists with diversified socio-demographics, political and
   participation trajectories in two Italian regions. More broadly, our
   article shows that the effects of entering government and intra-party
   reforms reinforcing the leadership at the expense of local activists are
   particularly strong in anti-establishment parties and clash with the
   conceptions of participation supported by activists.},

Abstract = {Nepal experienced three major political systems in the last seven
   decades: the multiparty political system (1958-1961 and 1990-2007), the
   panchayat political system (1961-1990) and the federalist political
   system (2007 onwards). Each political system carried its own political
   philosophy, claiming to inscribe participatory democracy at its core.
   The research is designed as an in-country comparative case study, taking
   three key political systems as its units of analysis. It asks how did
   ordinary people participate in the polity and politics of such diverse
   yet frequently changing political systems in Nepal? Interpreted from a
   participatory governance perspective, the research finds that citizen
   participation in public decision-making apparatuses has been
   transcending significantly over the last seven decades, yet ordinary
   people with no political affiliation have been facing difficulty in
   influencing decisions that affect them.},

Abstract = {Using original data collected from YouGov panelists in July of 2021, we
   examine caregiving experiences and attitudes toward caregiving policies,
   taking into consideration how intersecting identities shape the
   perspectives of caregivers. We examine the racial, ethnic and gender
   dimensions of who provides care, and how the pandemic affected
   caregiving commitments. We find that communities of color, especially
   women of color, experienced pandemic caregiving pressures differently
   than their White counterparts. We further consider public opinion on
   caregiving policies and explore whether and how these attitudes vary
   between men and women and across racial, ethnic groups and partisan
   groups. We find that while interesting differences do exist among
   different populations, and these differences are worth reflection,
   policies that support caregivers and caregiving recipients are, on
   balance, very popular.},

Title = {Silencing Human Rights Defenders Once and for All? Determinants of Human
   Rights Defenders' Killings},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {77},
Number = {1},
Pages = {401-416},

Abstract = {When are human rights defenders at risk of being killed? Echoing
   research on journalist killings, we argue that a democratic context
   makes it easier for human rights defenders to operate and incentivizes
   them to continue activities and to pursue information that puts them at
   risk. De jure protections that defenders have may not be enforced or may
   not protect defenders from bad actors engaging in politically motivated
   murder. These factors make human rights defenders more likely to be
   killed by actors trying to avoid the spotlight and exposure in
   democratic systems than in other types of regimes. Autocratic regimes
   provide fewer opportunities to freely advocate for human rights and to
   pursue or disseminate information about human rights violations by state
   or non-state actors, reducing the likelihood of defender mortality.
   Using two new sets of cross-national data on the number of killings of
   human rights defenders between 1997 and 2010 and from 2014 to 2020, we
   find that these arguments are generally supported when controlling for
   other factors that affect the killing of human rights defenders,
   particularly in democracies with lower state capacity.},

Abstract = {Treaties are a fundamental tool of international politics. Therefore,
   existing literature has long investigated their ratification, the act
   through which an actor commits itself to the treaty's content and its
   determinants. However, we believe this scholarship has three substantial
   limitations: a lack of comprehensive assessments of the differences
   between bilateral and multilateral treaties, a limited attention to
   small and middle powers, and a substantial neglect of the impact of
   cabinet ideology. We address these gaps by exploring the dynamics of
   treaty ratification in Italy. Our analysis covers all the treaties
   signed and ratified by Italian policymakers between 1994 and 2022 that
   underwent parliamentary approval. We find that multilateral treaties
   take, on average, more time to get ratified than bilateral ones.
   Treaties regarding areas such as environment and human rights are also
   subject to longer ratification processes. The presence of left-wing
   cabinet coalitions tends to increase the likelihood of ratification.
   Through these findings, the article contributes to the understanding of
   treaty commitment in middle powers. It also provides an innovative point
   of view in the debate on Italian foreign policy and its domestic
   drivers.},

Abstract = {One underplayed aspect of the current populist zeitgeist is the
   politicization of the military, adding to the growing list of dangers
   that democracies face today. Israel, which has experienced its own
   nationalistic populism since 2010, represents a deviant case with regard
   to the civil-military dimension. In contrast to the typical pattern of
   populist leaders enhancing the military's influence to bolster their own
   power, in Israel, populist politicians have sought to restrain the
   military top brass from the decision-making process, going as far as
   delegitimizing them by portraying them as part of the ``leftist{''}
   out-of-touch elite. In a country in which the lines between the military
   and civilian spheres have traditionally been blurred and where security
   officials have played a significant role in decision-making, this has
   been a noteworthy development in the era of Benjamin Netanyahu. This
   article advances two causal claims pertaining to the Israeli case.
   First, perceived military setbacks and political-diplomatic moves
   associated with the military have diminished the once-hallowed
   reputation of the Israel Defense Forces. Second, right-wing politicians
   often view the military top brass as potential political rivals, given
   the standard practice in Israel of high-ranking generals entering
   politics upon retirement. The generals' declining status in Israeli
   society has opened up the political space for populist nationalists to
   assault both active and retired security officials whose assessments
   often clash with the worldview of right-wing politicians.},

Abstract = {When does the United States normalize its diplomatic relations with its
   adversaries? This article introduces a theory of diplomatic
   normalization, focusing on the interaction between the hawkishness of
   presidents and their domestic popularity. I argue that dovish presidents
   are more likely to pursue normalization when their domestic approval
   ratings plummet, as this makes them shift their priorities toward
   policies they find themselves more comfortable and confident handling.
   Doves are less likely to pursue normalization when they enjoy high
   popularity, so as not to jeopardize favorable public support. In
   contrast, hawkish presidents typically do not support normalization,
   regardless of their domestic standing, as it does not align with their
   top policy priorities. The exception arises in the rare instance of a
   president with an exceptionally high degree of hawkishness who is able
   to pursue reconciliation without losing his support. I test my
   theoretical expectations using data on U.S. presidents' latent
   hawkishness and their diplomatic normalization decisions from 1950 to
   2005. The empirical evidence supports all hypotheses, underscoring the
   importance of understanding the interaction between a leader's personal
   attributes and the domestic political climate when studying foreign
   policy decisions.},

Abstract = {Most research on films as sites of nation-building centers on on-screen
   storylines, whereas intertextual references and off-screen
   representations of nationhood receive less attention. This article
   proposes a combined approach to further explore the nation-building
   potential of films, using as a case study the film adaptation Kahlil
   Gibran's The Prophet. Through a close reading of the film in conjunction
   with its intertextual references and the filmmakers' media interviews,
   the article explores the construction and negotiation of Lebanese
   nationhood and history under Ottoman rule. Special attention is paid to
   how the film's production, funding, circulation and reception are
   related to nation-building.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explore the conditions under which populist
   presidents undermine, preserve or improve democracy, with evidence from
   Latin America. We address five varieties of democracy in the region
   (electoral, liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian) from
   1994 to 2019 in 18 countries and focus on the backsliding or its absence
   during each presidential term. To do so, we rely on a QCA approach,
   through which we interpret the changes on each variety, acknowledging
   the presence/absence of populist presidents, presidents' popularity,
   political and economic critical junctures, support for democracy, an
   institutionalised party system and political stability. Results show an
   ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy as highlighted by
   part of the literature. Although populism emerges as an almost necessary
   condition for democratic backsliding in any variety, there are several
   cases where the presence of populist presidents led to an improvement of
   democracy in the different aspects analysed.},

Abstract = {This article undertakes a comprehensive investigation into several
   common critiques of career politicians. Career politicians are said to
   be self-serving: active and assertive when it suits their career
   interests, and much more interested in attaining higher offices than in
   serving as constituency-oriented MPs. Yet, empirical investigations of
   their alleged behaviours are few, and the results are patchy and mixed.
   Focusing on the United Kingdom case and using a multi-dimensional
   conceptualization that accords with academic and popular understandings
   of career politicians, the article draws on uniquely rich attitudinal
   and longitudinal behavioural data covering the first large generational
   wave of career politicians to be elected to parliament in the early
   1970s. It reports findings consistent with contemporary critiques,
   suggesting that such dispositions are inherent in the role of career
   politician. The strongest career politicians among this first wave
   concentrated strategically on career-serving activities, voted
   strategically to safeguard their careers, attained and retained
   successfully ministerial offices and prioritized their personal goals
   over their party obligations. The article further demonstrates that
   different measures used by researchers can produce contradictory results
   and that future comparative research should seek to range beyond
   unidimensional indicators.},

Abstract = {The article delves into three dimensions of women's political
   representation in the House of Representatives. Firstly, it examines how
   the interplay of institutions and contextual factors influences
   electoral opportunities, leveraging electoral data dating back to 1983.
   Next, through an analysis of candidate lists, it explores the role of
   political parties in nominating women. Secondly, it scrutinizes
   substantive aspects of representation, specifically legislators'
   preferences concerning abortion legalization, based on individual
   interviews. Thirdly, it investigates symbolic aspects of representation,
   particularly voters' attitudes towards inclusion, via an original survey
   with a nationally representative sample. These findings underscore the
   influence of party alignments on women's representation.},

Abstract = {If we address this topic from a conceptual and critical point of view,
   we need to address three issues: 1) why predictions are too often right,
   2) why, at the same time, they are so often mistaken, and 3) what
   consequences arise from the fact that our instruments for prediction
   ignore at least four realities that must be true about future forecasts
   or at least be conscious of their limits: a) that individuals cannot be
   fully subsumed into categories, b) that their future behaviour tends to
   have unpredictable dimensions, c) that propensity is not the same as
   causality and d) that democratic societies must make the desire to
   anticipate the future compatible with respect for the open nature of the
   future.},

Title = {Pressure on people and people on streets: social pressures to vote in
   Tunisia's new democracy},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},

Volume = {59},
Number = {4},
Pages = {896-915},

Abstract = {Previous literature argues that social pressure during democratic
   elections motivates citizens to vote. Studies in western democracies
   find that social pressure is especially ingrained among older
   generations who possess a deeper sense of civic duty. I test this
   argument in a new democracy, Tunisia, where citizens of all ages are
   experiencing democratic elections for the first time. I analyze the
   results from an original survey that includes an experiment measuring
   social pressures to vote across generations. The results show that
   contrary to findings in developed western democracies, Tunisians fail to
   socially sanction or reward an individual based on voting behavior
   despite believing that citizens should vote. This finding implies a
   democratic transition might encourage individuals to ascribe to the norm
   of voting, but citizens are unlikely to fully internalize this
   participatory norm in a way that activates and enforces this norm to
   pressure people to vote. These results speak to the wider
   generalizability of the impact of civic duty and norm enforcement on
   voter turnout in nascent democratic contexts.},

Abstract = {Do Americans identify as immigrants and, if so, what are the political
   implications? We argue that many Americans hold an immigrant identity,
   and that the strength of immigrant identity varies by race and immigrant
   generation. We find that an immigrant identity exists, that it is
   associated with several political outcomes, and that it is distinct from
   racial identity and a country-of-origin identity. We used the 2020
   Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Study to provide an in-depth,
   cross-racial, and cross-generation analysis of immigrant identity in the
   United States. We hope this initial work creates more space for work on
   the political consequences of the United States' complex identity as a
   nation of immigrants.},

Abstract = {There are times in the political life of any nation in which its
   imagining and reimagining become more intensely political, more
   conscious and more consciously intersubjective. Brexit has provided,
   provides today and will surely continue to provide a series of such
   moments. In and through a critical appreciation of Benedict Anderson's
   famous reflections on the nation as an `imagined community', I consider
   the (necessarily) imagined character of Brexit and the reimaginings of
   Britain that its imagining envisaged. I reflect on whether-and if so how
   and in what ways-'actually existing Brexit' is likely to pose a reality
   check on imagined Brexit, exploring in the process some of the wider
   political implications.},

Abstract = {Recent theories of democratic representation push beyond `minimalist'
   notions that only rely on periodic elections to connect officials and
   constituents. For example, Jane Mansbridge (2019) calls for `recursive
   representation', which seeks ongoing, two-way interaction between
   representatives and their constituents. Given the scale and complexity
   of modern representative democracies, how can such ambitious proposals
   be translated into practice? We analyze two Deliberative Town Halls
   (DTHs) convened with a Federal Member of Australian Parliament in 2020
   to discuss a complex issue, mitochondrial donation, ahead of a
   parliamentary debate and conscience vote on this issue. Drawing on
   interviews with participants, we argue that democratic innovations such
   as DTHs can contribute to realizing recursive representation when three
   criteria are met: authenticity, inclusion, and impact. We discuss the
   significance of each criterion and the role of DTHs in advancing
   recursive representation in a parliamentary system.},

   approach},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {86},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Voters need to be at least aware of candidates to hold them accountable.
   How does this work in mixed-member electoral systems where nominal votes
   often play a subordinate role and voters could entirely rely on party
   heuristics to choose between candidates? In lieu of existing causal
   explanations, we compile data on many factors contributing to candidate
   awareness and use a data-driven approach to identify variables that
   strongly predict voters' awareness of district candidates in the run-up
   of the German Federal Elections 2009, 2013 and 2017. We find factors
   that describe candidate-, voter-, and district characteristics
   politically to be important out-of-sample predictors in contrast to
   factors that describe them socio-demographically. Interestingly, we find
   that incumbency predicts candidate awareness, but it does not matter
   whether incumbents were elected nominally or via a party list. These
   findings can be a starting point for developing causal theories and have
   implications for our understanding of how voters perceive the different
   types of MPs a mixed-member electoral system generates.},

Abstract = {The extent to which political parties change their policy positions and
   the emphasis they give to different topics is crucial for the
   representativeness and responsiveness of contemporary political systems.
   This article aims to clarify the role of intraparty democracy in
   explaining the amount of such change. Previous research has shown that a
   stronger empowerment of members decreases programmatic change. This
   hypothesis is tested here more broadly, looking at both position shifts
   and emphasis change, adopting a more comprehensive definition of
   intraparty democracy and unpacking the Left-Right scale into an economic
   and cultural subdimension. It is further argued that the effect of
   intraparty democracy is moderated by the relative salience of the
   economic vs. cultural subdimensions of political competition. The
   empirical analysis of 47 parties in 10 countries between 1995 and 2019
   confirms that more internally democratic parties change less, while
   evidence concerning the moderating effect of relative salience is more
   mixed.},

Abstract = {As many urban centers, the 18th arrondissement of Paris has changed in
   two important ways over the last fifteen years. The first is the
   socio-urban transformation of the territory itself: gentrification and
   its deepening of social divisions in the area. The second is the
   oscillations in voting patterns of residents. As a consequence, this
   territory which used to be a stronghold of the Socialist Party has
   gradually become more of a marginal constituency, along with uncertain
   electoral outcomes and harsher competition. A localized survey thus
   makes it possible to highlight this socio-spatial mosaic and explain the
   variations observed in electoral results since 2014. Considering the
   2020 municipal elections in a sequence going from 2014 to 2022 makes it
   possible to show the oscillations, the recompositions, which notably
   take place in the struggles between segments of the left, corresponding
   to struggles between fractions of classes, which the localized approach
   makes it possible to grasp more finely.},

Title = {When do elections help autocrats? The plight of Palestinians under SNTV
   in Jordan},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {86},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Autocrats are often accused of manipulating electoral rules to favour
   pro-regime groups at the expense of the opposition. They select
   electoral systems, gerrymander districts, and engage in electoral fraud
   to ensure that elections do not challenge their rule. We investigate the
   extent to which incumbent rulers engage in such tactics by focusing on
   the case of Jordan. In particular we examine whether the Jordanian
   regime has `tweaked' the single non-transferable vote system (SNTV) so
   that it systematically favours ethnic Jordanian tribes of nomadic
   descent, who form the bedrock of support for the monarchy and against
   ethnic Palestinian tribes, who are more supportive of opposition
   parties. SNTV is also notorious for causing coordination problems for
   parties - or tribes in this case - that offer candidates. Using data
   from municipal elections, we find that the regime does indeed advantage
   nomadic residents. Municipalities with a significant presence of these
   residents were assigned a greater number of council seats per unit of
   population and lower district magnitudes, facilitating electoral
   coordination. Nomadic tribes also performed better with regard to voter
   coordination but not in nominating the optimal number of candidates.
   eOur findings demonstrate that clean elections in authoritarian
   countries if done ``right{''} can perpetuate and bolster regime
   favourites while simultaneously disenfranchising their challengers.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, politicians - particularly of the conservative kind -
   have been influential in binding together political support based on
   identity. Taking the case of the most populous Muslim country in the
   world and the largest democracy in Southeast Asia, Indonesia, this study
   analyses how Islamic identity has been instrumental during moments of
   political consolidation. It focuses on the way the political campaign
   industry uses social media to appeal to an otherwise fragmented
   `floating ummah' (Hadiz, V. R. (2018). The `floating' ummah in the fall
   of `Ahok' in Indonesia. TRaNS: Trans-Regional and -National Studies of
   Southeast Asia, 7, 271-290), is an assemblage of believers unified
   momentarily against an abstract oppressor. The mobilisation of the
   floating ummah with social media, this article argues, has provided
   opportunities for marginal politicians to gain standing in an
   intra-elite struggle over power dominated by the oligarchy.},

Abstract = {Avia Pasternak's book makes a significant contribution to our
   understanding of citizen responsibility for historical wrongs. This
   review nevertheless offers some scepticism about resting citizen
   liability exclusively on the idea of intentional participation. It
   argues that the necessity of the state possessing continuing legal
   responsibility over time is so intrinsic to the function of statehood
   that the question of citizen liability should be seen as part of the
   general theory of political obligation. So seen, fair play duties
   provide a more plausible general ground for citizen liability, even when
   adapted to unjust regimes. The model of intentional participation may by
   contrast harbour a muted connection between the ideas of blameworthiness
   and responsibility that the book in the main wishes to deny. And the
   practical problems of resting responsibility on intentional
   participation alone are substantial. Pasternak's major contribution,
   untouched by this critique, is to explain how the special obligations
   undertaken by intentional citizenship strengthen and extend beyond that
   more foundational duty of responsible citizens.},

Abstract = {This research contributes to an understanding of the `intertwined
   destiny' of China's twin initiatives, the BRI and the CSD. We find that
   the security implications of the twin initiatives drive different
   patterns of responses among ASEAN states. The dynamism emanates from
   diversifying preferences of ASEAN states amid complex interdependence.
   The BRI does a better job of projecting China's material and soft power,
   as it aligns closely with ASEAN states' comprehensive national
   interests. The CSD fares less well because it seeks to impose Beijing's
   hegemonic claims on the SCS, thereby posing a security challenge to
   claimant states in the region. The nuances suggest that the charm of the
   BRI cannot be readily converted into a passport for the CSD. For some
   ASEAN states, power asymmetry inherent in their relations with China
   requires a security commitment from this giant northern neighbour, which
   Beijing is still reluctant to provide.},

Abstract = {Members of Congress reveal their preferences on an issue, not only in
   how they vote, but also how they spend their time. I introduce and
   validate a new measure of Congressional engagement in national defense,
   based on the amount of time and legislative energy a member spends on
   defense issues. I demonstrate the utility of this index through the
   reexamination of two key puzzles in the literature on Congressional
   defense preferences: how veterans and members with military interests
   vote relative to their peers. Using the National Defense Engagement
   Index (NDEI) I find that both veterans and members who have military
   industry in their districts are much more likely to be engaged with
   defense than other members of Congress. These results help to resolve
   discrepancies in previous literature and suggest the benefit of
   investigating member engagement as a key part of research on
   Congressional behavior.},

Title = {The evolution of election forecasting models in the UK},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {86},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article reviews and analyzes the historical development,
   innovations, and challenges of election forecasting models in Britain.
   To anticipate challenges for forecasters, we proceed chronologically
   from Whiteley's (1979) popularity model and Mughan's (1987)
   political-economy model to the most recent forecasts in 2019. We then
   move on to discuss the desired characteristics of forecasts and assess
   the accuracy of ex-ante UK forecasts. This analysis reveals that while
   forecasters have had successes, certain elections have posed challenges.
   In 2015, the models failed to predict a Tory victory, and the snap
   elections in 2017 and 2019 left scholars with little time to generate
   and publish forecasts. We discuss the lessons learned and next steps for
   UK forecasters. And, throughout our article, we highlight the
   contributions of Harold Clarke who is remembered in this Electoral
   Studies symposium.},

Abstract = {Research has found that the context in which presidents govern explains
   the relaxation of term limits. However, presidents have strong
   motivations to retain power, and a minority of leaders from different
   world regions have actively attempted to overstay in office. I propose
   that the individual differences of the presidents explain why some of
   them challenge their term limits. Building on semistructured interviews
   with former presidents, I hypothesize that leaders who have a dominant
   personality and are politically inexperienced are more likely to attempt
   to overstay in office. Using a novel data set, I conduct discrete-time
   duration models that test the hypotheses for the 1945-2012 period in
   Latin America. The results confirm the expectations, suggesting that we
   need to consider both the context and the personal characteristics of
   chief executives to understand term extensions. More broadly, the
   results encourage further examination of the impact that leaders have on
   executive governance.},

Abstract = {Accountability has been included in the agenda of several public
   administrations that are driving many initiatives to explain and to
   justify to citizens government activities beyond traditional
   accountability mechanisms like elections. In this article, the concept
   of accountability is reviewed and a methodology for its analysis is
   suggested, particularly applicable to government compromises
   accountability. Using this methodology, a comparative analysis of
   Autonomous Communities is done. The results obtained show that
   accountability has a limited role in the Autonomous Governments' agenda,
   that there are significant variations among Autonomous Communities and
   that the weight of the three dimensions that form the accountability
   index is different in the different initiatives driven.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the attitudes of expatriate workers towards the
   future of migration to the Arab Gulf states. We conduct an online survey
   and framing experiment administered to more than 2900 expatriate workers
   in Kuwait and Qatar. We find that Arab migrants are less supportive of
   future migration than other migrants and also exhibit high levels of
   ethnic-group bias in favor of fellow Arabs. Evidence from the framing
   experiment suggests that Arab migrants disfavor Indian workers, even
   though workers from South Asia are less likely to pose competition for
   jobs. Our findings provide empirical evidence for ethnic boundary
   policing within the migrant community and speak to the conditions that
   encourage anti-migrant sentiment and in-group favoritism among Arab
   expatriate workers in the Gulf region.},

Abstract = {How does a judge's identity affect perceptions of the ability to preside
   fairly? We theorize that identity categories operate as ideological cues
   and that the public views judges perceived as ideologically proximate to
   be fairer, more impartial, and more inspiring of trust in courts
   broadly. Using a conjoint survey experiment with a diverse national
   sample, we find support for this theory and show that race, gender, and
   especially sexuality are used as ideological cues. The effect of
   identities is conditioned by respondent partisanship. Democratic
   respondents trust judges with marginalized identities more than judges
   with dominant identities. Republicans are relatively indifferent to
   judges' race or gender but are significantly less trusting of gay
   judges. We also uncover limited effects when judges preside over a case
   in which their identity is salient. These results suggest that the
   public does not seek descriptive representation as such but uses
   identity categories to achieve ideological congruence.},

Title = {When Do Campaign Donors Reject Extremists? Evidence from the US
   Foreclosure Crisis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {85},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1548-1561},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Individual campaign donors offer reliable support for extremists in US
   politics. Can such support waiver during economic crises, which often
   bolster extremists' popular appeals? Linking nationwide campaign finance
   and real estate transactions, I examine how the foreclosure crisis
   affected Republican donors' willingness to donate to Tea Party
   candidates, an insurgent right-wing faction of the Republican Party that
   opposed foreclosure relief. Individual-level longitudinal analyses
   demonstrate that Republican donors in distressed neighborhoods became
   less likely to contribute to Tea Party candidates but continued to give
   to other, more mainstream, Republican candidates. The Tea Party
   movement's unsympathetic portrayal of underwater home owners likely
   alienated Republican donors who witnessed neighbors of the same race as
   themselves suffering the plight of foreclosures. Despite the resulting
   fund-raising losses, Tea Party candidates performed better in primary
   elections in crisis-stricken districts. These findings challenge
   long-standing claims about how the US campaign finance system fuels
   polarization and extremism.},

   State as a unique modality of collaboration. Its constitutional sense
   and its limits are analyzed, distinguishing it from other forms of

   first experience of exercising the coordination function through the
   declaration of Coordinated Actions during the COVID-19 pandemic is
   analyzed and proposals are made for a more appropriate use in the

Abstract = {Since 2016, Peru has had seven presidents and has experienced two
   irregular dissolutions of Congress. How to explain this high political
   instability? This essay identifies the weakness of the Peruvian party
   system as the root cause of this political instability. This essay
   argues that the attack on political institutions in Peruvian politics
   was latent and with a high probability of breaking into the political
   scene given the significant weakness of Peruvian parties. Another factor
   that kept the assault on political institutions latent is the
   accentuated rivalry among Peruvian political parties. The weakness of
   the party system, which manifests itself with high volatility,
   contributed to the emergence of a wide imbalance of power among them.
   One of these parties (Popular Force) took advantage of this power
   imbalance for its own benefit to vacate a president and opened the
   opportunity for a relatively unknown politician to come to power (former
   President Martin Vizcarra). Vizcarra, a politician with legal issues,
   found the assault on political institutions effective to weaken his
   critics and gain popularity. Once the institutional deterioration
   intensified, as a result of these attacks, political instability
   amplified and led to more conflict and instability.},

Title = {Residues and Derivations: Vilfredo Pareto and Affective Politics},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This essay revisits Vilfredo Pareto's attempt in his Treatise on General
   Sociology (1916) to classify the non-rational sentiments animating
   social and political life, considering implications for recent theories
   of affective politics. Long known for having combined an irrational
   psychology with a model of elite rule, Pareto has more recently been
   cited as a predecessor for behavioral economists. However, I show,
   Pareto described sentiments as sources of creativity as well as inertia
   and supposed they are modified by complex, reciprocal interactions with
   ideologies and environmental conditions. As I argue, Pareto's dynamic
   account of residues jeopardized his methodological aspirations,
   portending challenges for those seeking to identify and manage popular
   sentiments today. By the same token, it prefigured theories of
   ``affect{''} developed by scholars who envision sentiments not only as
   determinants of preferences and alignments but also as sources of their
   undoing and transformation. In light of Pareto's problematic attempts to
   reconcile tensions in his study, I examine challenges facing those who
   align theories of affect with radical democratic programs. I conclude
   that radical democratic approaches to affective politics, like their
   managerial counterparts, are neither logically derived from nor
   precluded by human psychology per se, but instead compromised by
   prevailing configurations of sentiments, ideologies, and practices.},

Abstract = {Alexander Berkman's 1912 Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist is a significant
   book in the development of American anti-prison politics, not despite,
   but because of its ambivalent approach to prisons. I trace through
   Berkman's book and archive an unresolved tension between two approaches
   to the prison: advocacy for political prisoners, whereby the prison is a
   state tool for suppressing radical ideas, and advocacy against the
   politics of prisons, whereby the prison is an ``aggravated
   counterpart{''} of social structures and a site of struggle. Berkman's
   ambivalence between these approaches amid his memoirs and activism
   exemplifies the complex development of U.S. thinking on prisons and
   enduring tensions in contemporary prison politics.},

Abstract = {Mass media are often portrayed as having large effects on democratic
   politics. Media content is not simply an exogenous influence on publics
   and policymakers, however. There is reason to think that this content
   reflects publics and politics as much as-if not more than-it affects
   them. This letter examines those possibilities, focusing on interactions
   between news coverage, budgetary policy, and public preferences in the
   defense, welfare, and health-care domains in the United States. Results
   indicate that media play a largely reflective role. Taking this role
   into account, we suggest, leads to a fundamentally different perspective
   on how media content matters in politics.},

Abstract = {Tensions are on the rise in the Eastern Mediterranean, calling for a
   careful understanding of the motivations behind the foreign policies of
   small and large states in the region. This article explores the
   motivations behind the Republic of Cyprus and Turkey's foreign policies
   and their implications for conflict dynamics, illustrating the complex
   relationship between soft balancing and the prospects for conflict
   resolution, considering the spatial dynamics of multi-party conflicts.
   It argues that the Republic of Cyprus' and Turkey's changing responses
   influenced the very conflict itself, by pulling in more actors and
   thereby expanding its spatial scope. This topic has implications for the
   study of frozen conflicts, transatlantic security, and peace and
   stability in the Eastern Mediterranean region and beyond.},

Abstract = {While there are some studies mapping non-governmental organizations'
   (NGOs) responses to human trafficking, insufficient attention has been
   devoted to antitrafficking responses of Faith-Based Organizations (FBO).
   To remedy this gap, this article surveys 59 antitrafficking
   organizations through the analysis of their websites, assessing their
   level of faith-infusion and mapping their antitrafficking strategies. To
   identify the distinctiveness of FBOs, these are compared to their
   secular NGO counterparts. The survey shows that compared to their
   secular NGO counterparts, FBOs tend to focus more on the post-trauma
   stages of interventions and that FBOs tend to have individual and
   church-based donor networks. To further explore these patterns, I draw
   on qualitative case studies of three Christian FBOs in Thailand and
   Cambodia. Together, the survey and the case studies suggest that FBOs
   approach antitrafficking in a distinct spiritualized way, in particular
   for FBOs with higher degrees of faith-infusion. Faith is seen as an
   added value but employed in varied ways in antitrafficking; from
   integrating spirituality in programmes to de-emphasizing religious
   identity in favour of the theory of change emphasizing collaboration.
   The former illustrates the resistance to the secular paradigm while the
   latter illustrates adaptations to the same.},

Abstract = {Dutch civil society is seen as well-equipped and known for its high
   level of civic involvement in various fields. For sustainability of
   civil society, however, it is crucial to understand to what extent civic
   involvement changes over time. Therefore, this article describes how
   civic involvement in the Netherlands has developed in the period
   2008-2020. Using longitudinal high-quality survey data, we consider
   (contradictory or complementary) causes for trends on civic involvement
   during the period of investigation: (1) ongoing individualization; (2)
   traditionalization; (3) the role of major societal events that may
   periodically undermine or boost civil society. We find an overall trend
   of predominantly stable, yet slowly and statistically significant
   declining engagement levels that seem robust and relatively unaffected
   by societal events. Our results also reveal clearly fixed sequences of
   forms of civic involvement between distinguished (clusters of)
   organizations. The results in this article are most in line with
   individualization processes. However, given that the declines are slow
   and relatively unaffected by societal events, the findings could also be
   due to the slow process of cohort replacement.},

Abstract = {This article examines the influence of the political ideol-ogy of the
   governing party on the commitment of the city council to the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs) and the disclosure of information in this
   regard. The effect of the level of political fragmentation in the city
   council is also analyzed. The results obtained through the content
   analysis of the information related to the 2030 Agenda disclosed on the
   websites of 102 municipalities during the period 2016- 2021 reveal a
   significant influence of the ide-ological orientation of the ruling
   party, with a higher level of disclosure of SDG information in those
   municipali-ties governed by left- wing parties. Furthermore, political
   fragmentation limits the ability of left- wing governments to promote
   the SDGs as part of their political agenda. The findings reinforce the
   discussion on the influence of gov-ernment ideology on public policy and
   enhance the under-standing of the determinants of the contribution of
   public entities to sustainable development.},

Title = {Discursive malleability of a global policy model: How conditional cash
   transfers transcend political boundaries in Chile},

Abstract = {In Chile, a conditional cash transfer (CCT) programme was established by
   a left-wing government in 2004 and then re-established by a right-wing
   coalition in 2014. Despite some revisions and adjustments, Ingreso etico
   Familiar maintained the core characteristics of its predecessor Chile
   Solidario. This reflected a wider trend of CCT adoption by an
   ideologically diverse group of governments. Against this background, it
   is obvious that the CCT policy model appeals to political
   decision-makers on a wide scale, or at least makes it acceptable to
   them. However, questions remain: how was this model embraced by the
   ideologically opposing coalitions in Chile? And more broadly: how do
   CCTs appeal to such a wide range of policymakers? The article explores
   the argumentation of Chilean Members of Parliament and examines how the
   ideological and political consensus around these programmes was
   discursively attained. Through this case, the article also sheds light
   on how domestic policy dynamics interact with global policy processes.
   The analysis revealed points of confluence, which serve to illustrate
   the CCT model's capacity to convey different meanings to different
   people - allowing it to be interpreted to fit a variety of different
   perspectives. I define this quality as discursive malleability and argue
   that it is an important quality not only in explaining how a policy
   model can resonate among or appeal to such a wide range of policymakers,
   but also in the process where a global model is adopted in a country and
   becomes part of the domestic political debate.},

Abstract = {What are the relative contributions of stereotypes about the race and
   deservingness of welfare recipients to Americans' opinions on welfare? A
   recent study employing a conjoint-experimental method finds that
   Americans' stereotypes of welfare recipients as undeserving drive
   negative attitudes toward welfare, while stereotypes of welfare
   recipients as Black have little effect. However, this finding may be
   produced by the measure of welfare attitudes that includes questions
   implicating deservingness. We implement a conceptual replication of that
   study using different measures of welfare policy opinions that directly
   ask respondents about spending, both on welfare generally and on
   specific welfare programs. We show that when support for welfare is
   measured using the spending questions, stereotypes about race are
   significantly associated with opposition to welfare. These results have
   important implications for the debate on Americans' opposition to
   welfare programs, as well as for the measurement of policy opinions in
   surveys.},

Abstract = {The article assesses the role of civic education in contexts of
   heightened political polarisation, especially with a focus on right-wing
   populism. By drawing on the rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in
   Germany, we argue that civic education is an indispensible building
   block in redeeming the famous Bockenforde dictum in modern pluralist
   democracies. We outline several key principles and challenges civic
   education has to address in order to foster a `thin' notion of
   democratic identity - or `constitutional patriotism' as outlined by Dolf
   Sternberger and Jurgen Habermas. Against this background, we discuss how
   neutral civic education can, may and should be. Finally, we conclude by
   formulating an appeal towards more attitude instead of restraint
   vis-a-vis right-wing populist positions.},

Abstract = {This study examined the mediating role of civic skill-acts and direct
   associations of group identity on intentions to engage in peaceful or
   radical protest actions (i.e., activism or radicalism intentions
   respectively). A sample of 526 university students in Hong Kong was
   surveyed. The findings suggested that political identity complementarily
   mediated the relationship between joining political activities and
   radicalism intentions. Religious identity and ethnic/racial identity
   each have an indirect-only mediation to activism as well as radicalism
   intentions when mediated by community activities and responding
   activities respectively. Finally, political identity and economic
   identity each have direct-only mediations to activism intentions
   respectively. These results suggest that although group identity and
   civic skill-acts uniquely contribute to protest intentions, the
   inter-relationship is complicated by the type of group identity, civic
   skill-act, and protest activity studied. Recommendations for future
   studies are discussed in light of the findings.},

Abstract = {The January 6, 2021 Insurrection at the United States Capitol has
   renewed concerns that American citizens are becoming more tolerant of
   political violence, a phenomenon that fits within broader fears that
   partisan-induced motivated reasoning is driving democratic backsliding
   within the U.S. and across the Western world. Given the rural origins of
   many right-wing militia groups, and the widespread set of grievances
   circulating in rural America, questions and fear abound as to whether
   rural America is more supportive of political violence. In this paper,
   we investigate whether there is a substantial geographic component to
   support for violence against the state or ordinary citizens. Drawing on
   original survey data collected in the fall of 2021, we present two
   studies that explore the association between rural geography, rural
   resentment, and support for political violence. We find that, contrary
   to popular belief, rural Americans may actually be less likely to
   support political violence than their non-rural counterparts.
   Importantly, however, we find that some rural individuals - namely those
   who harbor higher levels of rural resentment - are more likely, on
   average, to support violence against the state. The same result is not
   replicated when looking at support for violence against ordinary
   citizens. These results provide important insight into the relationship
   between geographic attitudes and political violence and have noteworthy
   implications for American national security in our contemporary age of
   hyper-polarization.},

Abstract = {Reformers have offered many proposals for changing the Senate
   filibuster, ranging from modest adjustments to outright abolition. I
   draw on formal models of obstruction in legislatures to analyze the
   consequences of three such proposals: creating an opportunity to close
   debate with a simple majority vote after a sufficiently long floor
   debate, making it more onerous for the minority to sustain filibusters,
   and outright abolishing the filibuster. In each of these cases, the
   models offer a more complete understanding of the effects of these
   proposals.},

Title = {Aesthetic resistance: publicness, potentiality, and plexus},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 23},
Abstract = {This paper explicates the concept of aesthetic resistance (AR) and its
   connection to sociopolitical change, drawing from resistance studies'
   frameworks. Combining semi-structured and integrative reviews of
   literature on resistance in art and aesthetics across the humanities and
   social sciences, the paper performs a thematic analysis to identify
   patterns in AR's definitions, modes and domains, attributes, and
   transformative variables. These are synthesized in terms of the evolving
   resistance studies' frameworks and an understanding of aesthetics as
   relating to the sensorium, ultimately revealing three interlocking
   issues: (1) publicness, (2) potentiality, and (3) plexus. These
   AR-specific issues contribute to the categorization of resistance, its
   identification, and the tracing of its network en route to change.},

Title = {Should Rawlsian end-state principles be constrained by popular beliefs
   about justice?},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 19},
Abstract = {Although many accept the Rawlsian distinction between `end-state' and
   `transitional' principles, theorists disagree strongly over which
   feasibility constraint to use when selecting the former. While
   `minimalists' favor a scientific-laws-only constraint, `non-minimalists'
   believe that end-state principles should also be constrained by what
   people could (empirically) accept after reasoned discussion. I argue
   that a theorist who follows `non-minimalism' will devise end-state
   principles that cannot be realized (as end-state principles), or cannot
   be stabilized (as end-state principles), or are indistinguishable in
   content from those she would have selected had she followed
   `minimalism.' The paper ends by outlining the implications of my
   analysis for the broader methodological map of political philosophy.},

Abstract = {Identity politics based on an interpretation of society as a system of
   power and privilege are increasingly influential within left-wing
   parties and movements. We used two cross-sectional samples composed of
   Spanish-speaking social media users (total N = 1684) to assess the
   relationship between psychological variables typically associated with
   left-wing identity politics and authoritarian attitudes. In Study 1, we
   tested perceived grievance, identity-based ideology, and prejudice
   towards groups perceived as privileged, which positively predicted
   left-wing authoritarianism, with large effect sizes. In Study 2, we
   replicated our results on identity-based ideology and observed that
   social justice attitudes also positively predicted left-wing
   authoritarianism. These results aid understanding of political attitudes
   among social media users and help to close the gap in relation to the
   wider literature on right-wing authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {Following the 2021 Zapatista tour in Europe, this article offers a
   reconstruction of the genealogy of the practice of diplomacy from below,
   based on the meeting between the Italian post-autonomous collectives and
   the Zapatista rebel communities of the state of Chiapas in southern
   Mexico, and sets out its continuity after more than two decades. The
   research hypothesis is that this practice was born as a joint political
   construction thanks to the collaboration between two collective
   political subjects, organized and structured in their respective
   territories as constituent expressions of counterpower and in opposition
   to the hegemonic neoliberal model. How these collective actors relate to
   each other demonstrates the existence of two different political
   identities and cultures that, in the reciprocal encounter, recognize and
   feed each other-changing, hybridizing and, finally, strengthening each
   other.},

Abstract = {In this introduction to the sixth annual review of regional elections we
   identify three generations of regional election studies that have
   applied the second-order election (SOE) model. First-generation
   literature finds that regional authority, territorial cleavages, and
   election (non-)simultaneity explain territorial heterogeneity in
   SOE-effects because they affect `what is at stake' in a regional
   election. A `stake-based' approach also underlies a second-generation
   literature that finds that voters with strong regional identities and
   who find regional government important are more likely to make distinct
   party choices in the regional electoral arena. Third-generation research
   adopts a multilevel electoral system perspective and considers the
   impact of political-institutional variables on the extent of horizontal
   and vertical top-down and bottom-up spill-over between regional and
   national electoral arenas. Four election articles and four election
   reports make important contributions to the three generations of
   literature and thereby reveal that these generations of regional
   election scholarship remain highly relevant.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the integration of research methods training into
   a third-year elective undergraduate course. We suggest that the building
   blocks of research design can be embedded in courses without
   compromising their content. This introduces research methods to students
   who have no prior methods training or gives students with methods
   training more opportunities to engage in research design. We present
   evidence that this approach increased students' self-assessed knowledge
   of and confidence with research-related skills, especially among those
   without prior methods training. Additionally, the analysis of research
   proposals-the final assignment of the course-revealed that most students
   were able to apply core research design skills. These findings
   demonstrate that progress in research methods skills is possible across
   the curriculum.},

Abstract = {This article explains a dominant, curious and important pattern that
   emerges from our original data on 11 areas of financial regulation in
   the United States and the European Union from the Great Financial Crisis
   to 2020: sustained regulatory stringency in both jurisdictions. Our
   novel explanation, rooted in theories about international economic
   interdependence, temporal process and market power, emphasizes
   cross-border interactions that arose from a build-up of
   `border-policing' capacities. Our medium-n study, which combines
   congruence analysis and process tracing, reveals a causal mechanism -
   `joint reinforcement' - whereby the potential penalties imposed by one
   of the two jurisdictions prevent or temper the other from watering
   down-regulation. The study pushes the boundaries of qualitative
   research, advances theory and speaks to debates about global public
   goods.},

Abstract = {The simplification of the political landscape in terms of `left' and
   `right' is common across most democracies, if not most of the world.
   This would suggest that the terminology has a shared core meaning in
   different political contexts. While no such stable element has been
   established in the political science literature, various potential
   dividing lines that may form the core meaning have been proposed. This
   paper is the most extensive comparative study to our knowledge that
   evaluates these proposals by studying responses to open-ended survey
   questions on what voters associate with the terms `left' and `right'.
   Data from eight different democratic political contexts are analysed
   using quantitative text analysis methods. The results demonstrate varied
   support for the different explanations. Evidence is found in all
   contexts for the hypothesis that acceptance of inequality divides left-
   from right-wing politics. That the left-right dimension is a divide
   between those for and against government intervention in the economy, or
   between those for change and against change, is mostly congruent with
   our findings. We find less evidence that either secular/religious
   divisions, or different conceptions of equality, consistently
   differentiate left from right. Our findings point towards the existence
   of a context-independent underlying dimension of left-right competition.},

Abstract = {Women face more harassment and intimidation as politicians than men, but
   little is known about how this affects representation. I develop a
   theoretical framework for studying the gendered costs of political
   violence for descriptive, substantive, and symbolic representation.
   Testing the framework using interview and survey data on Swedish women
   and men politicians, I uncover the costs of violence against politicians
   in all three dimensions empirically. Violence makes women more
   frequently than men consider leaving politics and enforces male-coded
   characteristics for political candidates, affecting prospects for
   gender-diverse descriptive representation. Substantive representation is
   harmed by violence silencing feminist debates and obstructing women
   politicians' policy debate activities. Women's symbolic representation
   is threatened by violence coercing women to decrease their visibility.},

Abstract = {For more than two decades, the United Nations Security Council has
   tasked Blue Helmets to use all necessary means - including lethal force
   - to protect civilians from violence. Despite policymakers' emphasis on
   reducing threats to civilians, we remain ignorant of the conditions
   leading to successful outcomes when force is used to protect.
   Introducing four promising causal conditions, this article employs a new
   dataset capturing military protection operations across 10 UN missions
   in Africa from 1999 to 2017 to explore combinations of necessary and
   sufficient conditions for successful protection outcomes, finding
   promising recipes for success.},

Abstract = {Democratic governments sometimes use violence against their people, yet
   little is known about the electoral consequences of these events.
   Studying South Africa's Marikana massacre, we document how a new
   opposition party formed as a direct result of violence, quantify
   significant electoral losses for the incumbent, and show that those
   losses were driven by voters switching from the incumbent to the new
   party. Three lessons emerge. First, incumbents who preside over state
   violence may be held electorally accountable by voters. Second, such
   accountability seemingly depends on the existence of credible opposition
   parties that can serve as a vector for disaffected voters. Where such
   parties do not exist, violence may create political cleavages that
   facilitate the formalization of opposition movements. Third, immediate
   proximity to violence is correlated with holding incumbents accountable.},

Abstract = {Is the quality of democracy undermined or enhanced by party-system
   fragmentation? Addressing this question would help us better assess
   normative claims about electoral reforms. Yet, doing so is difficult
   because of endogeneity issues: party systems are endogenous to many
   other dynamics in a polity. We overcome this problem by putting forward
   an instrument for the number of parties in a system, based on the level
   of fragmentation added by parties that narrowly make it to parliament.
   We then test the effect of party-system fragmentation on the quality of
   democracy, drawing upon an extensive battery of outcomes. Against
   previous literature, we find that a higher number of parties leads to
   more fractionalized governments, but has no impact on other democratic
   outcomes. Subsample analyses suggest that fragmentation may have some
   effect in contexts of very high polarization, but we find no effect in
   other theoretically meaningful subsamples. Our results indicate that
   party-system fragmentation may have fewer normative implications than
   previously assumed.},

Title = {Electoral outcomes and satisfaction with democracy: A comparison of
   regional and national elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {84},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Subnational governments have become more numerous and more powerful
   around the world, increasing the importance of subnational elections.
   However, we still know little about the impact of regional electoral
   outcomes on citizens' political support, and there is no systematic
   comparison of the impact of election outcomes on citizens' satisfaction
   with democracy. In this research note, we provide such a comparison by
   investigating how the winner-loser gap in citizens' satisfaction with
   democracy differs across regional and national elections. Using data
   from Canada, Germany and Spain, we first show that there is a
   winner-loser gap in satisfaction with democracy following regional
   elections. The winner-loser gap at the regional level is, however,
   substantially smaller than the one generated by national election
   outcomes. Next, we find heterogeneous effects for voters who believe
   that the regional government strongly influences their quality of life.
   We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings.},

Title = {Fiscal expropriation in Turkey under the rule of Erdogan},
Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This work signifies an attempt to elaborate on the concrete workings of
   fiscal policy in today's Turkey through the notion of primitive
   accumulation. The subject matter is a political regime that constitutes
   itself increasingly through coercion. And to understand the political
   regime's constitution in its wholeness, its concrete existence in its
   relations with the economic life surrounding it, primitive accumulation
   - the notion that construes coercion as an economic power - is
   necessary. Furthermore, since the notion of class struggle is inherent
   to primitive accumulation, the latter notion also elicits to reflect on
   the formation of the state as it hinges on the class society. The notion
   of primitive accumulation reveals the class power that the state
   predicates and the concrete ends that this predicate sights. Political
   coercion can't be comprehended separately from the capitalist
   accumulation, and in the case of Turkey, their unity finds expression
   most clearly in the practices of fiscal expropriation. Throughout the
   work, fiscal expropriation is examined through three specific forms it
   takes: the unity of over-taxation with growing indebtedness of the
   state, public procurement regime, and public-private partnerships. All
   of them signify the proletarianisation and further impoverishment of the
   people just as in the era when Karl Marx has drawn up the notion of
   primitive accumulation.},

Abstract = {Why do rebel groups decide to create alliances with other non-state
   armed groups? And with whom? The existing literature on alliance
   formation in civil wars is divided into two paradigms. The former
   paradigm is related to a neo-realist approach to power politics drawing
   from the International Relations literature on alliance formation. In
   contrast, the latter considers the role of ethnic and ideological
   constituencies in determining rebel groups' preferences. These two
   paradigms of alliance formation, although non-competitive, can answer
   the previous questions in combination. This article aims to reframe the
   existing scholarship on alliance formation in civil wars and bridge the
   two paradigms by developing a typology based on the role of the
   coalition's short- and long-term goals and its internal composition in
   terms of ethnicity and ideology. The typology also presents a more
   nuanced understanding of why and with whom rebel groups ally by
   identifying four types of configurations, differentiating between
   tactical and strategic alliances, and homogeneous and heterogeneous
   compositions. By reframing the existing literature within the paradigms
   mentioned above and bridging them with the typology, the article paves
   the way for future research, particularly by understanding how alliances
   might change and evolve during civil wars.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the gender agenda has permeated all policy areas and
   has gained relevance through the constant work of organisations that
   have succeeded in making issues and challenges visible. This paper
   examines the interaction between international politics and the gender
   agenda in Argentina during the presidency of Alberto Fernandez
   (2019-2023). Based on a triangulation of information gathered from
   interviews, official documents, and news reports, the paper aims to
   analyse, in the context of recent foreign policy, what kind of decisions
   are linked to the gender agenda, and at the same time, what
   international projection the gender policies implemented at the local
   level have. We propose that the gender agenda has opened up a space in
   Argentine foreign policy in a short period and that it has done so
   mainly based on the country's trajectory in the international sphere
   linked to human rights and the discussion of inequalities in the world.
   The creation of the Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity has been
   crucial, projecting the country into global gender debates in an
   institutionalised way. Although concrete policies are developing in some
   cases, the agendas in this dual track demonstrate that these profound
   social demands have come to the state to stay.},

   between confiscation and the constitution of the common},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ESTUDOS POLITICOS},

Volume = {127},

Abstract = {The present article seeks to understand the relationship between
   technopoliques, biocapitalism and algorithmic governamentality in the
   context of cyber-colonial capitalism that constitutes the
   dominanteconomic paradigm. In this sense, from the context of
   biocapitalism, the objective is to trace the plan for the production of
   subjectivities today, understanding its relationship in the field of
   technopolitics guided by algorithmic governmentality. Therefore, it is
   in this field of tension that the objective is to understand the common
   in its ontological, productive and practical dimension, as a condicition
   of possibility to constitute new political technologies of the common,
   and forms and practices of insurrection against cyber-colonial
   capitalism. Thus, it is proposed to clarify the logic of algorithmic
   governmentality as a governmental paradigm and process of confiscation
   of the common, which produces an alienated subjectivity, and algorithmic
   technopolitical arrangements at the service of cybernetic capitalism, in
   the material context of tension with the possibility of constituting the
   common in the ontological, productive and practical field, constituting
   technopolitics of the common of combat, which make possible the
   occurrence of insurrectionary processes at the micropolitical and
   macropolitical level. For this, the historical materialism in the bias
   of Antonio Negri is used as a methodological, in which the method
   considers the antagonism between a creative subjectivity and a
   subjectivity constituted by capital. In this sense, the new categories
   of analysis are established that allow to account for new social
   subjects (the multitude/ the common) and to understand the forms of
   manifestation of the common from these categories in antagonism to the
   ``imperial{''} categories and to cybernetic-colonial capitalism.},

Abstract = {This research, as a result of a documentary review, proposes a series of
   strategies of socio-educational attention focused on reducing the
   implications of the multifactorial conflict that the educational
   institution is going through, for which the referential contributions of
   the Draft Bill of the Law of Peaceful School Coexistence are taken, a
   legislative initiative in which the purpose is to address the risk
   factors that make possible the emergence, permanence and systematic
   practice of school bullying in its various manifestations. Part of the
   results obtained indicate that the reduction of psychological, social,
   moral, emotional and physical mistreatment at school requires synergic
   efforts between the institutional apparatus of the Venezuelan State, the
   educational community and the family, who in common agreement and from a
   sense of co-responsibility, must promote strategic actions that
   strengthen coexistence based on active respect and shared reciprocity.
   It is concluded that guaranteeing psychosocial well-being and the full
   development of the personality requires the involvement of education for
   the exercise of citizenship, as an antidote that contributes to conflict
   management, acceptance of diversity and respect for the fundamental
   rights of others.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Scholars have long discussed whether the rise of China poses a threat to
   the Liberal International Order. However, there are methodological
   challenges to studying the effect of a rising power on established
   norms. In particular, the participation of rising powers in the
   established order is not exogenously determined. To make an empirical
   contribution to this debate, we focus on Beijing's influence as a member
   of the Human Rights Council. We exploit the fact that China's membership
   in the Council is determined by an exogenous membership rule and
   implement a matching technique to test whether China has influenced the
   voting patterns of the other member states on identical recurring
   resolutions. We find that China's presence in the Council systematically
   alters the voting behavior of other states in favor of China's interest,
   and that this change is larger when it comes to the enforcement of human
   rights through international criticism. To delve into the mechanisms
   underlying these findings, we conduct in-depth interviews with
   experienced diplomats at the UN Human Rights Council.},

Abstract = {Social norms are based on expectations of what others believe and do,
   and so they can shift in response to what trendsetters-highly visible
   media or political leaders-say or do. There is evidence that former
   President Trump as a trendsetter has weakened norms against expressing
   anti-immigrant attitudes in the US. As such, we ask: can trendsetters
   affect anti-immigrant norms across national borders? Can such spillovers
   be mitigated by countervailing norms attached to a national identity? We
   conduct two survey experiments to determine if there is potential for a
   Trump spillover effect in Canada and whether it can be mitigated by
   norms attached to Canadian identity. We find that priming Trump can
   weaken norms against expressing anti-immigrant sentiment in Canada. We
   also find that priming Canadian identity can mitigate the Trump as
   trendsetter effect, and attaching pro-immigrant norms to Canadian
   identity can strengthen norms against expressing anti-immigrant
   attitudes. The potential for a political trendsetter to have effects on
   immigration attitudes across national borders and the potential for
   national identity norms to mitigate such effects are important to
   understand given the recent global spread of anti-immigrant sentiment.},

Abstract = {Ecotourism is based on the economic use of the natural areas and
   monuments of a given community, whose practice is based on
   sustainability, responsibility and the wellbeing of the local
   population. The development of this type of policy must be based on
   specifically designed planning and management, supported by the
   principles of conservation and sustainability. The objective of this
   article was to identify the theoretical guidelines involved in the
   development of a coherent ecotourism promotion policy. In order to
   achieve the proposed objective, a phenomenological and hermeneutic
   methodology was used, with a predominance of digital documentary
   sources, whose main theme was the formulation and design of policies
   that promote ecotourism, its promotion and development, which were
   analyzed and discussed to draw up the conclusions of the study. The
   results obtained lead to the conclusion that the theoretical guidelines
   for the development of a policy to promote ecotourism focus on nature
   conservation, sustainability, local development and environmental
   education, understood as forces capable of promoting sustainable
   development as a whole.},

Abstract = {The entanglements of Middle East states in the Horn of Africa are
   debilitating the politically volatile region. The Middle East states
   power projection schemes and the race to build up military bases have
   been threatening the security of the Horn region by exporting the
   regional rivalries in the Middle East to the Horn of Africa. Typically,
   as is so often the case, the rival Middle East states become more
   attracted to the geopolitically crucial Horn region with conflicting
   core interests, and the local political actors have not been casual
   observers; instead, they use their playing cards to shape the
   involvement of Middle East powers. In this vein, the growing integration
   of the Horn region with the Arabian Peninsula security dynamics and the
   rising interests of Middle East states to militarize the Horn of Africa
   are ending up exacerbating the stability of the Horn of Africa more than
   ever before.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the discriminatory, anti-women workplace culture
   in China's tech industry and how tech workers organise online activism
   in response. In August 2021, an online petition broke out to demand
   justice for a sexual crime victim at the Chinese e-commerce enterprise
   Alibaba. This is a powerful example of digital activism leaping beyond
   the constraints and challenges of labour organising in the global tech
   sector. The article shows how social media could bring new possibilities
   to the tech worker movement in both authoritarian and democratic
   countries.},

Abstract = {The EU's Prodi doctrine stipulates that a new state formed through
   secession from an EU member state will be treated as a third party
   vis-a-vis the Union. This article engages with debates on secessionism,
   self-determination, and democracy in the EU to discuss what the doctrine
   entails for the democratic legitimacy of the EU. We argue that the
   doctrine is only compatible with one source of political legitimacy that
   the EU partly depends on, the state consent model. However, it is not
   compatible with the voluntary association model which is a moral basis
   that is increasingly relevant for a supranational union of democratic
   states. The prevalent practice of organizing referendums on EU accession
   shows that securing popular support is today an important feature of the
   politics of legitimacy in the EU. We illustrate our argument with the
   case of Catalonia and contrast it with cases from the history of
   European integration.},

Abstract = {The contemporary Republican Party has been the site of asymmetric
   partisan entrenchment and factional infighting. We test whether
   factional pressure from a far-right faction (the Tea Party) exacerbated
   the party's rightward movement with a granular analysis of Republican
   factionalism at the congressional district level. We develop a measure
   of local factionalism using novel datasets of activist presence and
   primary contests. Then, we conduct a difference-in-differences analysis
   to assess whether local factionalism in the Tea Party era heightened
   Republican partisanship and legislative extremism at the district level.
   We find that districts that experienced factional pressure moved
   rightward on both measures. These findings help clarify how the Tea
   Party captured the Republican Party and support a focus on the role of
   party factions in fomenting partisan conflict.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on the supply-side of protest activity in Latin
   America in the post-neoliberal era. It argues that parties' cohesive
   voting in Congress under different power constellations and parties'
   linkage strategy to voters create institutional conditions of power
   collusion, inter-branch stalemate, or party erosion that delineates
   political terrain for social mobilization. First, the firm control of a
   single party or coalition over the executive and legislature with
   cohesive voting of party members in line with party leadership denotes
   power collusion and incites underrepresented actors to protest. Second,
   the dislocation in the executive-legislative relations (either with
   party members voting against the president's proposals in a majority
   government or with cohesive opposition bloc(s) acting against the
   president's will in a minority government) leads to policy immobilism
   and pushes legislative parties to ignite popular discontent. Third, more
   programmatic party linkages increase the degree of party
   institutionalization and predictability about policy commitment and
   mitigate struggles in extra-electoral arenas. The theoretical argument
   is tested with a battery of statistical tests that lends credence to the
   institutional explanations of mass mobilization and corroborated with
   empirical cases that show the plausibility of the statistical findings
   in particular contexts.},

Abstract = {Focusing on four jurisdictions where abortion facilities and providers
   faced violent attacks following the Morgentaler decision of 1988, this
   study compares provincial government responses to core feminist demands
   in the area of women's reproductive health: enhanced hospital access,
   public funding of clinic abortions and safe zone protections. Consistent
   with previous research on childcare and anti-violence policies, the
   study finds that in neoliberal times, the presence of left governing
   parties in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario generally favoured
   abortion rights interests while conservative regimes disadvantaged them.
   The article contributes valuable new insights in revealing (1) the
   importance of centrist leaders in Ontario and at the federal level to
   pro-choice policy changes, (2) the significance of feminist critical
   actors to these outcomes, and (3) major variation among New Democratic
   Party provincial governments on abortion policy. The conclusion
   discusses implications of these results and proposes directions for
   further research.},

Abstract = {What is Japan's strategy to secure the US-led order from the heightened
   China challenge? This article argues that Japan is pursuing a smart
   power strategy made up of two complementary strands. The first is the
   use of hard power resources, involving internal and external balancing
   measures, to assist the US and other partners and friends to secure the
   region's balance of power in favour of the US-led order. The second
   strand refers Japan's use of soft power resources to reinforce the
   multilateral orders in East Asia and the Indo-Pacific regions in support
   of the US-led order. It focuses on the promotion of norms that advocate
   for a regional rules-based order outlined in the Free and Open
   Indo-Pacific strategy/vision. The article concludes that the smart power
   strategy has been successful in facilitating Japan's objective of
   securing the US-led order given its internal constraints and unique
   position between the US and China.},

Abstract = {Is engagement in private market activities associated with individualist
   attitudes and support for capitalism in North Korea? Using a unique
   survey data set from the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies
   that focuses on recent arrivals to South Korea from 2011-2020, we test
   several hypotheses derived from the literature that explains the rise of
   individualism globally. We find younger people who were in engaged in
   private business in North Korea are significantly more likely to embrace
   individualism (but not capitalism). We discuss the implications of this
   finding for the future of the regime, especially as North Korea
   marketizes its economy.},

Abstract = {Understanding political and social effects of violence in local
   populations through public opinion surveys has become increasingly
   common internationally. Yet while researchers are attuned to possible
   challenges induced during survey implementation, this work focuses
   almost uniformly on respondents. This paper considers survey enumerators
   as critical actors for data collection in violent research settings. We
   present survey results from 245 enumerators in Cote d'Ivoire to show
   that their personal feelings of insecurity and exposure to violence
   while conducting surveys may condition challenges faced and compromises
   made to gathering data. We shed light on how academic research in
   violent political settings poses unique security concerns for
   enumerators, with ramifications for data integrity.},

Abstract = {In recent years, celebrity populism has become increasingly prevalent in
   politics worldwide. However, the relationship between populism and
   celebrity politics is not straightforward, and more research is needed
   to understand how these two concepts intersect. The authors of this
   paper argue that a more nuanced understanding of celebrity populism is
   necessary to identify and analyze its various forms. By analyzing the
   communication strategies of the three populist candidates in the
   2019-2020 Croatian presidential election, this paper empirically
   investigates how celebrity populism manifests in practice. The authors
   use their proposed conceptualization to classify the candidates based on
   their use of populist and celebrity strategies. This allows for a more
   granular understanding of the different ways in which celebrity and
   populism can be combined in politics. The findings suggest that
   celebrity populism can take on different forms depending on the specific
   context and characteristics of the candidates. Moreover, the authors
   argue that celebrity populism is a strategy that can be effective in
   gaining popularity and mobilizing voters, particularly in countries
   where trust in political institutions is low.},

Abstract = {In this article, I ask, ``How do angry feminist claims get heard?{''}
   Angry feminist claims, I argue, inform, and mobilize by resonating with
   empathetic communities, legitimating feelings and experiences, and
   triggering energetic transfers among feminists and non-feminists.
   Through analysis of the 2018 protests of the nomination and confirmation
   of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court, I illustrate how
   angry feminist claims can be reclaimed as rational expressions of
   injustice, prompting divergent responses among differently situated
   audiences. Further, I demonstrate how anger as part of an affective
   appeal activates those attuned to hearing angry feminist claims as
   rational and legitimate, while simultaneously being challenged by
   intragroup intersectional differences.},

Abstract = {The idea that violent extremists inhabit an ``ecosystem{''} of
   interrelated online spaces has been popularised by both scholars and
   practitioners in recent years. Drawing from the natural sciences,
   terrorism and extremism studies has sought to capitalise on the
   conceptual potential of ecology to understand otherwise perplexing
   natural and artificial environments. Yet, despite its popularisation,
   there remain fundamental gaps in understanding the benefits and limits
   of using ecology to analyse extremist communities dwelling in
   cyberspace. To be applied in a rigorous manner, it is essential that the
   intellectual tradition and tenets that underpin ecology in the natural
   and social sciences be explained. Since its conception in biology, this
   article presents a historical and conceptual exploration of ecology to
   explain the lessons, opportunities, and limits it presents scholars and
   practitioners in terrorism and extremism studies today. This article
   provides the first systematic, genealogical overview of how ecology has
   evolved from the study of plant communities to become relevant in
   far-right extremism studies. This article provides foundational
   knowledge and lessons for moving disciplinary research and policy work
   forward, and offers guidance on how future studies can use ecology in a
   more rigorous and consistent manner.},

Abstract = {Au long de la decennie 1970, alors que l'Allemagne est separee par le
   rideau de fer, des mouvements environnementalistes puissants se
   developpent. En Allemagne de l'Ouest le refus de l'implantation des
   centrales nucleaires reunit agriculteurs, militants pacifistes et
   ecologistes ; a l'Est ce sont les enjeux de qualite de vie face a aux
   pollutions industrielles qui sont determinants. Le parti des Verts
   allemands (Grunen) cree en 1980, est issu de ces mouvements. Il a
   installe sa legitimite institutionnelle en confortant les mouvements
   environnementalistes dans son action au pouvoir dans les Lander, a
   l'echelle federale ensuite. Autour d'episodes emblematiques comme le
   renoncement a construire la centrale de Wyhl, ou l'action des rebelles
   de l'electricite de Schonau qui prefigure la transition energetique
   citoyenne (Burgerenergiewende), les enjeux energetiques sont devenus un
   sujet de debat democratique. En 2023, la sortie du charbon, et
   particulierement du lignite, se pose desormais avec acuite alors qu'un
   tiers de l'electricite allemande en est issue. De nouveaux mouvements,
   comme Ende Gelande, nourris par les mobilisations climatiques de la
   jeunesse dans le monde et en Europe, occupent mines et villages,
   denoncant la mollesse des gouvernements et exigeant des engagements
   immediats. Alors que les Grunen sont partie prenante du gouvernement
   depuis 2021, et que la guerre en Ukraine retarde la transition vers une
   economie decarbonee, ces mouvements determines, organises et mediatiques
   annoncent une nouvelle etape de l'ecologie politique allemande.},

Abstract = {The onset of multipolarity is accompanied by a number of cross-cutting
   trends. First, the consolidation of elements of modified bipolarity in
   the form of the Sino-American great power dyad. Second, the emergence of
   a range of `legacy' great powers, includ-ing Germany, France, the UK and
   Japan, with Russia struggling to retain its status as a great power
   while fearing relegation to legacy status. Third, the revival of cold
   war entails the restoration of bloc politics, although in this case in
   an acutely asymmetrical form. The nascent political institutionalization
   of the political East is based on a very different institutional and
   normative basis than the more consolidated political West. Overall, the
   center of gravity of international politics is shifting from the
   Atlantic to the Pacific basin, reflecting a fundamental change in the
   global correlation of forces. The Ukraine war has accelerated the end of
   the era of the dominance of the political West.},

Abstract = {Travel bans were a globally prevalent policy response to the COVID-19
   pandemic. In the United States, travel bans against China and European
   countries proved a broadly popular mitigation tool among Americans. Why
   did Americans support COVID-19 travel bans? We fielded two novel survey
   experiments, surveying 3000 American citizens across five waves (between
   March 2020 and March 2021). In randomizing the country of origin of
   those potentially subject to travel ban measures, we find consistent
   evidence that racial attitudes drive support for travel bans. The
   strength of this relationship varies across political parties and across
   hypothetical target countries but is not explained by objective
   caseloads that change across countries and over the course of the
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {This article investigates Republic of China Navy (ROCN) `defection
   mutinies' during the Chinese Civil War where mutineers seized ROCN
   vessels and defected to the Chinese Communists. Examining the memoirs of
   defection mutiny ringleaders and participants, this paper postulates the
   determinant that enabled ROCN defection mutinies was Chinese Communist
   covert action that capitalised on ROCN internal conflicts, weakened the
   collective action problem's effect on pre-empting mutinies and provided
   the necessary support to conspirators that led to defection mutinies
   based on Communist preferences. This research contributes to the
   military studies sub-field by exposing the intersection between covert
   action and wartime military unrest.},

Abstract = {While it may be necessary to secure elite buy-in to peaceful
   competition, the literature is pessimistic about the long-term effects
   of a power-sharing settlement on the quality of democracy. Designing
   institutions to guarantee political inclusion is commonly thought to
   undermine vertical and horizontal accountability by incentivizing
   rent-seeking over responsiveness to voters. This study employs data from
   the Varieties of Democracy project to test arguments about the
   pernicious institutional effects of political power-sharing settlements
   in post-conflict democracies, relying on a panel dataset of 28
   conflict-prone states in Sub-Saharan Africa since the onset of
   democracy's Third Wave (1990-2021). The analytical technique is a
   time-series linear regression distinguishing between upturns and
   downturns across a range of continuous measures of accountability. The
   results show that, in line with much of the literature, political
   power-sharing settlements are associated with increasing executive
   corruption and fewer improvements in the rule of law. However, none of
   the other proposed mechanisms linking political power sharing to poor
   accountability outcomes finds consistent or significant support in the
   cross-national sample. Overall, these findings suggest that the
   relatively undemocratic institutional concessions designed to resolve
   conflict may not pose the serious barrier to democratic deepening and
   consolidation as previously assumed.},

Abstract = {In latent scaling applications, such as the positioning of political
   parties, differential item functioning (DIF) may occur because of
   measurement issues or because of substantive differences in the
   association between latent and manifest variables. While the first
   source of DIF has received considerable attention, the second has not,
   although it is of potential interest to comparative scholars. In this
   research note, we introduce a novel hierarchical Bayesian item response
   model that allows us to disentangle different sources of DIF. Drawing on
   the 2019 Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), we highlight how the same
   issues are unequally politicized across Western Europe, and how some
   issues are less ideologically determined than others. Our model can be
   adapted to alternate settings, allowing researchers to shine a light on
   variation in, e.g., ideology, issue politicization, or party
   competition.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {83},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Do voters correctly perceive left-right positions of political parties?
   This question received considerable attention in the literature in the
   past decades. Previous research has shown that most voters have somewhat
   `correct' perceptions of where parties are located on a left-right
   dimension, but that both individual and party level factors influence
   how much those perceptions deviate from the real positions. This paper
   adds to this literature, relaxing the unitary actor assumption and
   introducing heterogeneity to the analysis. Using data from elite surveys
   to measure intraparty preference heterogeneity on two dimensions, I
   demonstrate that voters' misperceptions of party positions strongly
   increase the more heterogeneous the positions of party elites are on the
   economic dimension, but not on the sociocultural dimension, and that the
   effect size depends on how salient this dimension is for the party. The
   findings have implications for future research on mass-elite linkages,
   representation, as well as voting behavior.},

Abstract = {This study aims to unpack the mobilization of emotions in the political
   discourse of populist and non-populist parties and above all, across
   `varieties of populism' (right wing vs. left wing or hybrid). Is there
   an empirical connection between emotions and populism? Are all types of
   populisms alike with regards to the emotional appeals within their
   political discourse? Focusing on Italy as a crucial case for populist
   communication and using a novel methodological approach based on
   supervised machine learning, it systematically investigates the
   intensity and trends of specific emotions in political discourses
   (institutional and informal, i.e. leaders' speeches) of all Italian
   political parties over the last 20 years, for a corpus of more than
   13,000 sentences analysed. The findings confirm that (i) populists tend
   to use more (and a broader repertoire of) emotional appeals than
   non-populist parties; however (ii) overall, there is an increase in the
   use of these appeals in the Italian political party discourse over time,
   especially in terms of negative emotions; and, most importantly, (iii)
   different types of emotions are mobilized by different types of
   populisms. Right wing populism mainly uses negative emotions while left
   wing or hybrid populism employs positive emotional appeals. The
   communication arena (party manifestoes vs. speeches) nevertheless does
   matter in the degree and types of emotions mobilized by political
   actors. This study identifies important implications for research on
   emotional appeals in politics, populist communication and political
   campaigning, and populist contagion from an emotion-based perspective.},

Abstract = {While the literature highlights the relevance of informal rules for
   candidate selection, empirical research has mainly focused on formal
   rules and procedures. This article contributes to our understanding by
   investigating how the informal rules employed by political parties
   impact on intra-party competition. Using the example of district
   nominations in Germany, and based on a longitudinal mixed methods
   design, the inductive analysis reveals five central informal rules: the
   Incumbency Rule, the Information Rule, the House Power Rule, Fairness
   Rules and Power-sharing Rules. These rules shape the expectations and
   behavior of those involved in candidate selection and have a significant
   impact on various aspects of intra-party competition. They decrease the
   number of aspirants, reduce intra-party conflict and emphasize the role
   of local party leaders in organizing and controlling intra-party
   competition.},

Abstract = {We introduce a method to measure the socially constituted strength of an
   insurgency and its state opponent as they compete for recognition as a
   governing body, based upon the four flows theory of the communicative
   constitution of organizations. We validate our method using a RAND data
   set of 30 recently concluded insurgencies, and find that our method not
   only predicts the ultimate victor in all 30 conflicts, but also refines
   previous analyses of the pattern of conflict by reducing the number of
   parameters necessary to forecast outcomes and grounding these observed
   trends in the intersection of organization and communication theories.
   Our results reveal the criticality of an organization maintaining an
   aura of cohesive structuring while avoiding to appear more oppressive
   than its opponent.},

Abstract = {This work aims to show cyberspace as the fifth domain of international
   politics, in which the People's Republic of China and the United States
   build cyber power, with the ability to influence the development of
   cybernetic capabilities in Latin America. The text is divided into seven
   sections. The first presents the importance of cyberspace in
   international security. The second presents key concepts for domain
   analysis from the Social Sciences. In the third section, the categories
   of hard power, soft power, and smart power are analyzed. The fourth
   section points out international indices to measure cyber power and
   cyber capabilities. The fifth describes the method of comparative
   analysis applied to the study. The sixth compares the cyber power of
   China and the United States. In the seventh, asymmetries and areas of
   influence and cooperation in Latin America are identified. It is
   concluded that the United States is an example of national policy and
   organizational structure in cybersecurity for Latin America, while China
   is a benchmark for technological resources, with the potential to
   penetrate the economic strategy of the region.},

Abstract = {The boundary that separates the world of law from the world of crime,
   good citizens from the enemies of peaceful coexistence, and, ultimately,
   good from evil, is not only made by the iron bars and bricks of prisons,
   the patrols of wardens, and the inspections and audits for those who
   transit from one side to the other. The two worlds are also separated by
   a wall, less visible but equally impassable, which is the wall of
   silence. In silence and secrecy, imprisonment has been administered in
   prisons ever since, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, this
   form of penalty became the universal instrument by which, almost
   everywhere, infractions of the criminal law are punished. The words of
   the convicted are extinguished in the confines of prisons. For their
   distant echo to reach the outside world they need to be supported by
   blatant gestures: strikes, riots, acts of self -harm. At the beginning
   of the 1970s, a group of French intellectuals coordinated by Michel
   Foucault founded a group that assigned itself the task of giving back
   the word to the condemned, of letting emerge from their narrative what
   prison really is and what its effects are on the lives of individuals,
   both the one that takes place inside it and the one that follows, which
   is often but a parenthesis between one period of restriction and
   another. The operation of parrhesia that is accomplished by this
   activity is to unmask the classist matrix of criminal justice and its
   stigmatizing and ghettoizing vocation.},

Abstract = {During the 2020 election, voting by mail greatly expanded due to
   concerns with COVID-19. While voting by mail is relatively easy for most
   individuals, who have United States Postal Service (USPS) residential
   mail service, it is much more difficult for those with nonstandard mail
   service. In this article, we examine how decisions made by the USPS in
   the latter part of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have
   resulted in deeply entrenched structural inequities in the access to
   mail services on the Navajo Nation in Arizona when compared to rural
   nonreservation communities. Most (89 percent) of current Post Offices
   were established during the settler colonial period, during which sites
   were chosen primarily to advance military objectives and serve the
   interests of Anglo-American settlers. The resulting inequitable pattern
   of postal access remains, resulting in inferior mail service on the
   Navajo Nation and adversely impacting many aspects of life. Post Offices
   are fewer and farther from each other on reservation communities; there
   are fewer service hours; and we show in a mail experiment that letters
   posted on reservations are slower and less likely to arrive. This
   research fits within the growing body of American political development
   research on path-dependent processes and ``spatial racism{''} within
   geography.},

Abstract = {Recent political measures in Brazil, in conjunction with new
   environmental policies, could reverse previous achievements that had put
   the country at the forefront of social policy making. This article
   discusses the implications of Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) for
   social policy. It is based on qualitative methods, namely,
   semi-structured interviews with subscribers from six administrative
   regions who participated through digital platforms. The results indicate
   that the factors determining consumer participation in CSA are health
   impact, strengthening local production, environmental concerns, and
   eating as a human right and political act. This article also
   demonstrates the need to promote participation among low-income and
   socially vulnerable families in CSA and to firmly connect food and
   nutrition security policy with health, and environment aimed at poverty
   alleviation. The novelty of this research lies in its consideration of
   the implications of CSA for environmental preservation and the promotion
   of a healthier and sustainable food system, namely for the low-income
   population, which can lead to the growth of eco-social policies in
   developing welfare states in the global south.},

Abstract = {The question of the democratic character of the European Union (EU) has
   been a center-point of decades of political research. An important
   critique suggests that the development of the European political arena
   is still incomplete, with European parliamentarians primarily orienting
   themselves to national issues and politicians, implying a problematic
   mismatch between the political arena and their policy jurisdiction.
   Research has however been limited by methodological difficulties of
   capturing the level of Europeanization of the political arena. This
   paper contributes a novel method for measuring Europeanization by
   studying interactions from the European parliament to their national
   parliamentarians on Twitter in 15 EU countries. Contrary to expectations
   in the literature, we find substantial Europeanization of the political
   arena. The level of Europeanization furthermore varies greatly across
   countries and political groups. This has important implications on the
   debate on EU's democratic deficit, as communication across different
   levels of parliament indicates democratic debate.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian regimes in the 21st century have increasingly turned to
   using information control rather than kinetic force to respond to
   threats to their rule. This paper studies an often overlooked type of
   information control: strategic labeling and public statements by regime
   sources in response to protests. Labeling protesters as violent
   criminals may increase support for repression by signaling that protests
   are illegitimate and deviant. Regime sources, compared to more
   independent sources, could increase support for repression even more
   when paired with such an accusatory label. Accommodative labels should
   have opposing effects-decreasing support for repression. The argument is
   tested with a survey experiment in China which labels environmental
   protests. Accusatory labels increase support for repression of protests.
   Regime sources, meanwhile, have no advantage over non-governmental
   sources in shifting opinion. The findings suggest that negative labels
   de-legitimize protesters and legitimize repression while the sources
   matter less in this contentious authoritarian context.},

Abstract = {The vast majority of sub-Saharan countries have adopted constitutional
   clauses establishing that elected presidents cannot serve more than two
   mandates. While an extensive literature has examined why African leaders
   comply with or else try to manipulate term limits, the policy
   implications of the latter remain unexplored. Existing studies of other
   world regions suggest that setting a maximum number of terms presidents
   can serve tends to make them `lame ducks' during their final mandate. We
   reconsider this argument, and posit and demonstrate empirically that
   constitutional limits can actually induce positive effects on
   second-term presidents' actions compared to their first terms. More
   specifically, the absence of electoral pressures, the concern for their
   post-presidential future and legacy-building motivations may lead to
   improvements in the rule of law, especially regarding the functioning of
   the judiciary. This article represents the first empirical investigation
   of the performance of Africa's second-term lame-duck presidents.},

Abstract = {This essay proposes a critique of posthumanist critical theory through
   the development of the category of the hysterical sublime, a concept
   first introduced by Fredric Jameson in his early writings on
   postmodernism. While some critical posthumanist theories equate
   representationalism with a transcendental humanism, representation is
   inherent to the kinds of abstractions required in theory as such. Taking
   up the posthumanist resistance to anthropocentrism or human
   exceptionalism, the concept of the hysterical sublime-as opposed to the
   category of the modern sublime, regarding nature-is used to convey the
   way that posthumanism undermines its own ethical injunctions by invoking
   fatalistic representations of human action. Instead, this essay defends
   the return to dialectical humanism as an appropriate framework for
   thinking the rational and material conditions required for ethical human
   action.},

Abstract = {Populists are often cast as deniers of rationality, creators of a
   climate of ``post-truth,{''} and valuing tribe over truth and the rigors
   of science. Their critics claim the authority of rationality and
   empirical facts. Yet the critics no less than populists enable an
   environment of spurious claims and defective argumentation. This is
   especially true in the realm of science. An important case study is the
   account of scientific trust offered by a leading public intellectual and
   historian of science, Naomi Oreskes, and the misapplication of that
   theory during the coronavirus pandemic.},

Title = {A Diffusion Network Event History Estimator},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 1},
Abstract = {Research on the diffusion of political decisions across jurisdictions
   typically accounts for units' influence over each other with (1)
   observable measures or (2) by inferring latent network ties from past
   decisions. The former approach assumes that interdependence is static
   and perfectly captured by the data. The latter mitigates these issues
   but requires analytical tools that are separate from the main empirical
   methods for studying diffusion. As a solution, we introduce network
   event history analysis (NEHA), which incorporates latent network
   inference into conventional discrete-time event history models. We
   demonstrate NEHA's unique methodological and substantive benefits in
   applications to policy adoption in the American states. Researchers can
   analyze the ties and structure of inferred networks to refine model
   specifications, evaluate diffusion mechanisms, or test new or existing
   hypotheses. By capturing targeted relationships unexplained by standard
   covariates, NEHA can improve models, facilitate richer theoretical
   development, and permit novel analyses of the diffusion process.},

Abstract = {The quality of online survey data is sometimes seen as inferior compared
   to probabilistic face-to-face surveys. Extending existing research
   beyond the commonly studied cases, we analyse six European countries,
   comparing data from a representative online survey fielded for the 2019
   EP elections to the European Social Survey 9 and EB 91.5. We assess the
   effects of survey mode in terms of representativeness compared to
   validated benchmarks, as well as with inferences about party
   identification and vote choice. While we do find some differences in the
   marginal distributions compared to sociodemographic and electoral
   benchmarks, the inferential models when using online survey data as
   compared to face-to-face surveys are not substantially different.},

   Venezuelan Communist Left in the period that covers the times from the
   end of the Second World War till almost the moment of the collapse of
   the Soviet Union. The authors focus, above all, on the relations between
   Venezuelan communism, the PCUS, the Communist Parties of Cuba and China,
   however, they also emphasize the meaning of contacts between the PCV,
   the PCEU and ``Eurocommunism{''}. Based on the documents of the
   International Department of the CC of the CPSU kept in Moscow and the
   international communist hemerography, the authors recover a little-known
   story of the Venezuelan Left.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article was to suggest ways to improve the legislation
   regulating the scope of operation of the automated system of judicial
   enforcement proceedings, in order to increase the effectiveness of
   enforced execution of decisions while respecting human rights. The
   methodology of the article was based on the application of the following
   methods of scientific cognition: analytical, deductive, hermeneutic,
   comparative and synthesis. In addition, the authors analyze the legal
   regulation of the operation of the automated system of execution of
   court judgments, as an element of information provision for the forced
   execution of resolutions and, at the same time, have revealed the gaps
   in its legal regulation and, consequently, have suggested the ways to
   eliminate them. It was definitely established that there was no need to
   amend the legislation concerning the distribution of enforcement
   documents among private enforcement officers within their districts of
   jurisdiction. In the conclusions it was offered to improve certain
   provisions of the Ukrainian legislation regulating the provision of
   information on compulsory enforcement of decisions, in particular, to
   give the prosecutor access to information on judicial enforcement
   proceedings on an equal footing with the parties.},

Abstract = {Since the coming-to-power of the Fidesz-led collation government,
   right-wing populism has worked to establish an illiberal democracy and
   to protect national sovereignty in Hungary. Building an illiberal state
   has been through, in part, some of the mechanics that are associated
   with necropolitics. Within this context, the government has deployed
   strategies, including the use of sport, related infrastructure
   development and national sporting success, to (re)establish criteria for
   what they imagine Hungarian citizenship to be within and outside the
   current geographic borders of the state. This article examines the
   deployment of sport relating to intersecting narratives around
   right-wing populism and nationhood.},

Abstract = {Multiple studies have identified a significant gap between electoral
   winners' satisfaction with the functioning of their democracy and
   electoral losers' satisfaction. This disparity is attributed to the
   diverging policies the parties would enact. For this to be true,
   citizens must perceive true differences among the parties. Using
   thirty-one post-election surveys from twenty-five countries, this study
   finds that the win-loss satisfaction gap is conditioned by the perceived
   differences among the political parties in the democracy. The effect of
   winning or losing on citizens' satisfaction is significantly larger when
   citizens identify greater differences among the parties. This effect is
   driven by the difference in impact among citizens perceiving major
   differences among the parties. The differential effect underscores the
   importance of understanding citizens' perceptions of the parties in
   their democracy and contributes to researchers' knowledge of influences
   on democratic attitudes at a time when scholars are concerned about
   democratic decline.},

Abstract = {Are secessionisms from and within the EU comparable? What motivates them
   and to what extent do they pose similar challenges to EU territorial
   governance? This article addresses these questions by comparing the
   framing of the British Leave campaign and the Catalan independence
   movement. Drawing on the FraTerr database and method, the analysis
   suggests that secessionism from the EU and secessionism within the EU
   are different political phenomena despite sharing an emphasis on
   sovereignty and the common goal of breaking-up from an existing polity.
   Secessionism from the EU is primarily a call for the recovery of lost
   sovereignty and of classical functions of the state such as border
   control. Secessionism within the EU invokes sovereignty as the right to
   external self-determination and adds narratives around a better future
   and greater democratic quality and social justice. These two types of
   secessionism pose different challenges to EU territorial governance
   because the first entails a full rejection of the European project while
   the latter calls for a review of European multi-level governance.},

Abstract = {How can instructors best foster connections among students when learning
   is fully remote? This article describes a pedagogical experiment
   conducted in two large introductory political science courses at a large
   public university in the 2020-2021 academic year. We randomly assigned
   groups of students to different sets of instructions on how to study
   together remotely for an exam. Our strongest finding is that almost any
   effort by an instructor prompting students to work together helps
   students to feel more connected to one another; however, students often
   need to see and hear one another to feel connected. We find this to be
   tremendously encouraging-relatively easy interventions can result in
   significant improvements in learning.},

Abstract = {This paper examines Azerbaijan's decision to go to war in
   Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020. It aims to unveil the lessons Azerbaijan
   learned from the reaction of major regional actors in the South Caucasus
   to rising tensions in Armenian-Azerbaijani relations from the mid-2000s
   to the 2020 July border crisis. The paper argues that the consistent
   unresponsiveness of the international community emboldened Azerbaijan to
   proceed with its war preparations. It shows that Azerbaijan perceived
   the attitude of regional powers as inability and/or reluctance to
   interfere in the conflict, and this created a permissive environment for
   an all-out war.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the links between socioeconomic concerns and one of
   the most significant conflicts in the world, the Boko Haram-led
   insurgency in Northeastern Nigeria. In doing so it centers group
   dynamics for analysis of how women and youth constituencies intersect
   with vulnerability to violent extremism. It offers sophisticated
   quantitative analysis of new and original gender- and age-disaggregated
   survey data, with over 80\% female respondents. The paper finds that
   while poverty can influence vulnerability to violent extremism, women
   and youth constituencies interact in particular ways with structural
   factors and certain youth constituencies exhibit lower propensities to
   violence.},

Abstract = {Since the governments of Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru inaugurated a
   new Latin American integration mechanism, the Pacific Alliance, in 2011,
   the bloc has recorded both encouraging and disappointing results,
   depending on the evolution of the Alliance's main five
   aspects-political, economic, institutional, cooperative, and societal
   linkages. Although economic integration did not advance at the expected
   pace, owing to the abolition of a Mexican visa for Peru and Colombia,
   between 2011 and 2019, there has been a significant increase in social
   exchanges of nationals of the four countries, which included activities
   such as tourism, education, business trips, and others of similar nature
   (the Pacific Alliance's fifth element). Yet, despite these developments,
   scholars did not attempt to examine the societal linkage within the
   bloc, referred to in this article as the ``fifth element{''} of the
   Pacific Alliance. To narrow the gap, this article examines the path of
   the Alliance toward deep integration by identifying the effect of
   strengthening social interactions, using a transnationalist framework
   and paying particular attention to the changing patterns of individual
   trips over more than 10 years of the Alliance's existence.},

Abstract = {The European Union has developed an ambitious tobacco policy regime.
   However, this area shows striking differences in national
   implementation. Although existing research points to some explanations
   for member state differences, there is still only limited understanding
   regarding drivers of differentiated implementation. In this study, a
   method of difference is followed and the article investigates two cases
   of `high performers' (United Kingdom, Ireland) and two cases of
   `laggards' (Germany, Austria). In order to explain the differences
   regarding tobacco control strictness, three explanatory approaches are
   combined. First, taking a party differences approach, an in-depth
   analysis of the party positions is conducted, using Comparative
   Manifesto Data. Second, using a functional approach, policy
   implementation is assumed to be influenced by portfolio allocation. If
   the competence for implementing policy lies with economic or
   agricultural departments, a more liberal approach is expected than if it
   lies with the health department. Third, a turf approach is used: if the
   health department has the sole competence for the implementation,
   stricter (and also more dynamic) regulation is expected than if two or
   more departments must reach a consensus. Combining administrative
   science and politics approaches in an innovative way, the article
   provides novel insights on differentiated implementation.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the relationship between candidates' local
   roots and the share of personal votes received. The literature on
   personal votes emphasizes that candidates with strong connections to
   their constituencies tend to receive more personal votes than candidates
   with limited or no territorial connections. However, most research
   focuses almost exclusively on elected candidates, and localness is
   frequently operationalized as a dichotomous variable rather than as an
   ordinal one. This is a drawback on contemporary research on voting
   behaviour because it fails to reveal how different localness profiles
   affect the acquisition of personal votes. Using an original data set on
   single-member district candidates from the Italian 2018 general
   election, this article addresses the relationship between a localness
   index - derived from the literature - and the share of personal votes.
   The analysis shows that candidates with higher localness or which held
   monocratic political positions at the local level (notably mayors) tend
   to receive more personal votes. However, the interaction analysis shows
   that there is no effect of monocratic positions in multiplying the
   shares of personal votes obtained by local candidates.},

Abstract = {Recent data protection laws in the EU institutionalise NGO engagement
   with regulators and enable new mechanisms for bottom-up policy
   implementation. The article studies thirteen European NGOs and maps
   their contribution to policy implementation based on a novel typology
   for understanding their scope (national vs. transnational) and goals
   (direct vs. strategic) of actions. The article asks: (1) how do NGOs
   vary in their contribution to data privacy implementation in Europe? and
   (2) what are the implications of those variations for differentiated
   policy implementation? Through analyses of NGOs' informational
   activities and GDPR complaints, the article finds that NGOs converge
   towards privileging a transnational strategic civic-enforcement model,
   prioritising pan-European privacy cases to alter policy implementation,
   over individual citizen advocacy and empowerment at the national level.
   Civic engagement has served to mitigate cross-border policy
   implementation disparities, while preserving considerable regulatory
   discretion nationally. Integrating NGOs into the analysis of
   differential privacy policy implementation helps in highlighting the
   evolving nature of EU civil liberties.},

Title = {Do voters prefer educated candidates? How candidate education influences
   vote choice in congressional elections},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {82},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Previous research shows that democracies are more likely to produce
   educated politicians, but is this because voters prefer educated
   representatives or because of other features of the democratic process?
   Education may serve as a signal of candidate quality to voters or it may
   simply be associated with other factors, such as access to campaign
   funds, that help candidates win elections. We address this puzzle by
   analyzing head-to -head matches between candidates in US House elections
   from 2002 to 2012 along with a conjoint experiment. We find evidence
   that candidates with higher levels of education win more votes than
   candidates with lower levels of education, even after we account for
   standard indicators of candidate quality and campaign spending. This
   education premium not only garners more votes, but it also translates
   into higher probabilities of winning. The experimental results and
   sensitivity analyses show that it is unlikely that these results are
   explained by a hidden confound. The experiment also illuminates that the
   education premium flows from perceptions of candidate qualification and
   ability to pursue respondent interests.},

Abstract = {This study examines the lived experiences of second-generation Black
   Jamaicans and investigates how they interpret Canadian multiculturalism
   while navigating racism in their everyday lives. There is no dearth of
   research on multiculturalism in Canada. However, this article makes a
   fresh contribution to debates on multiculturalism by exploring how
   multiculturalism is understood and articulated as a claim-making process
   by a racialized group under lived citizenship framework. It extends the
   discussions on multiculturalism from a state-centered analysis to
   citizenship from below. Drawing from 22 interviews with
   second-generation Black Jamaicans, this study maintains that citizenship
   is a dynamic process through which research participants make claims to
   rights and belonging and negotiate their position vis-a-vis the state
   and other citizens to put the ideals of multiculturalism into practice.},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Using over 20,000 electoral slates from municipal elections in the Czech
   Republic, we document that in proportional representation electoral
   systems political parties rank candidates on the slates systematically
   according to their valence, measured by educational attainment, and
   intra-party value, measured by political donations and membership. The
   observed patterns are consistent with market mechanisms where the party
   leaders benefit from the valence and intra-party value of candidates and
   offer slate positions (i.e. the probability of winning a mandate) in
   exchange. We show that candidates with high valence and those who
   possess more intra-party value are placed in better-ranked positions,
   despite the fact that candidates with more intra-party value,
   conditional on observables, tend to receive relatively fewer votes than
   candidates with low intra-party value. We further show that as a party
   expects to hold more council seats, the share of their candidates with
   higher intra-party value increases.},

Abstract = {Malakand district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan has been
   going through phenomenal transformations in the socioeconomic,
   political, and ecological spheres since 1969. To understand these
   transformations, this article employs the theories of `panarchy',
   `resilience', and `adaptive cycles', borrowed from the literature on
   socio-ecological systems and sustainability transformation. These
   studies see disruptive transformation as a systemic change in the
   economy and society in relation to ecology. The evidence for the article
   is derived from fieldwork conducted by the first author during his
   doctoral study in 2007-2008 and later visits in September to October
   2012. The scales chosen for the analysis are local (Batkhela, Malakand)
   and regional (North West of Pakistan). The article argues that
   theoretical constructs such as panarchy, and adaptive cycles have
   explanatory value to delineate the socioeconomic, political, and
   ecological transformation, in the Malakand region, over a period. The
   article finds out that in Malakand, smaller actors at smaller scales
   enacted change at bigger scales of adaptive cycles. The change at a
   smaller scale due to the emergence of Batkhela Bazaar brought changes at
   bigger scales in the region. However, due to the interaction between
   multiple cycles at different scales, the system demonstrated some
   resilience to change, consequently forging a sustainable change in the
   region. Despite these explicit findings, we understand that interpreting
   theoretical constructs such as panarchies and adaptive cycles requires
   more rigorous research, particularly to develop a more precise
   connection between ecological change and socio-economic transformation
   in Malakand.},

Abstract = {After the January 6 attempted armed takeover of the Capitol, many
   commentators warned that describing the day as an act of domestic
   terrorism risked intensifying policing regimes targeting communities of
   colour. Others, however, encouraged the broadening of the domestic
   terrorism label to include armed white supremacists, given their violent
   efforts at regime change. Although these interventions have debated both
   the danger and utility in applying the terrorism label, few have
   challenged the concept of terrorism itself. Is terrorism a useful
   interpretive framework to understand the wide-ranging forms of political
   violence given that label, such as the September 11 attacks, the January
   6 events, the Indigenous water protectors contesting the Dakota Access
   Pipeline, and the Black organisers classified as ``Black Identity
   Extremists{''} for protesting police brutality? What are the material
   dangers of collapsing divergent political groups embedded in vastly
   different power relations under the terrorism label? Guided by these
   questions, this article examines the evolution of political vies for
   power between state and non-state actors to theorise counterviolence as
   a conceptual framework capable of interrogating the relationship between
   power, politics, and violence to better understand acts facilely reduced
   to ``terrorism.{''}},

Abstract = {Many studies have tried to identify citizens' views about which actors
   should govern and how. These studies have mostly looked at support for
   citizens or independent experts being given a greater role. Recently,
   Hibbing, Theiss-Morse, Hibbing and Fortunato have proposed a new battery
   of 21 survey items capturing the dimensions along which citizens'
   preferences for who should govern are organized. Testing their survey
   instrument among US respondents, they identified seven dimensions. In
   this study, we replicate their approach across nine European
   democracies, namely, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic,
   Finland, Greece, Ireland and the Netherlands. The replication allows,
   first, to compare citizens' preferences for political actors between the
   US and Europe, and within Europe. Second, it provides suggestions for
   how Hibbing and colleagues' battery might be adapted and re-used in
   other countries, enabling further cross-national comparative research on
   citizens' preferences for who should govern.},

Abstract = {This essay is part of a special issue celebrating 50 years of Political
   Theory. The ambition of the editors was to mark this half century not
   with a retrospective but with a confabulation of futures. Contributors
   were asked: What will political theory look and sound like in the next
   century and beyond? What claims might political theorists or their
   descendants be making in ten, twenty-five, fifty, a hundred years' time?
   How might they vindicate those claims in their future contexts? How will
   the consistent concerns of political theorists evolve into the questions
   critical for people decades or centuries from now? What new problems
   will engage the political theorists (or their rough equivalents) of the
   future? What forms might those take? What follows is one of the many
   confabulations published in response to these queries.},

Title = {Introducing digitalisation to strengthen evaluation systems for
   democracy in African parliaments},

Abstract = {African parliaments are a unique institutional context for evidence use,
   and processes for digitalisation have specific implications for how
   evidence systems can contribute to democracy. While African parliaments
   have organisational features that make introducing technology
   challenging, they also hold significant promise for using digitalisation
   as a tool to strengthen democratic governance both within parliaments
   themselves, and also across the executive. This article shares
   experiences introducing a research management tool in two African
   parliaments, and reflects on what it means for the role evaluation plays
   in strengthening democracy. This is through looking at the technical
   components of digitalisation, the contextual components, and the
   political and values driven elements of the parliamentary context. This
   article describes these components, and reflects on their implications
   for the way democratic evaluation is understood in a context of African
   governance.},

Title = {Election type and the logic of pre-election violence: Evidence from
   Zimbabwe},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {82},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Election violence is often conceptualized as a form of coercive
   campaigning, but the literature has not fully explored how electoral
   institutions shape incentives for competition and violence. We argue
   that the logic of subnational electoral competition - and with it
   incentives for violence - differs in presidential and legislative
   elections. In presidential elections, national-level considerations
   dominate incentives for violence. Presidential elections are usually
   decided by winning a majority of votes in a single, national district,
   incentivizing parties to demobilize voters with violence in strongholds.
   In contrast, election violence is subject to district-level incentives
   in legislative elections. District-level incentives imply that parties
   focus on winning the majority of districts, and therefore center violent
   campaigning on the most competitive districts. We test our argument with
   georefer-enced, constituency-level data from Zimbabwe, a case that fits
   our scope conditions of holding competitive elections, violence by the
   incumbent, and majoritarian electoral rule. We find that most violence
   takes place in strongholds in presidential elections, especially in
   opposition strongholds. In contrast, competitive constituencies are
   targeted in legislative contests.},

Abstract = {This paper critically reviews whether the hierarchical system or
   intercrisis learning can be sufficient to understand Korea's COVID-19
   responses. Our case study suggests that a Korean response system is a
   hybrid form that uses a hierarchical structure together with a network
   approach. To unveil theoretical models of how learning may occur and
   evolve during a crisis, we employ a policy learning model combining the
   network perspective and the four Cs model (cognition, communication,
   coordination, and control). We analyse the change in government manuals,
   response policies, and agenda streams observed in government documents.
   This analysis reveals far more complex interactions among actors and
   policies, both flexible and rigid at different phases of COVID-19. On
   top of policy learning, we conclude that it is necessary to rediscover
   the power of citizen voluntary responses and collaboration among actors
   of the response network through value change.},

Abstract = {What do national votes mean for dual citizens who have the right to vote
   here and there? Does political socialization in a liberal democratic
   system lead to a democratic remittance or do immigrant minorities align
   with authoritarian regimes challenging the West's liberal democratic
   values? In this article, we analyse voting preferences by using a
   transnational lens that focuses on the convergence of two different
   political systems via immigrant-origin voters. We focus on the
   Turkish-Dutch population from conservative backgrounds in our aim to
   gain a thorough understanding of support towards Islamic parties here
   (in the Netherlands) and there (in Turkey). This is one of just a few
   studies that have investigated the complex and layered nature of
   political preferences in a transnational world. A qualitative approach
   is followed to acquire in-depth insights of the ideas and evaluations of
   our research group. We collected data through semi-structured interviews
   (N = 21) between 2017 and 2018. Our conclusions indicate the
   significance of ethnic and religious identity, opening the way for
   Erdogan's authoritarian populism in shaping political preferences across
   the transnational political environment. Such influence, however, is
   limited by other factors such as adherence to democratic values and
   norms on the one hand and rational political calculations on the other
   hand.},

Abstract = {Relying on a networked perspective, this article argues that South Korea
   is an actor of relative importance in ASEAN's regional network, but it
   ultimately does not occupy a place that is more crucial than the
   association's other dialogue partners. In the context of ASEAN seeking
   to maintain its network power in an evolving Indo-Pacific, South Korea
   has played a supportive role in ASEAN's pursuit of social access,
   brokerage links and minimizing its exit potential from the Indo-Pacific
   network. South Korea's role, however, has been a comparably limited one
   rooted in specific functional areas and focused on certain ASEAN member
   states. While these efforts would certainly reinforce ASEAN's network
   power to some extent, the relatively thin network links between ASEAN
   and South Korea in other sectors suggest that there is little potential
   to expand cooperation beyond a functional and socioeconomic trajectory.},

Abstract = {Brexit was potentially a highly divisive issue for the EU27 with states
   having different relationships with the UK. And yet in the period from
   the UK's referendum in 2016 until the exit of the UK in 2020, the EU27
   maintained a remarkable degree of unity. This article examines relative
   EU27 unity in the face of the Brexit process. The article is based on
   interviews and other research on four selected EU member states:
   Germany, France, Poland and Ireland. The article considers four
   different factors drawn from the theoretical literature that might
   account for EU27 unity and then examines how they played out in each of
   the four states. We then compare across the cases and conclude that they
   all shaped national responses to Brexit, but that how they mattered and
   the patterns of effects were differentiated among the cases. This points
   towards the importance of seeing Brexit as a multifaceted phenomenon.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},

Abstract = {Jan-Werner Muller's analysis of `authoritarian populism' represents a
   highly limited approach to the issue that is typical of many mainstream
   approaches within populism studies and liberal-democratic constitutional
   theory. Through a critique of Muller, the article develops an account of
   the historical emergence of authoritarian populism as a `long
   counter-revolution of the radical right' against the values and
   institutions of the social-democratic welfare state. Focussing on the
   USA and UK, the article shows how, rather than being a novel phenomenon
   emerging from the fringes in the 1980s and 1990s, authoritarian populism
   emerges from the middle of the twentieth century as a highly successful
   form of hegemonic struggle over the Republican and Conservative parties
   and over American and British societies. The political success of a
   highly contradictory ideological framework of the radical right has
   helped to largely normalise a language, rhetoric and imaginary of
   authoritarian populism and place it at the centre of contemporary
   politics and culture. By largely ignoring such a development, and the
   highly contingent nature of North Atlantic `democracy', theorists and
   commentators like Muller fail to grasp the depth of the current
   authoritarian populist threat and offer only liberal-democratic
   mythology in response to the ranting and chanting of `fake news'.},

Abstract = {Recent `takeover' Prime Ministers have tended to conduct relatively
   brutal Cabinet reshuffles immediately after taking office. Liz Truss
   dismissed and moved large numbers of ministers after becoming Prime
   Minister in September 2022, and Rishi Sunak did the same after
   succeeding Truss in October 2022. This article locates the tendency
   towards brutalism in the broader context of British Cabinet reshuffles.
   It compares the scale of takeover reshuffles with other types of
   reshuffles and demonstrates how incoming takeover Prime Ministers in the
   twenty-first century have reconstructed their Cabinets more extensively
   than their predecessors. The article argues that the use of all-member
   ballots in party leadership elections has been a key driver of
   brutalism, and it further identifies several reasons why future Prime
   Ministers might want to resist the tendency.},

Abstract = {Communication is a fundamental step in the process of political
   representation, and an influential stream of research hypothesizes that
   male and female politicians talk to their constituents in very different
   ways. To build the broad dataset necessary for this analysis, we harness
   the massive trove of communication by American politicians through
   Twitter. We adopt a supervised learning approach that begins with the
   hand coding of over 10,000 tweets and then use these to train machine
   learning algorithms to categorize the full corpus of over three million
   tweets sent by the lower house state legislators who were serving in the
   summer of 2017. Our results provide insights into politicians' behavior
   and the consequence of women's underrepresentation on what voters learn
   about legislative activity.},

Abstract = {We propose a new, unified approach for comparative research on citizens'
   satisfaction with democracy (SWD). It starts with a well-specified
   individual-level model of the considerations citizens draw upon when
   answering the SWD survey question. Then we specify the relationship from
   contextual factors (especially institutions) through these
   individual-level mediating considerations and on to the SWD attitude.
   Multilevel structural equation estimation is applied to a merged dataset
   of European Social Survey (ESS) and country-level contextual data. The
   results add solidity to theoretical and empirical findings that
   citizens' judgments of democracy are driven mostly by policy outputs and
   lived experience and not much by institutional variation or its
   political consequences.},

Abstract = {We investigate the effects of states' labor laws, which can enhance or
   diminish the political power of public and private sector labor unions,
   on government responsiveness to public opinion. Drawing on newly
   developed measures of public opinion and policy liberalism in the US
   states over time, we leverage differences in the timing of law
   enactments across the states and find that labor laws impact government
   responsiveness in distinct ways. States that adopt right-to-work laws
   that lessen private sector union influence enact economic policies that
   are more conservative than public opinion, whereas states that adopt
   mandatory collective bargaining laws for public sector employees enact
   economic policies that are more liberal than opinion. These findings are
   consistent across a variety of different model specifications,
   timeframes, and measurement techniques and have substantively important
   implications for understanding the impact of government policies on the
   power of organized interests and the dynamics of political
   representation in American democracy.},

Abstract = {Brazil's Amazonian quilombos (communities descended from self-liberated
   slaves) have formed through grassroots mobilization in the crucible of
   coloniality, White supremacy, capitalism, and neocolonialism. This essay
   examines the historical dynamics of racial capitalism in and around
   Brazil's quilombos, the diverse economies that have undergirded quilombo
   world making, and the authors' attempts to engage in decolonial
   solidarity as White allies from the Global North. These reflections
   focus on three strategies that have seemed particularly important for
   solidarity work: (1) engaging in decolonial dialogues based on
   listening, responding, and acting to ensure that decolonization is more
   than a metaphor; (2) building terra firme, a form of
   institutionalization grounded in quilombo institutions rather than
   NGO-ization; and (3) operating as a weak current, a form of development
   practice analogous to J. K. Gibson-Graham's vision of a ``weak
   theory{''} that is humble, contingent, and yielding.},

Abstract = {This article deals with views of the American scholar of Russian studies
   Stephen F. Cohen (1928-2020) on what he termed the ``new Cold
   War{''}-i.e., the confrontation between the United States and Russia
   brought about by the US-driven expansion of NATO to Eastern Europe.
   Given the topicality of Cohen's views for the analysis of the current
   war in Ukraine, this article offers a summary and critical assessment of
   Cohen's analyses and of his warnings about the potential consequences of
   US foreign policy in Europe. The conclusion is that Cohen's analysis was
   vindicated by the outbreak of the current war in Ukraine, but that his
   ``Russo-centric{''} view is too narrow, and that his analysis must be
   placed in the larger global context within which the war in Ukraine
   takes place: US imperialism's two-pronged aggression against both Russia
   and China.},

Journal = {CONFLICT STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Number = {42},
Pages = {3-23},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The paper proceeds on the assumption that decoloniality matters in
   tackling the global climate crisis, conflict, and development at the
   community level across countries with high vulnerabilities. Africa
   remains one of the most vulnerable regions in the world. By examin-ing
   what decolonisation means in climate adaptation and the experience of
   six communities in three states in the Niger Delta of Nigeria, this
   article contributes to the conceptualisation of the decolonial discourse
   of climate adaptation, development and conflict understood as conditions
   favourable to the crisis. I analysed qualitative data obtained from the
   coastal communities through observation, focus group discussions, and
   interviews. The results showed a reinforcement of positions in a segment
   of the literature on decolonial climate adaptation in communities in
   some parts of the world. Migration, alternative sources of livelihood,
   embarkment of shorelines, skills development, vocations, and
   infrastructure development are among legitimate adaptive mea-sures local
   communities are adopting. At the same time, maladaptive measures such as
   piracy, kidnapping, illegal oil refining, and gangsterism are common.
   These antisocial behaviours lead to conflict and contribute to making
   climate change a very complex problem. Decolonial climate ad-aptation
   requires collaborative interventions at the level of the community,
   sub-national, nation-al, and multilateral fronts. The fact that climate
   change is a global problem with unequal impact means that the capacity
   to respond well to it at the community, sub-national, national,
   regional, continental, and international levels is crucial in addressing
   the crisis. The role of decoloniality in the handling of the effects of
   climate change in the community may take the form of integration of
   local and western knowledge. The decolonial framework would appear to be
   elastic with a potential conceptual role of critical assessment of
   existing frameworks, outcomes, impact, and power relations. One of the
   striking messages in this analysis is the likely role of local knowledge
   in reducing the risk of social tension and criminal conflict, and the
   need to strengthen it to in-crease the resilience and well-being of
   people.},

   that seek to increase their influencer in order to more effectively
   realize national interests, are the natural state and essence of
   polycentricity of modern international relations. The course of the
   European Union towards strategic autonomy raises the question of its
   relations with two global centers of power - the United States, the EU's
   most important ally, and China, its economic partner and competitor.
   Should the European Union become a full-fledged independent center, or
   should it play a supporting role of the most loyal ally of the other
   pole - the United States? This issue is at the heart of the modern EU
   strategy. The EU's 2016 Global Security Strategy proclaims a common
   course for strategic autonomy, but leaves out the answer to this
   existential question, since the EU member States still fundamentally
   disagree on the ultimate goals of strategic independence.},

Abstract = {The peacebuilding processes developed throughout the 1990s have shown
   themselves to lack the necessary tools to ensure peaceful realities
   wherever intervention has taken place; and in this order, the internal
   challenges of the intervened countries have, in most cases, surpassed
   the conflict resolution capacity of the agreements reached. This,
   indeed, is the case of the Central American isthmus, where the models of
   peaceful intervention conducted in countries such as Nicaragua,
   Guatemala and, in our case, El Salvador, have posed serious difficulties
   from the outset in terms of assuming national management in accordance
   with the postulates of positive peace. On the contrary, most of them
   still present situations of institutional weakness, corruption,
   authoritarian tendencies, and extreme social inequality. In this
   context, the following article aims to review and evaluate compliance
   with the Chapultepec Peace Accords, which put an end to the Salvadoran
   civil war in January 1992. With this objective in mind, the research
   will be based on two axes: on the one hand, the influence of the
   neoliberal paradigm when it comes to the peaceful intervention projects
   directed by the United Nations; and on the other, the historical
   experience that El Salvador has undergone after the signing of the
   Agreements.},

Abstract = {If one wants to get a grasp on the international institutional
   arrangement of what J. G. Ruggie called ``embedded liberalism,{''} which
   included the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), one must
   first carefully examine the conditions that made the regime of
   accumulation called Fordism possible. More precisely, it is essential to
   grasp how the particular evolution of class struggle in the US strongly
   influenced the organization of capitalism in this country, and
   subsequently the international institutions at the core of the embedded
   liberalism. Simply put, the thesis defended in this article is that the
   evolution of class struggle in the US in the 1930s and the following
   decades has been the main influence in the shaping of Fordism and an
   undervalued factor in the creation of the GATT. The GATT, in other
   words, is an agreement that strongly corresponds to the necessity of the
   management of the class struggle associated with Fordism.},

Abstract = {The author explores how chronicle and memoirs, history and memory
   reconstruct the past, while simultaneously influencing each other, using
   the methodological division of commemorative resources. The empirical
   basis of the study is the data of surveys conducted by the scientific
   group of the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences
   in the fall of 2020 and spring of 2022. The sociological data help the
   author to clarify how today, in the post -memory era, the private and
   family memory of our compatriots responds to the state historical
   discourse and to what extent family history acts as a means of
   reconstructing the national past. With the growing interest of Russians
   in their own identity and their inclusion in digital communication, the
   popularity of genealogical projects is increasing, with the help of
   which not only family memory, but also national history, is
   reconstructed, and the perception of the past is changing. Information
   about family history is the most important source of information about
   national history. Emotionally and meaningfully rich stories from
   eyewitnesses increase the historical interest of their children and
   grandchildren. History as a resource of identity turns post-memory
   carriers - close relatives, civil society, and bureaucracy - into
   creators of memory, and therefore history makers. One of the most
   striking examples of genealogical mnemonic, which be-came possible due
   to the post-memorial commemoration, as well as the digitalization of
   archival information about the war period, is the Immortal Regiment
   project, which symbolically connects national history and family memory.
   With the help of digitized archival data and virtual genealogy projects,
   many Russians are successfully reconstructing family history, especially
   when unknown circumstances of family history are felt as a
   ``premonition{''} of family memory. The ``incompleteness{''} of stories
   of a significant part of Russian families, primarily about the 1930-1950
   time period, gives rise to a demand for historical authenticity, but the
   perception of the past through the circumstances of the lives of
   relatives makes such perception less ``white-or-black{''}, calling for a
   balanced and ``understanding{''} assessment of history, whatever it may
   be.},

Abstract = {At the intersection of political sociology and urban sociology, this
   article explores the process of spatialization of the political order by
   articulating two angles of analysis, which constitute so many blind
   spots produced by the compartmentalization of disciplines and research
   themes: on the one hand, the spatialization of social groups and their
   political representation, which are always inscribed in specific
   territories, whose particular social morphology affects the ability (or
   inability) of each group to politically convert and represent its
   interests; on the other, public policy, which modulates both the social
   composition of territories and the ability of groups or scales of
   government to impose, arbitrate or reproduce different social interests.
   In proposing to unravel the links in the political conversion of social
   groups' interests on a local scale, the paper argues for a
   decompartmentalization of social science disciplines and methods, which
   is crucial to ultimately analyzing the way in which territorialized
   political domination is exercised.},

   capitalists expressed themselves during the last military dictatorship.
   We are interested in investigating his position regarding the main
   measures adopted during the administration of Jose Martinez de Hoz at
   the head of the Ministry of Economy. Especially those that give us clues
   about the evaluation of the capitalists on the role of the State in the
   economy.Our methodology consists on the qualitative and quantitative
   analysis of documents (newspapers, institutional sources, specialized
   magazines). We start from the study of the singularities of the
   accumulation of capital and the State during the selected stage. We
   analyze the characteristics of the industrial capitalists, as well as
   the accumulation space in which they operate, in order to account for
   the main determinations of their political action.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to analyze the cultural heritage preservation policy
   in the municipality of Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ. With a focus on the
   performance of the Council for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage
   (COPPAM), which acts as the protagonist in the management of
   preservation policies. The understanding of the functioning of the
   council was based on the construction of the profile of the councilors
   and their opinions regarding the effectiveness of the organ, its
   relationship with the public power and the observation of the council
   meetings. Thus, it was possible to bring about a discussion about the
   management of public policies for the preservation of cultural heritage,
   taking into account the values and singularities belonging to the scope
   of these policies.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the specific topic of nuclear non-proliferation
   under the umbrella of global governance- namely the United Nations'
   General Assembly. First, this work will present an account of the
   evolution of the nuclear nonproliferation regime and, secondly, examine
   the contemporary situation through a realist lens. More specifically, it
   is aimed to test powerful states' probability to shape the global
   agenda, through alignment. By establishing the theoretical bases and
   proposition on which the study is grounded, the following part will
   focus on methodology and hypotheses. By utilizing ANOVA analysis and
   Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression, this paper aims to uncover the
   relationship -if any- between the factors affecting state behavior on
   global platforms under the issue area of nuclear weapons and
   nonproliferation efforts.},

Title = {Housing as a Battlefield Between Self-Organization and Resistance: The
   Case of Reclaim the City},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {326-335},
Abstract = {Cities are a place of transformation, since cities are being challenged
   through various processes, among them gentrification. Likewise, cities
   are a space for innovation and new solutions, as many changes start
   locally. Reclaim the City is one such local movement: It is a response
   to weak statehood which results in a limited ability to solve the
   housing crisis and the continuation of spatial segregation in Cape Town.
   Gentrification deepens the housing crisis and has an impact on the most
   vulnerable groups, black and colored people, who are affected by
   eviction. Based on a qualitative study, this article first unpacks the
   weakness of the city authorities regarding housing and then analyzes the
   relationship between Reclaim the City and the city. This relationship is
   not to be understood as a binary, conflictual liaison; rather, the
   relationship is complex, involving resistance but also complementarity,
   because in the self-organized occupation Reclaim the City offers what
   the city is not able to provide. The response of the authorities is
   ambivalent: They welcome self-organization and yet try to control and
   delegitimize the occupation by criminalizing the occupants. The
   relationship between Reclaim the City and the city thus shows that
   self-organization does not necessarily lead to new interfaces between
   the state and social movements, as often discussed in the context of new
   municipalism, but rather housing becomes a field of social contestation
   in that the city and Reclaim the City negotiate for mutual acceptance
   and legitimation, at times with an open end.},

   policy and in the long-term care sector for the elderly in Spain. By
   analysing quantitative data from different official sources, the paper
   starts from the context and the evolution of both sectors and explores
   the existence of possible correlations between the use of indirect
   management models by the Autonomous Communities in the implementation of
   these essential services and their performance expressed in indicators
   of expenditure, available means and results achieved. The research shows
   that contextual variables and the resort to private operators have a
   strong influence on the provision of health services, while in the
   long-term care sector the size of the nursing homes has been more
   decisive as an explanatory factor for mortality rates associated with
   covid-19 than their legal nature, whether public or private.},

Abstract = {This article examines four mechanisms for establishing federal spending
   programmes despite tough opposition based on identity or ideological
   politics, as well as disputes between haves and have-nots. It contrasts
   the use of clocks (time limits), caps, compartments (special
   justification for spending that would otherwise have been rejected), and
   carve-outs (exemptions to federal spending programmes to buy off
   objecting veto players) to secure political support for national-level
   programmes, and asks under what conditions those limits might be
   breached. We look at the EU, Canada, and the US. These tactics are most
   successful at ``getting to yes{''} for federal authorities when they can
   isolate individual objections. As long as those objections persist, the
   limits will persist as well.},

Title = {Pride or Prejudice? Clarifying the Role of White Racial Identity in
   Recent Presidential Elections},
Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 1},
Abstract = {After the 2016 presidential election, a dominant media narrative emerged
   which claimed that Donald Trump's 2016 electoral victory was due to an
   upsurge in support by working class White voters, largely due to
   economic anxiety experienced since the 2008 recession. But as survey
   data from the 2016 election became available, a different story began to
   emerge. The consensus among social scientists became that racial
   attitudes were the most important predictors of support for Trump among
   many White voters in 2016, including those with less than a college
   education (whose incomes it should be noted may or may not put them in
   the working class). The literature remains dominated by studies that
   focus on White hostility toward racial outgroups, but a number of
   studies have emphasized the importance of Whites' ingroup attitudes.
   Trump lost reelection in 2020, but remains popular and most experts
   anticipate that he will run again in 2024. We therefore need to consider
   the still-unresolved question of if and how White ingroup identity is
   relevant to understanding Trump's electoral success. Yet there are few
   studies that have actually examined the effects of the full range of
   ingroup and outgroup attitudes simultaneously. In this paper, we
   re-evaluate the relative importance of the effect of White Racial
   Identity (WRI) on vote choice in recent presidential elections. We find
   that, like indicators of outgroup attitudes, the level of WRI has
   remained stable over the last several elections and in recent years has
   actually decreased. We also find that WRI actually has no direct effect
   on vote choice in recent presidential elections, including the two
   elections (2016 and 2020) in which Trump ran as the Republican nominee.
   We find instead that WRI influenced the presidential vote at best
   indirectly, serving as a platform for expressing White outgroup
   hostility.},

Abstract = {Over the past 20 years, Russia has evolved from a weak democracy to a
   repressive police state and now to a wartime dictatorship. The causes
   can be seen in a dynamic interplay between the collective mentality of
   an amorphous society and the institutional continuity of the Soviet
   Union's repressive apparatus. Russian society's inability to organise
   itself and a longing for a strong leader came together with the
   mechanisms of bureaucratic self-regeneration. Elections do not serve to
   select elites, but to confirm the leader by acclamation. Propaganda
   ascribes to him charisma; collective consciousness confirms this induced
   legitimacy. The state's production of conceived enemies plays a central
   role. Such propaganda legitimises the 20 years of internal war waged
   against those who think differently and the external war against
   Ukraine, which has been ongoing since 2014.},

Title = {Housing Segregation in the Rental Housing Market: A Field Experiment for
   Istanbul},
Journal = {SIYASAL-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCES},

Pages = {133-153},
Abstract = {This paper examines the housing discrimination towards the Syrian
   population living in Turkey under temporary protection status. Since the
   commencement of the civil war, the Syrian migration to Turkey has
   transformed numerous cities across the country into varying degrees of
   Syrian habitation. The Turkish policymakers initially designated Syrian
   immigrants as ``guests{''}, claiming that their settlement in Turkey was
   exceptional and would be transitory. However, this phenomenon has
   evolved into a lasting situation. Inequalities within the housing sector
   amplify the challenges faced by immigrants in establishing themselves
   and adapting to their host country. Moreover, the selection of a living
   locale carries significant importance, influencing the accessibility of
   local public services and engagement in the labor market. The paper
   specifically focuses on the migrants' experience of the initial housing
   search and the instances of bias in the rental housing market. It is
   founded upon empirical data derived from a field experiment conducted as
   part of the research project titled ``From Guests to City Dwellers: The
   Housing Experience of Syrians in Istanbul{''} Following data collection,
   a comprehensive three-phase mixed methods research was conducted. In
   alignment with existing literature, the field experiment was executed
   employing a sample that accurately represents the rental housing market
   in Istanbul, the city harboring the highest population of Syrian
   residents. Findings reveal a stark discrepancy, with approximately 35\%
   of housing tour requests made by Syrians for properties directly managed
   by landlords being declined, in contrast to a mere 2\% rejection rate
   for the local population. This disparity not only escalates the housing
   costs for Syrians due to the limited access to available properties in
   the rental housing market but also contributes to an uneven spatial
   distribution of Syrians across Istanbul's districts.},

   Traditional methods of dealing with the problem will not work as
   experience confirms. The objective of this work is to propose a new
   political approach to address the problem. We will start from the
   general postulates of the ecological paradigm, a new current of thought
   directly focused on the problem, without prejudice to a holistic
   approach to all reality. From these principles we will extract their
   political consequences in the key of basic principles, which are
   adequate to solve the problem with due haste.},

Abstract = {Taking as our point of departure the final line of Frantz Fanon's first
   book, Black Skins, White Masks (1952) ``-Oh my body, always make me a
   man who questions! -{''} we examine how Fanon's posthumously published
   The Wretched of the Earth (1961) may be treated as a kind of
   ``interrogation-machine.{''} Rather than approach this work as either
   transparently expressing the intentions of its author ({''}the text as
   body{''}) or as a surface sliding across meanings that can be assembled
   in any number of ways ({''}the text as machine{''}), we read three key
   episodes in The Wretched of the Earth as posing questions in ways that
   exceed the answers Fanon himself offers - a prose poem by Guinea writer
   Fodeba Keita; Fanon's treatment of the radical potential of Islam
   through his correspondence with Iranian sociologist Ali Shariati; and
   the responses of his patients to the trauma of torture. In highlighting
   these interlocutors, who tend to be neglected by most commentators on
   Fanon, we conclude that the text functions as a kind of ``manifesto{''}
   appealing to different audiences in the tradition of Marx and Engels,
   both colonized and colonizer. We also consider how Fanon's call for a
   ``new humanism{''} speaks to our own crises of virulent
   state-nationalism, religious fundamentalism, and institutionalized
   racism.},

Title = {Justified Coercion, Political Cooperation, and Exemption from General
   Laws},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 1},
Abstract = {When, if ever, should people be exempted from a law because they cannot,
   given their particular beliefs and values, see the force of the reasons
   for that law? Such exemptions, often requested by religious and cultural
   minority groups, enhance the cooperative character of democratic
   government by eliminating instances in which some citizens must
   experience their subjection to state power as mere coercion. I defend
   three claims. First, the value of political cooperation is sometimes but
   not always pivotal in the moral evaluation of mere coercion. Second,
   political cooperation has both intrinsic and instrumental value, but the
   latter should not usually determine judgments about exemptions. Third,
   the relational costs of subjecting someone to mere coercion are neither
   binary nor proportional to the extent of that coercion. My model of
   these costs reveals the types of cases in which the absence of
   accessible reasons is most and least likely to warrant exemptions.},

Title = {`New Dispensation, New Kids on the Block'. `Ama 2000' and the 2023
   Harmonised Elections in Zimbabwe},
Journal = {STRATEGIC REVIEW FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {88-117},
Abstract = {Zimbabwe's political landscape has undergone significant changes since
   the 2017 coup, with the post -coup period being christened the `New
   Dispensation'. The advent of the `New Dispensation', characterised with
   promises of a new and revolving democracy, coincided with the coming of
   voting age of `Ama 2000'. The paper investigated the electoral
   participation of `Ama 2000' in Zimbabwe's 2023 elections. A theoretical
   framework that looked at factors that influence youth political
   participation was developed and used in explaining the electoral
   participation or their lack thereof. Hundred and fifteen focus group
   respondents between the ages of 18 to 23 were selected in Zimbabwe's
   cities of Harare and Bulawayo, wherein conversations on the motivations
   and barriers on youth political engagement were facilitated. Whilst `Ama
   2000' demonstrated political knowledge and interest, they are generally
   apathetic, with a few participating in voting whilst most did not
   associate with the other forms of electoral participation.
   Disillusionment with both politicians and political parties, politically
   motivated violence, and life cycle factors were the major reasons for
   their lack of interest in the country's 2023 elections. Arguably, there
   is no democratic and plural `New Dispensation' after all, as these same
   factors have deterred older youth from participating in elections under
   the authoritarian Mugabe regime. However, the limited participation of
   `Ama 2000' in voting demonstrates commitment to democratic principles
   and a desire to shape the country's future. To address the youth apathy
   gap, political parties must actively engage with them, reform, and
   promote inclusivity. At state level, structural reforms of an electoral
   nature are necessary to protect the security of the voter. Civil society
   has a role to play in strengthening civic education programs that
   instill a sense of civic duty and active participation in democracy. By
   involving youth in the democratic process, Zimbabwe can build a
   foundation for inclusive political participation.},

Abstract = {This article explores Nepal Earthquakes 2015 as a case of Canadian
   disaster diplomacy, tracing the diplomatic ties between Canada and
   Nepal. We argue that the warming up of diplomatic relations between
   these countries in the 50th diplomatic year sprinted Canada's support
   following the 2015 Nepal earthquakes. The earthquakes increased Nepali
   Canadians' involvement in the relief efforts, reinforced their diasporic
   identities, and increased their visibility as a visible minority
   community within the broader Asian diaspora in Canada while surfacing
   the political divisiveness amongst them. Against this backdrop, we ask:
   what lessons can be learned for Canadian disaster diplomacy efforts in
   the South Asian region? Based on field evidence, we argue that nonstate
   actors, western disaster aid, and local government efforts fail to
   supply disaster relief in socially optimal quantities. We urge Canadian
   disaster aid actors to critically reflect on their aid strategies for
   effective help, not merely rhetoric and band-aid solutions.},

   alternative for implementation in other edu-cational institutions, this
   proposal has a descriptive and explanatory scope aimed at fostering a
   broader understanding of peace education in Colombia, moving beyond a
   mere curricular imposition. In line with this objective, the Peace
   Observatory emerges as a tool to catalyze stu-dents' research interests,
   engaging them in an exercise where subjects discover themselves
   con-tinuously ``philosophizing{''} and give a preponderant role to
   truth, reason, and healthy skepticism as elements that contribute to the
   promotion of well-being in Colombian schools.},

Abstract = {Migration as such is currently an evolutionary phenomenon, which is most
   pronounced in recent decades. Political, security and socio-economic
   aspects are one of the causes of migration. The reason is also climate
   change and therefore it can be ranked among the current challenges of
   civilization. The issue of migration became known after the outbreak of
   the migration crisis in 2015. Currently, after the outbreak of the war
   in Ukraine, it has again become known to the public as well as the
   academic community. Following Russia's attack on Ukraine, EU member
   states began to face a new wave of migration. The onslaught on the
   borders is visible in Slovakia, and for this reason the country had to
   adapt legislation in this area. The aim of the article is to examine the
   impact of the Ukrainian crisis on Slovakia's migration and asylum policy
   as a result of changes at the European level after the outbreak of the
   military conflict in Ukraine. By analyzing documents, we examine changes
   in the legislative migration and asylum policy of Slovakia. Through
   qualitative research using the empirical-analytical method, it
   identifies the shortcomings of Slovakia's migration and asylum policy,
   which appeared after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {111},
Number = {3},
Pages = {41-73},
Abstract = {The article examines the nature of the uncertainty impact on the
   formation and implementation of national security policy. The
   multiplication of uncertainties and complication of the system of social
   relations prompt a transformation of conceptual approaches to the
   identification of the national security basic features and the
   organization of key processes in this area. It has been proven that the
   development of the concepts of uncertainty and resilience prompts a
   reconceptualization of the national security. This process is currently
   taking place. The implementation of new approaches to ensuring national
   security contributed to the initiation of a paradigm shift in national
   security policy. Management of uncertainty allows for reducing its
   influence on national security policy-making. The development of science
   and increasing the level of public trust in scientific information,
   which is taken as a basis for shaping political decisions, are of great
   importance for this.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the jurist Hans Kelsen conceptualized the
   notion of << world state >> in the 1940s. The main argument is that
   Kelsen drew in his reflections on world state not only on his precedent
   iterations in legal theory, but also on mid-century visions for world
   state and global constitution that he encountered in the United States,
   where he emigrated to escape persecution in his native Austria. The
   article advances the claim that these American debates on world state
   are an impor-tant - yet hitherto ignored - intellectual context for
   understanding Kelsen's political thought. Kelsen's interpretation of the
   idea of << world state >> as a foundation for a new political world
   order, offers a valuable lens through which to analyse spatial and
   political notions of the << global >> and << globality >> in the history
   of twentieth century political thought.},

Title = {AGONISTIC PLURALISM AND COMPETITIVE MODEL OF DEMOCRACY: PROBLEMS OF
   NORMATIVE JUSTIFICATION},

   OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {108},

Pages = {6-24},
Abstract = {The article is devoted to the analysis of the main tenets of the theory
   of competitive democracy and its underlying principle of agonistic
   pluralism, which have become quite widespread among the Western
   political philosophers in the recent years. The author identifies two
   main approaches to the normative substantiation of the value of
   democratic competition. The first approach is based on the postulate
   about the importance of maintain-ing the diversity of public discourses
   and, therefore, inadmissibility of giving one of them the status of
   dominant or preferred. The second approach em-phasizes the importance of
   constantly challenging the established power rela-tions. Having
   demonstrated serious flaws in these approaches, one of which, in fact,
   promotes diversity for the sake of diversity, and the other -
   variability for the sake of variability, the author turns to the
   strategy of justifying com-petitive democracy that focuses on providing
   all stakeholders with an equal op-portunity to change the existing power
   relations. In his estimation, this strate-gy, which largely overcomes
   the shortcomings of the above mentioned ap-proaches, also has its
   weaknesses related to (1) the difficulty of disentangling between
   unequal opportunities for transforming power mechanisms and other social
   inequalities, (2) the unattainability of the complete equality of
   opportu-nities, and (3) the ambiguous relationship between the value of
   the opportuni-ty to define and abolish social restrictions (political
   equality) and other values (in particular, the so-called intrinsic
   equality). A special attention in the article is paid to the
   identification of the deep value foundations of agonistic plural-ism.
   The author notices that advocates of agonism want to evade clarification
   of these foundations and states that agonistic pluralism as the highest
   moral basis of politics is highly doubtful, while the part of the
   concept that is accept-able does not represent anything fundamentally
   new. According to his con-clusion, all this speaks of the purely
   instrumental nature of this principle, and thus of its relative
   importance in comparison with those ideals that it intends to achieve.},

   and functional determinants of the professional Ed deformation in the
   penitentiary staff. The importance of legal and moral awareness for the
   performance of operational and Mria service activities, correction and
   resocialization of convicts is substantiated. It has been proved that a
   professionally deformed employee knows the legal and moral norms, but
   complies with them R etatsesvus ubjectively and arbitrarily and
   justifies his actions with various circumstances related to the
   lddeientu DrHumberto specifics of the psychology and behavior of
   convicts. The methodological hiiloomr basis of the research is presented
   as comparative-legal and systematic analysis, formal-legal method,
   method of interpretation, hermeneutic method, as well as methods of
   analysis and synthesis. The conclusions identify socio-psychological
   measures aimed at the prevention of professional deformation of prison
   staff, among which are: improvement of the system of training, education
   and professional development; formation and maintenance of a sense of
   security, confidence in the usefulness and fairness of work. In

Abstract = {Since the end of the Cold War the relations between South Korea and
   Japan have developed in a non-linear manner. The most recent period is
   no exception. Following the cooling, witnessed since 2017, there has
   been a warming between the two countries, largely due to a qualitative
   change in Seoul's policy towards Tokyo when Yoon Suk Yeol's
   administration came to power in May 2022. The advances in the DPRK's
   nuclear missile program as well as China's assertive military policy
   began to push South Korea towards closer security cooperation with
   Japan. The internal political dynamics in the Republic of Korea,
   including the growth of anti-Chinese sentiment, the disappointment with
   the `soft' policy towards the DPRK pursued by the previous `progressive'
   administration, as well as the personal ambitions of the new president
   contributed to the warming of relations with Japan. Washington's
   activity also played a role, as it tried to `reconcile' its allies and
   intensify their military and political cooperation within the US - Japan
   - South Korea triangle. Analyzing the series of summits held in 2023
   between the leaders of the Republic of Korea and Japan, the author comes
   to conclusion that the two states put their historical grievances aside
   and gave priority to establishing close bilateral and trilateral
   (including the United States) cooperation, primarily in the fields of
   international politics and security. For the first time since the end of
   the Cold War, Japan and South Korea began to actively strengthen their
   military and political ties, not only on the anti-North Korean, but also
   on the anti-Chinese and the anti-Russian basis.},

Abstract = {The article aims to analyse the existing approaches to determining the
   impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war on European security and the
   scenarios of further involvement of Ukraine's partners from both sides
   of the Atlantic in its protection. The most tangible consequences of the
   war for the European security environment are highlighted. Specific
   attention is paid to the debatable issues, such as approaches to how
   Ukraine can win, factors that prevent larger military aid from the West
   to Kyiv, threats stemming from an incomplete understanding by some
   Western leaders of Moscow's goals in the war. The study is centred on a
   critical analysis of publications on this topic in authoritative
   journals on international relations, statistical data on the aid of the
   states of the collective West to Kyiv, and the results of public opinion
   polls on the continuation of support for Ukraine's struggle in European
   states and the United States.},

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {This article examines the diplomatic relations between Czechoslovakia
   and the Zionist movement during the late 1940s in regard to
   Czechoslovakia's contribution to the establishment of the State of
   Israel in May 1948. The support provided by Czechoslovakia, both
   diplomatically and militarily, played a pivotal role in the formation of
   an independent Jewish state. Notably, this assistance continued even
   after Czechoslovakia underwent a political regime change following the
   communist coup d'\& eacute;tat in February 194 8. The article aims to
   unravel the reasons behind this exceptional cooperation between two
   seemingly distant actors, both geographically and ideologically. Drawing
   upon recently disclosed archival collections from the relevant Czech
   archives and providing the insight to the foreign policy of a Soviet
   satellite, this research aligns with the historiographic paradigm known
   as the New Cold War History . By focusing on the contributions of
   satellite states to Cold War history, it sheds light on Czechoslovakia's
   significant role in shaping the geopolitical landscape of the Middle
   East in late 1940s. Even though it might have been a somewhat
   marginalized story in the later decades of the Cold War due to the
   affiliation of the two countries with opposite ideological blocs, the
   history of Czechoslovakia's contribution to the creation of the State of
   Israel is now recognized as one of the significant narratives in the
   mutual relations between the two states, demonstrating the importance of
   past -present linkages.},

Abstract = {Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861) is the Ukrainian national poet par
   excellence. He is both a romantic and a realist. With his poetry, he
   made a fundamental contribution to Ukrainian nation building, but also
   contributed a chapter to the social history of Tsarist Russia. Anyone
   who wants to read him in German will run up against obstacles. His prose
   and diaries are not available, much of his poetry exists only in old
   translations by communist cultural functionaries, such as Alfred Kurella
   and Erich Weinert. Yet Shevchenko has something to tell us: about the
   relationship between the imperial centre and the periphery, autocracy
   and justice, repression and freedom. A new translation of Shevchenko's
   work should be the first step in rediscovering the classic. And then
   read, starting with the lesson on Curiosity, from the chapter Crossing
   Borders.},

Title = {Inaccurate Politicians: Elected Representatives' Estimations of Public

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Month = {2023 JAN 1},
Abstract = {Knowledge of what voters prefer is central to several theories of
   democratic representation and accountability. Despite this, we know
   little in a comparative sense of how well politicians know citizens'
   policy preferences. We present results from a study of 866 politicians
   in four countries. Politicians were asked to estimate the percentage of
   public support for various policy proposals. Comparing more than 10,000
   estimations with actual levels of public support, we conclude that
   politicians are quite inaccurate estimators of people's preferences.
   They make large errors and even regularly misperceive what a majority of
   the voters wants. Politicians are hardly better at estimating public
   preferences than ordinary citizens. They misperceive not only the
   preferences of the general public but also the preferences of their own
   partisan electorate. Politicians are not the experts of public opinion
   we expect them to be.},

Abstract = {The role of the village headman and council of elders is very important
   in many societies. The focus of this article is to analyse the evolution
   and the role of the (informal) intermediary institutions and actors in
   the context of changing society's patterns and political landscape
   transformations. This article focuses on Albania and Kosovo, where
   village self-governing mechanisms played a crucial role in avoiding
   (often deadly) social conflicts during the post-communism transition.
   The article relies on in-depth interviews with involved actors at the
   local level, using the framework of evolutionary governance theory. The
   study shows that the role of the council of elders and village headman
   has been strong and important in times of weak central and local
   governance, while it weakened in times of strong politicization and
   increasingly patronizing role of the central government, thus not
   allowing for a right balance between legitimate community representation
   and accountability toward upper levels of governance.},

Abstract = {This article highlights a new way in which descriptive representation
   enhances democracy through inclusive party building. We theorize that
   parties retain and promote incumbents based on gendered criteria,
   disproportionately incentivizing women to recruit party members.
   However, gendered resource inequalities lower women's access to the
   patronage required for recruitment. Women respond by recruiting more
   women members, as it lowers recruitment costs, is role-congruent, and
   eases credit claiming. Using rich administrative data on party
   membership from 2004 to 2020 and a regression discontinuity design in
   Brazil, we find that, despite resource disparities, women mayors recruit
   new members at similar rates as men but reduce the gender gap in party
   membership. As expected, women are more likely to be promoted in
   constituencies where they most lower the gender gap in party membership.
   We also find that women's increased membership improves party
   resilience. Our findings suggest that descriptive representation
   strengthens party building by including underrepresented citizens.},

Abstract = {The paper aims to discuss the rarely acknowledged conceptual affinities
   between legal-political thinking of Carl Schmitt and Karl Loewenstein.
   It may sound surprising given their different political leanings, as
   well as the concept of democracy inherent in the legal and political
   thought of the two thinkers, especially in their constitutional
   theories. For Schmitt democracy signifies identity between the rulers
   and the ruled, while for Loewenstein it is the very will of the people
   that has to be checked and tamed through the institution of
   representation. But when it comes to the defence of the existing
   political regime against the assault of its enemies and the
   understanding of the reasons of Weimar Republic's failure, they strongly
   agree. Schmitt identified and elaborated on the possibility of the
   Weimar Republic's enemies entering through the gate of legality and
   shutting its doors behind them. Loewenstein clearly sides with Schmitt
   that defending the constitution means defending its core or substance.
   The concept of militant democracy bears striking similarities with the
   conceptual world of Carl Schmitt: critique of the legalistic blindness,
   rejection of neutrality in public life, friend-enemy distinctions,
   legitimacy versus legality and the state of emergency.},

Abstract = {Populist parties are held to be the drivers of unprecedented
   emotionalisation in electoral politics. Advancing theories of
   realignment and detachment, this article studies the temporal
   development in the affective alignments between voters and parties. In
   particular, it analyses the relationship between social structure,
   voters' affective orientations towards political parties, and vote
   choice over time by drawing on 625 representative population surveys
   from Germany over 44 years. The results show that voters' affective
   orientations are indeed becoming more important to vote choice. However,
   this reflects a return to the close link that already existed at the
   heyday of the original cleavages rather than something novel. What seems
   to have changed is the degree to which affective orientations are rooted
   in social structure. This not only qualifies overly myopic
   interpretations of populist success but has more general implications
   for the contemporary linkages between parties and voters.},

Abstract = {Insufficient scholarly attention has been given to how UN human rights
   treaty bodies can induce states to implement concluding observations
   (COBs). This is because previous studies tend to underestimate the
   treaty bodies as weak, and instead focus on domestic factors. A case
   study of the Japanese implementation of treaty bodies' COBs, however,
   reveals that domestic mobilization does not always succeed in changing
   government policies because of Japanese authorities' inadequate
   understanding of international human rights law in areas such as gender
   equality and the prohibition of hate speech. Exploring treaty bodies'
   role in inducing such states' implementation of COBs is therefore
   crucial. To tackle this, this paper applies the theory of Goodman and
   Jinks, and reveals that the treaty bodies' design is aimed primarily at
   persuading rather than acculturating states. If acculturation is
   incorporated into their design, it follows that treaty bodies should
   coordinate with the Human Rights Council, and that the Human Rights
   Council should follow up COBs in the Universal Periodic Review (UPR).
   Because `enforcement' of COBs by the UPR could undermine treaty bodies'
   work, this paper suggests a modest solution: that the UPR should cover
   the concerns expressed in COBs.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the Comparative Conspiracy Research Survey
   (CCRS) dataset, an individual-level cross-sectional dataset on
   conspiracy beliefs in eight countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada,
   Germany, Lebanon, Morocco, South Africa, and the USA. The dataset
   contains general conspiracy belief scales, as well as country specific
   data on dominant conspiracy theories. In addition, the questionnaire
   contains validated scales of social trust, populist attitudes,
   authoritarianism, self-esteem as well as items measuring political
   interest, ideology, and socioeconomic class. In this research note, we
   present the methodology of the survey and provide an example of how
   researchers can use the dataset. This example tackles the difference in
   the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and activism intentions
   across countries. We highlight that activism is related to conspiracy
   beliefs in consolidated democracies, but not necessarily in developing
   democracies or more authoritarian regimes. Lastly, we conclude by laying
   out several possibilities for research using the CCRS dataset.},

Abstract = {Free movement is simultaneously widely acclaimed and strongly contested
   in the European Union. To address this apparent contradiction, we unpack
   European Union freedom of movement into its different transnational
   rights and argue that opposition is unequal across entitlements. Using
   evidence from a unique survey conducted in the United Kingdom in 2017,
   we show that citizens mainly contest welfare access. This transnational
   right implies costs for the host country and taps into perceptions of
   belonging and deservingness. Due to its association with ideas of
   national community and solidarity, access to welfare is more contested
   even among those who, in principle, should be favourable to such
   entitlements: inclusive national identifiers and European integration
   supporters. Our findings underscore the challenge of creating a sense of
   European community that could underpin all transnational rights implied
   by the Union's principle of freedom of movement.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to examine the associations between
   levels of population density and the transmission of COVID-19 in
   Indonesia. Descriptive analysis is employed to determine the data
   distribution of the response variable (dependent variable Y) as well as
   the independent variables X-1 and X-2. Therefore, inferential analysis
   is a quantitative technique that involves examining a sample in order to
   draw conclusions about a larger population. The present investigation
   has revealed a statistically significant positive connection (r = 0.954)
   between the incidence of COVID-19 patients and population density in
   Indonesia. The Model Summary provides the R value (Correlation
   Coefficient) of 0.959, indicating a strong positive correlation between
   the variables. Additionally, the multiple correlation coefficient r
   (Multiple R) is 0.920, which represents the determination index or the
   proportion of the influence of X on Y. Therefore, it can be asserted
   that 92\% of COVID-19 cases are driven by population density and the
   number of individuals experiencing employment terminations, whilst the
   remaining 8\% is affected by additional factors. The regression equation
   can be constructed from the Coefficients table in the following manner:
   The equation can be expressed as Y = 5327.46 + 84.174X(1) - 0.170X(2).
   The calculation of the Standard Error of the Estimate (SE) yields a
   value of 8151.076 or 8151. The standardized coefficient (Beta) of 1.381
   represents the extent of association between the number of COVID-19
   infection cases and population density},

Abstract = {This article puts two concurrent developments in the Mediterranean
   region in conversation with one another. First, the victory of the
   neofascist Fratelli d'Italia in Italy's 2022 general election has led to
   fears that the EU's and NATO's leading Mediterranean member state might
   begin gravitating toward authoritarian global powers like Russia and
   China. Second, the January 2024 expansion of BRICS saw the leaders of
   Russia, China, and the bloc's other states invite six new countries to
   join, including the organization's first member state on the
   Mediterranean Sea, Egypt. In analyzing these two events side by side,
   this article suggests that the Mediterranean is likely to see increasing
   geopolitical competition between liberal-democratic alliances (like the
   EU and NATO) and partnerships steered by illiberal global powers (like
   BRICS+ and the BRI).},

Abstract = {Investigating the relationship between Islamic religiosity and electoral
   participation amongst Muslim citizens in Western Europe, this study
   combines insights from the sociology of religion and Islamic studies
   with political behavior literature thus creating an improved theoretical
   framework and a richer empirical understanding surrounding the electoral
   participation of religious minorities. First, we theorize about three
   underlying dimensions of Islamic religiosity: frequency of mosque
   attendance, religious identification, and frequency of prayer.
   Subsequently, we consider how the religiosity-voting relationship is
   bolstered or hindered by hostile national environments such as more
   exclusionary policies and practices (e.g., veil banning or exclusionary
   citizenship laws).Empirically, we use a unique dataset that harmonizes
   five European surveys, resulting in a sample size of just under 8,000
   European Muslims. Using multi-level techniques, we find, contrary to
   research on majority religiosity, that communal religiosity is unrelated
   to electoral participation. However, individual religiosity bolsters
   voting in particular among the second generation. Opposite to our
   expectation, we find that hostile environments do not seem to lead to
   different impacts of Islamic religiosity within Western Europe. Our
   results support the taking of a more fine-grained approach when
   measuring religiosity and also highlight how the impact varies across
   genders and generations.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that critical junctures - defined as sudden
   turning points in the historic trajectory of countries, institutions,
   and other units of analysis - provide a propitious lens to teach the war
   in Ukraine. By analyzing the influence of this war on energy security in
   Europe and the world, its impact on public opinion on NATO membership in
   nonaligned countries, or the war's potential to change great power
   politics, to name a few examples, students of political science can
   determine themselves, if the war amounts to a critical juncture. In
   doing so, they not only learn how to apply a rather complex theory to a
   real-world scenario, they also learn how the discipline of political
   science operates.},

Title = {Understanding public attitudes during Covid-19 in France with Polanyi
   and Gramsci: a political economy of an epidemiological and economic
   disaster},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {22},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {How ready were governments and the public to sacrifice thousands of
   lives to avoid economic collapse during the pandemic? We designed a
   trade-off scale measuring whether the French population is more
   concerned with the health or economic consequences of the pandemic and
   administered it eight times from April 2020 to April 2021. We find that
   concern for the economy was correlated with a preference for the
   application of a free-market logic, and that it grew swiftly over time
   and uniformly across the population despite the unprecedented
   epidemiological circumstances. Absolute differences in concerns
   correlated with material factors after the first lockdown, and with
   self-perceived risk of Covid-19 infection and especially political
   orientation consistently over the year. Respondents who were old,
   wealthy, highly educated, at low risk of infection, and on the political
   right were more concerned for the economy than their counterparts. Older
   respondents' strong adherence to the free-market logic seems to explain
   why economic concerns were more important among the group with the
   highest mortality rate. When political stance is interacted with
   material factors, marked divisions emerge among the wealthy, the highly
   educated, and especially the young depending on their political
   orientation from left to right. We employ insights from Polanyi and
   Gramsci to interpret these divisions as the potential build-up of a
   `double movement' around the predominance of the free-market logic in
   the public's `common sense'.},

Title = {The Lure of Technocrats: A Conjoint Experiment on Preferences for
   Technocratic Ministers in Six European Countries},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to gauge public support for ministers who
   did not follow a typical ``career politician{''} pathway prior to their
   nomination (i.e., those who never held an elected office and are not
   affiliated to a political party) and to understand what drives this
   support. We use a web-based conjoint experiment fielded in six European
   countries, in which respondents are presented with pairs of vignettes
   describing the profile of hypothetical ministers and must state which of
   the two candidates they would personally prefer. The task is repeated
   five times, once for the Prime Minister office and once for four
   specialized minister positions. We find that attributes associated with
   technocratic government almost always increase popular support for
   ministers. These preferences are stable across policy domains and are as
   prevalent in the case of the PM as in the case of specialized
   ministries. However, we identify substantial cross-country variations:
   pro-technocratic attitudes are more prevalent in Italy, Poland and Spain
   than in the UK and Germany.},

Abstract = {Recent polling shows significant levels of radical partisanship among
   the US public in the form of violent partisan schadenfreude and violent
   partisan attitudes. Previous research shows that the partisan intensity
   underlying these sentiments increases around presidential elections and
   when political actors use violent rhetoric. Has lethal mass partisanship
   declined in the years after the 2020 election, especially now that one
   of the main purveyors of violent rhetoric has left office? This paper
   uses panel data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) to show how
   levels of radical partisanship have changed from the post-election
   period of 2020 to the same time period in 2021 and 2022. The results
   demonstrate that rates of violent partisan attitudes have declined in
   2021 and 2022 compared to 2020, especially amongst those who were most
   supportive of former President Donald Trump. However, changes in
   partisan schadenfreude have no discernable pattern. The results
   demonstrate both that radical partisanship is not on a uniformly upward
   trajectory but likely decreases and increases with changes in political
   context, and that elements of radical partisanship do not vary in
   parallel.},

Abstract = {What explains divergent transitional justice preferences among political
   elites after genocide? We argue that elite preferences vary with their
   proximity to the victimized group. Individuals who know the victims
   personally and/or have witnessed violence against them may be more
   likely to support punishing the perpetrators, possibly because they
   experience collective guilt. We support this argument using an original
   biographical dataset on the members of the West German parliament,
   linking their location and experiences during the Third Reich to free
   roll-call votes on extending the statute of limitations for murder in
   1965-69. We find that proximity to synagogues, particularly those
   attacked in November 1938, predicts support for extending the statute,
   conditional on party, state, mandate type, denomination, and a host of
   personal attributes. We also find significantly lower support for
   extending the statute among former NSDAP members. Our findings highlight
   the importance of bystander experiences in shaping support for
   retributive justice.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the study of electoral volatility in
   two-round majority elections by examining the 2014 and 2020 municipal
   elections in Montpellier (France). Our article estimates electoral
   volatility using ecological inference from aggregated electoral and
   census data collected at the polling station level. First, this study
   underlines that vote shifts are mainly intra-bloc volatility. Moreover,
   our results also show that electoral volatility-particularly
   remobilization and intra-bloc volatility-is more frequent within polling
   stations with politically interested categories and young people.
   Furthermore, this study suggests that social context is an essential
   determinant of volatility.},

   high priority to increasing the growth rate. But does past experience
   suggest this is a sensible strategy? The historical evidence does not
   support the idea that this is a winning stance, and it places reliance
   on a concept which is both deeply problematic as measure of economic
   well-being and little understood by the public.},

Abstract = {Decades of research indicate that most Census-measured US racial and
   ethnic minorities are disproportionately impacted by environmental
   disamenities, all else equal; the study of this is referred to as
   Environmental Justice (EJ) research. Yet both US and world history show
   that another minority group is religious minorities. If so, this has
   health consequences and policy implications. Houses of worship (HOWs)
   are visible and physical symbols of religion. We use tax records to
   locate Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist or Hindu HOWs within census tracts
   for the entire contiguous United States. We combine these data with
   EJSCREEN data to analyze whether air pollution risks are greater in
   their presence. We find that, even holding constant race, ethnicity, and
   poverty, two non-census-measured religious minorities' HOWs are
   disproportionately impacted by air pollution in the United States: Jews
   and Muslims. This new knowledge has consequences for EJ policy and
   social justice-motivated environmental research.},

Abstract = {How did Scottish universities fare in the pandemic? This paper looks at
   changes in income and student enrolments, comparing the pandemic years
   (2020-2022) to those preceding them. Despite concerns that Covid would
   have negative impacts across the university sector, the analysis shows
   that both income and student numbers increased substantially in
   Scotland. This article builds on a related analysis (Armstrong 2023) and
   focuses on a selection of ten universities that encompass the diverse
   range of sizes, locations and student cohorts making up the Scottish
   university sector. It finds that growth in income, against expectation,
   accelerated during Covid, and this is largely attributable to expanded
   recruitment of international students, who pay significantly higher fees
   than those located within the UK. Scottish universities made a record
   amount of income from international fees in 2021-22 of 1.14 pound
   billion. The analysis of income growth is followed by exploration of
   changes in student numbers and cohort compositions, where international
   student numbers also accelerated in the pandemic. A discussion of the
   implications of these changes considers the growing divide among
   Scottish universities, and the wider implications that rapid growth and
   increasing dependence on one source of income has for universities,
   their staff and students and the cities and towns in which they are
   located.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the position of persons with granted international
   protection (recognized refugees) with reference to the experience of
   their employment or the acquisition of economic security. Economic
   security and independence are the prerequisite and foundation for
   successful integration of recognized refugees into society.
   Nevertheless, despite the possibilities foreseen by law, scarce
   employment and insufficient economic security of persons with granted
   international protection are among the key problems regarding their
   integration. This article consists of an overview of relevant literature
   in the field of refugee employment, a case study of the integration
   program of a non-governmental organization, and recommendations
   regarding the improvement of the refugee employment policy, as well as a
   contribution to the debate on the adoption of immigration policy with an
   emphasis on socioeconomic rights and opportunities for quality
   integration of refugees and migrants.},

Abstract = {Why is support the radical right higher in some geographic locations
   than others? This article argues that what is frequently classified as
   the ``rural{''} bases of radical-right support in previous research is
   in part the result of something different: communities that were in the
   historical ``periphery{''} in the center-periphery conflicts of modern
   nation-state formation. Inspired by a classic state-building literature
   that emphasizes the prevalence of a ``wealth of tongues{''}-or
   nonstandard linguistic dialects in a region-as a definition of the
   periphery, we use data from more than 725,000 geo-coded responses in a
   linguistic survey in Germany to show that voters from historically
   peripheral geographic communities are more likely to vote for the
   radical right today.},

Abstract = {To what extent are appeals to pro-white sentiment effective in American
   politics? Does it matter if such appeals are implicit or explicit? We
   investigate the degree to which white Americans are less likely to vote
   for candidates that use explicit appeals to white identity than they are
   to those who use more implicit appeals to white identity or to out-group
   animus. In doing so, we provide a crucial supplement to recent work on
   this topic, which finds that the implicit/explicit model is becoming
   less relevant for whites, as well as to research on the increased
   relevance of white in-group attitudes for white voter behavior. To
   examine the effect of such white identity appeals, we conduct a survey
   experiment with a national sample of 2746 white Americans. We find that
   respondents accept both explicit and implicit white identity appeals at
   the same rate as out-group appeal. Additionally, we see evidence that
   those who identify strongly as white are more likely to support
   candidates who engage in racial messaging. Our findings have broad
   implications for our evolving understanding of racial appeals in
   American politics, as well as the role of white identity in contemporary
   political discourse.},

Abstract = {Political philosophers and theorists make arguments about high-stakes
   problems. This article shows that those theories would be more credible
   if political philosophers ensured their work was robust: capable of
   withstanding reasonable changes to their assumptions and to the cases to
   which their arguments apply. The world is varied and inconstant. As a
   result, scientists and social scientists recognize the virtue of
   robustness. This article shows why political philosophers should also do
   so. It defines robustness, demonstrates its value, and shows how it can
   be evaluated. Illustrating the stakes of robustness, the article
   assesses prominent arguments concerning multiculturalism and open
   borders. Avoiding misunderstanding and confusion should be a central aim
   of political philosophy. To sidestep these outcomes and to reassure
   scholars that one's theory is not subject to concerns about its
   credibility, it will often be reasonable for philosophers to explicitly
   test their theories for robustness.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Abstract = {In Western democracies, like the United States, the United Kingdom, and
   Germany, the number of ethnic minority representatives has been steadily
   increasing. How is this trend shaping electoral behavior? Past work has
   focused on the effects of minority representation on ethnic minorities'
   political engagement, with less attention to the electoral behavior of
   majority-group members. We argue that increased minorities'
   representation can be experienced as a threat to a historically
   white-dominant political context. This, in turn, politically activates
   white constituents. Using data from four U.K. general elections and a
   regression discontinuity design, we find that the next election's
   turnout in constituencies narrowly won by an ethnic minority candidate
   is 4.3 percentage points larger than in constituencies narrowly won by a
   white candidate. Consistent with our argument, this turnout difference
   is driven by majority-white constituencies. Our findings have
   implications for intergroup relations and party politics and help
   explain recent political dynamics.},

Abstract = {In a large nationally representative study in the United States, we
   provide novel evidence that the greater pool of candidates who run for
   political office are higher in narcissism. Prior research has found that
   those who would like run for office, but don't actually run, are higher
   in grandiose narcissism. Here, using the SINS measure of narcissism,
   which asks respondents if they are a narcissist, we find that
   narcissistic individuals have greater expressive political ambition and
   are more likely than others to not only be interested in political
   office, but to actually run for political office.},

Abstract = {The Indo-Pacific has rapidly become the world's geopolitical and
   geo-economic epicentre. Consequently, much scholarly attention has been
   focused on Sino-United States superpower competition and on the policies
   of the region's great and middle powers. However, since Europe has
   engaged late with the Indo-Pacific, its policies remain under-examined.
   This Special Issue fills a lacuna in our knowledge through a dedicated
   appraisal of German, British, Italian, and European Union approaches to
   the Indo-Pacific. This introductory article provides an analytical
   survey of the impetus for Europe's new awareness of the Indo-Pacific's
   importance. It then sheds light on the European approach based on a
   tripartite framework comprising economy, security, and norms, which is
   adopted by all the articles in this Special Issue to draw out
   comparative insights. This research thus contributes to the literature
   on both European and Indo-Pacific strategic landscapes by examining an
   understudied development under a novel joint assessment.},

Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},

Volume = {48},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article discusses automation from the point of view of the
   intersection between Aristotle and Marx. First, it was Aristotle's
   notion of automatous - self-moving tools - that gave rise to the
   contemporary concept of automation. Marx's historical materialism is
   important as it puts the ongoing process of automation into a historical
   perspective. The development of self-moving machines should free us from
   the slavery of hard work, yet the legal and political superstructure of
   capitalism means that the growth of automation produces new forms of
   precarious wage-slavery. Alasdair MacIntyre's Aristotelian notion of
   practice is discussed vis-a-vis the Marxian notion of alienated labour.
   Given the conceptual structure - alienated labour (which prevents us
   from flourishing) versus non-alienated labour (as essential for human
   flourishing) - the article poses the question of whether we can apply
   this in our attempt to assess the ongoing process of automation.},

Abstract = {Across Western European democracies, the last 20 years have seen a
   growth of precarious employment and the rise of challenger parties. Both
   trends are especially marked in Italy, where occupational insecurity has
   become the norm and over half of the electorate has turned to a
   challenger party. In this article, I investigate the relationship
   between these two phenomena, addressing the question of whether and how
   precarity in the labor market influenced vote choice in the 2018 general
   election. First, I provide descriptive evidence that the Italian labor
   market shifted from dualism to generalized precarization. Second, I
   empirically investigate the relationship between precarity and voting in
   this context. The results show that the perception of precarity, not
   formal employment status, influenced voting behavior: it fostered
   participation, increased support for the Five Star Movement, and
   decreased support for the Democratic Party. These findings challenge
   core assumptions in the literature, first and foremost about precarious
   workers' low turnout rate, difficult mobilization, and consequent
   political irrelevance. They indicate that the electoral weight of
   precarious workers has increased, and their representation can be
   electorally beneficial.},

Abstract = {The emergence of ChatGPT and its ability to imitate student work has
   precipitated a crisis in education. Responses range from practical
   efforts to detect or prevent ChatGPT use to existential reflection about
   learning and assessment. However, the crisis is also epistemological,
   with educators struggling to determine what students know and fearing
   that student knowledge is diminishing. The educational philosophies of
   Socrates, Dewey, and Freire suggest that recognition of ignorance of
   different kinds (inquisitive, predictive, and practical) on the part of
   educators is uncomfortable but essential for improving the aims and
   methods of education. In this way, ChatGPT and the philosophy of
   education can be mutually illuminating.},

Abstract = {Climate policy is mostly ruled by national governments, which in
   multi-level systems creates tensions with sub-national tiers. Recent
   research has suggested that political parties' climate policy
   preferences and their stances on decentralisation are associated as
   pro-peripheral parties tend to assume the role of climate pioneers not
   solely due to environmental concerns, but also as a means to challenge
   the central authority of the state. In this research, we analyse whether
   the salience of climate change in the manifestos of parties competing in
   the 2017 and 2021 Catalan regional elections varies between them and if
   these differences are associated with the aforementioned cleavage. Our
   empirical findings reveal that the prominence given to climate change in
   the manifestos of the parties studied tends to be higher the more
   pro-periphery the positions of parties are, and the more salient
   decentralisation and independence.},

Abstract = {Human rights NGOs contribute to the formation of norms and policies
   around penality, and inform social understandings of what constitutes
   acceptable punishment. This article turns to the symbolic group-making
   work of human rights workers as agents who work with prisoners, and who
   also construct the image of the prisoner for the rest of society. I zoom
   in on the case of prison NGO work in Russia, a non-democratic country,
   and answer two questions: first, how do prison NGOs construct the image
   of the prisoner, and articulate their relationship with their social
   base and their networks of civic engagement? Second, what organizational
   behaviors do these articulations encourage? Drawing on 18
   semi-structured interviews and observation at prison NGOs based in
   Moscow, the study shows that Russian NGO workers often view themselves
   and act as members of a middle class social movement in Russia. While
   NGOs tend to focus on the most economically disadvantaged and socially
   isolated groups in their work, the prisoners they depict when addressing
   the public and the press tend to represent more educated groups with
   higher levels of symbolic capital (political prisoners, those convicted
   of economic crimes, and former state employees), reflecting a desire to
   put prison on the middle class agenda. At the same time, prison NGO
   employees employ a class lens in their work with prisoners, and
   determine how to help prisoners based on their assessment of how the
   socio-economic background of the prisoner intersects with ethnicity,
   religion, ability/disability, region where they are serving their
   sentence, and region where they are from. In other words, prison NGO
   workers view prisoners through the resources they can accumulate using
   the simultaneous, intersecting dimensions of their status and their
   relation to other groups both in prison and outside.},

Abstract = {This study shows how the automotive industry was able to influence the
   final legislation of the Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from
   passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles, even though the European
   Commission's introductory comments were supported by a competing
   interest group coalition: environmentalist NGOs. To operationalize and
   analyze the influence of lobbying on the EU policy formulation process,
   I utilize an approach not yet widely used in interest group research:
   discourse network analysis and inferential network analysis with
   exponential random graph models. This methodological combination allows
   me to parse the political debate within different phases of the EU
   policy process to gain insights into how automotive lobbyists were able
   to shape the final legislation in accordance with their interests and
   which political decision-makers empowered them to do so. Surprisingly,
   the party affiliation of Members of the European Parliament played only
   a subordinate role, whereas the origin of the MEPs was a significant
   predic-tor of whether they supported the proposals of environmentalist
   NGOs or the auto -motive industry. The latter's proposals were adopted
   in the European Commission's proposal and subsequently in the final
   regulation. Since the method can be easily applied to case studies from
   different policy areas, it provides a promising frame-work for the
   analysis of EU lobbying in general. Moreover, the network approach is
   easily extendable, allowing future research to integrate different
   strands of EU lob-bying research that go beyond influence analysis.},

Abstract = {Intergovernmental relations (IGR), the interaction among multiple levels
   of government, is an essential factor in implementing public policy in
   federations. Effective collaboration among numerous agencies of
   government is necessary for achieving policy goals. This study
   investigated the IGR framework as an essential factor in implementing
   the National Policy on Primary Education (NPPE) in Lagos State, Nigeria.
   The study was guided by administrative federalism theory and primary
   data were collected using in-depth interviews. This was complemented
   with secondary data from the scholarly literature and official
   publications. Data obtained were content analyzed. Findings from the
   study indicate that intergovernmental relations in Lagos State were
   characterized by a low level of trust between the implementing agencies,
   which undermined the achievement of the primary education policy goals.
   Increased dialogue among officials of the levels of government to
   achieve the buy-in of all implementing agencies would raise the level of
   trust needed for effective collaboration.},

Abstract = {While existing research shows why politicians' social media messages
   spread online, we know comparatively less about the types of individuals
   who see these messages. The current study tests whether Americans'
   exposure to posts from political elites is best explained by their
   partisan allegiance (homophily) or the intensity of their political
   engagement. To test this question, we employ data from a 2020
   Cooperative Election Study module that asks respondents how often they
   encounter social media posts from various political figures. We find
   that both homophily and intensity characterize exposure to elite
   messages: partisans and ideologues not only tend to encounter posts from
   politicians on their own side of the aisle most often, but they also
   encounter posts from politicians on the opposite side more often than do
   independent or moderate respondents. The role of intensity relative to
   homophily is greatest for posts by former President Donald Trump, which
   Democrats were more likely to encounter than Republicans or
   independents.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a bundle of active learning activities for an
   introductory undergraduate course in research methods. In particular,
   the activities aim to help students develop core knowledge and skills
   that provide a foundation for reading and conducting quantitative and
   qualitative research. Active learning is a pedagogical practice with
   well-established benefits such as better student attitudes and improved
   content comprehension and application. I build on this conventional
   wisdom by applying a student-centred evaluation method, demonstrating
   that students perceive active learning as an effective complement to
   traditional lecturing and assignments for learning core methodological
   topics in political science.},

Journal = {GERMAN POLITICS},

Volume = {34},

Abstract = {Conceptually contributing to the literature on culture/identity,
   ontological security, and narrative, this article explores Germany's
   articulation of historical memory in light of Russia's invasion of
   Ukraine. We argue that this is done through (re)interpretation and
   contestation, combing biographical continuity and narrative adjustment.
   Based on an analysis of 107 speeches in the German parliament, we claim
   that German foreign policy discourse is marked by a tension between
   different principles which are rooted in a normative dispute among
   Germans seeking to draw the `right lessons' from the country's history.
   This dispute is exemplified by ongoing German attempts to contextualise
   and situate their own past within the present through political
   narratives.},

Abstract = {Evidence from democracies shows that making laws more egalitarian can
   increase individuals' perceptions that others hold egalitarian views.
   How do citizens in authoritarian regimes that promote women's rights
   perceive public opinion on gender issues? While regime actions and
   narratives could increase perceptions that egalitarian attitudes are
   widespread, the disconnect between policy and public preferences could
   inhibit the expressive power of law to alter perceived norms. Drawing on
   original surveys and qualitative evidence from Morocco, an important
   case of de jure advances in women's rights, I find that Moroccans tend
   to overestimate others' embrace of patriarchal attitudes on gender
   issues. The tendency to misperceive conservatism spans demographic
   categories and is especially pronounced among men. I argue that
   citizens' awareness that policy processes are divorced from electoral
   accountability and the raised salience of conservative opposition during
   reform processes can reinforce perceived conservatism, even as women's
   rights advance.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to understand how subjective perceptions of human
   rights influence the justifiability of terrorism at the individual
   level, net of individual and country-level controls. Utilizing the
   seventh wave of World Values Survey data and 65,668 respondents from 52
   countries, this study finds those who report greater interference in
   their lives from security agents and those who see the country as being
   run more democratically are more likely to find terrorism justified,
   while those who perceive less respect for human rights are less likely
   to do so. The effect of state terror on the justifiability of terrorism
   is moderated by perceived democracy, with those perceiving the country
   as being run more democratically being more likely to find terrorism
   justified when state terror is high.},

   Peruvian society. The attempted censorship of the documentary
   Hugo Blanco, Río Profundo (2019)},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},

Abstract = {This article studies the ways in which a confrontation on the meaning of
   the socio-political past was developed in Peru. It resorts to a debate
   generated around the documentary Hugo Blanco, Rio Profundo (2019) and
   the set of written statements issued by different Peruvian groups in
   favor and against it. The texts were analyzed using
   linguistic-discursive tools provided by critical discourse analysis
   (specifically, transitivity, lexical selection and modality). Two
   arguments are developed. On one hand, we analyze interpretative
   resources used by the civil-military, radical and conservative right
   wing to delegitimize-by linking them with Shining Path and MRTA's
   terrorist actions-what the documentary narrates: the indigenous
   struggles for the takeover of lands led by Hugo Blanco in the 1960s. On
   the other hand, we study discursive mechanisms adopted by the
   artistic-cultural sectors to counteract and denounce the censorship
   request against the documentary (which is defended based on the
   historical veracity-the ethical duty-that it testifies and the
   unquestionable freedom of artistic expression that the documentary
   possesses). These findings allow us to offer a characterization of the
   ``salvation memory{''} and the use made of it by the Peruvian far-right:
   it is authoritarian, victimizing, cynical and stigmatizing. Likewise,
   the response offered by the artistic-cultural sector is characterized as
   one that is located in the ethical turn: a defense of the duty to study
   the past. Thus, an important discursive dispute about the social past
   and the Peruvian cultural memory is revealed.},

Abstract = {This paper assesses the relationship between population density and
   political violence within North and West Africa. We find that while most
   violence currently occurs in rural areas, it also exhibits a classic
   distance-decay effect, commonly occurring near urbanized places.
   Regional differences are evident as Jihadist-led violence is
   increasingly rural in West Africa while urban violence was more common
   in North Africa. Important difference in states with major conflict are
   also present, exemplified by urbanized violence in Nigeria and rural
   violence in Mali. Our findings therefore provide mixed evidence for the
   typical ``urbanization of conflict{''} discourse in the literature.},

Abstract = {This study examines the reaction of foreign manufacturing corporations
   in Russia to the strong sanctions imposed by Western countries on Russia
   in the first months after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine military
   conflict in March 2022. While the majority of Western companies
   announced different types of changes in their operations in Russia, a
   significant share of industrial corporations did not publicly announce
   planned changes in their operations. Notably, less than 17 percent of
   corporations that opened new factories in Russia between 2012 and 2019
   announced self-restrictions of operations or an intention to divest
   their Russian assets.},

Title = {Partisan Motivated Empathy and Policy Attitudes},
Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1701-1723},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A voluminous literature examines whether empathy-the capacity to share
   other people's perspectives and feelings-mitigates prejudice and
   improves intergroup relations. We know less about the impact of empathy
   for policy preferences. We theorize that the effects of empathy on
   policy attitudes are, at times, contingent on partisanship. Social
   identity dynamics and partisan motivations shape the target of a
   person's empathy and their beliefs about a policy's effects. We argue
   that, rather than bringing people together, high levels of empathy can
   accentuate partisan divisions in policy opinions. We test our
   theoretical argument using two surveys implemented in the United States.
   We find that partisanship often moderates the effects of dispositional
   empathy such that the most empathetic partisans are more polarized in
   their policy views. Importantly, there are predictable differences
   across issues. A perspective-taking experiment fails to heighten empathy
   or change policy opinions. Our study demonstrates that empathy has a
   nuanced role in preference formation. We discuss the implications of our
   findings for research on empathy, policy opinions, and political
   behavior.},

Title = {Out of the ivory tower: an explanation of the policy advisory roles of

Abstract = {The relevance and impact of political scientists' professional
   activities outside of universities has become the focus of public
   attention, partly due to growing expectations that research should help
   address society's grand challenges. One type of such activity is policy
   advising. However, little attention has been devoted to understanding
   the extent and type of policy advising activities political scientists
   engage in. This paper addresses this gap by adopting a classification
   that distinguishes four ideal types of policy advisors representing
   differing degrees of engagement. We test this classification by
   calculating a multi-level latent class model to estimate key factors
   explaining the prevalence of each type based on an original dataset
   obtained from a survey of political scientists across 39 European
   countries. Our results challenge the wisdom that political scientists
   are sitting in an ``ivory tower{''}: the vast majority (80\%) of
   political scientists in Europe are active policy advisers, with most of
   them providing not only expert guidance but also normative assessments.},

Abstract = {Presidents can use public speeches for a variety of purposes from
   rallying support for their initiatives to attacking their opponents or
   building societal consensus. Contrary to general expectations regarding
   dual executive systems, this article suggests that presidents in
   semi-presidential regimes can benefit politically and in terms of
   popularity from `statespersonlike' behaviour, and thus, they should
   generally refrain from negative and contentious statements. Examining
   the tone and content of formal speeches and informal messages of Finnish
   and French presidents from 2000 to 2020, the study shows that under
   varying constitutional frameworks and general practical expectations,
   the presidents in both countries by and large employ a
   `statespersonlike' style in their speeches. Presidential speeches
   primarily express a positive tone, and they contain few references to
   other state institutions and economy and other governmental domains.
   Instead, presidents typically seek to portray themselves as guardians of
   national interest, with foreign policy and national unity emphasized in
   the speeches.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {47},
Number = {4},
Pages = {813-839},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {Asylum and labour migration used to be processed along sharply separate
   legal-political tracks, recognising either humanitarian need or
   individual performance, respectively. This binary is losing traction, as
   neoliberal performance criteria and mundane labour needs hold entry in
   the asylum domain. This trend is illustrated along the Spurwechsel
   (track change) in German migration policy. While the preference for
   track change traverses party lines, it is marked by a tension between
   the imperatives of migration control and migrant integration. This
   allows for political variation, the right tending towards the control
   and the left towards the integration horn of the dilemma. Under a
   recently left-dominated government, which is at the same time receptive
   to business calls for more Fachkrafte (skilled labour), the control
   versus integration dilemma has been decisively resolved in favour of
   integration, up to a point that the state's sovereign migration control
   function and the integrity of asylum policy are put at risk.},

Abstract = {Previous scholarship has linked increased representation of women,
   racial/ethnic minorities, the LGB community, and the working class to
   more representative legislative agendas and roll call voting. But it is
   unclear if descriptive representation of historically excluded groups
   also affects policy innovativeness. Borrowing from interdisciplinary
   research, we argue that diverse legislatures are more innovative, so
   long as legislators operate in a quality deliberative environment. We
   measure the descriptive representation of seven different
   underrepresented groups in state legislatures from 1984 to 2016. We find
   that representation of women is a key predictor of innovation,
   operationalized as the tendency for states to adopt new policies early.
   We also find the effect of women is not dependent on critical mass, is
   undermined by high levels of polarization, and helps boost the capacity
   of legislatures to produce unique policy language. Some models are
   suggestive of a relationship between racial/ethnic minority (Black,
   Latinx, Native American) representation and innovation, but the results
   are inconsistent. The study provides insights into how representation of
   women can enhance legislative capacity to innovate in public policy.},

Abstract = {In this article, we discuss the de-reifying role of art and its relation
   with humanity's self-consciousness, as these are captured in Lukacs'
   aesthetic thought and, especially, in his work The Specificity of the
   Aesthetic. Through the discourse on both categories that traverse Lukacs
   oeuvre (totality, reification, imputed consciousness, etc.) and
   exclusively aesthetic categories (typical, particular, catharsis,
   mimesis, etc.), we attempt to give prominence to the way in which Lukacs
   conceives artwork's contribution to the cultivation of humanity's
   self-consciousness.},

   Mobilization},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Month = {2023 JUL 1},
Abstract = {Generations of research have incrementally identified the circumstances
   under which electoral campaigns matter. Direct interpersonal contact
   within local networks is commonly seen as conducive to campaign impact,
   but empirical evidence is scarce because of demanding data requirements.
   We advance the literature by studying the Movimento Cinque Stelle (M5S),
   an important challenger party in Italy, which followed the unusual
   practice of coordinating political activities on a public online
   platform. We web scraped the entire history of the movement's more than
   1,000 local branches with over 200,000 geocoded political activities, to
   study the effect and mechanisms of their no campaign in the 2016
   constitutional referendum. Relying on regression, matching, and
   instrumental variable models, we demonstrate that local M5S mobilization
   had substantial campaign effects. Our results have important
   implications, as they highlight the effectiveness of locally rooted
   campaigns and the particular potency of place-based political
   mobilization.},

Abstract = {The article is in the field of studies on parliamentary elections. The
   object of analysis is a chance in the rules for presenting candidatures
   for the House between 2018 and 2022, when electoral coalitions were
   replaced by Party Federations. The objective is to compare the results
   by party and region of the country to identify differences in electoral
   performance based on the percentage of success in the two campaigns.
   Electoral coalitions existed in the previous two decades, were valid
   only for the campaigns and presented programmatic and ideological
   variation, in addition to favoring party fragmentation. Federations are
   permanent organizations that organize elected representatives with
   ideological consistency. The comparison between the two elections shows
   a maintenance of the parties with better electoral success, continuity
   of distances between large and small parties in the Federation and
   reduction in the number of parties that presented candidates and that
   elect representatives in 2022 compared to 2018.},

Abstract = {Law 100 of 1993, which established the Comprehensive Social Security
   System, has been cited as one of the primary causes behind the current
   crisis in Colombia's health system. Consequently, there is a pressing
   need to propose a reform that addresses the issues presented by existing
   regulations. This document aims to synthesize public discussions
   surrounding Law 100 and presents an analysis of the causes of the health
   crisis. The components of this crisis were identified through an
   investigation into citizen perceptions of the health system in Usme and
   Kennedy, Bogota, using surveys and interviews applied conducted with
   users and officials of the system. The research was conducted under the
   research line ``State, Democracy and Justice{''} of the Institute for
   Pedagogy, Peace, and Urban Conflict of the Francisco Jose de Caldas
   District University (IPAZUD) during the years 2022 and 2023 within the

Abstract = {Way of implementing transitional justice into nationalcontexts is the
   parallel implementation of four conflict de-escalation strategies
   consisting of truth-seeking, judicialprocesses, reparations programs and
   institutional reforms. Inthis sense, the objective of this editorial is
   twofold, on the onehand, to present volume 41, number 78 of Political
   Questionsand, on the other, to practical aspects of the transitional
   justicemodel implementation. The author substantiates that theprocess of
   transitional justice implementing is endowed with acertain ideological
   component serving the purpose of transitional justiceimplementing. The
   authors concept definition of ``transitional justice
   modelimplementation{''} was proposed. It is noted that the mixed
   implementationmechanism of the studied model, combining domestic and
   internationalefforts in the field of peace building is the most
   acceptable for Ukraine.The author draws attention to the interdependence
   of the national contextand the relevant mechanisms for the transitional
   justice implementation.The author concludes that implementation
   mechanisms are determineddepending on the exigencies of the
   post-conflict society.},

Title = {Proportional Immigration Enforcement},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 1},
Abstract = {This article considers how much harm is justified in reaching
   immigration goals. Political philosophers generally overlook this
   question, focusing on states' rights to exclude immigrants in general,
   rather than which means of exclusion are justified. For example, even if
   excluding migrants during pandemics is justified, shooting at migrants
   is not. We argue that harm in immigration enforcement must be
   proportional. Whether harm is proportional depends on levels of harm
   migrants experience relative to harm immigration controls avert, whether
   migrants are forced to migrate, and whether harm is instigated by a
   state versus a nonstate actor. We further demonstrate that this claim is
   supported in a sample of UK and US citizens, including among those
   opposed to increasing migration. Drawing on an original experiment,
   novel in evaluating whether public opinions are consistent with the
   requirements of immigration justice, we demonstrate that opinions are
   consistent with the subprinciples of proportionality we present.},

Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},

Volume = {52},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {After the bloody devastation inflicted by the West on subalternity,
   there is the colonial tattoo that no one wants; since, the rejection of
   this mark makes suppose the degree of resistance and counterhegemonic
   action defined by the Amuyawi in the face of the global atmosphere of
   epistemological totalization. The pivotal proposal carefully exposes the
   origin of the Amuyawi of Frontier for the America of Colors and the
   philosophical parallelism with Slavoj Zizek. For this event, the
   elementary principles of the Amuyawi of Frontera and its respective
   methodology are analyzed; the role of the counter-system thinker against
   the philosophy that contemplates universal epistemology is also
   evaluated; likewise, the meeting of two abyssal worlds in their
   intentionality regarding the endotransterritorial dynamics of their
   inhabitants enters the debate and, on the other hand, the parallelism of
   slovenian with emerging thinking is verified; later, making use of the
   conspiracy theory, enters the topic widely commented by the inhabitants
   of the Muchedad, called: the danger under suspicion. Arrived at the
   final section, the principle of distrust towards the closest being
   arises under the premise of: ``protect them, but do not trust them{''},
   thus causing the return of totalitarian powers without counterpower on
   the verge of a highly lethal virus. Within this line, the study is
   obstructed, opening a way to reflect.},

Abstract = {By using the comparative method, this scientific article provided a
   comprehensive analysis of the Ukrainian air transport industry as an
   object of analyzing its state regulation. It is argued that a feature of
   the state regulation of the air transport industry is the integrative
   capacity, i.e. a comprehensive perception of the specified industry,
   which is not limited to air transport, but covers legal relations in the
   field of educational training, production, repair and modernization of
   aviation equipment, resolution of civil, economic and other disputes.
   Emphasis is placed on the systematization of legislation, on the basis
   of which administrative and legal regulation in aeronautical matters is
   carried out. In conclusion, the priority importance of a specialized
   state administration capable of simultaneously solving organizational,
   legal, political, economic, technical and other problems of development
   and operation of the air transport industry is pointed out. In addition,
   other practical recommendations for increasing the competitiveness of
   Ukrainian air transport were provided.},

Abstract = {Do bureaucratic actions trigger political engagement by firms? From 2005
   through 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission conducted a pilot
   study, for which they exempted a third of the stocks in the Russell 3000
   Index from short-selling price restrictions. This case presents a unique
   opportunity to study the connection between governmental regulation and
   firms' costly political engagement in an experimentally manipulated
   setting. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that firms
   exempted from price restrictions on short selling are more likely to
   lobby than the rest of the firms in the pilot study. In contrast, there
   is no discernible effect on treated firms' political action committee
   contribution patterns. This study helps clarify the strategic
   motivations behind why firms differentially engage in political
   activity.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research was to consider the essence of the use of
   criminal analysis in operational and search activities. The rationale is
   that it is necessary to improve the existing ways of using criminal
   analysis methods in operational and search EdMovige activities. The
   methodological basis of the article is a dialectical Fabola Euriaaniag
   approach. Moreover, during the research, a system of methods Nila of
   scientific knowledge has been used: formal logic (abstraction, analogy,
   deduction, induction, synthesis) for detailed clarification of the
   content of the issues under consideration; empirical research method
   during experimental research and interviewing experts; the method of
   system analysis to determine the directions for the introduction of
   innovative approaches to solving the problem. As a conclusion it is
   proposed to make changes in the Law of Ukraine ``On operational and
   search activities{''}, in particular, to supplement clause 4 of the
   first part of Article 8 with the following provision: in order to
   perform the tasks of operational and search activity to obtain
   information held by telecommunications operators and providers, about
   communications, subscribers, provision of telecommunications services,
   in particular, about the reception of services, their duration, content,

Title = {Authoritarianism and support for Trump and Clinton in the 2016 primaries},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Research in the wake of the contentious 2016 presidential primaries
   contends both Democrats and Republicans were internally divided along
   psychological lines. Specifically, MacWilliams (2016) finds
   authoritarian personality was strongly related to Trump support among
   Republican primary voters, and Wronski et al. (2018) finds
   authoritarianism was strongly related to Clinton support among
   Democratic primary voters. In this paper, I reassess the relationships
   between authoritarianism and 2016 primary candidate preferences for both
   Republicans and Democrats. I analyze two new large, probability-based
   surveys and generate random effects estimates using these surveys and
   two national surveys from Wronski et al. (2018). Overall, I find
   authoritarianism was moderately associated with support for Clinton over
   Sanders among Democratic primary voters, but weakly associated with
   support for Trump among Republican primary voters. My findings indicate
   authoritarianism may have played a more limited role in shaping
   Americans' candidate preferences in the 2016 presidential primary
   elections than past studies have suggested.},

Title = {Compulsory Voting Diminishes the Relationship between Winning and
   Satisfaction with Democracy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 1},
Abstract = {A robust body of research demonstrates that those who vote for electoral
   winners are most satisfied with democracy. In addition, a growing stream
   of literature shows that compulsory voting affects vote choices,
   attitudes, and emotions. Drawing insights from both literatures, I
   theorize that the relationship between winning and satisfaction with
   democracy is weaker for compelled voters. I test my theory with two
   separate studies. In study 1, I leverage a natural experiment whereby
   individuals are quasi-randomly assigned to compulsory voting on the
   basis of their birth date. Results show that compulsory voting causes
   the size of the relationship between winning and satisfaction to
   decrease. In study 2, I harness postelection survey data from several
   dozen countries. Results show that the association between voting for
   winners and satisfaction with democracy is weaker in countries where
   nonvoters are subject to penalties, especially among citizens who are
   less likely to turn out volitionally.},

Abstract = {Jimmy Carter's presidency lasted only one term before Ronald Reagan
   defeated him in 1980. Since then, scholars have debated-and many have
   maligned-Carter's legacy, especially his foreign policy efforts. The
   criticism of Jimmy Carter's foreign policies seems particularly mistaken
   when it comes to the Cold War. With the counsel of his National Security
   Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter exposed Soviet weaknesses, which
   included their global influence, economy, and record on human rights.
   Declassified government documents, census data, and the reflections of
   former policymakers and government insiders support a revised view of
   Carter's Cold War policies. The president's Soviet policies helped
   exacerbate the Soviets' domestic and international troubles, and were
   far more effective than earlier critics claimed in helping to end the
   Cold War and contributing to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.},

Abstract = {Scholars connect the rise of populist parties and the growing importance
   of social media platforms for political communication as the emerging
   social media logic seems well-suited to populist communication. The
   following research note presents a novel dataset that connects Facebook
   accounts to party-level populism data from the POPPA database. Over
   600,000 posts from 226 parties between 2017 and 2019 were analysed. The
   results show that in most European countries, populist parties are more
   active than non-populist parties on Facebook. However, high variation in
   the frequency of posts emphasises that country-specific aspects play an
   important role. Generally, Italian parties are much more active than
   those from other countries, whereas those in Northern and Western Europe
   are the least active. The most active party in Europe, the Italian
   right-wing populist Lega, showed the most extreme level of activity: its
   daily activity is around 20 times higher than the median. Furthermore,
   this analysis highlights why researchers should carefully check Facebook
   data for implausible inactivity and how connecting different data
   resources can help overcome potential biases resulting from missing
   data. Future studies analysing any party communication on Facebook will
   benefit from the insights and the list of party accounts featured
   herein.},

Abstract = {While there is a large literature studying the determinants of public
   support for European integration, we know much less about the factors
   shaping attitudes towards various international cooperation initiatives.
   In this article, we study the possible influence of framing, a mechanism
   linking pre-existing values and causal beliefs, on preferences for
   cooperation with the EU. We develop six thematic frames related to the
   context of international cooperation: economic benefits, security,
   shared identity, traditional and liberal values, and rules and norms of
   governance. We test the effects of these frames using a survey
   experiment conducted in three countries in Eastern Europe-Belarus,
   Moldova and Ukraine-that are targeted by the integration projects of
   both the EU and Russia. We find that thematic framing has only small
   effects on international cooperation preferences: priming liberal values
   and governance increases slightly support for cooperation with the EU,
   but the effects of the remaining frames are too small and heterogeneous
   to be estimated precisely with our sample. Contrary to expectations,
   some of these effects are exercised by changing the relevant causal
   beliefs of citizens, even if the thematic frames were not designed to do
   so.},

Abstract = {Question Time is one of the most visible aspects of parliament and a key
   mechanism of government accountability. It has been much maligned, both
   for its ineffectiveness and its poor standard of behaviour, but there is
   limited evidence upon which we can test this. Considering growing
   dissatisfaction with Australian democracy, this article presents a
   longitudinal analysis of Question Time. The 30-year timescale represents
   a unique contribution to the literature - allowing an assessment of how
   Question Time has changed, rather than being a point in time assessment.
   We find that the quality of Question Time is highly variable, but we do
   not find evidence that Question Time has declined in quality. While this
   may reinforce the idea that Question Time is a robust institution, we
   conclude that the variability suggests a fragility, and that vigilance
   is required to ensure that its effectiveness is not allowed to be
   undermined.},

Abstract = {Are the leaders of independent agencies independent in practice? Are the
   independence requirements set out in legislation a guarantee of de facto
   independence? This paper reveals the relationship between de iure
   independence and de facto independence of independent agencies through
   two dimensions: political affinity and political vulnerability of their
   leaders. Our analysis reveals how the de iure independence of an agency
   affects the probability that agency heads will have connections to
   political parties and whether their mandates will end prematurely in a
   period of political transition, i.e., when a new government takes
   office. It also determines whether the biographical profile of agency
   heads (PhD degree, bureaucratic background, and political affiliation)
   can influence their security of tenure when governments change, and
   hence their independence. This is supported by an empirical evaluation
   of independent authorities in the Czech Republic between 1993 and 2021.},

Title = {What Explains a Representative's Staffing ``Style{''}? Exploring the

   Considerations},

Abstract = {Students of legislative politics are divided over the relationship
   between electoral vulnerability and the type of ``home style{''} members
   of Congress adopt in terms of their district staffing decisions. The
   conventional wisdom asserts that an increase in electoral vulnerability
   corresponds with a legislator increasing the number of district
   staffers. However, another body of works implies that the inverse
   relationship should occur. To settle these competing claims, we explore
   the staffing decisions of legislators serving in the House of
   Representatives between the 101st and 113th Congress. We find that an
   increase in electoral vulnerability is associated with a decrease in
   district staffers. These results cast doubt on the widely held view that
   a legislator's electoral vulnerability results in an increase in
   district attentiveness at least in terms of their district staff.
   Additionally, our findings provide several insights into the
   relationship between elections and representation.},

Journal = {FORUM-A JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 14},
Abstract = {For the first time in one hundred years, the 118th Congress began with a
   prolonged Speaker's race that required fifteen ballots to elect a
   Speaker. The contentious Republican debate displayed a level of personal
   animosity between a faction - the House Freedom Caucus (HFC) - and the
   majority party's chosen leader - Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) - but it
   also revealed a series of significant divisions within the majority
   party over policy, and legislative norms and practices. How do different
   strategies shape the capacity of factions to spur formal changes to
   legislative institutions? How do party leaders respond to the demands of
   factions that raise issues threatening to party unity and their own
   leadership position? In this article, I analyze the composition of
   defectors in the Speaker's race, the status of their rule and procedural
   reform agenda, and the response by McCarthy, including to committee
   assignments and early use of restrictive rules in the 118th Congress. I
   conclude with a discussion of the consequences of the HFC strategy for
   the contemporary U.S. House, and an emerging need to expand theories of
   institutional change to better integrate the behavior of both party
   leaders and factions.},

Abstract = {This essay examines how Taiwanese national identity was performed on
   social media during the postponed Tokyo Olympics 2020. Taiwan achieved
   its best-ever medal tally, leading to the emergence of a new form of
   sport nationalism. Athletes' off-field behaviors, including diverse
   gender expressions, distinguished them not only from their Chinese
   counterparts but also from previous generations of Taiwanese athletes.
   Badminton, weightlifting, and table tennis athletes became the ``proxy
   warriors{''} of Taiwan, showcasing the democratic and diverse nature of
   Taiwanese society. The Tokyo Olympics, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and
   geopolitical tensions, became a battleground for ideologies, with the
   complex relationships among Taiwan, China, and Japan setting the
   backdrop for narratives. To depart from traditional research on official
   national discourses, this essay employs critical discourse analysis
   (CDA) by examining Facebook content and comments on news reports related
   to Taiwanese Olympians. This essays argues that Taiwan's cyber civil
   society has developed a flexible strategy to counter China's aggression
   on the internet. Taiwanese online mobilization demonstrated
   self-control, creativity, and adaptability, establishing a unique
   Taiwanese identity during the Tokyo Olympics in the midst of the
   pandemic.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Does austerity influence incumbent support? Existing studies struggle
   with conceptualizing the evolution of austerity's impact over time,
   estimating a causal effect, and analysing the reactions of different
   voters. This study theorizes that the effect of austerity on electoral
   preferences is not immediate, but gradual, as voters find out about the
   measures' consequences via the media. It leverages a survey in the field
   at the time of the austerity announcement in Romania in 2010, additional
   survey data collected immediately after this event and comprehensive
   daily media coverage to show that austerity measures do not have an
   immediate impact on incumbent support, anticipated turnout and
   expressing a vote preference. Instead, there is a gradual effect that is
   associated with increased media attention to budgetary cuts. This
   natural experiment allows the estimation of the immediate causal effect
   of austerity on electoral intentions. Difference-in-differences (DID)
   models show that the announcement triggered a massive loss of support
   for the incumbent among those who had voted for the party in power only
   a few months before. Austerity also led to the demobilization of the
   governing party's supporters. There is no evidence that those most
   directly affected by the spending cuts are more likely to punish the
   incumbent party.},

Abstract = {I examine the partisan and gender dynamics that shape Congressional
   policymaking on abortion since the early 1990s. I demonstrate how the
   movement of abortion from an issue that split the parties to a litmus
   test that defines what it means to be a Democrat or Republican has
   impacted policymaking. I highlight the increasingly central role female
   lawmakers play in crafting policy and shaping party messaging.
   Throughout this period, Democratic women are the most aggressive
   proponents for abortion rights and have expanded their influence over
   the party's agenda. Meanwhile, Republican women were divided on the
   issue through the early 2000s and had limited influence on the party's
   decision making. Since the Tea Party wave of 2010 brought more pro-life
   women to office, Republican women are pivotal players and will influence
   the direction of party strategy and legislating in the Post-Roe
   environment.},

Abstract = {Defining `radical left' political actors by their challenge to
   contemporary economic norms, this article draws the example of Die Linke
   in Germany and analyses explanations for this party's support. Two
   theories are tested. First, the policy-proximity account, building off
   the Downsian spatial model and tested with three policy dimensions
   relating to economics, cultural policy, and migration policy. Second,
   the populism-based account, which defines this as a conflict between
   `the people' versus `elites'. Using German Longitudinal Election Survey
   data, this article carries out a large-N analysis of support for Die
   Linke. It uses multiple linear regression to test how far support for
   this party is explained by proximity between voters and the party, or by
   levels of populism among voters. Results showed greater support for Die
   Linke from proximal voters on each dimension; however, highly populist
   voters were not found to be more supportive of Die Linke. The article
   concludes in favour of a policy-proximity explanation but suggests the
   party's well-established nature may have altered voters' policy
   preferences, potentially leaving a reverse causal relationship and
   leaving in doubt the role of policy-proximity on radical left support.},

Abstract = {The secrecy, subtlety, and diversity of party-firm relations have proven
   challenging to synthesize. We introduce a new heuristic framework for
   the study business donors on the basis of pragmatic, partisan, and
   social motivations. We illustrate our framework with an analysis of
   donors to the UK Conservative Party from the property services and
   construction industries. While actors make it almost impossible to place
   particular events in our framework, in the aggregate the framework is
   empirically tractable. We triangulate a study of over twenty years of
   donations data, news on social events, and qualitative data to argue
   that the construction industry is motivated by a combination of
   pragmatic and social motivations, while the property services industry
   is best described by a combination of the social and partisan
   motivations.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how the US and Australian Departments of Defence
   used social media platforms for branding, perception management and to
   curb online firestorms as well as how their citizens reacted to these
   political branding techniques during the Afghan troops' withdrawal and
   evacuations. The study analyzed 11,460 tweets and replies from the US
   and Australian DoDs. Results show that the US and Australian DoDs
   strategically used their tweets to communicate professionalism, military
   efficiency and exceptionalism, information and clarification, duty,
   commendation, commiseration, and support for mental health. Findings
   further demonstrate that there was a significant association between the
   US and Australian DoDs' counterinformation (inoculations) and tweets
   approving of both the withdrawal and evacuations. The study uncovers
   that the branding efforts of the US and Australian DoDs during the
   Afghan withdrawal and evacuations were successful as their high
   reservoir of trust moderated the short- and long-term effects of the
   online firestorm.},

Title = {Rethinking the political in the pluriverse: The ethico-political
   significance of care},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {19},

Pages = {252-268},

Abstract = {Postfoundational political thought is characterized by a distinction
   between ``politics{''} (a socio-symbolic order that delineates what is
   knowable and thinkable) and ``the political{''} (the instantiation of a
   socio-symbolic order). This article critically engages with the
   postfoundational thought of Jacques Ranciere to rethink ``the
   political{''} in the context of the pluriverse, a matrix of multiple
   distinct yet interconnected worlds. In so doing, this article challenges
   the idea that ``care{''} is not properly political. Specifically, I
   argue that in the context of the pluriverse, socio-symbolic orders, or
   worlds, are not instantiated as such; rather, they must be established
   and, importantly, reestablished in the face of one another. From this
   vantage point, caring for and maintaining worlds-especially worlds
   marginalized by relations of power in the global political economy-is of
   political and ethical significance. This article thus offers a
   decolonial and feminist approach to thinking about the political as it
   (a) destabilizes the Westerncentric assumption that there is one-world,
   and takes different worlds as worlds seriously; and (b) centers issues
   of care and reproduction, demonstrates how they are politically and
   ethically salient, and thereby contributes to the project of
   foregrounding the political import of care.},

   civil conflicts in Sub-Saharan Africa},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},

Abstract = {As an infectious disease, malaria consumes around 250 million yearly
   clinical cases and with more than half a million annual deaths. It has
   shown tremendous burden for the economic and social life of many
   countries around the world, particularly in the tropical and developing
   nations. The conventional wisdom claims that the prevalence of malaria
   infection either prolongs or should be positively correlated with
   outbreaks of civil conflicts. We contend that malaria infection should
   deter civil conflict occurrences because warming parties should avoid
   engaging each other in areas with rampant malaria infection. We test the
   hypothesis with 20 years of geo-referenced panel data of conflict event
   and malaria risk from Sub-Sahara Africa. Our result renders strong
   support for our hypothesis that areas with more malaria infection tends
   to have less civil conflicts.},

Abstract = {Structural Injustice has become a hugely important concept in the field
   of political theory with the work of Iris Marion Young central to
   debates on what it is, what motivates it and how it should be addressed.
   In this article, I focus on a particular thread in Young's account of
   structural injustice which I argue is all too often overlooked - the
   untraceability of structural injustice. This is not only a constant
   theme in Young's account of structural injustice, it is, in fact, a
   defining feature. By `untraceable', Young means that structural
   injustice is distinct from other sorts of injustices for which there is
   a traceable agent at fault - these sorts of faut-based injustices fall
   under what Young calls the `liability model of injustice'. For the
   purposes of exploring the concept of structural injustice, I follow the
   logic of the claim that structural injustice is untraceable to see where
   it takes us in conversation with Young's critics. I conclude that
   Young's account is not only defensible with some clarification and
   development but vital politically. That said, I also find Young's
   account of political responsibility for structural injustice wanting and
   accordingly I propose a way of understanding what I see as a dynamic
   transition from structural to fault-based injustices which I argue
   Young's more `static' account fails to accommodate. This is important, I
   suggest, for thinking about the ways in which responsibility for
   different forms of injustice operate and change.Contemporary Political

Abstract = {This article explores the effects of social media on government
   accountability under authoritarian regimes. It examines whether online
   discussions have a disciplining effect on officials' scandals. We use a
   unique dataset containing records of scandals discussed on microblogs in
   China to systematically study their effects on the government response
   process and officials' disciplining. We find that the government employs
   clear strategies: higher levels of online discussion lead to quicker
   government responses and more severe punishment of the officials
   involved. Scandals involving sexual and economic factors, which
   initially capture more attention, involve quicker responses and more
   severe punishments. Even when we exploit rainfall as the instrumental
   variable to mitigate the endogeneity, the results are still robust. Our
   findings highlight the accountability mechanism facilitated by social
   media and the power of social media empowerment.},

Abstract = {This research note presents the RepResent Belgian Panel (RBP). The RBP
   is a voter panel survey consisting of four waves fielded to a sample of
   voters in Belgium around the May 2019 federal, regional, and European
   elections in Belgium. It provides unique data on about 250 variables for
   a quota sample of the same respondents, pre-2019 elections (N = 7351),
   post-2019 elections (N = 3909), one year after the elections (N = 1996),
   and 2 years after the elections (N = 1119). The RBP panel dataset was
   designed to analyse voters' political attitudes and behaviours, notably
   on different dimensions of democratic representation, and with a
   specific focus on democratic resentment (e.g. citizens' attitudes
   towards democracy such as distrust and alienation, but also behaviours
   such as abstention, protest, or voting for anti-establishment parties).
   Its longitudinal structure allows to explore the political dynamics at
   play in Belgium throughout the lengthy government formation process.
   Finally, the last two waves of the RBP were fielded during the Covid-19
   pandemic, allowing to explore public opinion before and during this
   global crisis. The RBP should be of interest to scholars of public
   opinion and electoral studies.},

Title = {The Islamic Human Rights Deficit: Region, Not Religion, Is the Driver},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {189-212},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Scholarly research, journalistic accounts, and popular discourses often
   portray Islam as detrimental to human rights. Governments in
   Muslim-majority countries are considered especially prone to violating
   bodily integrity protections, curtailing civil and political liberties,
   repressing women and LGBT people, and restricting religious freedoms.
   Using cross-national time-series data for a majority of the world's
   countries, this article demonstrates that Islam per se is not
   responsible for human rights deficits in any of these domains. Simply
   being a Muslim-majority country is not associated with increased rights
   violations. Rather, human rights gaps are confined to Muslim-majority
   countries in the Middle East and North Africa region and, in some cases,
   to Arab countries. Additional research to explain these patterns is
   warranted.},

Abstract = {In 1990, Simon Clarke inaugurated two decades of research of the former
   Soviet Union through an international collaboration with Russian
   sociologists that examined a society in the throes of transformation.
   Along with his colleague Peter Fairbrother, Simon developed a network of
   Russian researchers in the Institute of Comparative Labour Relations
   Research. Together they produced a corpus of work that meticulously
   analysed the impact of economic reform on workplaces and households and
   the response of workers and their organisations. This piece is an
   extended version of a published interview with Simon conducted by two of
   his former students, Sarah Ashwin and Valery Yakubovich.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {57},
Number = {4},
Pages = {644-674},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Though a great deal of research has examined the economic and political
   consequences of natural resource wealth, its implications for labor
   remain empirically under-examined. In this article, we contend that
   resource abundance undermines labor rights due to the inelastic demand
   for resource-intensive products, which serves to insulate these states
   from internal and external pressures to protect these rights. In
   addition to this direct linkage, we posit that resource wealth
   indirectly undercuts labor rights through its adverse impact on civil
   society and bureaucratic capacity. Examining these linkages across 148
   countries for the years 1994-2010, we find that resource wealth has a
   negative and significant impact on labor rights practices, though not on
   labor rights laws. Results from a causal mediation analysis show that
   resource wealth also undermines labor rights through its negative impact
   on labor organizations and bureaucratic capacity},

Abstract = {There is now a growing consensus among democratic theorists that we
   should incorporate both ``democratic deliberation{''} and ``aggregative
   voting{''} into our democratic processes. But how should the two
   democratic mechanisms of deliberation and voting interact? In this
   article, we introduce a new axiom, which we call ``Nonnegative Response
   toward Successful Deliberation{''} (NNRD). The basic idea is that if
   some individuals change their preferences toward other individuals'
   preferences through democratic deliberation, then the social choice rule
   should not make everybody who has successfully persuaded others through
   reasoned deliberation worse off than what they would have achieved
   without deliberation. We prove an impossibility theorem that shows that
   there exists no aggregation rule that can simultaneously satisfy NNRD
   along with other mild axioms that reflect deliberative democracy's core
   commitment to unanimous consensus and political equality. We offer
   potential escape routes; however, each escape route can succeed only by
   compromising some core value of deliberative democracy.},

Abstract = {State repression and protest are common in modern authoritarian and
   hybrid regimes, yet individual responses to these events are not well
   understood. This article draws on unique panel data from the months
   spanning Zimbabwe's 2018 election, which we view as a moment of
   uncertainty for most Zimbabwean citizens. Using a
   difference-in-difference estimator, we estimate change in individual
   protest intentions following exposure to repression and dissent and we
   assess three individual-level mechanisms hypothesized to drive
   responses. We find evidence that exposure to local repression and
   dissent are mobilizing among opposition supporters and nonpartisans.
   Analysis of potential mechanisms suggests that the effects of exposure
   to dissent may be driven by information updating, whereas relational and
   emotional mechanisms seem to drive backlash against repression, despite
   increased perceptions of risk. We find no evidence of
   counter-mobilization by ruling party supporters, and little effect of
   exposure to contentious events over social media.},

Abstract = {Can democratic innovations (DIs) offer a cure for the widespread loss of
   support for electoral institutions? This widely held assumption among
   advocates of DIs should be questioned more thoroughly. Insufficient
   attention has been paid so far to the impact of different types of DIs
   on electoral legitimacy, defined as the support for the principles
   grounding electoral representation. What is at stake is the
   compatibility and equilibrium between different parts of the new
   democratic systems that are developing in many political contexts. To
   address this issue, the article offers an innovative typology,
   distinguishing five types of DIs based on their relationship with
   traditional representative institutions. This allows to identify DIs
   that do have the potential to strengthen electoral legitimacy
   (initiative, recall, abrogative referendums, deliberative town-halls)
   from others overtly attacking it (lottocracy, liquid democracy) or
   potentially challenging it (citizen-initiated referendums and empowered
   citizens' assemblies). The article shows that it is not because an
   innovation is conceived as complementary to electoral representative
   institutions that it cannot challenge the latter's foundations. Finally,
   it identifies several issues on which empirical knowledge is lacking,

Abstract = {The Argentinean movement \#NiUnaMenos (NUM) represents one of the most
   relevant transnational examples of Latin American feminist mobilization
   against gender-based violence and can be understood as vanguard of a
   current tide of feminized resistance on a global scale. This article
   addresses two central narratives in the discourses and social practices
   of three founders of the NUM; one about feminist mobilization as a
   social transformative moment that creates distinctive protest
   performances in the pursuing of a liveable life despite the challenging
   restrictive possibilities; and the other about the intersection between
   gender and class in the struggle against the neoliberal patriarchal
   precarization of life, related to the lack of the collective systems of
   social protection against gender-based violence. The analysis of these
   narratives highlights a feminization of resistance that promotes a
   radical transformation of the social system, where politics also at a
   micro level question capitalism, colonialism, and patriarchy by
   producing alternative knowledges, subjectivities, and epistemologies.
   Particularly, the study of the experience of enhanced precariousness
   created by the operation of patriarchal violence, and the resistance
   expressed in engendered alternative ethical and non-violent responses,
   reveals in the narratives the strength of a precarity awareness becoming
   a network of transnational and cross-identities solidarity.},

Title = {Diplomacy Versus Politics: Two Mutually (In)Dependent Systems},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {471-486},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Diplomacy is often presented as subordinated to politics as if it merely
   received politically willed `inputs' to produce politically structured
   `outputs'. However, diplomacy often deviates from political
   instructions. It can even operate almost without any political
   considerations whatsoever. This observation gives rise to a sense that
   politics and diplomacy operate as two separate systems that are mutually
   dependent and yet simultaneously independent from each other. To
   illuminate this relationship, the present paper draws from Modern
   Systems Theory (especially Parsons and Luhmann) to argue that politics
   and diplomacy engage in double interchanges: (1) they stimulate each
   other through premises for actions like `foreign policy goals', and (2)
   they implement each other such that diplomatic happenings can be booked
   as political successes and vice versa. The discussion section outlines
   how the autonomy of the two systems varies empirically - such as in the
   case of politically appointed diplomats - and how extreme cases of
   autonomous operations (apolitical diplomacy or adiplomatic politics)
   face negative sanctions.},

Abstract = {How does democratic transition affect party polarization? While previous
   literature on party politics in post-transition environments describes a
   fragmented political system marked by multi-partism and the rise of
   weakly institutionalized parties, party polarization in young
   democracies is underexplored. We argue that democratic transition
   reduces party polarization by introducing a new set of parties which
   have not consolidated their issue positions yet. The ambiguity of party
   positions makes ideological attributes less salient and renders a less
   polarized party politics. To assess the impact of the party polarization
   in young democracies, we employ a fuzzy regression discontinuity design
   (RDD). We use the Manifesto Project data on right-left positions of
   parties from 58 countries to measure party polarization and the
   Varieties of Democracy (V-DEM) data on regime transition to identify
   democratic transitions. Our findings suggest that party polarization on
   right-left issue position decreases on average, following the democratic
   transition.},

   an analysis of the Spinozist concept of ``prudence{''} that, making it
   the constituent power of ``common freedom{''}, reveals its distance from
   the idea of ``obedience{''}.},

Abstract = {This research note presents some of the problems and arguments for the
   formulation of a theoretical model of political stability and democracy
   from a realistic perspective. The problem of research concerns the type
   of democracy required for the stability of a modus vivendi in a liberal
   regime considering a realistic conception of politics. The hypothesis
   that is argued is that agonistic democracy is the conception of
   democracy adequate for the political stability of a modus vivendi if the
   postulates of contemporary political realism are considered. The
   proposed methodology defines the conceptual relationships between both
   conceptions and political realism.},

   focuses on modern research grounded on stoicism, which has flourished on
   the cultural scene as a sign of individuality. The rationale for such
   popularity within neoliberalism is due to the practices of individuals
   when experiencing pain. Therefore, the historical and socio-cultural
   origin of the self-care discourse is addressed, which will constitute
   what has been refered to as a new stoa.},

Abstract = {Only modern conceptions of friendship involve women and are thought also
   by women. Unlike La Rochefoucauld and other male moralists, in her
   Traite de l'amitie, as well as in her Reflexions nouvelles sur les
   femmes, Mme de Lambert describes a form of sentimental friendship
   between woman and man that cannot be distinguished from love. By
   examining the Traite in conjunction with the Reflexions, my article will
   show that Mme de Lambert's view of friendship deserves attention for two
   reasons. On the one hand, she revised Montaigne's reflections to include
   women in the realm of friendship. On the other hand, she revived
   Madeleine de Scudery's politics of tenderness to defend women's
   intellectual freedom. Disclosing what is at stake in Mme de Lambert's
   conception of friendship will allow to highlight an interesting aspect
   of her political thought.},

Abstract = {This article takes stock of the state of women's political history in
   the twentieth century and suggests new lines of enquiry, drawing on the
   authors' own work on the Labour Party. It identifies a number of key
   themes which have enriched histories of women and gender in the
   nineteenth and early twentieth century and considers how these might be
   developed. Firstly, it examines the significance of the local, and more
   particularly, the neighbourhood, in women's political lives. Secondly,
   it asserts the value of focussing on the membership, including the
   economic, social and cultural shifts that shaped their lives, the
   intersection of gender with factors such as age or ethnicity, and their
   own political identities. Finally, it stresses the importance of
   interrogating masculine cultures to understand how gendered dynamics
   played out. It concludes with a reminder that inserting women into
   established political narratives is insufficient: the point is to
   transform those narratives.},

Abstract = {this paper seeks to delve into some fundamental elements that explain
   the construction of political positions and that no project, especially
   one that has to do with the ecological transformation of society, can
   afford not to take into account. The fundamental reasoning is the
   following: science, facts and evidence, by themselves, do not become a
   political support in favor of taking the necessary measures. For this
   reason, it is pertinent to unpack what we understand by the functioning
   of human mechanics, in order to question the approaches that insist on
   separating emotion and reason, belief and reasoning, truth and politics.
   Considering the political dimension of ecology also implies assuming
   dimensions that are sometimes discarded at first.},

Abstract = {Trust in national and local institutions is an essential component of
   democracy. The literature has dealt mainly with the former, while less
   attention has been given to the latter. This paper advances a novel
   theoretical approach to inquire about trust in local institutions, which
   is also used to test national ones. We posit that trust is affected by
   the perceptions individuals have of the physical space where they live.
   Both a) the perceived quality of life in the neighbourhood where
   individuals live and b) the neighbourhood (perceived) peripherality are
   hypothesized to affect trust in local (and to a lesser extent) national
   institutions. We test our hypotheses in Italy, over a large
   representative sample of more than 40.000 respondents. We show that both
   variables are crucial predictors of local trust, but only the perceived
   quality of life predicts national trust. Equally important, social,
   cultural and economic individual capital does not modify the relation.},

Title = {Camps, not just parties. The dynamic foundations of affective
   polarization in multi-party systems},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {83},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Concerns over affective polarization in Western democracies are growing.
   But which broader political distinctions are also affective
   demarcations? As inter-party cooperation is the rule in multi-party
   democracies, explaining affective polarization beyond partisan divisions
   is crucial. I argue that demarcations between political camps deepen
   affective polarization, and country-level factors influence the
   relevance of these affective divides. Based on survey data from 23
   Western democracies (1996-2019), I demonstrate that affect is most
   polarized between Left and Right camps, and between the Radical Right
   and other camps. Further, these divides are dynamic and depend on
   different country-level outcomes. The Left/Right divide disappears when
   Left and Right parties govern together, while the Radical Right divide
   is fortified with Radical Right electoral success. These findings
   highlight that affective polarization's group foundations extend beyond
   partisanship, and that affective polarization could even act as a
   defence mechanism against radical challengers.},

Abstract = {This study examines fiscal federalism by interrogating the relationship
   between first- and second-nature geographic features-most notably
   distance as well as various economic/infrastructural indicators-and
   intergovernmental transfers and subnational fiscal dependence in Russia
   and the United States from 2003 to 2015. Our findings reveal stark
   differences in the role that geographic factors play in these two
   federations. While first- and second-nature factors influenced both
   transfers and reliance in Russia, only second-nature indicators had an
   effect in the U.S. case. Economic development and infrastructural
   improvements do not cause the influence of first-nature indicators to
   evaporate altogether, but they do attenuate the effects of those
   considerations.},

Abstract = {The paper examines a specific approach to the idea of the just price.
   The approach takes its cue from a basic insight about the nature of
   exchange, namely, that the latter occurs when both parties to the
   exchange stand to gain something from it. The distributive question that
   arises from this observation is how, or according to which principle, we
   ought to divide such gains. The paper rejects two intuitive answers. The
   first is that the just price is that at which the gains from exchange
   are equally distributed between the parties. The second is that the just
   price is the price at which the party that is worse off prior to the
   transaction gains as much as possible from it. The problem with the
   former is that it condones exploitation when one of the two parties is
   vulnerable. The problem with the latter is that it cannot be plausibly
   generalized to all transactions. The paper then offers a novel
   alternative that both preserves the intuitive appeal of the approaches
   that have been criticized and is able to avoid their weaknesses. This
   can be achieved by accepting an eclectic distributional ethic with a
   sufficientarian core.},

Journal = {WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {47},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1223-1250},
Month = {SEP 18},
Abstract = {The rise of Euroscepticism has shifted the structure of political
   conflict in the European Parliament (EP) towards an increasingly
   dominant pro-/anti-EU divide. Focusing on the hard case of EU
   enlargement, this article examines changes in MEPs' discursive and
   voting patterns over the past two EP mandates. It combines two original
   datasets containing MEP statements during plenary debates and subsequent
   roll-call votes to examine the polarisation, cohesion, and consistency
   of legislative behaviour across different European Political Groups. The
   findings show that soft Eurosceptics drive a deepening of the
   pro-/anti-EU divide by radicalising in both discourse and vote to join
   hard Eurosceptics in their firm rejection of further enlargement.
   Pro-European MEPs, in contrast, show discursive accommodation of
   Eurosceptic concerns, with a growing inconsistency between sceptical
   discourse and continued vote-based support for enlargement-related
   initiatives. A case study of Turkey illustrates these two mechanisms.
   The findings shed light on the changing dynamics of political
   competition in the EP and the impact of rising Euroscepticism upon MEPs'
   legislative behaviour.},

Abstract = {Voters often face a complex information environment with many options
   when they vote in elections. Research on democratic representation has
   traditionally been skeptical about voters' ability to navigate this
   complexity. However, voting advice applications (VAAs) offer voters a
   shortcut to compare their own preferences across numerous issues with
   those of a large number of political candidates. As VAAs become more
   prevalent, it is critical to understand whether and how voters use them
   when they vote. We analyze how VAA users process and use VAA information
   about their district candidates with original survey data from the 2019
   Danish parliamentary election in collaboration with the administrators
   of one of the most widely used Danish VAAs. The results demonstrate that
   VAAs have substantively large effects on their users' choices between
   parties and between candidates within parties.},

Title = {Inequality in Agency Response: Evidence from Salient Wildfire Events},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 1},
Abstract = {Government agencies may be an additional source of unequal
   representation beyond that stemming from the differential responsiveness
   of elected officials. We use plausibly exogenous focusing events, which
   raise public demands for government provision of local public goods, to
   examine evidence of inequality in agency decision-making. Using the
   empirical case of wildfire risk management in the western United States,
   we find that experiencing nearby wildfires raises the salience of
   wildfire risk and leads agencies to place a greater number of risk
   reduction projects nearby, even when wildfire risk has already been
   reduced. This effect predominates among high socioeconomic status
   communities, especially higher income, more educated, and whiter
   communities. Empirical evidence is consistent with a formal model in
   which public agencies perpetuate inequality due to differences in the
   costs of lobbying across demographically varying communities and
   differences across communities in the benefits to agencies of responding
   to their demands.},

Abstract = {The Ckunza language of the Chilean Lickan Antai is regarded as extinct.
   This community has worked on its revival since 2010. This descriptive
   -quantitative study explores the knowledge and use of the language among
   the members of the Atacamenean community. The results reveal an emerging
   reversal of the displacement of the Ckunza language. This article
   contributes to support the struggle for language revitalisation by
   supporting language planning as well as research in this field.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Although judicial elections are considered a method of keeping state
   courts-otherwise insulated from public pressure-accountable, the private
   financing of judicial campaigns has been met with significant criticism.
   In particular, the perception that campaign contributions can buy
   favorable case outcomes for contributors to judicial candidates may pose
   problems for judicial legitimacy. While some scholars and advocacy
   groups have advanced proposals which seek to eliminate private financing
   from judicial elections, research has yet to demonstrate a link between
   the public's evaluations of a court's legitimacy and the campaign
   financing system the state employs. In this paper, we present the
   results of a survey experiment that examines the public's evaluations of
   judicial legitimacy under different campaign financing schemes. We find
   evidence supportive of our core hypothesis: respondents viewed courts
   with publicly financed elections as more legitimate than those with
   privately financed elections. This study helps to reinforce the
   viability of public financing by empirically demonstrating that the
   public views a state supreme court elected using the public financing
   model as more legitimate and less susceptible to donor pressure than one
   selected using privately financed models.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article was to reveal the content of the controversial
   elements of the illegal use of humanitarian aid, provided for in Article
   201-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine; to clarify the validity of the
   introduction of this prohibition and, moreover, to discuss its impact on
   law enforcement. All of which in order to be able to determine the
   prospects for the development of criminal law in the field. Several
   research methods have been used in the article, such as: comparative,
   systemic-structural and legal-formal. Referring to the appropriate
   methodological basis has made it possible to delve into the issues of
   criminal liability for embezzlement of humanitarian aid funds in
   Ukraine. Based on the results of the comparative analysis, it has been
   noted that there are no special provisions on appropriation and
   embezzlement of humanitarian aid items in the legislation of certain
   European states. As a conclusion it has been argued that the
   introduction of article 201-2 in the Criminal Code, is an example of
   excessive criminalization because: in this case, the act, which is
   inherent in the social harmfulness necessary for criminalization, did
   not require criminalization, since criminal liability for it has already
   existed and is broadly typified in the law.},

Abstract = {The analysis carried out in the article was aimed at exploring the
   conditions of possibility, for inspection and search of the crime of
   fraud with financial resources, which also involved the review of:
   (places of events, documents); interrogation (of witnesses, suspect,
   victim); simultaneous interrogation of two or more persons already
   interrogated; presentation for identification (person, things). With the
   help of general and special philosophical methods, the tactical features
   of carrying out the specified investigative (search) actions, which are
   often caused by a conflict situation produced by the involvement of
   organized criminal groups, in the commission of such fraudulent actions,
   are determined. The results indicate the specific circumstances of the
   search, aimed at the seizure of computer equipment, software and
   relevant information contained therein. Furthermore, the conclusions
   emphasize the desirability of timely implementation, thorough
   preparation, involvement of a specialist in the field of economic
   activity and competent use of technical means of fixation to manage
   these crimes.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research was to consider appropriate forms of
   interpretation of legal norms in modern jurisprudence. In the main
   content it has been established that the interpretation results in a
   general conclusion or a sum of conclusions reached by the subject of
   interpretation in the process of clarification of the rule of law (legal
   norms), using the whole set of methods of interpretation, which is
   appropriate to the legal reality. The methodological basis of the
   research was presented as comparative-legal and systematic analysis,
   formal-legal method, as well as hermeneutic method, method of analysis
   and synthesis. It has been concluded that the procedure for achieving
   the purpose of interpretation should be as follows: grammatical
   interpretation - teleological interpretation - clarification of the
   conformity of the essence of the content of the legal norm with the
   principles of law - systematic interpretation - special legal
   interpretation - logical interpretation - functional interpretation -
   historical interpretation - repeated application of the interpretation
   procedure upon receipt of new data. If this procedure is properly
   followed, it is possible to achieve the conditions for the achievement
   of an adequate legal hermeneutics, which places the texts in their
   context of meaning.},

Title = {Reading Ellison through Herder: Language, Integration, and Democracy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 1},
Abstract = {This article contributes to recent work treating Ralph Ellison as a
   major democratic theorist by reading his political thought through a
   heretofore overlooked, and apparently remote, interpretive lens: the
   linguistic and cultural theories of Johann Gottfried von Herder.
   Ellison's controversial endorsement of an integrationist vision of
   American nationhood was, I show, rooted in an underlying theory of
   language whose premises were essentially Herderian. Yet Ellison also
   creatively expanded on those ideas, notably through his concept of the
   ``democratic vernacular,{''} which analyzed the relationship between
   language, culture, and politics to explain how democracy and integration
   might progress in the United States, despite the racism of its political
   system and amid the deep pluralism of its culture. By reworking
   Herderian themes for radically diverse contexts, Ellison's thought
   furnishes resources to democratic theorists confronting a range of
   urgent normative issues related to cultural diversity.},

Abstract = {The main objective of the study was to identify the key legal norms and
   aspects of employment of the Ukrainian population The method that has
   been applied is the functional modeling methodology. In this regard, the
   purpose of the study was to propose a model of the legal support system
   to stimulate the demand for labor. In the conditions of the market
   economy, the employment factor of the population is a determining factor
   in shaping the socio-economic situation of any country as a whole and,
   of each individual in particular. Therefore, one of the most important
   functions of the public administration is the study and proper
   application of the legal regulation of labor activities. It is concluded
   that the labor market, as an important and multifaceted area of the
   economic and socio-political question of society, requires qualified
   regulation to increase the efficiency of its functioning. Thus, the
   creation of an effective system of regulation of the sphere of
   employment is needed as one of the main social measures for the
   development of society in the XXI century.},

Abstract = {In 2022, the Welsh Government announced plans to increase the size of
   the Welsh Parliament/Senedd Cymru, a culmination of two decades of
   elite-level argument over whether more members should parallel the
   institution's growing suite of legislative and fiscal powers. While an
   expanded legislature may improve the Senedd's capacity to scrutinise the
   executive, opposition has focused on increased costs that detract from
   core public spending. Using a novel survey experiment conducted in the
   2021 Welsh Election Study, we assess public attitudes and find that
   support for expanding the Senedd is limited to those with a strong
   Welsh-only identity and pro-autonomy preferences. Although appeals to
   holding the executive to account do not broaden this base of support, a
   framing that the Senedd should be comparable in size to legislatures in
   Scotland and Northern Ireland does have a positive effect on voters with
   more median constitutional preferences.},

Abstract = {Methodological uniformity and the relatively small number of studies
   concerning election turnout in Serbia strikingly detract from the social
   importance of the topic. The goal was to reduce this disparity by
   studying turnout in the 21st century under a statistically atypical
   approach that uses objective, publicly available data at the
   municipalities/cities level. Beginning in 2012, the trend of a worrying,
   almost linear decrease in turnout was found. Canonical correlation
   analysis showed that socio-demographic-economic variables are highly
   predictive of voter turnout. Six pairs of statistically significant
   canonical factors were isolated from the space of
   socio-demographic-economic characteristics and corresponding variables
   of electoral participation. It was indirectly established that the
   analytically extracted types of environments whose inhabitants exhibit
   specific electoral-participative behavior also show specific
   constellations of electoral preferences. The findings were then
   discussed in light of the regression to Vucic's hybrid regime.},

Abstract = {By spurring trade, the level of income and consumption and production
   increase, which consequently causes a more polluted environment. As
   global economic integration escalates, the possibility of contention
   becomes more translucent. The foundation of this article is based on the
   Ricardian model regarding consumption and production pollution function
   in six scenarios depending on Autarky or trade situation. There is also
   a difference in the relative labour size of countries. Also, pollution
   tightness can clarify whether there are any concerns about climate
   change regarding the production pollution function and consumption
   pollution function. The theoretical approach proves that unemployment
   does not occur when we have no concerns about climate change and this
   tightness of pollution would not impact the level of production and
   consumption. The emission intensity, relative labour size and tightness
   of pollution targets are the key elements discussed in both Autarky and
   trade. The critical point about trade is that it enters specialization,
   and the home country only produces good 1 and the foreign country only
   produces good 2. The main finding of this paper, based on a simple
   theoretical approach, is about the impact of one unit change in relative
   labour size regarding pollution tightness with respect to the labour
   force of both home and foreign countries is provided at the end.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether and to what extent the bandwagon effect and
   the spiral of silence impact opinion formation in a polarized context,
   where individuals tend to be persistent in their policy attitudes.
   Focusing on contentious policy issues at the heart of the culture war in
   American politics, our aim is to study the relative importance of
   attitude persistence and social conformity in the opinion-formation
   process, and how these responses depend on individuals' ideological
   commitments. We conducted an experimental study of US citizens, where
   participants donated money to organizations advocating opposed positions
   on seven of the most contentious issues in American politics. Utilizing
   the presentation of opinion polls as a treatment, the findings are
   threefold. First, we show that polls cause ideologically moderate people
   to abandon the minority and conform to the majority opinion regardless
   of the issue at stake. By contrast, we show that attitude persistence
   prevails among ideologically extreme people. Second, we demonstrate that
   seeing polls generally demobilizes people with minority views. Third, we
   find that opinion-conversion and demobilization jointly undermine
   minority opinions, while only a small minority of extremists repels both
   mechanisms. These findings have important implications for research on
   opinion formation in today's polarized political landscape.},

Abstract = {This article develops an explanatory framework of institutional change
   in intergovernmental relations. Using new institutionalism, we focus on
   a main explanatory factor-the players' perceptions of their own
   accountability and that of others. Integrating the concepts of multiple
   accountability and felt accountability, we develop the concept of an
   accountability gap, meaning differences between the perceptions of
   players in the central government about their responsibility to provide
   local services and the perceptions of players at the local level about
   their responsibilities. Our claim is that perceptual gaps concerning
   accountability in a two-tiered or multi-tiered system may influence
   their interests, strategies, and behavior and hence determine the timing
   and pace of specific institutional changes. We illustrate the
   theoretical framework by examining how Spain managed the COVID-19
   pandemic. Related ArticlesAguado, N. Alexander. 2018. ``Mayor-Council

Title = {A Jihadi Critique of the Modern State: Abu Qatada in Conversation with
   Decolonial and (neo-)Marxist Thought},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},

Volume = {51},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the reception of decolonial and neo-Marxist thought
   in a jihadist critique of the modern state. The author argues that a
   study of Abu Qatada al-Filis?ini, a prominent theorist of modern
   Jihadism and Salafism, reveals his nuanced interaction with theories of
   hegemony, ideology, and decolonization. An examination of Abu Qatada's
   critique of modern state institutions and ideology shows that he engages
   with philosophical critiques of sovereignty, hegemony, capitalism, and
   the nation-state and utilizes both neo-Marxist and decolonial thought.
   This paper explores how Abu Qatada theorizes the modern state as a
   colonial project, leading him to rationalize jihad, or violent
   resistance, as the only solution to realize paradigmatic change. It
   further shows how Abu Qatada justifies opposition to the modern state
   and hegemony with seamless deployment of scripture and Islamic
   jurisprudence and insists that his political project builds on premodern
   Islamic theories of knowledge and government necessary for
   decolonization, albeit often without offering details. This study
   reveals a feature of jihadist thought that has remained largely
   unnoticed in the literature and is the first to explore the interactions
   between Salafism and critiques of the modern state.},

Abstract = {The maritime domain has emerged as an emblematic arena for geopolitical
   maneuvering, economic synergy, and strategic competition in the 21st
   century. As the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has assumed
   greater resonance, the maritime component of this corridor, often
   referred to as the ``Maritime Silk Road,{''} holds the potential to
   reshape and nurtures the economic and geopolitical landscape in the
   Indian Ocean region. The blue economy encompasses various sectors,
   including fisheries, shipping, renewable energy, and trade while plays
   as a catalyst in the economic prosperity and sustainability of coastal
   nations. This research aims to explore the multifaceted geopolitical
   implications of the maritime cooperation between Pakistan and China,
   with a specific focus on its profound impact on the blue economy. This
   blue web of strategic nexus has potential in the terms of diplomatic,
   military, and economic ties, while capable of harnessing cultural,
   technological, and educational exchanges. Gwadar Port, the gateway to
   the Arabian Sea, has emerged as a pivotal factor in this equation due to
   its role in fostering regional and international interconnectivity.
   However, this is also vulnerable to growing security, environmental, and
   geopolitical rivalries.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the challenges, prospects, and security policies of
   the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Political-Security
   Community within the ASEAN through a review of regional studies, an
   evaluation of theoretical approaches in the context of international
   relations, and an examination of case studies related to regional
   security in Southeast Asia. The challenges faced are complex, including
   China's growing influence, unresolved regional disputes, the strict
   principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of member states,
   and ASEAN's inability to safeguard human rights in the region. Through
   case study analysis, this paper concludes that the principle of
   multilateralism is being tested by the complex relationships and
   interactions among the states within ASEAN. Measuring the progress of
   security cooperation within the ASEAN cooperation framework has proven
   difficult due to the complexity of geopolitical and geoeconomic
   interests, as well as territorial boundaries. ASEAN's inherently weak
   foundation further complicates this assessment. Moreover, regional
   developments have limited ASEAN's capacity to fulfill its fundamental
   objective of building a stable political environment in Southeast Asia.
   Ongoing developments in the region have constrained ASEAN's capacity to
   effectively fulfill its core mission of creating a stable political
   environment in the region.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the phenomenon of defections in political parties
   through a case study that focuses on Quebecois elected representatives.
   Interviews with former parliamentarians and an analysis of media
   discourse about their departure document the motivations for leaving a
   party or joining another one. This research proposes two innovative
   typologies: the first identifies the types of defections, and the second
   explores the motivations for leaving. The analyses show that Quebec
   elected representatives leave mainly because of value and policy
   conflicts and very little for prestige. A dialogue with Hirshman's work
   also illustrates the role of speaking and listening in the decision to
   leave or stay.},

Abstract = {The twenty-year period of modernization of the Russian economy under the
   leader-ship of Vladimir Putin, prior to the invasion of Ukraine in z0zz,
   was characterized by a consistent trend towards a statist domestic
   orientation, coupled with an increasingly radical policy of financial
   openness. Despite numerous domestic economic reforms, which were
   oriented towards free-market principles, being either reversed or
   signifi-cantly altered, foreign economic policy reforms proved to be
   more enduring. In this paper, I argue that the differential outcomes
   along the axis of internal and external economic reforms are
   interrelated. The absence of a robust rule of law domesti-cally enabled
   the reversal of privatization reforms, but also made financial openness
   policies more appealing to political elites. Furthermore, the society's
   expectation of welfare paternalism enabled the regime to tolerate the
   negative aspects of greater integration by relying on distributive
   policies rather than widespread repression. In contrast, I demonstrate
   that the inheritance of a less developed welfare state and an
   over-reliance on repression led the Chinese Communist Party to adopt a
   more cau-tious approach towards financial integration.},

Abstract = {China does not permit dual nationality, meaning migrants in Australia
   must evaluate the benefits of Chinese versus Australian citizenship.
   Decisions about competing citizenship statuses are informed not only by
   this prohibition of dual nationality but also by individuals' classed
   positions. By comparing the choices of trade skilled migrants from
   different backgrounds in China, this paper shows that homeland social
   class is a key factor in decision-making processes, particularly the
   uniquely Chinese spatial expression of class manifested through the
   hukou system and the differential local citizenship this entails. An
   analysis of representative cases illustrates the complexities of
   evaluating memberships acquired through migration and nested memberships
   resulting from local citizenship with China. People from different
   backgrounds and, importantly, different places in China's socio-spatial
   hierarchy value their Chinese legal status differently. The differential
   effects, both material and symbolic, of membership in or exclusion from
   urban centres in China form a critical part of individuals'
   calculations, over and above the national-level membership within which
   local hukou citizenship is nested.},

Abstract = {Inter- and transdisciplinarity (ITD) has been part of political science
   for quite some time now, but although political science regularly deals
   with its self-understanding, the consequences for research and
   researchers of ITD have not yet been systematically considered. To
   stimulate this debate, we conceptualize ITD as a spectrum of knowledge
   integration, application, and participation. We use International
   Relations norm research as a theoretical framework to describe, analyze,
   and reflect on ITD as a normative dynamic. Autoethnographically and
   through participatory observation, we examine ITD as a normative
   dynamic, with insights from three research projects in the field of
   sustainability. Specifically, we ask what implications ITD has for
   researchers and research in political science. As a result, we find that
   ITD offers both opportunities and challenges. In the context of
   knowledge integration, we discuss the importance of the participation of
   political science in major societal issues in contrast to ITD's
   preferences for a particular understanding of knowledge and research. We
   reflect on ITD's application bias in terms of problem-solving
   opportunities and output orientation. In addition, we consider the
   participation postulate of ITD and weigh potential democratizing effects
   against the conditions under which these might be realized. Finally, we
   address where further research seems useful to continue reflection on
   ITD.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the relational dynamics between the Pacific
   Alliance and Mercosur from 2011 to 2022. It seeks to understand the
   moments of advancement and retraction of both regional processes by
   discussing the current situation and the prospects for strengthening the
   convergence between them. The study is based on data analysis-documents,
   reports, news, and institutional archives-that highlight how the
   negotiations between Mercosur and the Pacific Alliance were conducted. A
   literature review complements the analysis by reinforcing the concepts
   applied in this study to support the research hypothesis-that initial
   competition between the Pacific Alliance and Mercosur was overcome by
   efforts to manage the differences between them, which culminated in an
   ongoing dialog between the blocs. Still, the endogenous problems of
   Latin American integration processes and ideological differences between
   the national governments have resulted in challenges for the advancement
   of a convergence and the establishment of common trade policies. To
   overcome such differences, it is essential to reach cooperation
   agreements that transcend the elimination of tariffs between the two
   regional projects. The first steps toward restoring the convergence
   agenda require political willingness to overcome ideological
   differences, as well as clear interest and engagement from the economic
   elites.},

Title = {Economic Notes on the Concept of Political Power},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL POWER},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 15},
Abstract = {These notes offer an unusual perspective on democracy by interpreting
   key categories of political science through the lens of economics,
   specifically drawing from the `theory of the firm' literature. Due to
   incomplete contracts, political power is conceptualized as a variable
   quantum that balances power resources with constitutional and electoral
   constraints. Accordingly, the proposed model is used to explain how the
   amount of power can vary over time, what its determinants are, and what
   mechanisms can lead to political regime change in an era of world
   polarized by democracies and autocracies.},

Abstract = {Universities are increasingly interested in providing courses that equip
   students with data science skills and engage experiential learning,
   particularly in the social sciences. However, these courses can be
   costly to implement and time-consuming for instructors to develop. This
   article describes an integrative learning model for teaching
   computational social science skills to undergraduate students. There are
   three elements to the model: content delivery through collaborative
   learning, skill development in an applied lab setting, and student
   mentorship. I apply this model to an experiential course where
   undergraduate students learn to create and conduct a national public
   opinion poll. The model addresses the need for university classes that
   equip undergraduate students with computational social science skills,
   and provides a pathway for training student researchers as teaching
   assistants for future courses. This model builds the research capacity
   of faculty, graduate assistants, and undergraduates, invests in data
   science by providing an infrastructure for the collection of large scale
   data over time, and integrates experiences inside and outside of the
   classroom. This model is replicable at other institutions and will be of
   benefit to programs seeking to implement best practices and maximize
   learning effectiveness through research integration.},

Abstract = {I rely on data from 31,754 electoral districts in the United States from
   1834 until 2016 to explore how the nationalization of politics occurs
   within districts. I argue that in the early stages of the American
   democracy local concerns were more prominent in the distant districts
   from the capital city than in the nearby districts, and therefore the
   number of parties was greater in the former than in the latter. However,
   these differences vanished after the New Deal, when authority was
   centralized. Nationalization reduced the number of parties everywhere,
   but above all in the most distant district from Washington, D.C.},

Abstract = {Using October, 2016 data from a nationally representative sample of U.S.
   adults (N = 1,461), this study considers the extent to which social
   structure and culture worked together to activate affinities for Donald
   Trump. For our analyses, we used multiple regressions and first focused
   on the extent to which social structural locations (e.g., gender,
   race/ethnicity, age, education, rurality) were associated with a
   willingness to trust Trump and report intentions to vote for him. Then,
   we considered partisanship affiliations. Finally, we looked at the
   extent to which hegemonically masculine, racial/ethnic and nativist, and
   authorities on truth values helped to further establish affinities for
   Trump. Findings indeed revealed that cultural value contestations were
   central to establishing affinities for Trump. Such beliefs even remained
   linked to intentions to vote for Trump after accounting for adults'
   trust in him.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A growing literature studies the relationship between ideological and
   affective polarization. By taking a Downsian approach to affective
   polarization we contribute to this literature and demonstrating that
   affective polarization is driven by congruence between citizens and
   their party, relative to other parties, in the general
   liberal-conservative space and across a host of salient issue domains.
   We find robust support for our theory using individual-level national
   election survey data from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany,
   and Finland. Moreover, we find that ideological differences inform
   affective polarization independently from partisan identifications and
   that they drive more out-party animosity than in-party affinity. These
   findings have implications towards a more unified understanding of the
   citizen determinants of affective polarization and the role ideology
   plays in shaping the views held by partisans across democracies.},

Abstract = {During crises, do emergency politics impair the EU polity by alienating
   Europeans? Recent literature suggests that executive decisions in hard
   times can spur negative European sentiment, increase polarisation in the
   public and thus create more problems than solutions. The Covid-19
   pandemic offers an ideal opportunity to study this important issue.
   However, studying mass sentiment towards the EU is mostly constrained by
   imperfect survey data. We tackle this challenge with an empirical
   strategy that combines two original data sources: first, we use policy
   process analysis to identify key EU decisions; second, we leverage
   Twitter data to measure sentiment. As a result, we can study whether key
   EU decisions impacted EU sentiment and whether this impact is
   conditional on the level of EU competence, prior politicisation and
   problem pressure. We find that EU decisions impact EU sentiment
   positively and do not polarise it (even among highly politicised
   decisions). Low prior politicisation and healthcare-related decisions
   increase the positive impact of EU actions. There is thus no punishment
   of the EU for acting outside its remit. Our findings have important
   implications for the politics of polity maintenance in the EU.},

Abstract = {Populist radical right parties (PRRPs) have become more mainstream,
   increasing their relevance in European politics. While a lot is already
   known about them, there are still gaps in our knowledge. This article
   addresses one such gap by studying Western European PRRPs' positions on
   education policy. It focuses on the salience of education in election
   manifestos, substantive positions that parties hold, and in how far
   these positions reflect their core ideology. Constructing a novel
   framework based on core ideologies and three dimensions of education
   policies, including an often-neglected content dimension, the article
   presents results from a qualitative content analysis of 15 manifestos.
   The results show that education policy is relevant for PRRPs, albeit to
   varying degrees, and that their policies are informed by their core
   ideologies. The findings have important implications for understanding
   education policy dynamics in liberal democracies as PRRPs fundamentally
   challenge normative foundations of Western European education systems.},

Abstract = {The 51st (Highland) Division surrendered to the Germans on 12 June 1940.
   The force lost at St Valery was made up not only of Scots, but also
   English, Welsh, French and French Colonial troops. But in recent decades
   the division's loss has been recast as a story of solely Scottish loss,
   deployed in narratives of grievance and victimhood. We contrast the
   mythology with the historical reality, in the context of the
   distribution of `fake history' in the service of nationalist politics
   (English 2021).
   This paper considers three aspects of the events of 1940:
   1. The creation, development and use of the mythology.
   2. The nature of the 51st Highland Division - how `Highland', how
   `Scottish' was the force lost at St Valery?
   3. The actual events of May-June 1940.
   We do this by drawing together existing and new scholarship, including
   more from French perspectives than is common, to summarise knowledge in
   an accessible form for a wider audience.},

Abstract = {This essay is part of a special issue celebrating 50 years of Political
   Theory. The ambition of the editors was to mark this half century not
   with a retrospective but with a confabulation of futures. Contributors
   were asked: What will political theory look and sound like in the next
   century and beyond? What claims might political theorists or their
   descendants be making in ten, twenty-five, fifty, a hundred years' time?
   How might they vindicate those claims in their future contexts? How will
   the consistent concerns of political theorists evolve into the questions
   critical for people decades or centuries from now? What new problems
   will engage the political theorists (or their rough equivalents) of the
   future? What forms might those take? What follows is one of the many
   confabulations published in response to these queries.},

Abstract = {Permanent campaigning has been widely examined in electoral scholarship.
   However, few studies have looked at paid online political advertising or
   compared the degree to which different types of actor engage in
   permanent campaigns. To fill these gaps, we present an in-depth study of
   online political advertising within the UK to provide new insight into
   the dynamics of the permanent campaign. Analyzing data from the Facebook
   advertising archive between 2018 and 2021, we reveal how Facebook
   advertising is utilized by parties, party leaders and nonparty campaign
   groups during electoral and non-electoral periods. We find that parties,
   political leaders and satellite campaign groups focus their activity
   primarily on general election periods and often invest little outside
   these periods. In contrast, nonpartizan campaign groups utilize
   advertising more evenly in electoral and non-electoral periods. Our
   findings raise questions about the extent to which online political
   advertising is used for permanent campaigning by different groups.},

Abstract = {This essay is part of a special issue celebrating 50 years of Political
   Theory. The ambition of the editors was to mark this half century not
   with a retrospective but with a confabulation of futures. Contributors
   were asked: What will political theory look and sound like in the next
   century and beyond? What claims might political theorists or their
   descendants be making in ten, twenty-five, fifty, a hundred years' time?
   How might they vindicate those claims in their future contexts? How will
   the consistent concerns of political theorists evolve into the questions
   critical for people decades or centuries from now? What new problems
   will engage the political theorists (or their rough equivalents) of the
   future? What forms might those take? What follows is one of the many
   confabulations published in response to these queries.},
