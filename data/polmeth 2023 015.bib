Title = {What makes communism possible? The self-realisation interpretation},
Journal = {POLITICS PHILOSOPHY \& ECONOMICS},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In the Critique of Gotha Programme, Karl Marx famously argues that a
   communist society will be characterised by the principle, `From each
   according to his abilities, to each according to his needs!' I take up a
   question about this principle that was originally posed by G.A. Cohen,
   namely: what makes communism (so conceived) possible for Marx? In reply
   to this question, Cohen interprets Marx as saying that communism is
   possible because of limitless abundance, a view that Cohen takes to be
   implausible for ecological reasons. I develop a new interpretation of
   Marx's position. On this interpretation, people in communist society
   achieve self-realisation through providing others with the goods and
   services required for their self-realisation. Coupled with a reasonably
   high (but not immense) development of productive power, self-realisation
   generates conditions in which people can produce according to their
   abilities and receive according to their needs. I defend this view as an
   interpretation of Marx and I argue that it represents a more plausible
   account of what makes communism possible than Cohen's interpretation in
   which technological advance and limitless abundance play the predominant
   role.},

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Geographers have connected the experiences of disabled persons with
   specific socio-spatial-political phenomena such as disability policies
   and laws, economic conditions, disability movements, and welfare
   systems. However, debates over disability theories and accessibility
   rights have lacked empirical data representing the perspectives of
   disabled people in Asia. In this study, the first to explore experiences
   with accessibility in an inter-Asian context, the daily experiences of
   disabled people in two Southeast Asian countries (Thailand and Vietnam)
   and two Northeast Asian countries (Japan and Taiwan) were compared. In
   each country, 10 wheelchair- or crutch-using residents of a large city
   were invited to be interviewed, of whom 39 participated. Results showed
   that disabled people's daily experiences are influenced by the cultural
   and historical contexts in which the concept of disability has been
   constructed. Attitudinal and cultural barriers to accessibility should
   be further examined, and Asian contexts should be included in the
   political geography of disability.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis research aims to examine the US-China policy shift from
   Obama to Biden emphasizing the centrality of Taiwan question in the
   geostrategic competition with Beijing and its prospect if the US
   strategy remains unchanged.Design/methodology/approachA conceptual
   framework is outlined, illustrating how the US grand strategy is driven
   by the ideological foundation of Exceptionalism. The paper highlights
   the associated US policy changes that evolved from Obama to Trump and
   then Biden to advance Washington's strategic interests in its rivalry
   with China over Taiwan.FindingsBiden's policy led to an escalating
   geopolitical competition with Beijing over Taiwan to maintain US
   supremacy. The Biden administration is more stringent than the previous
   administrations on the Taiwan question and there is the conviction that
   the USA must not back down on Taiwan because the alternative will be a
   retraction of US world primacy to Beijing. With Washington's persistent
   hegemonic strategy, the US-China confrontation over Taiwan seems
   inevitable.Originality/valueThe research highlights how the Biden
   administration managed a perpetuated Ukraine crisis and forged
   unprecedented high-level ties with Taiwan, indicating the
   administration's determination to exacerbate contentions with Beijing
   over Taiwan rather than de-escalate.},

Abstract = {My article investigates Marx's dissertation from the perspective of the
   categories of Hegelian logic employed in the writings on the critique of
   political economy and, in particular, in the analysis of the value-form
   (Wertform) in Capital. The aim of my contribution is to show how Marx's
   early writing is not intended as a mere `exercice encore scolaire'
   (Althusser), but as the first documented confrontation with Hegel's
   logic. Marx's early writing displays a moment of elaboration and
   acquisition of Hegel's method. I argue that the Epicurean atom
   represents a developing contradiction, and that the dissertation follows
   a precise Darstellung, which extends from the metaphysical and physical
   principle to the abstract subjectivity of Epicurean atomism.},

Abstract = {A gulf between constitutional and everyday perspectives is prevalent,
   and often overlain by gender divisions. To explore how this gulf can be
   bridged to allow for the inclusion of everyday concerns in
   constitutional discussion, we engaged with women in the Irish border
   area, a region where constitutional difference has striking effects in
   daily life. We held a series of small-scale deliberative cafes on
   cross-border health provision, which is linked to dysfunctions of
   regional governance and contentious constitutional issues. We asked if
   such open-ended deliberation allows everyday concerns to `scale out' to
   wider territorial units and `scale up' to the constitutional question.
   We found that the deliberative cafe, a radically inclusive method,
   facilitated a limited scaling up and out from everyday experience:
   participants collectively and credibly defined systemic dysfunctions on
   the regional level with policy implications for constitutional
   discussion. Although participants raised important political issues,
   they did not easily move from regional to constitutional discussion. We
   argue that this discursive disjuncture between regionalist policy and
   constitutional politics derives from a tension between wider regionalist
   state discourses (which determinedly avoid constitutional contention)
   and constitutional discourses (which lack a spatial dimension and assume
   one `ideal' public rather than engage with many existing publics).},

Abstract = {This article uses Marx's idea of commodity fetishism and subsequent
   theories of rei-fication to understand the social construction of race.
   Race is typically defined as a socially-constituted category that is
   mischaracterised as a natural one. The goal of this article, in
   contrast, is to explain how this mischaracterisation arises. In addition
   to this main objective, the article uses this explanation of race to
   contest recent attempts that locate the `persistent entanglement' of
   race and capital in their functional relation-ship. Finally, the article
   engages with related, commodity-based theories of race and racism and
   concludes with thoughts on what the socially-constructed category of
   race can teach us about the nature of value and capitalism.},

Abstract = {This article argues how the politics of scale is paradoxically used by
   the Bruneian state in environmental policymaking to legitimate its
   internal authoritarian regime. The literatures on post-politics, green
   authoritarianism and green as `spectacle' are used in conjunction with
   personal observation findings on forestry protection and climate change
   policymaking processes, and triangulation with global environmental
   performance indices, to explore this paradox. The Bruneian state must
   justify a strong environmental policy implementation rhetoric, whilst
   simultaneously having to maintain its domestic authoritarian functioning
   that relies on fossil fuel extraction and exportation. It does this by
   engaging in a `consensual' neoliberal post-politics that uses
   supra-national and international environmental policy frameworks and
   settings that are liberal democratic and polycentric in nature, through
   a `post-politics of scale'. This article contributes to the wider
   territory, politics and governance literature by illustrating how
   internal enviro-political tensions are remedied, inculcated across, and
   discursively influenced by, wider geographical spaces and politics
   beyond individual states, regardless of their political regime type.},

Title = {A road scheme, the state, and the detournement of urban space: Henri
   Lefebvre and competing publics in postwar Hyde Park, London},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {107},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Henri Lefebvre develops the term, de ` tournement, to help analyse how
   certain events can make urban spaces more `plastic' and uncertain and
   thus more readily malleable for appropriation by groups and
   organisations. In the literature, however, there has less been
   discussion about how events of de ` tournement can lead to often intense
   dialogue and internal divisions within and between state departments,
   and between the state and groups in civil society about how these
   uncertain spaces can be moulded strategically to suit certain agendas
   and projects. This paper starts to fill this scholarly gap by applying
   Lefebvre's insights to examine the Park Lane Road Improvement Scheme in
   London, 1955-1962. This road scheme built a dual carriageway system
   between Hyde Park Corner and Marble Arch and unintentionally generated a
   moment of de ` tournement in the surrounding spaces. The paper explores
   how four distinct publics emerged around the road scheme to discuss and
   elicit support for their respective agendas on how these uncertain
   spaces might be `stabilised' once more. The four publics were: a `civic
   public' assembled by the London County Council; a `local amenities
   public' created by the Royal Fine Arts Commission; a `national heritage
   public' assembled by the Ministry of Works; and a `free speech public'
   constructed by defenders of Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park. The paper
   demonstrates how a road scheme can generate competing claims to
   publicness, which not only incorporate the state, but also open up
   strategic opportunities for progressive movements to extend and develop
   their rights to the city.},

Title = {The News Media Bargaining Code: Impacts on Australian journalism one
   year on},

Abstract = {The Australian News Media Bargaining Code (NMBC) is the first successful
   legislative attempt to compel digital platforms to pay news media
   organisations for third party news content. This paper focuses on the
   NMBC after its first year to explore whether the Code was successful in
   meeting one of its publicly stated purposes; supporting public interest
   journalism. We argue that the Code delivered outcomes that met the
   ACCC's policy objectives around an industry power imbalance, but there
   are several issues that remain unaddressed. Using semi-structured
   interviews from Australian news media executives involved in
   negotiations with Meta and Google during the initial implementation of
   the Code, we explore: (a) how news organisations used financial
   compensation provided by agreements under the Code, (b) how individual
   organisational priorities were framed and articulated, and (c) whether
   these actions have supported public interest journalism in Australia.
   Our findings indicate that many of issues with the Code have emerged
   mostly from the unintended impacts of the Code, including: lack of
   designation of platforms within the legislation, the registration
   criteria for news outlets eligible to enter negotiation, and the
   definition of stakeholder relationships within the legislation.

   El Codigo de Negociacion de Medios de Noticias de Australia (NMBC) es el
   primer intento legislativo exitoso de obligar a las plataformas
   digitales a pagar a las organizaciones de medios de comunicacion por el
   contenido de noticias de terceros. Este documento se centra en el NMBC
   despues de su primer ano para explorar si el Codigo logro cumplir con
   uno de sus propositos declarados publicamente; apoyar el periodismo de
   interes publico. Argumentamos que el Codigo entrego resultados que
   cumplieron con los objetivos de la politica de la ACCC en torno a un
   desequilibrio de poder de la industria, pero hay varios problemas que
   siguen sin abordarse. Usando entrevistas semiestructuradas de ejecutivos
   de medios de comunicacion australianos involucrados en negociaciones con
   Meta y Google durante la implementacion inicial del Codigo, exploramos:
   a) como las organizaciones de noticias usaron la compensacion financiera
   proporcionada por los acuerdos bajo el Codigo, b) como las prioridades
   organizacionales individuales fueron enmarcado y articulado, y c) si
   estas acciones han apoyado el periodismo de interes publico en
   Australia. Nuestros hallazgos indican que muchos de los problemas con el
   Codigo surgieron principalmente de los impactos no deseados del Codigo,
   que incluyen: la falta de designacion de plataformas dentro de la
   legislacion, los criterios de registro para los medios de comunicacion
   elegibles para entrar en negociacion y la definicion de las relaciones
   de las partes interesadas dentro la legislacion.},

Abstract = {Neoliberal educational reforms that emphasize market-based competition
   and individual responsibility have exacerbated socioeconomic segregation
   in the Australian school system, thereby putting underprivileged
   students at a greater disadvantage. This necessitates a renewed focus on
   educational equity. As the public's policy preferences are important in
   policymaking, it is essential to understand the factors that contribute
   to the public's attitudes toward equity-oriented educational policies.
   In this study, we investigated beliefs about collective responsibility
   as a contributing factor. An online survey of adults (N = 1,999)
   conducted in the most populous state in Australia revealed that people's
   beliefs about collective responsibility for socioeconomic achievement
   gaps positively predicted their support for public assistance to
   students and schools in need. Furthermore, people's appraisals of
   educational equity positively predicted their support for public
   assistance, partly due to its positive effects on those beliefs about
   collective responsibility. These results provide insight into ways to
   shape the public's attitudes toward equity-oriented educational
   policies.},

Abstract = {Revolutions are invariably viewed as the violent replacement of an
   existing political order. However, many social innovations that result
   in fundamental institutional and cultural shifts do not occur via force
   nor have clear beginning and ending dates. Focusing on early-modern
   England, we provide the first-ever quantitative inquiry into such quiet
   revolutions. Using existing topic model estimates that leverage caselaw
   and print-culture corpora, we construct annual time series of attention
   to 100 legal and 110 cultural ideas between the mid-sixteenth and
   mid-eighteenth centuries. We estimate the timing of structural breaks in
   these series. Quiet revolutions begin when there are concurrent upturns
   in attention to several related topics. Early-modern England featured
   several quiet, but profound, revolutionary episodes. The financial
   revolution began by 1660. The Protectorate saw a revolution in land law.
   A revolution in caselaw relating to families was underway by the early
   eighteenth century. Elizabethan times saw an increased emphasis on basic
   skills and showed signs of a Puritan revolution affecting both theology
   and ideas on institutions. In the decade before the Civil War, a quiet
   revolution of dissent preceded the turmoil that led to a king's
   beheading.},

Abstract = {The paper explores the economics behind two large-scale rebellions in
   Japan throughout 1532-1536 and 1570-1580, launched by a religious
   organization called Honganji. The paper argues that Honganji's
   large-scale rebellions took off primarily due to religious reforms,
   particularly, the creation of an after-life pardon doctrine, which
   enabled the functioning of more potent incentives that fostered
   participation. First, the doctrine raised the costs of not joining a
   rebellion by excluding the non-participants and consigning them to hell.
   This resulted in immediate spiritual, social and economic penalties, as
   condemned individuals were considered religiously corrupt and were
   expelled from the sect's temple towns and sect-dominated village
   communities. Second, the after-life pardon doctrine reduced the costs of
   rebellious participation by guaranteeing an instant rebirth in paradise
   after dying for the sect's cause. As many individuals at the time saw
   the world through the lens of religion and spirituality, the guarantee
   of paradise was an especially potent incentive to join a rebellion.},

Abstract = {Radical-right populism (RRP) is notably based on the production of
   antagonism involving the `people', the `elite' and `others'. The
   analysis of RRP discourse can be particularly useful to investigate RRP
   geopolitics as the representation of an international situation
   legitimising national and foreign policies. Based on an analysis of
   narratives relating to Ukraine and Russia produced by Viktor Orban, the
   RRP Prime Minister of Hungary, the current article researches a key
   spatial object associated with the people and justifying Orban's
   position concerning the two countries between 2014 and 2022: the
   heartland. This analysis shows that Orban refused to choose his `camp'
   between Russia and Ukraine over many years, preferring to position
   himself as a defender of a people's heartland, the location of which
   changes depending on his addresses and temporal contexts. The defence of
   this heartland generally involves the naming of a clear enemy: the
   Western liberal world.},

Title = {The function of solidarity and its normative implications},
Journal = {ETHICS \& GLOBAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 5},
Abstract = {Many lament that solidarity is declining, implying there is something
   good about it; but what is solidarity and why should we want it? Here,
   we defend an original functionalist re-interpretation of solidarity.
   Political solidarity plays a key functional role in a polity's
   persistence through time. Thus, we should want institutions that foster
   solidarity. This paper is divided into three parts. In the first, we
   draw on the philosophy of biology to pinpoint what counts as a proper
   function, in a way that is naturalistic, objective, and selective. On
   this aetiological account, a sharp distinction between functional needs
   (e.g. the pumping of blood) and functional mechanisms (e.g. the valve
   that pumps blood) is drawn. In the second part of the paper, we propose
   that solidarity should be understood as an aetiological function of
   society. This new conception sheds light on the widely acknowledged, yet
   seldom clarified connection between two common readings of solidarity:
   solidarity as a set of feelings of mutual kinship (its functional need),
   and solidarity as a set of redistributive institutions (a key functional
   mechanism). The third part concludes that this new functional conception
   of solidarity provides normative reasons to foster solidarity.},

Abstract = {The recent proliferation of settler colonial and Indigenous studies of
   Palestine have addressed the historical and present-day enclosure of
   Palestinian land, yet the question of `indigeneity' is underexamined in
   this literature. Claims to indigeneity in Palestine straddle varied
   definitions: a racial category; as constructed through the colonial
   encounter or preceding colonialism; and as a local relation or an
   international juridico-political category. Using discourse analysis and
   ethnography of a specific Palestinian sustainable agriculture
   initiative, I show how for Palestinians, claiming indigeneity brings
   into tension potential political economic gains, social relations of
   struggle, and discursive formations of collective subjectivity. A
   valorisation and commodification of indigeneity as a racial category
   narrows notions of indigeneity to the biological -cultural, offering
   challenges for Palestinian struggles for sovereignty. I conclude by
   asking what theorising from Palestine offers to Marxist theories of
   racial capitalism and settler colonialism, and whether indigeneity can
   exceed its commodification.},

Title = {Evaluating emotional and social interactions in museum liminal spaces: A

Abstract = {BackgroundThis study explores which architectural features of
   interstitial spaces improve visitors' interactions with the overall
   museum space and with other visitors at the National Museum of the
   Islamic Revolution and Holy Defense in Tehran, Iran. Interstitial or
   liminal spaces are defined as ``in-between{''} spaces connecting primary
   spaces in a building that have a key role in relating humans to places.
   ObjectivesThis study asks which geometric features can increase the
   socio-emotional interactions for visitors. MethodsTo answer the
   question, observations of behavior and body language were made at the
   study site. These data were analyzed based on body language science and
   neuroscience literature. Five in-between spaces connecting exhibition
   halls were selected, and visitor behaviors were observed and analyzed
   using the Observer XT software by Noldus. ResultsResults showed that
   certain types of passages were associated with the highest levels of
   emotional interaction, while others are associated with the highest
   levels of social interaction. ConclusionsThe results of this study align
   with earlier neuroscience findings regarding brain activities in
   relation to certain geometries. The methods used in this study can be
   applied by architects and designers in their predesign planning and post
   design evaluation processes to improve socio-emotional interactions for
   visitors.},

Abstract = {PurposeAfrican countries are endowed with both human and natural
   resources. These resources constitute integral components for any
   economic development due to the long-lasting relationship with all
   sectors in an economy, yet there is an obvious disagreement between
   growing economy and employment generation in Africa. Though there has
   been a growing pattern of economic size, particularly the gross domestic
   product (GDP) among African countries, most of these economies are low
   in human development. The disagreement between economic growth and
   employment generation in Africa despite abundant natural resources
   located on the continent calls for public discourse among scholars.
   Therefore, the purpose of the study is to examine the peculiar drivers
   of unemployment intensity in a region characterized by endowed
   resources.Design/methodology/approachThe paper adopts two approaches;
   the authors employed the pooled mean group (PMG) estimator and utilised
   stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to generate a government efficiency
   index between the period 1991 and 2017 among sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
   countries.FindingsThe empirical results through the single
   output-multiple inputs framework indicate that on average, there is a
   low level of government efficiency towards increasing the objective of
   human development in Africa. However, in the long run, natural resource
   endowment has a positive and significant relationship with employment
   generation for SSA. Hence, the study established that a low level of
   government efficiency has a long-lasting effect on low human development
   experienced in Africa.Social implicationsThe need to improve the level
   of government efficiency towards economic development by making both
   human and physical capital more effective will spur the exploration of
   natural resources.Originality/valueThe paper provides an empirical study
   of the effectiveness and efficiency of government through PMG and SFA in
   establishing the relationship between government approaches and
   employment level in selected SSA countries.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the use of HMDA data for CRA-rated (Community
   Reinvestment Act) banks to study possible bank loan discrimination
   against minorities from 2007 to 2016. We examine banks rated Outstanding
   for compliance with the CRA, which means that regulators believe that
   these banks are doing an outstanding job at serving low- and
   moderate-income neighborhoods. We expect that CRA Outstanding rated
   banks are unlikely to commit taste-based discrimination. We find that
   these banks have statistical discrimination in loan approvals for Asian,
   Black, Hispanic, and women borrowers. We also find that these banks have
   statistical discrimination against white males without co-applicants
   relative to the omitted group of white males with co-applicants. This
   result is inconsistent with taste-based discrimination. We conclude that
   either the models or the HMDA data are ill-suited for studying lending
   discrimination.},

   which introduced a limit on realized capital expenditures only for
   municipalities above a given population threshold (5000 residents). One
   possible interpretation of our results is that by exploiting the
   imperfect knowledge of voters, policymakers benefit from promising
   overly ambitious investment plans. The introduction of some form of
   capital-expenditure limit makes these promises less credible, and helps
   to bring spending plans in line with reality. Furthermore, we find that
   capital revenues are also overestimated, and that the forecast accuracy
   of these revenues improves due to the reform. This is in line with our
   political-economy interpretation: as there is less room to inflate
   expenditures, politicians also have fewer incentives to indulge in
   window-dressing on the revenue side.},

Title = {Recognition Crisis: Coming to Terms with Identity, Attention and

Abstract = {The theory of recognition has much to offer the field of political
   communication as it struggles to comprehend communicative dysfunctions,
   political polarization and governing crises across the industrialized
   democracies. Drawing on the work of Axel Honneth, Charles Taylor, Nancy
   Fraser and Michele Lamont, as well as more recent contributions, we put
   recognition theory into conversation with some of our field's
   contemporary concerns. In particular, we show how the theory offers
   depth, nuance and synthesis to progress communication scholars are
   making in the study of how attention economics and social identity shape
   perceptions and communications in a hybrid political media system. In
   the process, we argue that we are experiencing a historically novel
   phase of recognition, in which the granting and denial of recognition
   are transformed at the individual level by the affordances of
   many-to-many social networking platforms, and at the group level by the
   use of recognition for attracting attention to commodified media
   properties. At the intersection of the modern attention economy,
   heightened articulation of identity-based messaging, and recognition
   processes is what we term a recognition crisis, in which claims of
   misrecognition by multiple, conflictual groups are unresolvable and
   undermine the solidarity that grounds social and political life. We
   conclude with a roadmap of new opportunities to understand existing
   research findings and pose new research questions. Moreover, we show
   that the field of political communication has a great deal to offer
   discussions of recognition occurring in related fields of the social
   sciences.},

Abstract = {We analyze the consequences of political polarization between domestic
   policymakers for inter-national policy coordination or delegation to a
   common agency. Coordination is preferred under political polarization if
   it allows to constrain the policy of policymakers with different policy
   targets, while delegation allows to determine policies in the future by
   selecting the appropriate agent. Policymakers have different preferences
   concerning international coordination and which form it should take.
   These differences are increasing in political polarization. They agree
   on delegation if election outcomes are close to being random.},

Title = {Islamist terrorism and the status of women},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We investigate the effect of Islamist terrorist activity on women's
   legal position in society, using data for 171 countries between 1970 and
   2016. To identify causal effects, we exploit the prevalence of Islamist
   terrorism in neighboring countries as an exogenous source of variation,
   arguing that regional terrorism affects local terrorism through
   contagion effects. We show that increased activity by Islamist terrorist
   groups is linked to lower legal status of women. By contrast, we find
   that neither Islam per se nor other types of terrorism have comparable
   effects. This reinforces the notion that Islamist terrorism is
   singularly interested and effective in weakening women's rights. Our
   results are consistent with a rational-economic model of terrorism,
   where Islamist terrorists purposefully use violence to maximize
   political utility, while governments make concessions that constrain the
   role of women because the costs of compliance are lower than the harm
   from continued Islamist terrorism.},

Abstract = {Discourses of urgency have dominated adaptation responses to climate
   change, necessitating fast and decisive action. These discourses are
   particularly apparent in low-lying island states due to rising sea
   levels. Tuvalu, an atoll state in the South Pacific, has engaged in land
   reclamation projects as a means of adaptation. Focusing on these
   projects, I explore how chronopolitics can help tease apart the complex
   spatialities and temporalities which underpin adaptation. Chronopolitics
   describes the relationship between the politics of individuals and
   groups and their perspective on time, thus it can help to unpack how
   time perceptions shape adaptation decision-making processes. Drawing on
   fieldwork in the South Pacific and COP24 in Poland, I contend that
   adaptation serves as a performative process that supports alternative
   climate futures. Within this paper, I use critical geopolitics to show
   how these futures are suffused with power relations, at domestic,
   international and financial levels. Moreover, through an examination of
   the 2019 Pacific Island Forum, I argue that land reclamation serves as a
   visible, material resource to enrol in performative forms of diplomacy.
   Subsequently, I show how it is imperative that geographers, and social
   scientists more broadly, are attentive to the temporality and spatiality
   of adaptation to understand its political potential.},

Abstract = {How did technological upgrading in the Baltics during the transition
   from planned to market economy affect labour? Existing academic
   literature would imply a skill-biased or polarising effect. However, we
   find that the opposite is likely true-technological upgrading
   predominantly benefited lower skilled workers. This is explained by an
   abundance of lower skilled labour, which fostered the usage of less
   advanced technologies that such workers could utilise. This article
   contributes to the discussion on the relationship between technology and
   labour by highlighting that technological upgrading may lead to
   low-skill-biased change.},

Abstract = {This qualitative study analyzes the perceptions of US women political
   candidates about their local news coverage at a pivotal moment of change
   in both journalism and electoral politics. Through an intersectional
   approach, in-depth interviews with thirty-seven women who recently ran
   for office from 2016 to 2020 revealed findings in two areas of news
   research: local news declines and gender bias in political news. First,
   massive declines in local news capacities have trickled into local
   political communication, which, along with affordances of social media,
   point to a decline in relevance of local media to local campaigns.
   Second, participants perceived bias in their news coverage based on an
   identity intersecting with their gender, partisan affiliation, or both.
   Their experiences offered two potential ways forward for local news to
   reattain relevancy in local elections in countries of local news
   declines: through accountability journalism, and by diversifying staff
   to meet the needs of a diversifying electoral slate of candidates.},

Abstract = {Many fear that social media enable more potent influence operations than
   traditional mass media. This belief is widely shared yet rarely tested.
   We challenge this emerging wisdom by comparing social media and
   television as vectors for influence operations targeting Ukraine. This
   article develops a theoretical framework based on media structure,
   showing how and why decentralized and centralized media offer distinct
   opportunities and challenges for conducting influence operations. This
   framework indicates a relative advantage for television in both
   dissemination and persuasiveness. We test this framework against the
   Russo-Ukrainian conflict (before the 2022 escalation), contributing new
   data from a national survey and a new dataset of Telegram activity. We
   identify fifteen disinformation narratives, and, using statistical
   analysis, examine correlations between media consumption, audience
   exposure to, and agreement with, narratives, and foreign policy
   preferences. To explore causal mechanisms, we follow up with content
   analysis. Findings strongly support our theoretical framework. While
   consuming some partisan social media channels is correlated with
   narrative exposure, there is no correlation with narrative agreement.
   Meanwhile, consumption of partisan television channels shows clear and
   consistent correlation. Finally, agreement with narratives also
   correlates with foreign policy preferences. However, and importantly,
   findings indicate the overall limitations of influence operations.},

Abstract = {Joining the Army, a new installation or a new unit are times of
   significant stress for Soldiers. Support provided during these
   transitions can affect unit cohesion, Soldier well-being, retention, and
   mission readiness. This research aimed to explore how Soldiers
   experience the Army onboarding process as well as perceptions of the
   welcome experience. Nineteen focus groups were conducted with 120
   Soldiers using a semistructured interview protocol. Thematic analysis of
   focus group transcripts revealed two major themes, varied welcome
   experience and an inconsistent Total Army Sponsorship Program. Soldiers
   reported varied transition experiences ranging from positive, neutral,
   nonexistent, to negative. Results indicate that Soldiers welcome
   experience was dependent on the specific installation, leaders, and
   unit. Findings demonstrate that at the installation and unit level, the
   Army currently lacks standardized processes for onboarding new service
   members. We note the research limitations and offer several
   recommendations that can be drawn from the present findings.},

Abstract = {James Buchanan would have celebrated his 100th birthday in 2019. This
   serves as an inspiration to look at the future of public choice and the
   question of how much normativity public choice can bear. In our analysis
   we draw parallels between public choice and German ordoliberalism (and
   its source in the Freiburg School of Economics). We argue that the
   reception of ordoliberalism exemplifies easy-to-grasp pitfalls that
   should be taken seriously. We anchor the future agenda of public choice
   in a solid individualist perspective. Similar to ordoliberalism, public
   choice will have to clarify its relation to normative economics. The
   effects of rules and institutions and their working properties should be
   thoroughly analyzed empirically. The role of ideas is important for the
   normative foundation of both public choice/ constitutional economics and
   ordoliberalism, and is rooted in normative individualism. It provides a
   benchmark by which rules and institutions can be judged as favorable.},

Abstract = {From the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the social distancing
   measures introduced created a series of social problems and needs that
   were partially addressed in Italy as well as in other countries by
   grassroots mutual aid initiatives. This article analyses these
   initiatives as direct social actions: actions that do not primarily
   focus on claiming something from the state or other power holders, but
   instead on directly transforming some specific aspects of society by
   means of the very action itself. The article addresses the impact of the
   temporality of emergency on solidarity politics by employing a series of
   qualitative interviews and choosing to place the analysis of mutual aid
   initiatives that developed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in
   longer pathways of engagement in direct social action. While many of
   these initiatives were strongly rooted in the Italian social movement
   and civil society landscape and the choice to engage in mutual aid
   activities was the result of long years of reflection and planning, the
   article shows how strongly the temporality of emergency affected the
   nature of these initiatives, their development and their outcomes, in
   particular with regard to the extraordinary number of people who
   volunteered and their relationship with politicisation processes.
   Through this analysis, the article aims to contribute to the
   understanding of a crucial form of action and the influence of
   exceptional contexts on collective action.},

Abstract = {Despite long-standing criticisms, restrictions on price increases during
   emergencies remain widespread in the US. Criticisms most often cite the
   social costs of the shortages, but, we have found another, as yet
   unknown, cost: price-gouging regulations increased social contact during
   the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, thirty-four US
   states declared emergencies, which activated their preexisting
   price-gouging regulations, and eight others introduced new regulation
   along with their emergency declarations. Because these states border
   eight others that also declared emergencies, but had no price-gouging
   regulations, this created a unique natural experiment. Exploiting the
   pandemic-induced variation in regulation, and cellphone mobility data,
   we find that price controls increased visits to, and social contact in,
   commercial spaces, presumably because the regulation-induced shortages
   forced consumers to visit more stores and come in contact with more
   people as they struggled to find what they needed. This, of course,
   undermines social distancing efforts.},

Title = {New or ``normal{''} election? Understanding ranking activity in New York
   City's first ranked choice voting election},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},

Volume = {104},

Abstract = {Objective: Ranked choice voting {[}RCV] is currently seeing a spike in
   interest and is expanding in practice throughout the United States.
   However, the impacts and effects of RCV in the United States are not
   well understood and neither are the driving forces behind voters.
   engagement with it. This article explores what drives a voter's
   willingness to engage with ranking and to what extent.
   Methods: We use New York City exit poll data to analyze what increased
   the likelihood of voters to both participate in any ranking activity
   whatsoever as well as what drove voters to rank several candidates.
   Using both logistic and ordinal logistic regression we analyze how a
   voter's engagement with ranking is impacted by their socioeconomic
   background, their understanding of RCV, and campaign-centered variables.
   Results: Our results show that wealthier, better educated, white voters
   who perceived a more positive campaign environment were more likely to
   engage in ranking. Gender, education, income, campaign tone, and being
   asked to rank a candidate as second or third are shown to be predictors
   of a voter's propensity to rank several candidates.
   Conclusion: Voters engage with RCV when they are provided with
   information on how RCV works and the benefits that come with it. Voters
   who perceive a more positive campaign environment and are explicitly
   asked by candidates to include them in their rankings are more likely to
   maximize their ranking activity.},

Abstract = {This study assesses how perceptions about the quality of legal
   institutions affect entrepreneurial activity across US states. We employ
   survey data from the US Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform
   regarding both the overall perceived institutional quality within a
   state and a multitude of subcategories. With a panel data set covering
   2002-08, we find that along with overall legal quality, entrepreneurial
   activity across states is positively correlated with better perceptions
   about punitive damages, summary judgment, rules of discovery and
   admission of scientific and technical evidence at trial. Interestingly,
   interacting these variables with economic freedom typically generates
   non-results, though this is not the case when considering only
   opportunity entrepreneurship. Implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {Using a new real-time dataset from Beetsma et al. (2020) containing all
   pension reform measures in 23 OECD countries between 1970 and 2017, we
   demonstrate that, in contrast to what one might a priori expect, the
   timing of pension reform measures coincides with business cycle shocks
   and not with current or projected demographic shocks. The OECD-wide
   demography only explains the general reform trend. We rationalize this
   finding using a political-economy model with two-sided adjustment costs
   to explain a lack of response of pension reform measures to changes in
   demographic indicators.},

Abstract = {Because of their integration in the elaboration of national positions in
   the European decision-making process, Belgian subnational entities have
   since the 1990s favoured collaborative paradiplomacy. This has been
   particularly the case for Wallonia and the Brussels Region since they
   have a stronger stake in keeping Belgium together. Cooperative
   paradiplomacy has therefore been their default option, only interrupted
   by the crisis over the signature of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade
   Agreement (CETA) treaty, which was refused by these two regions. This
   article therefore analyses the dynamics of the conflict over the
   signature of the CETA treaty and the specific contribution of the two
   regions, Wallonia and Brussels.},

Abstract = {ObjectivePolitics around the world has become more divisive. We ask if
   the influence of far-right parties extends to personal concerns and
   argue that a theory combining issue ownership with partisan discourse
   can explain personal policy salience. MethodUsing aggregate
   Eurobarometer data, we create compositional models to estimate the
   effect of partisan discourse on pocketbook policy concerns. We focus on
   whether these elite messages influence concerns differently depending on
   the presence of a far-right party. ResultsWe find that more partisan
   discussion about law-and-order issues influences relative personal
   concerns on security and immigration issues across ideological groups
   when a far-right party is present. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that
   an ``issue-owning{''} party can alter how people interpret politics and
   view their own concerns. Far-right parties influence the perceptions of
   people across ideologies. Research showed that these parties can
   influence parties and voters; we show that they can shape personal
   perceptions.},

Abstract = {IntroductionStand your ground (SYG) and castle doctrine (CD) laws are
   presently growing throughout the United States. The present study aims
   to better understand public perceptions of SYG and CD cases and
   demographic factors that influence judicial decision making.
   MethodsParticipants were 204 adults who were randomly assigned one of
   four vignettes that depicted a CD or SYG scenario and varied by
   defendant demographics. After reading the vignette, participants
   completed a questionnaire assessing whether they believed the defendant
   was guilty of the murder and whether the homicide was justified.
   ResultsResults indicated participants were more likely to assign a
   guilty verdict to the SYG scenario, compared to the CD scenario.
   Additionally, participants assigned to the SYG vignette believed the
   male defendant was more justified in killing the victim, compared to
   participants assigned the female defendant. ConclusionResults from this
   study reveal how potential jurors may harbor sex/gender bias in
   determining justifiable homicide in stand your ground cases.},

Title = {Geopolitics of Disability and the Ablenationalism of Refuge},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 4},
Abstract = {Although it has rarely been addressed as such, the regulation of
   disability within migration governance is a geopolitical issue. This
   article examines how refugee resettlement intersects with
   ablenationalism, an ideology that treats disability as exceptional,
   thereby shoring up the exclusionary terms of citizenship. Drawing on
   findings from our multi-sited study (2016-2019) of the resettlement of
   Iraqis to the US, we show how the fantasy of the `disability con' and
   fantasy of the `bogus refugee' feature overlapping logics. Asylum
   officers routinely question asylum seekers' narrations, pointing to
   holes in logic, inconsistencies, embellishment, and perceptions of
   scripted stories as reasons for denying asylum claims. Our study shows
   how these moments of suspicion can double-up or intertwine for refugees
   seeking disability exceptions in the naturalisation process. We argue
   that the disenfranchisement of those who seek naturalisation on these
   grounds reproduces ablenationalist exclusion and shores up a geopolitics
   of impairment and militarised refuge.},

Abstract = {Today's political misinformation has increasingly been created and
   consumed in visual formats, such as photographs, memes, and videos.
   Despite the ubiquity of visual media and the growing scholarly attention
   to misinformation, there is a relative dearth of research on visual
   misinformation. It remains unclear which specific visual formats (e.g.,
   memes, visualizations) and features (e.g., color, human faces)
   contribute to visual misinformation's influence, either on their own or
   in combination with non-visual features and heuristics, and through what
   mechanisms. In response to these gaps, we identify a theoretical
   framework that explains the persuasive mechanisms and pathways of visual
   features in lending credibility (e.g., as arguments, heuristics, and
   attention determinants). We propose a list of relevant visual attributes
   to credibility perceptions and a research agenda that integrates methods
   including computational visual analysis, crowdsourced annotations, and
   experiments to advance our understanding of visual misinformation.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to obtain a recent estimate of the cost of
   precautionary foreign reserve accumulation that emerging market and
   developing economies (EMDEs) had to endure to protect themselves against
   the risks of financial globalization. In addition, the study estimates
   the cost of excess reserves in emerging market economies (EMEs) using
   various reserve adequacy indicators that reflect potential sources of
   foreign exchange drains and vulnerability in EMEs' balance of
   payments.Design/methodology/approachThis paper begins by explaining the
   accumulation of foreign reserves in EMDEs as a self-protection strategy
   against the risks of financial globalization. Next, it sheds light on
   the different types of economic costs of foreign reserve accumulation.
   Finally, it estimates the cost of foreign reserve accumulation in EMEs
   during the period (1990-2018) and in EMDEs during the period (1990-2015)
   due to data availability.FindingsResults indicate that the cost of
   accumulating foreign reserves as a self-protection strategy in EMDEs and
   EMEs' was huge compared to their development financing needs. Applying
   various reserve adequacy measures demonstrates that many of the EMEs
   were holding inadequate precautionary reserves in 2018. Actually, this
   reflects the significant increase in external short term debt that many
   of the EMEs have witnessed since the eruption of the global financial
   crisis (2008). Thus increasing reserves in EMEs with weak reserve
   buffers and higher external debt is critical as they are more vulnerable
   to external shocks and capital flow reversals. Also given the estimated
   huge costs of accumulating foreign reserves, EMDEs should accompany it
   by other complementary self-protection policies and liquidity management
   policies to free up resources for productive
   investment.Originality/valueThe study contributes to the literature by
   estimating the cost of precautionary foreign reserve accumulation
   imposed on EMDEs during an extended period of time that covers a decade
   after the onset of the global financial crisis. Also to the authors'
   knowledge, this is the first study that estimates the cost of excess
   reserves in EMEs using various reserve adequacy indicators including the
   International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessing reserve adequacy (ARA)
   approach.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis study analyzes the performance over the past several years
   of firms that have taken advantage of various COVID-19-related support
   policies. MethodsThis study uses survey data on Japanese firms linked
   with official firm statistics to analyze the productivity and wages over
   the past several years of firms. ResultsThe results indicate that the
   firms that used support policies had lower productivity and wages long
   before the pandemic. Firms that used multiple policy measures and those
   that repeatedly used support policies tended to show additionally lower
   performance. ConclusionsFirm support policies may have the side effect
   of preserving inherently inefficient firms and such a problem may
   increase in severity as support policies become prolonged.},

Abstract = {Research on news credibility and susceptibility to fake news has
   overwhelmingly focused on individual and message-level factors
   explaining why people view some news items as more credible than others.
   We argue that the consistency of the message's content with the dominant
   mainstream narrative can have a powerful explanatory capacity as well,
   particularly in the domain of international news. We test this
   hypothesis experimentally using a sample of 8,559 social media users in
   three post-Soviet countries. Our analyses suggest that the consistency
   with the dominant narrative increases the perceived credibility of
   foreign affairs news independently of their veracity. We also
   demonstrate the moderating role of international conflict, government
   support, and news language in some national contexts but not others.
   Finally, we report how the effects of these factors on credibility vary
   according to whether the news items are real or fabricated and discuss
   the societal implications of our findings.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
   citizen movements initiated in Hong Kong and Chile in 2019. Based on
   discourse analysis and interviews, the study argues that adapting the
   repertoires of protest to the mobility restrictions and the evolution of
   the political systems reinforced the populist dimension of the Anti-ELAB
   (anti-extradition law amendment bill) and the Chilean Spring movements.
   In Hong Kong, the restrictions of freedoms facilitated the constitution
   of a broad international network opposed to the Chinese Communist Party
   that comprises overseas organisations and public figures in exile
   dedicated to lobbying before western governments and providing a
   discourse frame to the diasporic communities. In Chile, the successive
   election campaigns that accompanied the constitutional process allowed
   new political actors with refoundation aspirations to access the
   institutions. This study found, in both cases, that rhetoric based on
   the antagonistic exaltation of the people's signifier has become central
   to the movements' discourses: a transformation accompanied by the
   consolidation of political leaders pretending to represent the
   movements' demands. This study analyses the discourses and demands of
   the citizen movements in light of the institutional framework in which
   they appear and evolve to contribute to the growing literature where the
   study of contemporary social movements intersects with the studies of
   populism.},

Abstract = {Cross-border regions are seen as specific spaces where both
   cosmopolitanism and nationalistic attitudes can spread. It is commonly
   argued that due to the physical proximity to a neighbouring country, the
   development of cross-border encounters and interactions among contiguous
   populations can both favour the emergence of shared supranational
   identifications and reinvigorate nationalistic sentiments. Based on a
   series of semi-structured interviews with inhabitants, this paper
   investigates common patterns of belonging in three European cross-border
   regions. The relatively dispassionate way in which the differences
   created around the border are experienced and communicated by the
   interviewees reveals that although the border continues to significantly
   structure the feelings of belonging of the inhabitants of these regions,
   its centrality and capacity for social polarisation are limited. In the
   context of the European integration process, the analysis shows that
   despite the persistence of the border, it is frequently transcended,
   imbricated with other borders and scales of belonging, and increasingly
   banalised. These findings suggest that border societies are not
   necessarily overdetermined by their geography either towards
   cosmopolitan or nationalistic attitudes.},

Abstract = {For nearly 150 years, the Supreme Court has denounced jurisdictional
   ambiguities in immigration policy, regularly striking down state laws as
   unconstitutional intrusions on the federal government's ``broad,
   undoubted power. `` Most scholarship on the historical evolution of US
   immigration policy has followed suit, rendering invisible the role of
   state governments and federalism in immigration policy during the
   crucial, transformative decades of the Gilded Age and the Progressive
   Era. This article redresses these silences by spotlighting the
   aggressive state policy activism and critical intergovernmental
   negotiations over how to control immigration and noncitizens from the
   1870s to the 1920s. Focusing on two older, eastern seaboard
   states-Maryland and Virginia-and two newer, southwestern states-Arizona
   and New Mexico-these historical case studies show how subnational
   immigration initiatives were fueled by distinctive local and regional
   labor need and racial landscapes. This article also identifies and
   illuminates distinct forms of autonomous, interdependent, insistent, and
   validated activism by states in immigration federalism.},

Title = {Effect of Economic Complexity on Unemployment in Terms of Gender:
   Evidence from BEM Economies},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},

Abstract = {The present study aims to indicate whether structural transformation has
   provided enhancement for the disadvantaged parts of society in terms of
   gender or whether it has been implemented at the expense of social
   inequalities in 10 BEM (Big Emerging Market) economies (Argentina,
   Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, South
   Korea and Turkiye) in the period 1998-2019. The study also aims to
   understand the dynamics behind the connection between structural
   transformation and unemployment by comparing the results from each
   country. This paper also focuses on the effects of economic complexity
   on the breakdown of unemployment rates including female, male, youth
   female and youth male unemployment divisions. In the study, firstly,
   cross-sectional dependence is tested for all variables; secondly, the
   CADF test as a second -generation unit root test is applied; thirdly,
   the parameter constancy test is applied to each model, and then the
   models are estimated using the panel regression method with random
   coefficients. The study reveals a geographical distinction between the
   ten economies. Economic complexity significantly affects all types of
   unemployment in Poland, but it does not affect unemployment in Asian and
   African countries. The other result of the study is that even in Poland,
   the decreasing effect of ECI (Economic Complexity Index) on unemployment
   is different for women and men.},

Title = {The geopolitics of fear: Pro-refugee resistance to Europe's racial
   security},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {109},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article explores pro-migrant resistance in the most vulnerable, yet
   understudied, spot of anti-immigrant regimes, the border city on major
   refugee routes. This piece is part of my multi-sited ethnography tracing
   gateway cities of Europe's Southern borders with the Middle East.
   Against the background of existing scholarship on the shrinking spaces
   of pro-migrant resistance, my findings expose an everyday urbanity that
   is inclusive and protective of refugees in the frontier city. However,
   rather than displaying festive snapshots of sanctuaries, the evidence
   shows that the pro-refugee resistance dwells in a highly contested and
   politicized urban space. Having received the main refugee flow from
   outside of Europe, the European Union tightened external borders
   following the outbreak of the Syrian civil war. As the Mediterranean Sea
   gradually turned into a graveyard, Athens, the main gateway city in
   Eastern Mediterranean, was deeply affected. The in-depth analysis of a
   defiant neighborhood of Athens, Exarchia, uncovers the leverage of the
   border city to resist the taken-for-granted ``global fear{''} of the
   Muslim refugee - a legacy of post September 11 war on terror. Revealing
   intense emotions shaped by the geography of violent borders, my research
   points to the widely shared aversion to government-led fear. The article
   analyzes the dialectics between top-down securitization sustained by
   fear and bottom-up resistance empowered by feelings of trust, safety,
   and belonging. While civic disobedience is routinely attacked and
   repressed by the security regime, I document how the geopolitics of
   emotion persist in everyday sociability and empower locals with
   differing political agendas in their pro-refugee resistance.
   Accordingly, my main argument is that the geopolitics of emotion are
   integral in forming, transforming, contesting, interrupting, and even
   evading securitization of migration in the least expected geographies,
   Europe's racial borders with the Middle East.},

Title = {Troubling the spatial politics of Green New Deals: Towards a Youngian
   approach to global justice},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As a whole, the Green New Deal (GND) is discussed as one of the most
   promising political projects to address social justice targets together
   with climate goals. Yet, as most individual GNDs focus on the national
   level, concerns about global justice have largely remained absent from
   early debates, leading some to conclude that the GND reproduces
   neocolonial and extractivist schemes. To analyse programs for a GND in
   relation to issues of global justice requires an analytical framework
   able to evaluate justice claims in extended geographies. Drawing on the
   later work of political theorist Iris Marion Young, we develop a
   framework that foregrounds three principles: shared responsibilities for
   environmental harm of global reach, self-determination for those
   effected by these harms, and a forward-looking political responsibility
   to address the structures producing and sustaining injustice. We employ
   this framework to conduct a qualitative content analysis of four
   selected GND proposals from the UK, the EU and the US. This analysis
   indicates that all selected GNDs acknowledge in principle the global
   reach of responsibilities and formulate (limited) proposals to address
   these in different fields. However, they do not think of global justice
   in terms of a forward-looking notion of political responsibility that
   acknowledges the need of structural reforms and the self-determination
   of those experiencing harm. Instead, when addressing justice beyond the
   level of the nation state, these GNDs fall back on a notion of
   distributive justice. Based on the work of Young, we conclude with a set
   of propositions for global democratic structures that would support the
   outlined principles of global justice.},

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper examines the role of partnerships in the governance of UK
   migration policy, considering how partnerships have been mobilised to
   navigate tensions between multiple state and non-state actors. The paper
   focuses on the work of regional strategic migration partnerships (SMPs)
   across the UK, bodies that bring together national and local government,
   statutory agencies, third sector organisations, and private contractors,
   all concerned with the management of migration and asylum. Considering
   SMPs as sites of collaboration and contention within local
   `battlegrounds' of policy, the paper examines how enrolment and
   socialisation shape relations between actors, serving to sustain
   governmental authority but also offer openings for the formation of
   advocacy coalitions. Through examining how SMPs addressed the
   outsourcing of asylum support services, I argue that for many non-state
   actors enrolment into an SMP produces an ambivalent politics centred on
   forms of tactical closeness and critical discomfort. In concluding, I
   suggest the forms of intimacy created through enrolment serve to extend
   ambivalence as actors become torn between relationships and commitments,
   highlighting the fraught and often unstable nature of SMPs as bodies of
   policy coordination and advocacy potential.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to investigate the decline of American hegemony
   as one of the most prominent crises of the modern world order, from a
   broader perspective that transcends narrow traditional interpretations.
   The paper assumes that the September 11 events in 2001 have launched the
   actual decline in American hegemony. Tracing the evolution of US global
   strategy over the past two decades, the study seeks to analyze the main
   causes and repercussions of the decline of US hegemony, which would
   provide a bird's eye view of what the current global system is going
   through.Design/methodology/approachThe study investigates the decline in
   American hegemony through a longitudinal within-case analysis which
   focuses on the causal path of decline in hegemony in the case of the
   USA, since the events of September 11, 2001, and tries to identify the
   causal mechanisms behind this decline. Following George and Bennet
   (2005), the study uses process tracing to examine its research question.
   Process-tracing method seeks to identify the intervening causal process
   - causal chain or causal mechanisms or the steps in a causal process -
   that leads to the outcome of a particular case in a specific historical
   context (Mahoney, 2000; Bennet and Elman, 2006). The study chose this
   method, as it offers more potential for identifying causal mechanisms
   and theory testing (George and Bennet, 2005); it opted for a specific
   procedure, among the variety of process-tracing procedures listed by
   George and Bennet, which is the detailed narrative presented as a
   chronicle, accompanied by explicit causal hypotheses. Using this process
   tracing procedure, the study assumes that American hegemony has
   witnessed dramatic changes in the aftermath of critical junctures,
   particularly the events of September 11, 2001, and the financial crises,
   2008, which contributed significantly to this decline. Consequently, it
   traces the impact of these events on the state of American hegemony, in
   light of the review of contributions of different theories on hegemony
   in the field of international relations, both traditional and critical.
   Consequently, introducing the theoretical framework used in the study
   (the four-dimensional model of hegemony), which transcends criticisms of
   previous theories.FindingsThe crises of the modern world order and the
   decline of American hegemony - being the main manifestation of such
   crises - revealed the inability of the traditional and critical
   approaches reviewed in the study to interpret this decline and those
   crises. The reason behind that was the inability of these
   interpretations to reflect the various dimensions of American hegemony
   and its decline since the September 11 events. This highlights the
   importance of using the four-dimensional model, which combines different
   factors in the analysis and has proved to be an appropriate model for
   studying the case of American hegemony and its decline after the events
   of September 11, as it deals with the phenomenon of hegemony as a social
   relationship based on specific social networks.Originality/valueDespite
   the currency and relevance of the decline of US hegemony for both the
   academic and political world, the topic needed to be analyzed
   systemically and addressed in a thorough scientific way. Through the
   application of theoretical concepts into the analysis of empirical data,
   this study contributes to a field where too often the discourse about
   decline of American hegemony is led without the required theoretical or
   conceptual considerations.},

Abstract = {QAnon is beginning to gain attention in scholarly circles, but these
   sources often disagree about how to categorize the movement. This
   amounts to the meta-dispute between those who view QAnon primarily as a
   religious ``cult,{''} and those who grant it greater credibility as a
   political populist movement. Using quantitative and qualitative methods
   we test the proposition that QAnon could be a mix of both. Results from
   both analyses suggest that QAnon is best understood primarily as a
   political populist movement, but one that utilizes religious rhetoric.
   The findings thus highlight the asymmetric nature of the conflation of
   religion and politics in the contemporary American civil sphere.},

Title = {Political referenda and investment: Evidence from Scotland},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {80},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We present evidence that referenda have a significant, detrimental
   outcome on investment. Employing an unsupervised machine learning
   algorithm over the period 2008-2017, we construct three important
   uncertainty indices underlying reports in the Scottish news media:
   Scottish independence (IndyRef)-related uncertainty; Brexit-related
   uncertainty; and Scottish policy-related uncertainty. Examining the
   relationship of these indices with investment on a longitudinal panel of
   3,589 Scottish firms, the evidence suggests that Brexit-related
   uncertainty associates more strongly than IndyRef-related uncertainty to
   investment. Our preferred specification suggests that a one
   standard-deviation increase in Brexit uncertainty foreshadows a
   reduction in investment by 8\% on average in the following year. Besides
   we find that the uncertainty associated with the Scottish referendum for
   independence while negligible at the aggregate level, relates more
   strongly with the investment of listed firms as well as those operating
   on the border with England. In addition, we present evidence of greater
   sensitivity to these indices among firms that are financially
   constrained or whose investment is to a greater degree irreversible.},

Volume = {104},

Abstract = {ObjectiveA shift of Latino voters to Republican Party candidates has
   been observed in recent years. Past research on presidential elections
   supports the idea that borderlands counties vote differently than other
   counties in borderlands states and tend to favor Democratic Party
   candidates. This study explores congressional voting patterns in the
   Texas borderlands.MethodsUsing county-level data for Texas counties in
   2010 and 2022, this study examines Republican congressional voting as a
   function of (1) borderlands cultural and economic context, (2) economic
   conditions, (3) social contact, and (4) religious adherence. We
   contribute to existing scholarship by proposing that there are three
   district border subregions.ResultsOverall, this study finds increased
   levels of support for Republican congressional candidates in the
   borderlands region. However, when subregions are compared, those
   counties with economic linkages to Mexico and rural Tejano counties are
   more likely to vote for Democratic Party candidates in 2010 and 2022.
   The West Texas borderlands region, however, is no longer distinctive
   from other Texas counties in terms of voting patterns in
   2022.ConclusionVoters in the predominantly Latino Texas borderlands are
   increasingly voting for Republican congressional candidates suggesting a
   change in partisan attachment. The effects of foreign-born arrivals and
   rising economic optimism in the borderlands may lead to more voting for
   Republican candidates. However, current economic realities and linkages
   as well as past social and political marginalization may continue to
   make borderlands voters distinct.},

Abstract = {Conflicts over the independence of judiciary as one of the European
   Union's core democratic values is one indicator of democratic
   backsliding among its member states. Based on the Europeanization
   framework, we compare this conflict in German, Polish and Spanish print
   media and Twitter from 2019 to 2021. In the countries that are strongly
   affected by the value conflict, Poland and Spain, Europeanization is
   less evident. In contrast, the German discourse shows a high degree of

   affirm, and protest the politics of space and memory},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {107},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The article concerns the role of heritage sites and performances in
   fuelling as well as resisting colonial domination over space and memory
   in the city of Jaffa. Using this case study, it maps the ways urban
   planning, preservation practices, and a spectrum of official and
   grassroots walking tours can enhance or challenge cities' official
   memory lanes and paths of erasure. The article draws on a study
   conducted between 2017 and 2020 on the politics of heritage tours in
   landscapes of forced displacement, utilizing an expanded multilingual
   walk-along qualitative methodology. It contributes to the expanding
   scholarship on performances and tourism as relevant fields for the study
   of political geography. Based on a series of inventories of interactions
   between bodies and contested heritage sites in Jaffa, the article argues
   for the theoretical need to extend research on the politics of memory
   and/or architecture to include how different actors and subaltern groups
   animate those elements through their bodies, movements, memories, and
   stories.},

Title = {Perceived fairness of intra-municipal cohesion politics: Does place of
   residence affect party preferences?},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {107},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper examines whether beliefs that local decision-makers are
   perceived to favour certain groups or districts over others, are linked
   to anti-establishment party preferences, and whether living in an urban
   or rural area affects this relationship. By taking stock of an original
   survey of Swedish respondents stratified into densely (urban) and
   sparsely (rural) populated districts, our results reveal geographical
   polarisation even within municipalities based on perceptions of how
   resources are distributed, as well as perceptions of opportunities to
   influence policy. Individuals who live in densely populated rural areas
   and believe that groups have unequal influence within the municipality
   depending on their geographical location tend to be far left.
   Individuals who have similar grievances about bias in decision-making
   but live in rural areas tend to be far right. Furthermore, Left Party
   supporters living in densely populated areas are more likely to perceive
   bias against poor districts, while rural Sweden Democrat supporters are
   more likely to believe that urban residents disregard rural concerns. We
   conclude that local decision-makers are perceived to favour certain
   groups or districts over others, are linked to an increased likelihood
   to prefer anti-establishment parties.},

Abstract = {From the perspective of Transaction Cost Theory, this paper proposes a
   conceptual model to assess ownership and management control decisions of
   private partners in public-private partnerships for infrastructure with
   regard generic risk factors, namely asset specificity, demand risk,
   environmental risk, social risk, macroeconomic risk, and governance or
   behavioral risk. Using an ordinal logistic model, hypotheses are tested
   on data covering 2152 projects in 12 emerging countries for the period
   2010-2019. Overall results indicate that the extent of private ownership
   and management control is negatively related to risks, the marginal
   effects of which are moderated by high-quality public institutions.},

Abstract = {Wartime pressures to protect national military and security interests
   inevitably create threats to civil liberties. This essay reviews the
   abuses of the period, carried on by public officials as well as citizens
   who saw themselves as acting on their behalf. There was a remarkable
   range of targets-with few spies to find, broadly defined disloyalty
   sufficed. The attempt to create a unified, loyal culture extended to
   wide areas of the culture, such as the teaching of history, aided by
   volunteers. The public and private efforts brought ruined reputations,
   imprisonments, public shaming, murders, and awful behavior on the part
   of courts and citizens. These were bad times for civil liberties. This
   essay reviews the history and explores the legacies.},

Abstract = {To explore the psychology of voting secrecy, we conducted a field
   experiment to examine voter sensitivity to arrangements for ballot paper
   selection under the French ballot system (i.e., multiple ballot papers).
   Working closely with Swedish election authorities, we randomly assigned
   participants to vote in a fictional election under low, medium-high and
   high privacy conditions with a follow up paper-and-pen survey to record
   perceived voting secrecy. Results show that participants perceived an
   arrangement for selecting ballot papers behind a closed screen as
   clearly more secret than one where selection was public, and that a
   third and even more private arrangement, where voters did not have to
   walk a few meters with ballot papers in hand, potentially visible to
   onlookers, provided even higher levels of perceived secrecy. The study
   demonstrates that voters are sensitive even to small changes in the
   voting environment. Accordingly, election administrators should be aware
   that details matter for the experience of voting secretly.},

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Research on autocracies often posits that propaganda can manipulate
   citizens' beliefs, but existing work does not systematically investigate
   how well individuals recognize misinformation in authoritarian
   environments and whether susceptibility to propaganda is related to
   vulnerability to false news. I present the results of four surveys in
   Russia, in which more than 60,000 participants evaluated 74 true and
   false news headlines. I find that Russians' capacity to discern
   falsehoods is comparable to discernment found in other political
   contexts, and they could often detect false news stories. However,
   consumers of state media gave less accurate evaluations than consumers
   of independent media, and government supporters were substantially more
   susceptible to pro-regime misinformation than opposition-minded
   citizens. Supporters also strongly rejected true messages inconsistent
   with their political dispositions. These results help understand why in
   environments dominated by propaganda individuals can be quite vulnerable
   to information manipulation. At the same time, regime critics in my
   study often fell for propaganda-inconsistent falsehoods. These results
   highlight the broader challenge of fighting misinformation and
   propaganda in a situation when many citizens exhibit political biases.},

Abstract = {This article outlines three major features of the digital society
   (information sharing, a levelled-playing field, and reciprocal
   surveillance) and explores their manifestation in the field of
   diplomacy. The article analyzed the international network of 78
   Ministries of Foreign Affairs (MFAs) on Twitter during the critical
   period of its growth between 2014 and 2016. To explain why some MFAs
   follow or are followed by their peers, both internal (Twitter) and
   external (gross domestic product) factors were considered. The analysis
   found the principle of digital reciprocity to be the most important
   factor in explaining an MFA's centrality. Ministries who follow their
   peers are more likely to be followed in return. Other factors that
   predict the popularity of MFAs among their peers are regionality,
   technological savviness, and national media environments. These findings
   provide a broader understanding of contemporary diplomacy and the fierce
   competition over attention in the digital society.},

Abstract = {Amid wider discussions of online harassment on social media platforms,
   recent research has turned to the experiences of social media creators
   whose compulsory visibility renders them vulnerable to frequent attacks,
   ranging from persistent trolling to much more insidious, offline acts of
   violence. This study examines a contemporary form of harassment against
   social media creators known as ``mass reporting,{''} or the targeted,
   automated flagging of creators' online content to trigger content
   takedowns and account bans. Mass reporting is particularly challenging
   for social media creators because of its weaponization of platform
   infrastructures for community governance, leaving creators with few
   avenues of support after orchestrated attacks and restricting their
   access to platform support. Drawing on in-depth interviews with social
   media creators who have been subjected to mass reporting on their
   content, this study builds an understanding of the ways in which tools
   for platform governance, such as content reporting, can be weaponized to
   harass and introduce vulnerabilities for creators.},

Abstract = {Christian-democratic parties not only constituted the most successful
   political force in much of Western Europe during most of the twentieth
   century; their attitudes toward solidaristic welfare reform have
   arguably also been more diverse than have those of most other major
   political groupings during this period. Whereas existing studies have
   mostly attributed this variation to electoral or strategic
   considerations, this article emphasizes the importance of interest group
   involvement. It analyzes and compares postwar old-age pension reform in
   three important Christian-democratic-ruled societies, Belgium, Germany,
   and the Netherlands, and shows how the very different attitudes of the
   main Christian-democratic parties toward solidaristic welfare reform in
   these countries related to the strength and unity of the
   Christian-democratic labor union movements there.},

Title = {Populist far right discursive-institutional tactics in European regional
   decarbonization},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {105},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {What rhetorical strategies are populist far-right parties using to delay
   regional decarbonization? This paper focuses on three populist far-right
   parties-the Conservative People's Party of Estonia (EKRE), Alternative
   for Germany (AfD), and Poland's Law and Justice (PiS)-and the
   discursive-institutional tactics each used from 2014 to 2021 to delay
   decarbonization of their carbon-intensive regions. We identify three
   discursive-institutional tactics used by populist far-right actors to
   delay decarbonization: (1) politicizing decarbonization, (2) reframing
   cultural values to form alliances with anti-decarbonization movements,
   and (3) dismantling key decarbonization institutions. We show that the
   populist far-right discursive-institutional tactics in European regional
   decarbonization are prevalent and vary widely. The politics of backlash
   against the EU-driven progressive public policies and anti-democratic
   rhetoric, including xenophobia and national sovereignty discourses are
   commonly used by these three populist far right parties to mobilize
   counternarratives against climate change and regional decarbonization.
   EKRE and PiS typically portray themselves as the protectors of social
   insurance and safety for vulnerable groups affected by regional
   decarbonization. PiS and AfD harness regional identity to mobilize civic
   engagement against decarbonization. All three parties work to empty and
   dismantle key decarbonization institutions. Overall, our findings

Abstract = {This study explores the role of social media in the Black Lives Matter
   (BLM) Movement by examining how social media news use impacts BLM
   protest action. Theoretically, we go beyond the frequently discussed
   relationship between social media and protest participation and examine
   how grievances, political efficacy, and racial identity conditionally
   impact the influence of social media on protest engagement. The findings
   suggest that social media news use amplifies, rather than reduces, the
   gaps between engaged and disengaged citizens regarding protest
   participation, particularly in the online sphere. These indicate that
   social media is not an equalizing tool for BLM participation.},

Abstract = {This article examines international politics of recognition in the
   increasingly multipolar global environment, with a specific focus on
   recognition events in Kosovo, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Crimea, the
   Occupied Golan Heights, Jerusalem, Western Sahara, Luhansk and Donetsk.
   It reveals that the recent surge in recognition is propelled by
   geopolitical and geographical motivations, which undermine the normative
   significance of territorial integrity, non-recognition and
   self-determination in recognition politics. The article proposes a
   thesis that situates recognition within the context of geopolitics,
   spatial management and power dynamics that expand our understanding of
   the broader impacts of recognition beyond the traditional emphasis on
   statehood emergence and prevention. Recognition has become entangled in
   geopolitical contestations between influential global players seeking to
   normatively legitimise and normalise conquest, occupation and
   colonisation. In this context, geopolitical considerations have
   overridden the normative and legal weight of the well-institutionalised
   norms of territorial recognition. This underscores the gap between
   recognition norms and practices and demonstrates the explanatory power
   of geopolitics.},

   spatial threshold of memory},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {105},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper I explore the subtle regulation of cultural practice in
   Argentina's Parque de la Memoria. I interpret the Parque de la Memoria,
   or memory park, as a spatial threshold. When family members of the
   desaparecidos enter the park they enter the memory of the spatial
   threshold as what remains (of what remained) of the violent attempt by
   the Argentine military regime to spatialise political order. The
   desaparecidos, or disappeared, were to be captured and performatively
   constituted in the space of exception as the embodiment of a terrorist
   subversion that threatened Argentina's re-founding as a Western,
   Christian civilisation. To resist the temptation to leave a flower at
   the monument as the memory of the spatial threshold between the sacred
   and profane, life and death, the city and the river, is to hold open the
   possibility for an alternative politics by maintaining potentiality's
   link to impotentiality as the ability to not-mourn. It is in this
   potentiality, not-yet-actualised and thus not exhausted, that space is
   opened for a post-dictatorship politics in Argentina that would reach
   beyond the exhausted notions of the need for reconciliation with, or the
   redemption of, the disappearances of the disappeared.},

Abstract = {People seem to have pure time preferences about trade-offs concerning
   their own pleasures and pains, and such preferences contribute to
   estimates of people's individual time discount rate. Do pure time
   preferences also matter to interpersonal welfare trade-offs, including
   those concerning the welfare of future generations? Most importantly,
   should the intergenerational time discount rate include a pure time
   preference? Descriptivists claim that the intergenerational discount
   rate should reflect actual people's revealed preferences, and thus it
   should include a pure time preference. Prescriptivists claim that the
   intergenerational discount rate should be based on moral analysis, and
   thus they (often) claim that the rate of pure time preference should be
   zero. I argue that regardless of which view is correct, a focus on pure
   time preference is misplaced. First, the most plausible interpretation
   of descriptive preferences for intergenerational trade-offs is that
   people are socially biased and not time biased. Second, social bias is
   superior to time bias as a prescriptive reason to discount the welfare
   of future people. Third, recent advances in measuring social bias as a
   social discount rate make social bias a viable replacement for time bias
   in economic analyses of intergenerational welfare trade-offs.},

Title = {Political Trust as an Evaluation against Normative Benchmarks? A
   Two-wave Survey Experiment on the Role of Normative Benchmarks in the
   Evaluative Model of Political Trust},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The dominant model that guides scholarly research on political trust
   rests on the assumption that this attitude is evaluative. It states that
   citizens evaluate political actors' trustworthiness traits against a set
   of normative benchmarks. Remarkably, despite its dominance in political
   trust research and its serious implications for theories on democratic
   accountability, this assumption has not been tested systematically. This
   paper tests the micro-level foundations of the trust-as-evaluation model
   via an extensive two-wave survey experiment among 15,997 respondents. We
   assess to what extent normative benchmarks of trustworthiness condition
   citizens' trust in politicians with 11 randomized traits. Our findings
   challenge the commonly held view of the role of normative benchmarks in
   the trust-as-evaluation model. While respondents clearly differentiate
   trustworthy politicians from untrustworthy ones and withdraw trust from
   politicians with negative traits, their normative benchmarks do not
   systematically influence this judgment. We discuss the implications of
   these findings for the trust-as-evaluation model.},

Abstract = {Early voting has been pitched as a way to help boost voter turnout in
   the United States. The evidence pointing to a positive association
   between the availability of early voting and electoral participation is
   decidedly mixed, however. Some studies have even found that provisions
   for early voting are negatively correlated with aggregate voter turnout.
   The explanations that have been offered for this surprising, negative
   relationship vary to some degree. One popular theory centers on declines
   in social pressure that might be expected to accompany large numbers of
   highly-engaged voters casting their ballots well in advance of Election
   Day. Equally as surprising as these negative findings is the fact that
   the mechanisms that have been proposed by way of an explanation for
   their existence have yet to see a direct test in the literature. In this
   article, we remedy this lacuna by exploring the relationship between
   early voting and political talk and mobilization efforts at the
   individual level using several years of ANES and CES data. Our results
   exhibit a great deal of nuance. However, after focusing on the set of
   cases that are the most likely to exhibit the theorized (negative)
   effects of having voted early, we do find consistent evidence that those
   who cast their ballots in advance of the day of the election engaged in
   lower levels of political talk. Our study thereby lends some credence to
   the idea that early voting may be associated with declines in the
   peer-to-peer transmission of electorally relevant social pressures.},

Title = {Through the Looking-Glass: The IOM Recasting the Safe, Orderly and

Abstract = {The stated aim of the Global Compact for Migration (GCM) is to
   facilitate `safe, orderly and regular migration'. Yet, plain meaning
   alone fails to reveal who is shaping this formative narrative. The
   International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has played a crucial role
   in the preparatory phase of the GCM and is coordinating its
   implementation. In this article, we shed light on two out of the IOM's
   global roles - a first one of coordinating the United Nations Network on
   Migration and the other role of organising the first International
   Migration Review Forum (IMRF) of the GCM. Hence, the IOM's institutional
   upgrade leads us to question to what extent the IOM has designed the
   GCM's narrative of `safe, orderly and regular migration'. Through a
   non-systematic document analysis of UN and IOM reports and briefs, we
   find evidence that the IOM adjusts the meaning behind the `safe, orderly
   and regular migration' depending on whether a global, respectively,
   regional mandate is at stake. To this end, we investigate the IOM's
   activities in West Africa where it faces an increasingly divided mission
   that lies at the intersection of its global and (trans-) regional roles.
   A closer look at how the IOM applies the narrative at global and West
   African levels reveals that it deliberately rearranges the order of the
   adjectives `safe, orderly and regular' to produce different meanings for
   different policy purposes. Viewed strategically, we find the IOM
   generates such word combinations to either pursue its abovementioned
   multilevel strategy, or to affirm its new position among UN agencies.
   Hence, one and the same adjective deployed at the global and regional
   level amounts to a different meaning, with implications for policy
   attribution. In result, the IOM's strategy to recast the narrative of
   `safe, regular and orderly migration' depending on whether it is
   fulfilling a regional or global role, ultimately leads to greater
   tension within the IOM as a whole.},

Abstract = {The `Islamic State in Iraq and Syria', or Da'esh, claimed territorial
   control and declared itself a state and Caliphate, but scholars disagree
   on the quality of these claims. Some argue that Da'esh really was a
   state, others reject this as propaganda of a non-state actor, and still
   others highlight that Da'esh challenged the international order as a
   whole. This article combines the notions of the `territory effect' and
   `inter-territory' to explain why the (self-)presentation of Da'esh
   appeared as a challenge to the (non-)state dichotomy of the modern
   international and its territorial underpinnings. While contesting the
   inter-territorial compartmentalisation of the state system, Da'esh
   projected a counter-territoriality beyond this system. The resulting
   horror vacui and collective campaign against Da'esh in turn shed light
   on an inter-territory effect of assuming and re-enacting contiguous
   state territories in a globally encompassing system of states, which
   thus locates and contains - but also enables - violence within states.},

Abstract = {Purpose- This study aims to assess and decompose the sustainable
   development using the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) in Iran in
   2018, for proposing agenda-setting of public
   policy.Design/methodology/approach - It ranks the SDGs not only in Iran
   but also in the region and the world to reveal the synergetic
   effects.Findings - Based on the results, subaltern-populace generally
   suffers from the hegemonic domination of ruling elite-bourgeois, lack of
   strong institutions, heterogeneous policy networks and lack of advocacy
   role of non-governmental organizations, due to no transparency, issues
   in law or no rule of law, no stringent regulation, rent, suppression and
   Mafia, all leading to corruption and injustice.Practical implications -
   To stop the loop of corruption-injustice, Iran should homogenize the
   structure of the policy network. Furthermore, the failed SDGs of the
   three-geographic analysis are the same in a character; all of them
   propose SDG 3, good health and well-being as a serious failed
   goal.Social implications - In this regard, strong evidence is the
   pandemic Coronavirus, COVID 19 since 2019, due to its highly-disastrous
   consequences in early 2020 where the public policymakers could not adopt
   policies promptly in the glob, particularly in Iran.Originality/value -
   In Iran, in addition to this, the malfunction of health is rooted in
   ``subjective well-being{''} and ``traffic deaths,{''} respectively.
   Concerning the transportations system in Iran, it is underscored that it
   is damaging the sustainable development from all the three pillars of
   sustainable development including, economic, social and environmental.},

Abstract = {The research (N = 265) considers the effect of exposure to personalized
   political comedy on the gun control debate on message discounting,
   perceived informativeness, and message elaboration. Results show that
   viewers are less likely to engage in message discounting, more likely to
   engage in message elaboration, and more likely to rate personalized
   political comedy as informative when compared against exposure to a
   standard late-night monologue. Importantly, the findings show that
   personalized political comedy content has greater message engagement
   effects among those with lower affinity for entertaining news,
   suggesting that personalized political comedy may help to expand issue
   engagement and audiences.},

Abstract = {PurposeEgypt has set plans to transform into a green economy which
   requires major reforms in the waste sector as one of the most vital
   sectors crucial for this transformation. This study aims at inspecting
   the current status of the Egyptian waste sector to highlight the major
   policy reforms needed. Furthermore, it assesses the economic viability
   of establishing waste-to-energy (WtE) projects under the current
   regulations that govern the sector.Design/methodology/approachThe study
   employed an inductive analytical approach to scrutinize the
   institutional and regulatory framework of the waste and WtE sectors.
   Furthermore, a novel techno-economic analysis was conducted to assess
   the profitability of a WtE plant that employs moving grate incineration
   technology.FindingsThe analysis of the waste sector revealed its
   deteriorating state and the dire need for immediate restructuring
   through more stringent regulations to establish an integrated waste
   management system (IWMS) that incorporates WtE technologies as well as a
   number of corrective actions that would help enhance the sector.
   Additionally, the techno-economic analysis revealed the need to amend
   the current WtE regulation to comprise a gate fee as an indispensable
   revenue stream for WtE projects.Originality/valueThis study is one of a
   few studies that uses a new technique of analysis to explore the
   potential role that WtE projects can play in Egypt as a part of an IWMS
   that aims at transforming the waste sector into a resource sector while
   providing a renewable and sustainable source of energy.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study investigated the utilization of social media
   during the 2020 South Korean general election, which took place during
   the COVID-19 pandemic, using the equalization versus normalization
   framework. Methods: This study estimated the associations between the
   characteristics of candidates and their respective constituencies and
   the use of various social media platforms by the candidates. Results:
   Dominant political actors were more active social media users,
   supporting the normalization hypothesis. However, when considering the
   candidates' chances of winning the election, social media's normalizing
   effect was weakened. Conclusion: This study provides new insights into
   the equalization versus normalization debate by analyzing social media
   use in a context where offline campaigning was restricted.},

Abstract = {This article provides an analysis of public engagement as it is
   practised and conceptualised by the Welsh Parliament. It does so by
   applying an interpretive framework to elite interviews and parliamentary
   committee report forewords, in order to identify institutional
   narratives of public engagement. These narratives are identified and
   discussed at three different levels of decision-making (and in ascending
   levels of `abstraction'): practice, strategy, and concept. The chosen
   framework and methodology show the usefulness of narrative at a
   conceptual and analytical level. The conclusions drawn - regarding i)
   the need for a shift from public-facing to publicengaging committee
   work, 2) a lack of clarity on desired outcomes, and 3) continued
   tensions around sources of evidence and knowledge - are relevant and
   applicable to parliaments across a range of contexts.},

Abstract = {Energy poverty remains a major challenge for sustainable and inclusive
   economic growth, good governance, peace and stability in developed
   countries and especially in developing regions such as Africa. In
   addition to this energy challenge, the participation of women in
   political decision-making remains another great challenge for African
   countries. To date, few studies have examined the effects of women's
   political participation on energy poverty. Therefore, the aim of this
   study is to examine the effects of women's political participation on
   energy poverty (measured mainly by access to electricity) in a panel of
   45 sub-Saharan African countries over the period 1997-2018.
   Additionally, this paper examines the transmission channels through
   which women's political participation affects energy poverty. The
   empirical evidence is based on fixed-effects and the generalized method
   of moments (GMM), and the following results are established: First,
   women parliamentarians improve access to electricity for both the total
   population and urban and rural populations. In other words, results show
   that women parliamentarians reduce energy poverty in sub-Saharan Africa.
   These findings are robust to a series of sensitivity checks. Second, we
   identify control of corruption and democracy as the main transmission
   channels through which women parliamentarians promote access to
   electricity. These results highlight the important role of women
   politicians in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, including
   access to electricity in Africa.},

Title = {Another Wind of Change? Evidence about Political Outsiders in the French

Abstract = {Some citizens who are dissatisfied with long-established politicians are
   turning to new representatives, that come from the general public,
   referred to as political outsiders. This article empirically explores
   whether the change in political representatives - achieved by citizens
   voting for political outsiders - leads to a change in political
   representation. Our analysis uses original data on the votes and
   activity of over 1,000 members of the French Parliament (MPs) between
   2012 and 2020. Isolating an outsider effect remains a challenge as they
   are both novices in politics and in the Parliament. Our empirical
   strategy allows disentangling the political experience effect from the
   parliamentary experience effect using novice MPs political insiders.
   First, we find that political outsiders are more independent than
   political insiders only in low disciplined political groups, and there
   is no evidence concerning highly disciplined political groups. Second,
   using a non-parametric multidimensional index measuring MPs' legislative
   activity, our findings indicate that parliamentary inexperience explains
   why newly elected MPs are less productive at first and then catch up
   with their experienced counterparts within a year after taking office.
   However, over the entire legislature, the difference between new and
   re-elected MPs level of activity does not appear to be significant.
   Overall, even if the election of political outsiders allows changes in
   some usual individual characteristics of the representatives as age or
   gender, it appears that more conditions are needed than solely electing
   political outsiders to change the manner of doing politics.},

Title = {Missives for the Future? Michael Lowy's Close Encounters with the US
   Left},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {The oeuvre of Brazilian-born and Parisian-educated Michael Lowy is
   widely recognised as the achievement of an exacting revolutionary
   cultural worker who integrates theory with his political duties, and
   labours hard at his craft so that the poetic imagination can reclaim and
   thereby re-enchant the reified reality of capitalist modernity.
   Nevertheless, when we come to Lowy's reputation in the United States we
   face a curious situation. There is no doubt that his work is known and
   respected among many activists and scholars. Yet from the perspective of
   the needs of the Marxist Left, the disparity is striking between what
   Lowy has to offer as a militant thinker and the actuality of his impact.
   The search for an explanation of such a discrepancy must begin with a
   preliminary stab at what I regard as a `Lowyian' interpretation of
   Michael Lowy's life and writings. The method includes an exploration of
   his possible `elective affinities', defined in a broad sense, with the
   cultural and political work of US radicalism since the 1960s. Are there
   analogies, kinships, or attractions of meaning that have entered into a
   relationship of reciprocal appeal and influence? In the end, however, I
   conclude that the disproportion between potential and actual stems
   largely from fractional perceptions of his accomplishment that are
   rooted in the peculiarities of US Marxist thought in general and of US
   Trotskyism in particular. Such partial and one-sided assessments are a
   profound barrier because the achievement of Michael Lowy needs to be
   understood in its totality.},

Title = {Ideological spillovers across the Atlantic? Evidence from Trump's
   presidential election},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {76},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Ideological spillovers refer to the modification of an individual's core
   beliefs after learning about other people's beliefs. We study one
   specific international ideological spillover, namely, the effect of the
   unexpected election of a United States (US) president (Donald Trump on
   the 9th of November 2016), who openly questioned the so-called `core
   liberal consensus', on European's core political beliefs. Using a
   regression discontinuity design (RDD) around the election event, we show
   that the Trump presidential election (TPE) gave rise to a `backlash
   effect'. That is, it steered core European beliefs in two specific
   domains, making Europeans more favourable to (i) glob-alisation and (ii)
   international mobility (about 10\% change in the overall Likert scale
   range of the statement that immigrants contribute to a country).
   Contrasting with the hypotheses of `belief contagion', we do not find
   evidence that TPE steered illiberal beliefs. Furthermore, TPE improved
   (deteriorated) the view Europeans had of their own country (the United
   States).},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis research draws on the theory of unequal exchange to help
   explain global inequities in the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU).
   MethodsI evaluate the proposition that the vertical flow of exports to
   high-income countries exerts harmful effects on undernourishment in
   less-developed countries using fixed effects estimation and generalized
   least squares random effects tobit panel regression models.
   ResultsInsights from the theory of unequal exchange help advance our
   understanding of global inequities in the PoU. ConclusionThis analysis
   contributes to an emerging body of literature suggesting that this
   unique form of global economic integration exerts harmful effects on
   health outcomes in less-developed countries.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses 1) how \#MahsaAmini has become a significant hybrid
   movement in Iran and 2) how it is taking Twitter activism into the
   post-fake news era. I will begin by reviewing the existing literature on
   Twitter and democracy. Then, I will discuss the roots of the
   \#MahsaAmini, which make it a hybrid movement. Further, I will show how
   Iranians have circumvented the regime's fake news campaigns and cyber
   army. This paper argues that while non-democratic regimes have developed
   more complex methods of suppressing digital protests, these efforts are
   ineffective in large-scale protests.},

Title = {European Foreign Policy Towards Hybrid Actors in the Middle East and

Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2024},

Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {Diplomacy increasingly demands taking into account a large variety of
   polities, featuring not only state but also non-state actors (such as
   IGOs and NGOs) and `hybrid' actors. Particularly in the broader Middle
   East and North Africa region, hybrid actors are important players in
   local, regional and international order. The European Union and its
   Member States have a distinct interest in gaining influence in the
   geopolitics of the region and are increasingly confronted with these
   actors in their external actions. Yet, little is known about how
   European foreign policy practitioners and diplomats deal with hybrid
   actors in practice. By providing a rich empirical account based on 37
   interviews in the context of fieldwork in Brussels and Beirut, this
   research goes beyond existing analyses of official European policies and
   discourse towards hybrid actors. Building on recent advancements in
   practice theory and insights from political geography, the article
   emphasises the influence of space and the ubiquity of oblique routes
   shaping European foreign policy practices.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces the terminology of border infrastructures as a way
   to enrich a multi-perspectival approach to territorial bordering
   processes that takes seriously their stratifying and racialising
   dynamics. Building on the analysis of migrant informal dwellings, or
   ghettos, which are increasingly constructed as naturalised `black
   spaces' in the Mediterranean, the paper's contribution is twofold.
   First, it calls for more situated research into the multiple networks,
   connections and agencies involved in bordering processes, which often
   comprise complex interactions across `formal' and `informal', `human'
   and `more-than-human' boundaries. Second, it proposes to foreground the
   socio-materiality of borders-as-infrastructures by analysing how these
   actively reproduce a logic of separation in both a political and an
   ecological sense. The article pushes forward a more immersive
   understanding and methodology that is able to unearth the stratifying,
   racialising dimensions of contemporary borderwork across and within the
   confines of nation-state territoriality.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the case of the 2011 march against a highway project through
   the Isiboro Secure National Park and Indigenous Territory (TIPNIS) in
   Bolivia, alongside a discussion of Max Weber's conceptions of
   rationality, this paper situates that demonstration in the interface
   between the Bolivian State's modern formal rationality with the sub-
   stantive rationality proposed as `Vivir Bien'; an umbrella term for a
   conglomeration of indigenous proposals for a sustainable relationship
   between humans and nature that goes beyond neoliberalism, colonialism,
   and their cultural and environmental consequences. As with any modern
   institution, the Bolivian State performs with modern means -ends
   calculations, thus subduing the transformative potential of `Vivir Bien'
   as a distinct rationalism, with its means -ends framework, knowledge,
   and patterns of action.In a Weberian critique of Modernity, two issues
   will be raised. First is the need to recognize the modern state as the
   institutional embodiment of modern formal instrumental rationality bound
   to Modernity's means -ends framework. Second, an evaluation of the
   possibility of incorporating other rationalisms into the modern state,
   allowing other means -ends valuations for state policymaking involving
   other patterns of action and sociality.Based on these considerations,
   this paper recognizes modern rationalism in contrast to other
   rationalisms, worldviews, and practices in a critical search for alter
   native approaches and proposals for attending to local and global
   problems threatening sustainable human existence, from environmental
   devaluation to social inequality.},

Abstract = {Objective. Although previous studies pointed to various aspects of
   social distance and conflicts with representatives of otherness,
   associations with objectively measured aspects of personality in the
   form of a semi-structure interview combined with observation are less
   common. Based on previous studies, this study focused on the
   relationship between social distance and conflicts with representatives
   of otherness. It was hypothesized that the lower the personality
   functioning, the higher will be social distance and more conflicts with
   representatives of otherness will be reported. We assumed that impaired
   empathy would be associated with higher social distance in comparison
   with other variables of personality functioning derived from Alternative
   Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD)-identity, self-direction and
   intimacy. Sample and methods. Participants (N = 204) were recruited from
   several contrast groups including clinical and measures focused on
   conflicts, personality functioning (STiP-5.1), social distance (Bogardus
   Social Distance Scale). Additionally, several related methods were used.
   Results. Increased impairments in identity, self-direction, empathy, and
   intimacy were associated with a higher degree of subjective importance
   of conflicts with representatives of otherness. Greater social distance
   was associated with impairments in self-direction and empathy. However,
   social distance was found independent of subjectively experienced
   conflicts. Multivariate linear regressions showed that social distance
   was predicted by education, racism, and personality functioning
   (STiP-5.1 -Self-direction), BR and SR scores, explaining 58 per cent of
   the variance. Conclusions. The subjective importance of conflicts and
   social distance to representatives of otherness is associated with AMPD.},

Title = {Action dilemmas in prefigurative politics: making prefiguration feasible
   in Sweden},
Journal = {SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {492-508},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Prefigurative political movements often attempt to create and maintain
   an alternative reality, where activists can enact and experiment with a
   desired future. Yet, sustained participation in a prefigurative project
   requires that individuals view this potential future as realizable and
   feasible. Based on a long-term ethnographic study of a radical
   left-libertarian movement in Sweden, I identify three dilemmas activists
   must solve to allow prefiguration to remain feasible, which I term
   practical prefiguration, principled prefiguration, and purposeful
   prefiguration. In practical prefiguration, individuals must find ways of
   balancing commitments and obligations from identities outside the
   movement with their identities as social movement participants.
   Principled prefiguration, conversely, focuses on the challenges
   prefigurative participants encounter as they attempt to translate broad,
   macro ideological principles into local interactional norms. Finally,
   purposeful prefiguration explores how activists maintain optimism, hope,
   and belief in a prefigurative project through creating and maintaining
   measures of success that are not based on instrumental social change. In
   this article, I investigate the strategies long-term activists used to
   solve these problems. I argue these strategies often require changes in
   movement form, tactics, and character as activists accommodate the
   realities of the present, which can potentially threaten the
   prefigurative nature of a political project. The article concludes by
   arguing that inequalities in prefigurative movements can arise from the
   solutions to these practical problems, but that prefigurative projects
   must find ways of balancing present and future if they wish to survive.},

Title = {Manipulating municipal budgets: unveiling opportunistic behavior of
   Italian mayors},
Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},

Volume = {198},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {317-342},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We examine the political budget cycle hypothesis using revenue data from
   Italian municipal administrations. By leveraging on the staggered
   schedule of local elections and employing a difference-in-differences
   strategy, we find evidence of opportunistic behavior by mayors. In
   pre-election years, mayors reduce total accrued revenues from municipal
   solid waste fees and property taxes, which are the primary sources of
   revenue in municipal financial statements. Non-term-limited mayors who
   seek re-election engage in such opportunistic behavior, while those
   facing a binding term limit do not manipulate revenues for electoral
   purposes. Our findings remain robust across various specifications and
   controls. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that the observed results are
   primarily driven by smaller municipalities, as well as by those situated
   in the South of Italy that exhibit low levels of social capital. Mayors
   employing political budget cycles also strategically offset reductions
   in highly salient fees and taxes by raising less salient non-tax
   revenues. This study contributes to the understanding of political
   budget cycles in the context of Italian municipal administrations and
   has implications for the broader literature on electoral behavior and
   public finance.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this paper is as follows: First, understanding the
   nature of the relationship between corporate adoption of the concept of
   societal responsibility {[}availability of environmental awareness,
   clear vision of the impact of societal responsibility on financial
   performance, managers informing employees of the latest developments in
   societal responsibility programs, managers' response to their corporate
   social responsibility (CSR) proposals] in the form of an annual report
   that supports the success of the company's objectives, the company's
   management encourages employees to participate collectively in societal
   responsibility programs and to protect the environment from pollution in
   the petrochemical industry. Second, understand the nature of the
   relationship between the dimensions of corporate social responsibility
   concept (cultural, social, economic, ethical and legal) and protect the
   environment from pollution in the petrochemical industry. Third, the
   research also seeks to show the role of societal responsibility and its
   application in the petrochemical companies to protect the environment
   from pollution in The Governorate of Alexandria - Egypt, and come out
   with results and recommendations that could help protect the environment
   from the forms of environmental pollution resulting from the production
   processes of this industry.Design/methodology/approachThe researcher has
   relied on each of the following approaches: Case study methodology is a
   research strategy aimed at solving a problem or facing a particular
   situation. It is based on preliminary hypotheses through full analysis
   of all data collected and recorded. Which depends on the study of a
   limited number of cases or vocabulary in-depth comprehensive study
   through the study of all or a large number of variables overlapping and
   interrelated and influential on the problem under consideration. Thus,
   it provides a deep and rich understanding of what is going on around the
   research and the processes that are related to it, and not only the
   external or apparent description of the situation or phenomenon; it
   cares about the total description and looks at the particles, in
   relation to the whole. Quantitative approach: by giving a numerical
   description indicating the size or size of the phenomenon or the degree
   of association with the phenomenon. Other phenomena. Accordingly, the
   role of the petrochemical companies in Alexandria Governorate, and the
   social responsibility programs carried out within the governorate in
   terms of importance, growth and requirements, and the most important
   characteristics and constraints and components and methods of work and
   developments have been described. Thus, the researcher can analyze the
   relationship between CSR and environmental protection from pollution in
   Alexandria Governorate.FindingsThere is paucity in the studies that
   dealt with the relationship between CSR and environmental protection
   against pollution in public organizations. There is agreement among the
   sample on the importance and feasibility of adopting the concept of
   social responsibility and placing it at the top of the top management
   concerns, especially in the field of petrochemical companies. With the
   need to take concrete implementation measures to support social
   responsibility programs aimed at serving the community among all
   stakeholders.
   The effective implementation of the mechanisms for the implementation of
   meaningful social responsibility programs requires fundamental changes
   in management practices, existing organizational structures and the
   quality of personnel working in the relevant departments, in general,
   and the social responsibility group, in particular, which may be
   difficult for political and economic reasons.Research
   limitations/implicationsTime: The study period was set from 2015 to
   2017. Place: The study focuses on the petrochemical companies operating
   in Alexandria. Humanity: The study focuses on the employees of the
   petrochemical companies operating in Alexandria Governorate.Practical
   implicationsThe adoption of social responsibility positively affects the
   protection of the environment from pollution, and this effect shows that
   the adoption of the concept of corporate social responsibility is
   influenced by the following factors: increasing the participation of
   workers with healthy environmental contributions to the productive
   process; increasing the companies' economic and social activities toward
   protecting the environment from pollution; increasing the capacity of
   companies to pay greater costs to preserve the environment; increasing
   the awareness of green consumers with the products it offers Companies;
   development of continuous internal work environment companies; and
   clearly defined strategy followed in social responsibility
   programs.Social implicationsThe social responsibility of the public
   organizations derives their strength through, first, the keenness of
   these organizations to analyze the variables of the ethical dimension of
   social responsibility and their availability, which will lead the
   organizations to provide their services with the highest quality and
   sincerity. That this analysis (ethics of individuals) as training
   members of the social responsibility team to solve problems using
   brainstorming and provide employees with official data related to
   improving work (ethics of leadership), such as the identification of
   business objectives through the participation of managers with
   subordinates, and the punishment of workers who exhibit immoral
   behaviors (ethics of productive processes) as a decision-making process
   to ethical standards regardless of the costs involved. When there is an
   immoral behavior and managers are responsible for implementing the
   changes needed to reach the targeted outcomes), second, promote
   partnerships with other relevant sectors for community
   service.Originality/valueAccording to the results of the previous
   studies and the applied study results, the researcher would like to
   submit a mechanism to the directors and heads of the boards of directors
   of the Egyptian petrochemical companies under study.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis article considers the influence of female legislators on
   gun legislation across U.S. states. Females have behavioral differences
   with males and likely different exposure to gun-related
   violence.MethodUsing data from 1991 to 2020, we estimate the drivers of
   gun legislation across U.S. states. The dependent variables are
   alternately the total number of gun laws enacted and 5-year differences
   in gun laws.ResultsWe find that female legislators in state houses
   significantly increase the supply of gun laws. Female senators, on the
   other hand, were no different from their male counterparts. In other
   results, states with greater population density had more gun laws, while
   economic prosperity, race, and the elderly population did not generally
   have significant effects. Finally, when special interest aspects,
   involving gun ownership, mass shooting episodes, and states with
   single-party control of the legislative and executive branches are
   considered, mass shootings and single-party control increase laws, while
   gun owners have the opposite effect. These findings show significance
   when 5-year differences in gun laws are used.ConclusionsOur findings
   suggest that when it comes to gun legislation and female legislator
   representation, it matters which chamber of the legislature females are
   elected to. Furthermore, different interest groups can significantly
   bear upon gun legislation.},

Title = {Geopolitical assemblages and disasters-in-the-making in Kalimpong, India},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article argues that landslides ought to be understood as
   geopolitical processes. The argument is based on a study into the causes
   and impacts of landslides in Kalimpong District, West Bengal, India. The
   article is based on six months of qualitative, ethnographic fieldwork
   carried out between 2019 and early 2020. Several semi-structured
   interviews with both landslide victims and some other key informants
   provide most of the data for the article. This was complemented by field
   notes and other ethnographic methods. Landslide prone Kalimpong District
   sits mostly in The Eastern Himalayan foothills and is West Bengal's
   newest district, annexed from Darjeeling district in 2017. That year
   also saw the third major uprising of a century-long movement for a
   separate Indian state of Gorkhaland, of which Kalimpong would be a part.
   The intersections of that movement and its drivers with disaster risk
   and its management in Kalimpong are the primary focus of the article. I
   make sense of these intersections by advancing a conceptual framework
   that combines assemblage -based geographical theories of disaster risk
   and the concept of geopolitical assemblages. This allows me to, by
   narrating people's experiences and understandings of three specific
   landslides, illustrate that geopolitical processes make landslides
   possible and then exacerbate and prolong their impacts. The article
   makes novel theoretical contributions to geographical literatures on
   infrastructure, geopolitics, and hazards. It also provides a critical,
   contemporary overview of the geopolitical context of the Eastern
   Himalayas.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how social movement scholars construct the
   category of `religion' within the discipline. Using some of the
   conceptual tools from the critical study of religion - namely,
   problematising the distinction between the `secular' and the `religious'
   - it analyzes a sample of articles within the journals Social Movement
   Studies and Mobilization between 2010 and 2020 that deal with a broad
   range of religious, spiritual, and `religion-like' or `secular sacred'
   phenomena. I find three key trends within the data: social movements
   literature has a narrow construction of what constitutes `religion';
   those things designated `religious' are often instrumentalized in
   service to `political' ends; and social movement scholars are more
   likely to study conservative and extreme politics where it intersects
   with groups considered `religious' than with those considered `secular.'
   The article invites scholars of social movements to consider how
   particular conceptions of both `religion' and `politics' are naturalised
   within the field.},

Abstract = {The assumption that ownership has an effect on the diversity of news is
   based on the forms of control that ownership allows and the market
   conditions in which ownership is exercised. In this study, we perform a
   large-scale analysis of the Swedish newspaper market, surveying 130
   newspapers and parliamentary speeches over a period of six years
   (2014-2019), to substantiate to what extent market and for-profit
   ownership forms impact political viewpoint diversity. Our analysis shows
   that newspapers with market leadership and chain ownership offer more
   political viewpoint diversity than number two and single-owned papers.
   In contrast, the ownership forms surveyed here (private, foundation, and
   publicly traded ownerships) display little effect on newspapers'
   internal diversity. We also find that a greater number of papers in a
   local market does not imply more external diversity in that market. The
   analysis thus offers some nuance to the notion that ownership form and
   market pluralism are prerequisites for viewpoint diversity, highlighting
   instead the importance of scale effects for pluralistic media systems.},

Abstract = {Participatory democracy and public consultations are increasingly being
   used to shape public policy or resolve political issues. In France, the
   Grand Debat was launched in early 2019 as a democratic response to the
   Yellow Vests movement, a massive grassroots social protest. With more
   than 500,000 participants, the Grand Debat platform was interpreted as a
   popular success by the government and the media, but little is known
   about which citizens expressed their opinions online. Although
   participants on the platform were anonymous and only answered public
   policy questions, we are able to infer their support for the Yellow
   Vests movement by using a second platform (a Facebook app) that asks
   similar questions as well as support for the Yellow Vests. We find that
   a large majority of participants in the Grand Debat did not support the
   Yellow Vests movement, in contrast to the general population at the
   time. This is evidence of a strong self-selection of participants on
   political grounds, resulting in a biased representation of French public
   opinion.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {An independent judiciary is often hailed as one of the most important
   aspects of the rule of law. Securing judicial independence (JI) via
   explicit constitutional rules seems straightforward and there is
   evidence that de jure and de facto JI are linked, at least in the long
   term. However, the realized degree of judicial independence often
   diverges significantly from the constitutionally guaranteed one. Based
   on a worldwide panel dataset from 1950 to 2018, we find that a negative
   gap, that is, when de jure JI > de facto JI, is very common. Factors
   associated with a decreasing gap are the number of veto players and the
   extent of press freedom and democracy, whereas corruption is associated
   with an increasing gap between de jure JI and de facto JI.},

Abstract = {Are parliamentarians involved in normative power diffusion? This case
   study of Japanese parliamentarians' international activities shows how
   they engage in international norm diffusion at interparliamentary
   meetings in a way that multiplies the normative power efforts of Japan's
   government. While parliamentarians are neither official foreign policy
   actors nor diplomats, they actively promote topics that support Japan's
   normative power interests and employ mechanisms identified for normative
   power diffusion. Thus, parliamentarians become multipliers of Japan's
   normative power efforts and have the ability to reach legislators in
   Japan's key partner countries. This paper argues that, when abroad,
   Japanese legislators adopt the identity of an international
   representative of Japan, who supports promoting Japan's interests in
   various areas, such as climate change, overseas agricultural
   investments, or regional financial stability.},

Abstract = {Lack of access to financial services is a problem for many; worldwide,
   one in four adults does not have a checking or savings account.
   Financial institutions with active, low-balance accounts often face
   considerable challenges compared to larger financial institutions
   (Black, 1979). Adding a fixed regulatory cost of servicing accounts can
   affect relative costs and thus generate an Alchian-Allen effect (the
   third law of demand) that leads financial institutions to quit servicing
   these low-balance accounts. Regulators may prefer this outcome as it is
   easier to regulate and extract rents from large financial institutions.
   Data indicates more underbanking in countries with lower income and more
   regulation. This article looks at the barriers traditional financial
   intermediaries often face in less developed nations and then looks at
   how fintech and cryptocurrencies enable bank alternatives to lower
   barriers to entry and expand financial inclusion.},

Title = {Gender and Sexual Minorities in the Armed and Police Forces: Perceptions
   and Mental Health Implications of Portuguese Militaries-A Qualitative
   Study},
Journal = {ARMED FORCES \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {311-336},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions toward gender
   and sexual identities in the Portuguese armed and police forces,
   emphasizing on mental health implications. A qualitative research
   methodology was followed, using an electronic inquiry answered by 64
   participants who are members of the Portuguese armed or police forces.
   Data were examined using thematic analysis, and the recurrent themes
   identified were the following: general characteristics of the
   military/police environment and culture, sexist attitudes and behaviors,
   positive attitudes and behaviors related to sexuality,
   homophobic/heterosexist attitudes and behaviors, influence of military
   and police culture on the expression of sexuality and coping of sexual
   minorities, negative impact of military and police culture on the mental
   health of gender and sexual minorities, and personal opinion regarding
   how sexual and gender diversity should be addressed in the armed and
   police forces. Analysis of these themes provides insight into the
   perceptions and experiences of our participants and suggests that the
   impact of stigma and discrimination toward gender and sexual minorities
   in this context was relevant for the individuals within this sample.},

Abstract = {Based on panel data on around 5500 German households, this article
   analyzes whether the experience of financial losses due to the Corona
   pandemic has affected three kinds of personal traits and preferences:
   the willingness to take risks, patience, and the locus of control (LOC).
   Our empirical results indicate that patience and the LOC remain
   unchanged by the experience of pandemic-related financial losses,
   whereas we find a negative effect of severe financial losses on
   risk-taking, contrasting with the traditional assumption that such
   preferences are constant. In this respect, our heterogeneity analysis
   indicates that financial losses due to the Corona pandemic particularly
   affect the most vulnerable households, notably low-income households and
   those with little income diversification.},

Abstract = {The influence and application of some of the main postulates of what is
   known as the linguistic turn led, beginning in the 1970s, to a deep
   renewal in the field of intellectual history. Among the currents that
   broke with the traditional history of ideas are the historical
   contextualism (history of languages and political discourses) of the
   so-called Cambridge School and the history of political and social
   concepts (Begriffsgeschichte) of the German historian Reinhart
   Koselleck. Throughout convergences and controversies, both schools have
   returned ideas and texts to their historicity in the form of language.
   German conceptual history, with its research on political-conceptual
   change in modernity, its relationship with social history and its
   theoretical dimension in the study of historical temporalities, has had
   fruitful roots in Spain since the late twentieth century, up to the
   point of becoming, both in the field of philosophy and historiography,
   the main current in the history of political and social ideas. The
   thrust of Hispanic historiography has even reached a transnational
   dimension, crystallizing in various Ibero-American projects,
   dictionaries and publications. After twenty-five years of results, the
   possibilities offered by the theory and methodology of conceptual
   history are far from being exhausted.},

Abstract = {The seas and inland waters have historically been spaces of the
   invisibleness of social struggles. This article offers an
   interdisciplinary analysis of the Colombian Constitutional Court
   decisions related to human rights violations in artisanal fisheries
   territories. We used a human rights-based approach to study 79 court
   proceedings and built a digital database called Justice in Fishing
   Territories (Justicia en Territorios Pesqueros). We identified and
   analyzed the most frequently claimed and protected rights. Most of the
   Court proceedings are centered on participation processes, indicating
   that artisanal fisheries sector actors are not being considered in the
   approval of development projects. We conclude that the Colombian State
   privileges the interests of the industrial economic sector to the
   detriment of the rights of the fishing populations.},

Abstract = {This article explains the << reinvention >> of Franco's regime as a
   developmentalist dictatorship. It reconstructs the scientific and
   philosophical origins of that legitimisation strategy through the figure
   of Laureano Lopez Rodo, Technical Secretary of the Presidency of the
   Government (1956-1962) and Commissioner of the Development Plan
   (1962-1973). Through a biographical approach combined with the methods
   of intellectual history and the history of ideas, it examines the
   concepts of state and society that the architect of Franco's development
   policy elaborated throughout his academic career in the 1940s and 1950s.
   It thus shows that these concepts were inspired by administrative
   legislation in France and in Salazarist Portugal. Besides, Lopez Rodo
   was influenced by American scientific management theories, the work of
   the International Institute of Administrative Sciences and the
   reflections of the German jurist Ernst Forsthoff. It finally argues that
   the attempt to stabilise the regime through administrative efficiency
   and economic success was linked to a specific model of society, which
   was based on extensive depoliticisation and the conversion of citizens
   into administrados.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesQuestions of attitude stability for appointed decisionmakers
   are vital to our understanding of democracy. I test the assumption of
   bureaucratic preference stability that is widespread in formal and
   empirical analyses of the U.S. executive branch. MethodsThe study
   presents a qualitative analysis of quantitative voting data for members
   of the National Labor Relations Board from 1948 to 1988 ResultsAnalysis
   reveals a few clear cases of permanent and important preference change
   and some evidence of change at the very beginning or very end of a few
   board members' careers. But overall there is remarkable stability in the
   relative levels of support for labor exhibited by board members as their
   careers unfold. ConclusionsWith some notable exceptions, an independent
   regulatory board member's revealed preferences tend to remain stable and
   consistent with the expectations that any observer would have had at the
   time of their initial appointment.},

Abstract = {Challenges in sustainable regional planning have been a hot topic of
   discussion in the past few decades. In this article, we analyze
   different approaches to regional development planning and explore their
   relevance to achieving sustainability in the area, while emphasizing the
   importance of the bottom-up approach in regional planning. We performed
   a bibliometric analysis to detect the state of research of the regional
   development planning and examined the program of forming a system for
   ensuring a region's sustainability. We concluded that it is crucial to
   create national development plans utilizing a regional approach, which
   involves local projects and programs that benefit not just the economy
   and ecological state of the regions but also the inhabitants of those
   regions.},

Abstract = {Ralph Bunche, the first African American to receive the Nobel Peace
   Prize, was a committed anti-imperialist, a fighter against racism and
   for civil rights. And yet, his action and appearance as special
   representative of the United Nations Secretary-General in the Congo,
   made him appear as hostile to African independence and as a
   (neo-colonial) ``blanc,{''} questioning the sincerity of his
   anti-imperialism as well as his anti-racism. The article argues that
   Bunche's dilemma is paradigmatic for the paradox that exists between the
   United Nations' (UN) declared anti-racism and anti-imperialism, on the
   one hand, and its politics of peacekeeping and peacebuilding which are
   effectively a quasi-imperial politics of world order, on the other. The
   article dissects Ralph Bunche's writing and thinking on the
   international system, Africa and the Congo in order to understand how
   individual anti-racist commitment can co-exist, or even be
   co-constitutive of, systemic racism of international politics and law.
   Apart from providing important insights into the thought of a central
   founding figure of UN peacekeeping and peacebuilding, the article
   contributes, hence, to ongoing discussions on Eurocentrism and race in
   international politics.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the Cold War, international sanctions have become a
   popular tool for developed countries and some international
   organisations to express their dissatisfaction with the behaviour of
   certain countries. The issue of the effectiveness of sanctions is
   increasingly being debated with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the
   recent Russian invasion of Ukraine. While several empirical studies have
   questioned the effectiveness of international sanctions, especially with
   regard to their adverse effects on the well-being of populations,
   surprisingly little is known about the cross-country effect of sanctions
   on economic complexity. This study therefore investigates, as a first
   attempt, the effects of international sanctions on economic complexity
   in 76 target developing countries over the period 1998-2019. Our
   baseline model includes UE, US, and UN sanctions, and the empirical
   results show that international sanctions reduce economic complexity,
   with UE sanctions being more detrimental for target countries. These
   results are robust when considering alternative measures of
   international sanctions (including unilateral, plurilateral, economic,
   non-economic, financial, travel, trade, military, arms, and intensity of
   sanctions), alternative measures of economic complexity, and the
   instrumentation with the share of important votes in the UN General
   Assembly. Furthermore, we also test for potential channels and show that
   human capital, foreign investment, institutional quality, and terrorism
   are mechanisms through which international sanctions could affect
   economic complexity.},

Abstract = {Objective: : This research examined the effects of color lightness on
   evaluating advertisements featuring nonheteronormativity-themed images.
   Methods: : An increasing number of brands feature non-heteronormative
   couples in advertisement campaigns to target nonheteronormative
   consumers and position brands as socially progressive. Four studies were
   conducted to test the hypothesis that nonheteronormativity-themed
   advertising that uses lighter images would receive more favorable
   evaluations than darker images.
   Results: : The color lightness effect influenced attitudes toward the
   ad, product evaluations, and purchase intentions. Individuals with
   political conservatism exhibited a preference for lighter colored ads
   than darker colored ads. Furthermore, the effects of color lightness
   type on attitude toward ads were moderated by political conservatism,
   and this effect was mediated by disgust.
   Conclusion: : The current study suggests that a carefully designed
   advertising campaign featuring nonheteronormativity(gay) couples, which
   considers design elements can be used to target consumers and signal
   progressive values supported by sponsoring brands.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to discuss the main characteristics of the Middle
   East North Africa (MENA) region's capital inflows volatility. It also
   examines the effect of institutional quality and information
   availability on capital inflows volatility in selected MENA countries
   (Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Saudi
   Arabia and Tunisia) in the period
   1996-2017.Design/methodology/approachThe study's assessments are based
   on the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) and globalization
   indices. It also employs an updated data set of balance of payments
   indicators released by the International Monetary Fund. Moreover, the
   study uses econometric panel modeling of random effect model, with
   Driscoll-Kraay robust standard error, to analyze the relationship
   between capital inflows volatility, institutional quality and
   information availability.FindingsThe paper finds that both institutional
   quality and information availability are in an inverse relationship with
   the total capital inflows volatility in the MENA region. However, the
   findings vary across the different components of total capital inflows.
   For example, the volatility of foreign direct investment (FDI) declines,
   like total capital flows, as the two factors improve. However, the
   volatility of foreign portfolio investment (FPI) is negatively related
   to institutional quality but does not have any significant relationship
   with information availability. While the volatility of foreign other
   investments (FOI) decreases with the availability of information, but
   does not have any significant relationship with institutional
   quality.Originality/valueThis paper expands the limited literature
   regarding the determinants of capital inflows volatility. Furthermore,
   it is the first study that investigates the effect of institutional
   quality and information availability on capital inflows volatility in
   the MENA region.},

Title = {Grounding the political theory of global injustice in the actions of

Abstract = {In Poverty, Solidarity, and Poor-Led Social Movements, Monique Deveaux
   builds a political theory of poverty as relational and responsibility
   for injustice as solidaristic. Identifying the ways that poor-led
   movements have politically theorized and acted, Deveaux develops a
   theory of relational poverty that entails politicizing poverty which
   requires local-level organizing, consciousness-raising, resisting
   injustice and developing and demanding alternatives, and engaging in
   public debate and discourse. She goes on to argue that the praxis of
   poor-led movements reveals normative commitments to mutuality, deference
   and deep listening, and risk taking. These enable movements of people in
   poverty to take on the injustice of poverty together across difference,
   privilege, and other obstacles to transformative (solidaristic)
   politics. Deveaux provides a mode for doing grounded normative theory
   (GNT) by relying on secondary literature. GNT is a methodology for doing
   political theory that destabilizes the epistemological authority of the
   political theory of the academy by treating lived experience - words and
   actions - as providing relevant text for analysis. The methodology is
   particularly important for theories related to justice. Deveaux
   demonstrates how this can be done with secondary sources thus enabling
   comprehensive engagement without avoiding burdening social movement
   actors with interviews or other modes of accommodating researchers.},

Abstract = {Despite extensive literature examining digital activism, there is
   limited geographical research exploring the spatialities of digitally
   centred contentious politics. This article makes use of recent
   literature examining territory, terrain, sovereignty and digital
   territorialization projects to produce a conceptual framework that can
   make sense of the complex geographies of digital activism in
   contemporary China. It then uses this conceptual framework to analyse
   the spatial effects of digital territorialization projects and the
   development of digital sovereignty on those practising contentious
   politics in China. To do this, it uses the case study of
   \#BeijingSurgery\#, a Beijing-centred hashtag and instant messaging
   project attempting to contest narratives around the eviction of migrants
   from Beijing in 2017.},

Abstract = {This volume of the Australian Journal of Politics and History presents
   an edited collection of papers delivered by emerging and established
   researchers at the Second Rethinking \& Researching 20th Century
   Aboriginal Exemption Symposium, co-hosted by the University of the
   Sunshine Coast with La Trobe University in October 2021. The papers
   reveal the human costs, hardships and legacies of the state policies of
   Aboriginal Exemption last century which supposedly offered the promise
   of freedom to Indigenous Australians confined to reserves and missions.
   Equally, the papers explore innovative and culturally safe ways to
   investigate and further understand Aboriginal exemption that ensure
   Ancestors and Elders, who actively negotiated, resisted and subverted
   its use, are recognised and honoured.},

Abstract = {Military impersonation, or stolen valor, is an understudied topic.
   Military impersonation can be committed by civilians and service members
   alike. Military service misrepresentation is adjudicated under civilian
   federal law (for civilians and veterans) or the Uniform Code of Military
   Justice (UCMJ; for service members). In the legal field, the main
   literature concerns the constitutionality of the Stolen Valor Act (SVA)
   of 2005. However, since the SVA of 2005, many developments have
   occurred. The same applies to the UCMJ, which underwent a large revision
   that went into effect in 2019. The scarcity of research has led to this
   legal study covering the federal statutes and state statutes that apply
   to military impersonation. Not only are financial motives found,
   mitigation of sentences in court cases is also a motive. Both
   demonstrate a need for military history verification.},

Title = {Emotional response to UK political party leader facial displays of
   affiliation, reward, and ambiguity during Brexit},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {104},
Number = {3},
Pages = {281-298},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {ObjectiveOn December 12, 2019, the United Kingdom's ruling Conservative
   Party called an election that put the country's 2016 ``Brexit{''}
   referendum on leaving the European Union to the test. The divisive
   campaign and a polarized electorate culminated in large losses by
   opposition Labour and Liberal Democratic parties. Amid a polarized
   electorate, lingering questions arise as to whether the election results
   reflect more upon partisan ties or the respective party leaders' ability
   to emotionally connect with followers through their nonverbal behavior.
   MethodsUsing a unique pre-registered design, this study considers the
   emotional response to leaders of the three major U.K. political parties
   in the week prior to the December 2019 election by drawing upon a
   national sample of 546 partisan participants. We examine self-reported
   happiness, affinity, anger, and distress in response to reward and
   affiliative smiles as well as ambiguous facial displays in short videos
   shown without sound featuring Conservative Party leader Boris Johnson
   and his opponents Jeremy Corbyn (Labour Party) and Jo Swinson (Liberal
   Democratic Party). ResultsThe findings of this pre-registered study
   suggests partisan identity plays a powerful role in empathetic and
   counter-empathetic responses to leader facial displays generally.
   Further analysis reveals a more nuanced response to the competing
   leaders' facial displays with followers of all three parties responding
   to the different smiles in distinct manners.},

Abstract = {Music has always been a concern for sociology, and its classic authors
   attest to this. We begin this article - which is essayistic in nature -
   with a substantive analysis of this tradition that continues to
   (re)shape the sociology of music today. Amongst these clas- sics, we
   would like to highlight its greatest name: Max Weber. In fact, this
   author de- veloped a long-term analysis of Western music, especially
   with the advance of ration- alisation, somewhat similar to his analyses
   of the spirit of capitalism and the genesis of bureaucracy in Europe in
   his study The Rational and Social Foundations of Music - written between
   1912-1913 and published posthumously in 1921. We then establish a link
   between Weber's thesis and the sociology of music today, centring our
   analysis on contemporary music production through the use of Artificial
   Intelligence (AI), but also the digital universe more broadly. Weber's
   theoretical contributions are explored in re- lation to this, focusing
   on the interconnection between his concept of rationalisation and the
   emerging digitalisation of music - in particular, streaming services.},

Abstract = {The history of revolutionary volunteerism begins with the French
   Revolu-tionary and Napoleonic wars and continues with the Latin American
   and Greek Wars of Independence, the French invasion of Algeria, and the
   civil wars of the Iberian Peninsula and the Rio de la Plata. In the
   aftermath of the European revolutions of 1848 and the Spain's
   Progressive Biennium (1854-1856), many ex-revolutionaries, exiles,
   demobilized soldiers, and ordinary immigrants continued this tradition.
   They volunteered for wars in favor of democracy and national
   unification, and for liberal campaigns of conquest in the name of
   civilization. A blossoming academic literature has analyzed this
   phenomenon. All the same, little is known about ordinary volun-teers who
   did not write memoirs or become the protagonists of romanticized
   biog-raphies. This microhistory traces the wanderings of Claudio Feliu,
   a struggling artisan and militiaman from Barcelona who participated in
   the failed revolution of 1856 and then traveled to Argentina for
   political and personal reasons where he volunteered for a campaign
   against the Indians (1857-58) and then a naval attack in what was then
   called the ``War of National Unification{''} (1859). In addition to
   helping understand the ordinary experiences of volunteers, his life
   offers a window into analyzing the interconnections between the Rio de
   la Plata and the Mediterra-nean, and popular democratic internationalism
   in the mid nineteenth century.},

Title = {What Drives Inflation in High-inflation Countries? Evidence from Haiti,

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},

Volume = {71},

Pages = {238-266},
Abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the long-term effects
   of money supply, economic growth, interest rate, exchange rate, domestic
   credits and the oil price on inflation in Haiti, Sudan, Turkiye and
   Zambia, which are among the world's highest-inflation countries
   according to 2021 data. For this purpose, a panel cointegration approach
   is applied where fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and
   dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) techniques are employed to explore
   the long-term effects with the help of annual data for the period
   2000-2019. Also, the Dumitrescu and Hurlin panel causality test is used
   to determine whether there is a causality from these variables to
   inflation. The empirical findings show that there is a long-term
   relationship among these variables for the whole panel. The consequences
   from the FMOLS and DOLS estimates show that (i) money supply has a
   positive effect on inflation, (ii) economic growth affects inflation
   positively, (iii) an in-crease in the exchange rate causes inflation to
   rise, (iv) the oil price affects inflation positively, (v) interest rate
   affects inflation negatively, and (vi) domestic credits have a negative
   effect on infla-tion. In this context, we find that the exchange rate is
   the variable that has the greatest effect on infla-tion. Moreover, the
   findings of the panel causality test suggest that there is a causal
   relationship from money supply, economic growth, exchange rate and the
   oil price to inflation.},

Title = {Telluric geographies of the means of violence. On alterity, weapons, and
   space at the margins},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {109},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article provides a critical reading of the literatures on spaces at
   the margins of different polities and state/non-state forms of authority
   in political geography asking how infrastructures of violence are
   governed. In this ambit, weapons and military means have been poorly
   defined and conceptualised, while the ways they are actually governed
   (beyond a mostly instrumentalist perspective), as well as the effects
   this govern -mentality activity generates for the reproduction of
   (dis)orders at the margins, have not been directly investigated. Drawing
   from studies on biopolitical governmentality, and Roberto Esposito's
   conceptualization of the immunitary apparatus in particular, we explore
   how relations of alterity, as well as attendant political spaces, are
   terraformed through violence and infrastructures of governing weapons
   and military means. Our approach is attentive to the role of materiality
   and non -human elements in shaping socio-spatial relations but it
   highlights also how there exists a close link between (1) weapons and
   armed humans, (2) space, and (3) identity/alterity which is articulated
   via the act of governing infrastructures of violence. Building upon
   empirical insights from Myanmar's borderlands and frontiers, the paper
   shows that weapons and war -making are governed through infrastructures
   made of technical objects codifying violence materially, techniques of
   managing human -non -human entanglements, and rationalities. Conducting
   the conduct of violence contributes to reproduce the political space at
   the margins and to construct identity/alterity categories founded on the
   identification of less -than -human forms of life.},

   psycho-political analysis of the ``comfort woman{''} statue movements in
   South Korea},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {108},

Abstract = {Sonyosang (girl statue in Korean) is a bronze statue symbolizing
   ``comfort women,{''} the estimated 80,000 to 200,000 women physically,
   mentally, and sexually exploited by the Japanese Empire during WWII. As
   a backlash against the 2015 `' comfort women{''} agreement between the
   South Korean and Japanese governments, Koreans have installed 384 girl
   statues across South Korea. Based on ethnographic research that I
   conducted in South Korea between 2019 and 2021, including in-depth
   interviews with Korean activists who raised funds for or participated in
   creating, installing, and managing girl statues in South Korea, this
   research examines how the girl statue movement in South Korea has
   developed into a left-wing nationalist-populist movement and how
   affective identification with the statue generates a populist identity.
   To this end, this research firstly discusses how former President Park
   Geun-hye's undemocratic political measures recall the memory of
   minjungism (Korean populism) that led the pro-democracy movement in the
   1980s, enabling Korean nationalist leftists' demands to form a chain of
   equivalence in the girl statue movement. Secondly, relying on Melanie
   Klein's theory of identification, this article examines how the `people'
   is constituted through affective forms of identification with the girl
   statue. By doing so, this article demonstrates that the growth of the
   girl statue movement into a left-wing nationalist-populist movement
   blurs boundaries between the psychological, the personal, the national,
   and the (geo) political.},

Abstract = {Mobile phone interviews are becoming an increasingly appealing mode of
   data collection in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we used
   data from 36 countries to examine mobile phone coverage of adults aged
   15-49 years. We paid special attention to the (1) coverage rate
   (percentage of individuals who own at least one mobile phone) versus
   penetration rate (mobile phone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants), and
   (2) proxy-covered population (i.e., persons who do not own mobile phones
   but are potentially accessible through devices owned by other household
   members). Study findings suggest that (1) penetration rates notably
   overestimate mobile phone coverage of the population; (2) mobile phone
   coverage structure varies substantially; (3) mobile phone owners are
   more likely to be males, urban residents, literate, married, and
   relatively wealthy; and (4) proxy-covered adults are distinct with
   regard to demographic characteristics and survey outcomes in comparison
   to directly covered and not-covered adults. This study informs
   practitioners about the current coverage structure in several low- and
   middle-income countries and promotes proper procedures for studying
   coverage structure before implementing mobile phone interviews in those
   countries. Finally, this study introduces the term proxy-coverage and
   advocates for approaching the proxy-covered population to reduce
   noncoverage bias, especially in settings where mobile phone sharing
   among family members is common.},

   levels},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {80},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The literature on fiscal federalism has long debated whether fiscally
   decentralized countries are inherently more economically and fiscally
   unstable. This paper contributes to this literature by analyzing the
   impact of fiscal decentralization on one of the most important
   dimensions of macroeconomic stability, the unemployment level. This is
   the first study in the literature to address the relationship between
   fiscal decentralization and unemployment rate at the country level,
   especially using the decomposition between its structural and cyclical
   components. The fundamental relationship is explored empirically by
   using an instrumental variable approach on a panel of 52 countries
   between 1991 and 2012. The main result is that more fiscally
   decentralized countries in general tend to experience lower unemployment
   rates. We also find, as theoretically anticipated, that the impact of
   fiscal decentralization is mostly on structural unemployment compared to
   cyclical unemployment. The results are robust to alternative
   specifications.},

Abstract = {How does economic opportunity - the set of possible investments in an
   economy - shape politics, and politics shape investment? We argue that
   in a world where money is power, political leaders will intervene in the
   economy if investment returns shift power and threaten their position.
   Anticipation of such action induces a bias towards investments which
   vary less and co-vary with the investments of the regime. Leaders will
   then weigh losses from such intervention and biased allocation, which
   depends on possible investments' risk and covariance, with the costs of
   a larger and less vulnerable coalition. We provide causal evidence of
   this process using the steamship revolution in transport which radically
   altered economic opportunity in the 19th century. We show that not only
   do large coalition regimes (e.g. democracies) have an inherent
   investment edge in high-risk projects, such as new technology and
   international trade, but that they are more likely to emerge if that is
   where economic opportunities are.},

Abstract = {Using data from professional football leagues in four countries, we
   assess the effects on team performances following head coach turnover,
   distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary exits. We use entropy
   balancing to deal with the endogeneity of coach departures, by
   reweighting pre-departure covariates to obtain a comparable control
   group. Results reveal little, if any, positive effect from either type
   of turnover, though some longer-term benefits are possible if teams
   experience no subsequent turnover. We discuss how these findings fit
   with previous literature and theory, and discuss the wider practical
   implications.},

Abstract = {This article employs structural vector autoregression and local
   projection methods to examine the impacts of the deterioration in the
   US-China political relations on bilateral trade between Australia and
   China. Three scenarios are considered to reflect the evolution of US
   geopolitical strategies in recent years such as ``America First{''},
   ``China Threat Theory{''} and ``The Protection of US Allies{''}. The
   simulation results illustrate that worsening the US-China political
   relations has a negative impact on Australian exports to and imports
   from China. It is also found that economic conditions in the US play a
   more important role in the transmission of this impact than those in
   China and Australia. In addition, various options are explored to check
   the robustness of the findings in this article.},

Title = {A place for pastoral power: From the ``government of souls{''} to
   ``global struggles for souls{''}},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {107},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {While research on geopolitical space and faith has drawn on Michel
   Foucault's work on power/knowledge, subjectivity, and strategy, little
   use has been made of his genealogies of Christian pastoral power.
   Arguing that Foucault's work on the pastorate analyzes
   political-religious submission, care, control, and resistance without
   reflexively secularizing faith (by either normalizing or abnormalizing
   it), this article calls for its use in research on ``global struggles
   for souls{''}. However, to make pastoral power relevant to contemporary
   Christian and non -Christian subjectivities in Europe and beyond,
   Foucault's confinement of the concept to ancient-medieval
   Western-European Christendom must be revisited. To that end, the article
   undertakes a close and concurrent reading of Foucault's key works on
   pastoral power and identifies core conditions around the concept's
   contemporary applicability. Moreover, in critiquing Foucault's
   Eurocentric mapping of the pastorate, I argue that its analytical merits
   cannot extend to subaltern subjects (Christian and otherwise, in Europe
   and beyond) unless it is rethought through postcolonial and decolonial
   notions of power as relations of embodied race, class, gender, and other
   difference reproduced through colonial legacies.},

Title = {Regional immunity complexes: A plurospherical and autoimmunological
   reimagining of regional security},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {107},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article proposes a categorical reframing of regional security
   theory that builds on and extends the recent theoretical turn towards
   immunology. Specifically, the article argues that the systems of
   regional security should be recast as systems of regional immunity in
   order to draw attention not only to the spatial complexities of
   postnational and increasingly deterritorialised regionalism, fuelled by
   the spatial modalities of late modernity, but also to the autoimmunitary
   processes that are at work in all protective and resilience-building
   systems, biological and political alike. The discussion departs from
   Peter Sloterdijk's immunological theory of spheres in order to delineate
   the broad outlines of what the article terms Regional Immunity Complexes
   (RIC's). Through this reading, structures of regional security take on
   the form of a plurosphere of atmospherically differentiated and
   immunised lifeworlds that rhizomatically unfold through the connected
   isolations of Sloterdijk's foams. Through the exploration of specific
   examples, the article shows how the dynamics of regional plurospheres
   affect the processes of regional security and resilience and how these
   then engender the very counter-processes of autoimmunological erasure.},

Abstract = {Introductio: nWe draw on social contract theory and resource curse
   literatures to assess the relationship between government revenue
   composition and forest loss in low- and middle-income nations that
   collect higher levels of revenues from a broad base of individuals and
   companies should have less forest loss.Methods: We use two-stage
   instrumental variable regression models to test how a government's
   revenue source impacts forest loss for a sample of 83 low- and
   middle-income nations.Results: We find support that low- and
   middle-income nations that collect more revenue from broad-based taxes
   tend to have less forest loss.Conclusion: We move the cross-national
   research frontier forward by applying insights from the fiscal contract
   and resource curse literatures to forest loss. We find that a
   government's revenue source is related to forest loss with low- and
   middle-income nations that rely more on broad-based taxes having lower
   levels of forest loss than revenues collected from other sources
   including natural resource rents and foreign aid.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate transformation processes in
   the field of public administration in Ukraine and the possibility of
   implementing change management. This article uses a case-study
   methodology, with both primary source statistics and archival materials,
   to evaluate the extent of decentralisation reforms in Ukraine. We
   demonstrate that reforms have been partial, which we attribute to an
   inefficient and opaque system that frustrates reform efforts. The main
   gaps of the Ukrainian authorities are observed in the inability to
   effectively influence the distribution of resources, in particular, to
   ensure the functioning of newly created territorial units. The article
   provides evidence that the existing problems that are the result of
   inefficient public administration in Ukraine, regarding poverty,
   inflation, the growing gap between rural and urban population, and the
   growth of unemployment, can be solved by implementing change management.
   The decentralisation reforms initiated in Ukraine have often been
   extolled in various quarters for their potential to enhance
   administrative and governance efficiency. Nevertheless, a comprehensive
   and empirical assessment detailing the full extent and depth of these
   reforms remains conspicuously absent. Such a gap in the literature
   underscores the need for a rigorous examination to ascertain the real
   magnitude of changes and their tangible impacts on the ground. The
   novelty of the study consists in the focus on the approach of the
   three-dimensional design of public administration proposed by Ukrainian
   researchers in the context of `management-administration-management'.},

Abstract = {In 2018, the UN Global Compact for Migration (GCM) was signed by a
   majority of countries. The GCM was the first intergovernmentally
   negotiated agreement, prepared under the auspices of the United Nations,
   to cover all dimensions of international migration in a holistic and
   comprehensive manner. Seventeen countries, among them Italy, Austria,
   Hungary and Poland, abstained or voted against this non-binding
   agreement as they feared interference in their national sovereignty. The
   polarising potential of the GCM, that supposedly sets global regulations
   against national policies, has been fuelled by far-right actors
   throughout Europe. Framing the decision on the GCM as a referendum
   against the allegedly liberal governance of migration in the European
   Union, movements and parties launched a multi-faceted campaign that
   generated protest and spurred advocacy networks transnationally. In this
   paper, we analyse the extent to which the campaign against the GCM
   influenced foreign policy in the narrow sense of countries signing or
   not signing the pact (short-term impact), but also in terms of discourse
   and policy on immigration (long-term impact), more broadly. We explore
   the relative role of campaigning against the GCM by contrasting four
   country cases - Austria, Belgium, Germany, and Italy, each of which had
   different governmental constellations and previous extra-parliamentary
   mobilisation on migration. Our work offers a first in-depth comparative
   study of this key campaign that has otherwise remained understudied in
   the field of protest, media and extremism studies. By providing a
   comparative analysis of the same campaign in four European countries, we
   aim to offer important insights on how the far right is attempting to
   impact decision making in foreign policy contexts and what factors might
   explain its mobilisation and influence capacity.},

Abstract = {This study examines how the news framing of immigration influences the
   public's feelings toward immigrants and their preference for immigration
   policy in the United States. Unlike prior experimental research that
   documents the respondents' immediate reactions to several hand-crafted
   news frames, this study provides strong empirical evidence for the
   association between the respondents' real-world news exposure and their
   opinion change over time. Combining a computational media content
   analysis and a two-wave panel survey, the research demonstrates that
   while exposure to certain frames in the mainstream media would directly
   lead to public support for a stricter immigration policy, partisan media
   tend to affect public opinion indirectly by influencing their feelings
   toward immigrants in opposite directions.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis article investigates the extent to which perceptions of
   the competitive context of mayoral elections reflect actual levels of
   competition and how that relationship is shaped by political
   expertise.MethodsWe use a unique survey data set of more than 6000
   respondents interviewed in 40 separate mayoral elections.ResultsIn broad
   strokes, people living in competitive cities are more likely than others
   to predict competitive outcomes. However, in keeping with the knowledge
   gap hypothesis, the relationship between objective levels of competition
   and perceived levels of competition is much stronger among those with
   relatively high levels of political knowledge than those with low levels
   of political knowledge.ConclusionsThe connection between actual and
   perceived conditions does not hold evenly for all segments of
   society-the information-rich respond to their political environment,
   while the information-poor are relatively unmoved by that environment.
   This pattern of asymmetric information acquisition is a familiar one in
   American politics and provides further evidence of an important source
   of political inequality.},

Abstract = {Digital media platforms have been implicated in the recent rise of
   far-right extremism. This study proposes that these platforms afford
   emotional processes that lie at the core of far-right movements. Drawing
   on Randall Collins' interactional framework and the literature on
   cultural trauma, we investigate the emotional processes triggered by
   traumatic experiences within far-right online communities. As a case, we
   examine how the white supremacist community Stormfront responded to the
   2008 election of Barack Obama, by analyzing the complete datasets of
   discussion on the forum through a combination of computational methods
   and qualitative analysis. Our findings suggest that the community
   functioned as a ``emotional refuge{''}, where members collectively
   interpreted and transformed their emotional reactions, thereby shaping
   an emotionally energized collective with a focused target of collective
   action.},

Title = {Speculating on shale: Resource-making and the `politics of possibility'
   in Poland and the UK},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {107},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on the speculative character of knowledge and action
   in relation to subterranean resources, drawing on the curtailed
   histories of shale gas development in Poland and the UK. It adopts a
   political-economic orientation towards speculation rather than a
   narrowly financial one, seeking to understand the `politics of
   possibility' associated with speculative resources. Specifically, we
   build on work in political geography to understand speculation as a form
   of productive `resonance' replicating across epistemic, economic, and
   political domains. Thinking of speculation as resonance - as synchronous
   vibration across different areas of social life, stimulated by and
   intensifying uncertainty - offers a novel way of thinking about the
   possibilities of subterranean resources for forging political
   alignments. We show how speculation was integral to demonstrating the
   resource potential of shale in both Poland and the UK, and consider how
   this speculative character of shale subsequently infiltrated into
   economic and policy realms. Resonating across these domains, and
   amplifying epistemic uncertainties about shale, speculation produced a
   politics of possibility orientated towards `gambling' on potential
   outcomes. By taking seriously the political possibilities of the
   uncertainties attached to subterranean resources, we extend the value of
   speculation as a concept for analysing the constitutive role of
   uncertainty in politicaleconomic governance.},

Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The number of legislations around the world restricting the use and
   publication of pre-election polls during election campaigns is on the
   rise. However, we do not have a good sense of the extent to which
   citizens are against the publication of pre-election polls and what
   factors drive support or opposition for their regulation. In this
   research note, we tackle these issues using data from the 2019 Canadian
   Election Study. Our findings show that citizens are quite divided on
   whether polls should be banned during the last week of the campaign.
   Moreover, contrary to our expectations, we find almost no evidence of
   partisan effects in citizens' opinions about the regulation of polls. We
   interpret these findings as good news for democracy as citizens, at
   least in some contexts, do not seem to rely on partisan considerations
   when it comes to the regulation of political information.},

Abstract = {Several disciplines in social sciences have shown that institutions that
   promote cooperation facilitate mutually beneficial exchanges and
   generate prosperity. Drawing on these insights, this paper develops a
   Reservation Economic Freedom Index that classifies institutions on a
   sample of Indian reservations concerning whether these intuitions will
   enhance the prosperity of Indians residing on these reservations. The
   development of this index is guided by the research of political
   scientists, economists, other social science disciplines, and research
   in law. When correlating this index with Indian incomes, the evidence
   shows a statistically significant positive correlation between
   reservations with prosperity-enhancing institutions and their economic
   prosperity.},

Title = {Territorial consolidation after rebel victory: when does civil war
   recur?},
Journal = {TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Pages = {920-940},
Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {Rebel victors of civil war face existential threats both internally and
   externally. In consolidating territorial control, how do rebel victors
   respond to domestic armed challengers? Do such decisions determine civil
   war recurrence? This paper argues that rebel victors can manage domestic
   risk and consolidate state power by either repressing or coopting
   challengers. Cooption strategies can range from the less inclusive, such
   as unilateral changes to the constitution and elite power-sharing
   arrangements, to the more inclusive, such as signing peace agreements
   and negotiated constitutional reform. While repression and non-inclusive
   cooption strategies increase chances of civil recurrence,
   consensus-based strategies of state consolidation, such as negotiated
   constitutional reform, reduce repeat civil wars. Evidence is found for
   our argument in newly configured data on cases of rebel victory since
   the end of the Cold War (1989-2015).},

Abstract = {In this paper, we build a simple endogenous growth model with labour and
   corporate taxes to investigate the asymmetric effects of tax policy over
   the growth trajectory. We employ a newly developed panel smooth
   transition model to empirically analyse a sample of 19 advanced
   economies over the 1961-2017 period. We find that both the asymmetric
   effects and the tax measures used are essential. We also find that the
   effects of corporate and personal taxes on long-run growth are
   non-linear, while the detrimental effects of personal taxes are
   empirically larger compared to those of corporate taxes once
   non-linearities are controlled for.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the Instagram self-presentation of Italian party
   leaders Giorgia Meloni and Matteo Renzi. Building on the notion that
   circumstances are crucial to the construction of the self through
   digital photography, we argue that the two leaders strategically use
   setting and accompaniment to navigate the demands of their populist
   self-presentation as ``ordinary super leaders{''}: exceptional
   celebrity-like personae whose lives remain nonetheless close to those of
   their constituents. To make our case, we analyze a corpus of images
   featuring the two leaders posted on their Instagram profiles during 2020
   (266 for Meloni and 158 for Renzi). Our findings suggest that Meloni and
   Renzi alternate and remix celebrity practices of exclusivity,
   exceptionalism, and everydayness in an attempt to come across as
   simultaneously extraordinary and ordinary, aspirational and relatable.
   Inspired by Meyrowitz's ``middle region politics,{''} we propose the
   notion of middle region populism to describe how populist leaders
   leverage the affordances of an image-centric social media platform and
   the vernacular of internet celebrity to curate an online presence in
   which they pose as exceptionally charismatic yet ordinary and relatable.},

Abstract = {The spread of disinformation has been a topic of heightened concern,
   particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the response to a public
   health crisis relies on the ability for public officials to inform
   citizens. Using a representative two-wave panel of internet users in
   Brazil, we examine the relationship between pathways to information,
   WhatsApp use, and the persistence of misinformed beliefs about the
   pandemic. We find a strong relationship between presidential support,
   right-wing news sources, and participating in WhatsApp groups with
   strangers, and becoming more misinformed over time. Conversely, most
   media diets (traditional news media, social media and WhatsApp for news)
   had no effect. However, Bolsonaro supporters, using WhatsApp and
   Facebook for news was strongly associated with increasing and persistent
   misinformation. Our findings provide further evidence that political
   leaders undermine a country's ability to respond to a pandemic insofar
   as they breed mistrust in other institutions by instrumentalizing public
   health measures to win political fights.},

Abstract = {This article studies surrogacy as one of the most popular assisted human
   reproduction techniques in the world and focuses on Latin America to
   review its regulation in Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Ecuador,
   Panama, and Peru. As a main finding, none of these nations' legislative
   bodies have issued comprehensive regulations and the only existing
   lights to order this practice have been given by jurisprudence and, on
   some occasions, pronouncements of administrative authorities that deal
   with specific cases and lack the general and binding nature of the law.
   On the other hand, it was possible to find differences in the
   conceptualization, which obeys the degree of discussion existing in each
   country. Finally, it reflects on the absence of regulation in surrogacy
   and possible violations of the rights of the actors involved.},

Abstract = {We present a model of plea bargaining and vary the value a prosecutor
   places on a conviction obtained via plea bargain relative to a
   conviction obtained at trial. We show that increasing the relative value
   of a plea bargain increases the trial penalty and decreases the severity
   of the equilibrium plea bargain. We report the results of an exploratory
   experiment which assesses this prediction in a more realistic setting,
   in which subjects are incentivized by conviction rates. Our treatment
   variable is whether convictions obtained via plea bargain are included
   in conviction rate calculations. Including plea bargains in conviction
   rates increases the number of plea offers made and increases the trial
   penalty, which is qualitatively in line with our predictions.},

Abstract = {BackgroundAcademic research is the site where the production and
   dissemination of knowledge are embedded in Eurocentric epistemologies
   which are posited as universal and non-Eurocentric knowledges are
   devalued, dismissed, and ignored. ObjectivesThe goal was to explore the
   tensions that emerged between the Global North team and the Global South
   team, from the Global North's perspective. MethodsThis paper a
   collaborative autoethnography to trace how the logics' of coloniality of
   power structured a transnational research project focused on exploring
   Indigenous Women's experience of marginalization. The autoethnography
   involved engaging in critical reflexive auto-interviews between the team
   members in the Global North, analyzing field notes and personal written
   reflections. ResultsAutoethnography revealed how colonial conditioning
   respectively shaped both-the Global North and the Global South teams'
   expectations of one another, and as such, how they each operationalized
   decoloniality in the research process. ConclusionThe Global North team
   focused on epistemically disengaging from coloniality but became overly
   concerned on meeting the expectations of the funder's temporally
   oriented productivity demands and ended up rearticulating coloniality's
   logics. The Global South was concerned with remedying the material
   dimensions of coloniality in their local community but became overly
   focused on adopting neoliberal logic models to efficiently satisfy the
   North's productivity expectations. Meaning, they, too, rearticulated
   coloniality's logics.},

Abstract = {The use of warning labels on political advertisements is one way to help
   citizens better evaluate the source and veracity of messaging, and
   combat the harms of misinformation on social media. Reliance on labeling
   is part of a larger policy push for greater transparency on social media
   platforms with respect to the source and quality of information. In this
   study, we test the effectiveness of ``traffic light{''} labels (red,
   orange, green) as indicia of the veracity of political advertisements on
   YouTube. In an online experiment (N=1,054), we test seven variations of
   TL-veracity labels and find that red and orange traffic light labels
   placed concurrently with the start of a political advertisement
   significantly affect credibility perceptions. Taken together, the
   findings suggest that direct-to-consumer labels can be effective inputs
   to credibility perceptions, but their effectiveness depends on timing
   and position.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the use of social media for news affects
   citizens' knowledge about politics and current affairs. We employ a
   two-dimensional perspective on political knowledge and investigate how
   factual political knowledge, confidence in that knowledge, and
   misinformation, understood as the mismatch between factual political
   knowledge and confidence in knowledge, are related to social media news
   consumption. While earlier studies have suggested a negative
   relationship between social media news consumption and factual
   knowledge, there are indications that social media use may give people a
   general sense of being informed, even when they are not. Such general
   subjective knowledge might, however, differ from confidence in retrieved
   facts. Drawing on a two-wave panel study from Norway, we find evidence
   of a negative relationship between social media news consumption and
   both dimensions of knowledge. Notably, however, we do not find that
   social media news use leads to confidence in incorrect beliefs,
   suggesting that the digital media environment produces an uninformed,
   but not an overconfident, misinformed news audience.},

Abstract = {Concerns over online hatespeech have prompted governments to strengthen
   social media governance. However, claims by policy-makers and political
   activists regarding the effectiveness and likely consequences of legal
   regulations remain largely untested. We rely on qualitative interviews
   and two expert surveys to examine the behavior of public relations
   professionals in response to online hatespeech when having the option of
   using the new user-complaint mechanism under the German Network
   Enforcement Act (NetzDG). Our findings reveal that strategies depend on
   whether professionals work at public sector institutions, business, or
   civil society organizations and political parties. Public sector
   institutions are likely to report to the platform, but not under NetzDG.
   Civil society organizations are likely to choose content moderation,
   counterspeech, and other forms of intervention. Businesses deploy a wide
   range of strategies. In practice, Germany's procedural approach relying
   on user-complaint mechanisms to deal with online hatespeech is not used
   by experts as a means to combat online harassment.},

Abstract = {Among the Pacific Northwest Coast Indians of North America before and
   during the extended era of European contact, a pervasive institution
   known as the potlatch governed human relations through reciprocity
   rather than the hierarchical state. Potlatching involved recurring
   intertribal feasting, gift giving, ceremonial dance, storytelling,
   oratory, dispute resolution, declarations of claim or right, and some
   measure of property destruction. The tribes referred to this network of
   publicly declared favors given and owed and promises made and received
   as their customary ``potlatch law.{''} Like law in the Western world, it
   was the foundation on which their economies rested. The potlatch
   memorialized obligations, enforced property rights, insured against
   risk, promoted knowledge accumulation, supplied investment capital, and
   served as a system of fractional reserve banking. Beyond that, it was
   the foundation of the tribes' unique culture. The potlatch provides
   fascinating insight into the nuance and power of reciprocity in ordering
   human relations.},

Title = {External voting in Latin America. Explaining variations in turnout
   (1990-2017)},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {105},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The study of turnout of expatriates has aroused early attention in the
   literature on external voting, given the low generalized participation
   rates. Although some causes have already been considered, not much
   progress has been made in theoretically supporting these reasons. At the
   same time, most are case studies or comparisons between a few cases,
   with mostly descriptive analysis strategies which do not allow to make
   causal inferences. In addition, the very few studies of large N cover
   short periods of time or do not address electoral participation. So,
   which are the factors that condition emigrants' turnout is a question
   that still needs to be answered. Drawing on an original data set of 104
   elections held between 1990 and 2017 across 15 countries of LA and based
   on rational choice theory, we compare turnout at the aggregate level
   seeking to explain its variation among countries and over time, using
   time series and fixed effects models. The results show that turnout
   increases with simplified registration procedures, flexible deadlines
   and in presidential and second-round elections. Likewise, polarization
   contexts and majority electoral systems reduce the dissuasive effect on
   participation of non-competitive elections.},

Abstract = {I am interested in the ``rational irrationality hypothesis{''} about
   voter behavior. According to this hypothesis, voters regularly vote for
   policies that are contrary to their interests because the act of voting
   for them isn't. Gathering political information is time-consuming and
   inconvenient. Doing so is unlikely to lead to positive results since
   one's vote is unlikely to be decisive. However, we have preferences over
   our political beliefs. We like to see ourselves as members of certain
   groups (e.g. ``rugged individualists{''}) and being part of those groups
   depends on having certain beliefs (e.g. about welfare spending). Even if
   a decrease in welfare spending would be bad for me, I might still
   benefit by believing in and, consequently, voting for a decrease since
   my vote is unlikely to make a difference but getting to see myself as a
   rugged individualist will make a noticeable difference to my wellbeing.
   It is sometimes argued that this hypothesis fails for empirical reasons.
   I will argue that things are worse: it is conceptually incoherent. I
   will do so by first showing that it is a rationalizing explanation and
   then argue that rationalizing explanations must be reflectively stable
   from the agent's perspective. The rational irrationality hypothesis is
   not.},

Abstract = {US platform companies have dominated the global platform economy.
   Drawing on archival research, interviews, and company reports, we
   explore the reasons that Russia was able to develop platform companies
   that survived the entry of US firms. The chaotic post-Soviet society
   paradoxically provided a sheltered environment within which domestic
   companies could build sufficient competence to maintain their domestic
   market position. As first movers, Russian companies created and
   leveraged within-country network effects based on social, cultural, and
   physical affinities with their user base. This made it difficult for US
   platforms to overwhelm domestic companies. After 2008, the Russian
   government's position regarding the internet changed, and it began to
   selectively shield domestic leaders by preventing acquisitions by
   foreign companies and requiring the preloading of domestic applications
   on devices. Our Russian case study is instructive for other countries
   that want to remain open but, at the same time, build domestic platform
   companies.},

Abstract = {Conceptualising Kiribati as an interstitial island in the Chinese
   Pacific provides an opportunity to elaborate on the way it sits at the
   intersections of culture, geography and history as a sovereign entity
   with a role of assemblage. As the debate that ensued a Chinese
   diplomatic visit in 2020 illustrates, such intersections can be absorbed
   into frameworks that are largely beyond the control of islanders, and be
   given different meanings. The critical analysis of these debates points
   to the meanings that get lost in such a process of absorption and
   homogenisation and applies a decolonial methodology to avoid that.
   Furthermore, this analysis elaborates on the concept of island
   sovereignty in a deeper and more articulate way than that afforded by
   the media format in which those debates are shaped. The way the welcome
   ceremony has been enacted suggests that the I-Kiribati political project
   is far from being a passive acceptance of Chinese presence and influence
   in the Pacific Ocean.},

Title = {The Impact of Voter Education on Voter Confidence: Evidence from the
   2020 U.S. Presidential Election},
Journal = {ELECTION LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {In this article, we assess whether voters who live in states where state
   election officials (EOs) invested in voter education have higher levels
   of confidence in vote counting. We argue state investment in voter
   education strengthens voter confidence by improving voter experiences
   and creating a culture of voter education, both of which facilitate
   transparency in elections. We measure state election official investment
   in voter education during the 2020 U.S. Presidential election by merging
   a unique dataset of EO social media communications during the last
   months of the 2020 election cycle with various election administration
   data sources. We find EO use of Facebook bolsters confidence in vote
   counting at the personal, local, and state level. Importantly, voters
   predisposed to question election integrity living in these states-those
   highly skeptical about the occurrence of fraud and who supported Donald
   Trump in 2016-express higher confidence at the personal, local, and
   state level in states where EOs were active on Facebook in 2020.
   Findings are mixed for measures of resource investment in voter
   education through federal and private funding. Our study is the first to
   establish a positive relationship between voter education and voter
   confidence. However, our findings also underscore the pervasive effects
   of partisanship and national narratives about stolen elections.},

Title = {Destabilizing Race in Political Communication: Social Movements as Sites

Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {484-503},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {How do social movement actors use consciousness-raising communicative
   practices to reconfigure political understandings of race? And how can
   such practices shape the analysis of political communication? We explore
   these questions by drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, semi-structured
   interviews, and archival materials to examine two case studies: an
   historical example of Grace Lee Boggs' structural guidelines for
   creating a revolutionary study group in the Asian Political Alliance and
   a contemporary example of Equality Labs' anti-caste political organizing
   by engaging across racial and caste social hierarchies. These cases
   illustrate the analytic value of engaging alternative theoretical
   frameworks of race and politics from critical ethnic studies, feminist
   of color scholarship, and social movements as rich sites of political
   theory through cultivating political consciousness in service of radical
   political imaginations.This article offers two main contributions to the
   field of political communication. First, by looking at the creative work
   of racial theorizing within social movements, we destabilize the limits
   of race as a demographic category. Second, we demonstrate the analytic
   value of studying political education and consciousness-raising as
   communicative practices that emphasize relational reconfigurations of
   race. This article recasts racial political discourse from public
   opinion and campaign messaging measured quantitatively to political
   imaginations that must be interpreted within historical and material
   contexts. As our cases demonstrate, centering the shifting category of
   race within movement building opens up the field of political
   communication to the communicative processes of consciousness-building
   and also offers dynamic understandings of race and racialization.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveWe evaluate the relationship between economic freedom and
   incarceration at the U.S. metropolitan statistical area level. MethodWe
   use economic freedom data at the metropolitan statistical area unit and
   local incarceration data from the Vera Institute in 5-year intervals
   from 1977 through 2017. ResultsOur evidence suggests that greater
   economic freedom is associated with lower rates of incarceration in
   jails for the overall population. The channel tends to be through both
   the first and second economic freedom components ({''}size of
   government{''} and ``taxation,{''} respectively). Finally, the results
   for juvenile incarcerated populations are largely driven by labor market
   freedoms. ConclusionTo the extent that reducing incarceration rates
   continue to be viewed as a positive outcome in line with recent trends,
   this study suggests that promoting laws and policies aimed at enhancing
   economic freedom could be an avenue to advancing that goal. For
   proponents, this policy implication has the rare advantage of bipartisan
   appeal.},

Abstract = {Race has been a consequential factor in politics for centuries, yet our
   review of the political communication literature finds only sporadic
   interest in the topic. To examine systematically how and how much
   political communication research has addressed race, we analyze
   author-supplied keywords in nine journals within three broad categories
   (political communication, generalist communication, and critical
   communication) over 31 years. Combining computational methods and
   traditional content analysis, we find that political communication and
   generalist journals engaged with race substantially less than critical
   journals, and that this level of engagement has remained essentially
   flat since the mid-1990s. Political communication journals discussed
   racism least among the three journal types, and specific political
   communication theories appeared rarely across the board. Finally,
   addressing race did not predict journal impact factor.},

Abstract = {Political communication researchers commonly use one of two strategies
   to measure online network diversity: a ``subjective `` approach tapping
   participants' impressions of the diversity in their networks, or a
   ``structural `` approach that asks about the socioeconomic position of
   individuals within their networks. While these measures are largely
   treated as functional equivalents in research about information
   technology and politics, we demonstrate that the two measures are only
   moderately correlated, and there are systematic differences in the
   reliability and validity of the two measures. We conclude that the
   structural measure is the better choice for most studies, although the
   subjective measure may be more appropriate in some cases.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates therelationship between prosperity and national
   account data during wartime, focusing on Canada. In particular, we build
   off of existing literature arguing that military outlays must be
   excluded for real output measures to reasonably approximate economic
   prosperity. We analyse all non-war components of Canadian gross national
   product during both world wars and estimate a novel price deflator for
   World War II in order to take into account wartime price controls. This
   allows us to obtain a new estimate of real output in Canada excluding
   military outlays. We then compare the trends in our new real output
   series with domestic private investment and stock market trends, all
   three of which either fell or grew at an anemic pace in Canada during
   both world wars. Combined, we argue that this provides evidence against
   the idea of wartime prosperity and more specifically, against the notion
   of World War II ending the Great Depression in Canada.},

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {102},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Geopolitical imaginations are disseminated in a variety of media forms.
   Looking at everyday user-generated content, popular culture on the
   internet enables insightful encounters. This paper analyses a community
   on the social platform Reddit, where so-called Polandballs are shared.
   These satirical comics, where countries are portrayed as ball-shaped
   characters, coloured according to national flags, represent diverse
   geopolitical as-semblages. The paper argues for utilising an assemblage
   approach to track the dynamic and interlinked content creations and
   discussions by members of the community. Contrary to the Western-centric
   orientation in the community, the representations of Singapore by
   Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans are analysed. This high-lights
   narratives which are usually subdued in general geopolitical discourses,
   which concentrate on countries perceived as important on the world
   stage. The findings indicate that content creators discuss economic
   pros-perity, international relations, and structural vulnerabilities
   from different angles. There are popular depictions, yet some offer
   alternative discourses. Further, audiences challenge perceptions through
   their active engagement in the assemblages and through including
   external discursive elements. Hence, the paper shows a suitable
   application of assemblage thinking when discussing everyday negotiations
   of geopolitical discourses in hitherto neglected social media spaces and
   emphasises the role of non-institutionalised geopolitical content
   creation.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveIn this article, we explore how populist beliefs and related
   attitudes (nativism and system-level discontent) are associated with
   support for government spending across a wide range of countries and
   spending categories. MethodUsing cross-sectional survey data spanning 18
   democratic countries, we test how each of these constructs affects
   support for government spending on education, healthcare, social
   welfare, and job creation, and how that support is affected by explicit
   tradeoffs between spending increases, taxation, and public debt.
   ResultsPopulism and system-level discontent are associated with support
   for increased government spending, while nativism is associated with
   opposition to government spending. ConclusionsThis creates an inherent
   and perhaps intractable tension within right-wing populist movements.
   The nativist sentiments that animate right-wing populist movements work
   to undermine support for redistributive spending.},

Abstract = {We use a panel of Korean municipalities to examine the impact of
   participatory budgeting on local government expenditures. We find that
   participatory budgeting systematically alters the pattern of local
   spending. Municipalities using participatory budgeting reallocate
   resources to-ward more immediate and visible expenditures and away from
   long-term development expen-diture. We also find evidence that
   participatory budgeting affects the municipal budget by a greater amount
   than the expenditures directly allocated through participatory
   budgeting. Our findings indicate that participatory budgeting leads to
   the reallocation of local public spending by increasing information
   flows between policymakers and service users.},

Abstract = {We prove that the core for Borda count is empty in many cases in which
   the majority core is non-empty. We then compare Borda count and majority
   rule in a forward agenda using a two-dimensional spatial voting model
   with minimal-intelligence agents who vote sincerely and propose
   randomly. The analysis allows us to compare Borda count and majority
   rule in a dynamic setting and to show which voting rule is more capable
   of attaining Pareto-optimal policies and utilitarian ideals under those
   conditions. We find that Borda count moves policies in the rough
   vicinity of the Copeland winner and typically outperforms majority rule
   on both criteria in twenty rounds or less. Majority rule often
   outperforms Borda count in 1000 rounds. This provides a modest step in
   the application of new voting rules to committees.},

Abstract = {This paper uses a laboratory experiment to investigate the efficacy of
   different content moderation policies designed to combat misinformation
   on social media. These policies vary the way posts are monitored and the
   consequence imposed when misinformation is detected. We consider three
   monitoring protocols: (1) individuals can fact check information shared
   by other group members for a cost; (2) the social media platform
   randomly fact checks each post with a fixed probability; (3) the
   combination of individual and platform fact checking. We consider two
   consequences: (1) fact-checked posts are flagged, such that the results
   of the fact check are available to all who view the post; (2)
   fact-checked posts are flagged, and subjects found to have posted
   misinformation are automatically fact checked for two subsequent rounds,
   which we call persistent scrutiny. We compare our data to that of
   Pascarella et al. (Social media, (mis)information, and voting decisions.
   Working paper, 2022), which studies an identical environment without
   content moderation. We find that allowing individuals to fact check
   improves group decision making and welfare. Platform checking alone does
   not improve group decisions relative to the baseline with no moderation.
   It can improve welfare, but only in the case of persistent scrutiny.
   There are marginal improvements when the two protocols are combined. We
   also find that flagging is sufficient to curb the negative effects of
   misinformation. Adding persistent scrutiny does not improve the quality
   of decision-making; it leads to less engagement on the social media
   platform as fewer group members share posts.},

Title = {Determinants of Non-maturing Deposit Pass-through Rates in Eurozone

Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2023},

Pages = {291-318},
Abstract = {The non-maturing deposit (NMD) pass-through rate represents a key
   parameter needed in the process of managing interest rate risk of the
   banking book (IRRBB). NMD interest rates for retail and corporate
   segments are usually not directly linked to market interest rates, but
   depend rather on the bank's marketing strategy, market competition,
   liquidity, and possibly on other factors. The ratio at which banks
   adjust their NMD interest rates to changes in interbank market interest
   rates is known as the NMD pass-through rate. The goal of this paper is
   to analyse the variability of NMD pass-through rates in the 19 Eurozone
   countries and identify their possible determinants. The pass-through
   rates are estimated using cointegration analysis based on datasets
   available from the ECB Statistical Data Warehouse and the results show
   significant variability between countries. To analyse the determinants
   of pass-through rates in the Eurozone, the rates are regressed on nine
   aggregates of the country-level banking sector including concentration,
   profitability or funding, and three macroeconomic and socio-economic
   variables. Out of the tested predictors, the ratio of wholesale funding
   to liabilities was found to be the most significant predictor of retail
   and corporate pass-through rates, with a positive coefficient,
   indicating that countries where banks rely more heavily on wholesale
   funding exhibit higher pass-through of market interest rate changes to
   NMD deposit rates. Additionally, the loan-to-deposit ratio was found to
   have a significantly negative impact on retail pass-through rates, while
   the return on equity has a significantly positive impact on the
   corporate pass-through rates.},

Abstract = {In the early 1990s, David Card contributed to a major evolution in
   economic research. From then on, the quality of empirical research is no
   longer judged solely by its links with a formal theoretical model, but
   above all by the relevance of the hypotheses under which causal
   relationships are identified. Using a range of quasi-experimental
   methods, David Card has made decisive contributions to a number of major
   debates, including those on the minimum wage, immigration, racial
   segregation and education. Empirical research in economics is gaining in
   autonomy, prestige and audience, especially among other social sciences.
   Based on an analysis of the publications of some emblematic economic
   journals, we trace the way in which the quasi-experimental approaches
   promoted by David Card eventually spread in Europe and in France.},

Abstract = {The present work is based on a hypothesis that the Czech economy was
   showing signs of economic de-celeration and a potential slump into
   deeper growth problems way before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,
   i.e., at least in the year 2019. However, the present text does not
   intend to thoroughly con-firm this hypothesis because in order to do so,
   a longer timeline of key economic indicators needs to be analysed. What
   it does present is at least a partial argumentation supporting the
   abovementioned hy-pothesis and some basic calculations. It proposes two
   ways towards its confirmation. The first one is a comparative analysis
   of individual - especially European - economies' response to subsiding
   external influences, i.e., to the weakening of the effects of the
   pandemic on the economy. The second way is at least a partial analysis
   of key macroeconomic indicators from the time before and during the
   pan-demic, with an emphasis on detectable divergences in the
   development. The conclusion of our research is the finding that as early
   as in 2019, the Czech economy was showing signs of imminent deceleration
   of growth, which would probably have turned into stagnation and possibly
   a certain decrease in econom-ic activity. The conclusions indicate that
   the reason behind such development was a massive but in fact little
   effective investment activity in the Czech economic environment, which
   is historically related to the structure of the economy and to the
   position of the Czech industrial sector in supplier relation-ships. Two
   related phenomena arise from that: firstly, a relatively low labour
   productivity, with producers domiciled in the Czech Republic reaching
   quite a low volume of value added, and secondly a massive capital
   outflow in the form of profits paid to parent companies abroad. The
   final part of the paper outlines some potentially effective steps which
   might lead - under favourable circumstances - to restructuring processes
   in the Czech economy. Due to the date of finishing the research, the
   paper does not include the consequences of the War in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {In 1929, Congress passed a law capping the US House of Representatives
   at 435 seats, delegating the power to reapportion to the Executive
   Branch, and empowering state legislatures to redistrict with few federal
   limitations. The 1929 law was a compromise after nearly ten years of
   squabbling over how to apportion pursuant to the 1920 Census. In this
   article, we consider the apportionment debates of the 1920s both to
   better understand the politics of the era and to draw lessons that might
   apply to a potential reapportionment debate today. Throughout the
   decade, partisanship and political self-interest structured members'
   votes on reapportionment. The legislation that eventually passed
   resulted from a compromise that greatly empowered state legislatures to
   redistrict freely by removing federal requirements that had been in
   effect since the 1870s, effectively shifting the battle over
   congressional representation from one over reapportionment in Congress
   to one over redistricting in the states.},

Abstract = {This article explores the dynamics of modern authoritarian regimes,
   using Belarus under Alexander Lukashenko as a case study. By examining
   Belarus's transition from a ``competitive authoritarian{''} regime to a
   ``hegemonic authoritarian{''} one from 1994 to 1996 and its further
   shift from a spin dictatorship to a fear dictatorship in 2020, the study
   offers insights into the multifaceted nature of dictatorships. The main
   findings are that using elections as a means to classify regimes does
   not fully explain their effect on authoritarian vulnerability and that
   different classifications of dictatorship, such as spin versus fear, are
   not necessarily mutually exclusive.},

Title = {``The kidnappers are the police{''}: Criminal governance and forced
   migration in Central America},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {For decades, citizens of Northern Central America have fled their homes
   and their countries to escape violence and insecurity. The pervasive
   fear driving such displacement is rooted in profound suspicions that the
   state itself may be a primary accomplice in criminal schemes. While
   scholars and Central American publics alike agree that such ``criminal
   governance{''} is very real, no one can nail down its precise contours,
   much less identify how deeply embedded in the state any particular
   illicit network may be. This article homes in on the play of perception
   and il/licit power to map how collective doubt about where the state
   ends and its underworld begins structures criminal predation and forced
   migration. Drawing on more than a decade of ethnographic research in
   Guatemala, I map victims' struggles to distinguish between their
   assailants' ``real{''} and ``imagined{''} powers, showing how illicit
   networks strategically colonize and leverage this ample space of doubt.
   Ultimately, I argue that widespread but murky state-criminal fusion and
   territorial control can make a powerful feedback loop with the threat
   and reality of violence at criminal hands. This feedback loop in turn
   acts as a form of disciplinary power, molding targeted subjects and
   conditioning their agency in everyday life, even haunting them through
   time and space long after they have ``escaped.{''} Such dynamics are a
   provocation for scholars to rethink misleading distinctions between the
   state and illicit networks in places like Guatemala to comprehend the
   lived consequences of contemporary criminal governance.},

Abstract = {The Supreme Court ruling on Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013)
   provided states and local jurisdictions with increased discretion when
   operating elections. Since this decision, voters across the United
   States have experienced a reduction in polling locations through
   precinct consolidation and polling location closures. Further, passed
   and pending legislation will restrict vote-by-mail use and early voting
   in future elections. For many, these changes will restructure the
   in-person voting experience as more voters will vote in-person on
   Election Days at fewer locations. While scholarship has demonstrated the
   effects of polling location consolidation on voter turnout and voter
   disenfranchisement, less research has investigated the effects on system
   performance and voter wait times. This analysis applies a simulation
   optimization to assess the consequences of three polling location
   consolidation strategies on voter wait time. We find that allocating
   resources in combination with the consolidation strategy directly
   affects voter wait times. Our results suggest that consolidating
   precincts and polling locations requires deliberate resource allocation
   planning to distribute voting equipment efficiently.},

Title = {From just transitions to reparative transformations},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article reflects on one aspect of the rapidly growing body of
   research on just transitions that we think has not been robustly enough
   explored: the difference that more explicitly reparative approaches to
   historical injustice rooted in racial capitalism might make to how these
   transitions are conceptualized and enacted. To advance this argument, we
   turn to recent scholarship on reparations, and particularly reparations
   for slavery, colonization and Indigenous genocide, to draw out critical
   insights that might helpfully expand and redirect just transitions work
   to more fully address the ongoing legacies of what Olufemi Taiwo has
   recently called, `global racial empire.' Specifically, we examine the
   reparative demands embedded in the Cochabamba People's Declaration in
   Bolivia (2010) and the Black Hive's Black Climate Mandate in the US
   (2022). Through close analysis of these two documents, we draw out and
   expand four principles that we see as critical to the development of
   more reparative policy options for just transitions at both national and
   international scales. Specifically, we draw attention to the need for
   just transitions work to 1) draw on broader temporalities that
   foreground the long afterlives of colonial genocide and slavery; 2) more
   thoroughly recognize geographical interconnectedness across nation-state
   boundaries, including the powerful persistence of neo-colonial
   relationships of exploitation and expropriation; 3) redirect processes
   of highly racialized global (mal)distribution; and 4) attend to more
   `pluriversal' possibilities for rectifying these inequalities.},

   Political Sophistication on Biased Information Processing},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {According to literature, biased information processing increases with
   political sophistication. The logic behind this relationship is that
   political sophisticates possess greater cognitive skills and knowledge
   to defend their prior beliefs. Although political sophistication can be
   understood as a multidimensional concept, existing research primarily
   uses general political knowledge as a proxy to assess it. Therefore, we
   introduce a more rigorous measure of sophistication that gauges
   individuals' ability to justify their attitudes with substantive and
   well-elaborated arguments and put the classic measure of political
   sophistication to a test. We study these mechanisms in a
   direct-democratic setting via an online survey, in which 898
   Swiss-German voters are exposed to a tailored counterargument on a
   political referendum. Our results indicate that individuals with higher
   levels of sophistication evaluate counter-attitudinal information less
   favorably and hold more stable opinions. While we did not find support
   for the hypothesis that sophistication leads to selective exposure to
   consonant information, our analysis points to a reverse mechanism:
   individuals with lower levels of sophistication exhibit a higher
   likelihood of exposure to dissonant views. Notably, these results align
   with the trends reported for general political knowledge and corroborate
   the validity of using general political knowledge as a proxy for
   political sophistication.},

Abstract = {Radio spectrum has become central to technological progress and economic
   growth. While, command-and-control regulatory institutions of the early
   twentieth century were considered necessary to counter endemic market
   failure, recent regulatory reform towards a market regime with flexible
   licensing creates an interesting environment for examining how complex
   externalities are managed by private contracting in decentralized
   systems. We present empirical evidence suggesting that adoption of a
   more ``Coasean{''} policy regime in radio was followed by far more
   crowded wireless markets than were formed under rigid administrative
   structures. This is observed by contrasting pre-cellular mobile phone
   system outcomes in the U.S. (1946-1978) with the later evolution of
   cellular networks (1983-2015). The cellular marketplace exhibits
   exceedingly more complicated network coordination under liberalized
   property ownership rules. We nest our empirical findings within a
   conceptual framework derived from theoretical literature on property
   rights.},

Title = {Can health passport overcome political hurdles to COVID-19 vaccination?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {80},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this paper we examine whether a health passport that increases the
   cost of not getting vaccinated, can change the individual trade-off in
   favor of vaccination. To address this question, we study the impact of
   the announcement of the French health passport on factors affecting
   vaccine hesitancy. First, using data from a survey conducted on the eve
   of the announcement date, we examine the determinants of vaccine
   hesitancy, and find that, prior to the introduction of the health
   passport, political preferences were significantly associated with
   vaccination rates. Then, using actual district-level data, we estimate
   the short-term impact of the health passport announcement on weekly
   COVID-19 vaccination rates and show that vaccine uptake significantly
   increased in the overall population, and particularly among the 20 to
   39-year old cohort. Focusing on the role of political factors, we find
   that vaccination rates increased significantly in districts with a high
   proportion of far right voters, thus highlighting that the health
   passport reversed the impact of some extreme political preferences on
   vaccine hesitancy.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the effect of online political ads on party
   preference, and whether this effect is more pronounced for newer
   political parties and voters who are less politically knowledgeable and
   literate regarding online privacy. A mixed-method approach, combining
   Facebook browser tracking data and a four-wave panel survey, was adopted
   during the 2021 Dutch General Election campaign. The results showed that
   the number of political ads received from a specific party has a
   positive effect on both the propensity and choice to vote for that
   party. In addition, people with less political knowledge and online
   privacy literacy are more likely to be persuaded by online political
   ads. However, at the party level, there is no evidence indicating that
   the effect of political ads on party preference is stronger for new
   parties than for established parties. Overall, this study shows that
   voters can be persuaded via the frequency of exposure to online
   political ads, but the extent to which they are affected can vary.},

Abstract = {Since 2019, researchers examining, archiving, and collecting extremist
   and terrorist materials online have increasingly been taken offline. In
   part a consequence of the automation of content moderation by different
   technology companies and national governments calling for ever quicker
   takedowns. Based on an online survey of peers in the field, this
   research highlights that up to 60\% of researchers surveyed have had
   either their accounts or content they have posted or stored online taken
   down from varying platforms. Beyond the quantitative data, this research
   also garnered qualitative answers about concerns individuals in the
   field had related to this problem set, namely, the lack of transparency
   on the part of the technology companies, hindering actual research and
   understanding of complicated and evolving issues related to different
   extremist and terrorist phenomena, undermining potential collaboration
   within the research field, and the potential of self-censorship online.
   An easy solution to this would be a whitelist, though there are inherent
   downsides related to this as well, especially between researchers at
   different levels in their careers, institutional affiliation or lack
   thereof, and inequalities between researchers from the West versus
   Global South. Either way, securitizing research in however form it
   evolves in the future will fundamentally hurt research.},

Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},

Abstract = {After a period of self-regulation, countries around the world began to
   implement regulations for the removal of terrorist content from tech
   platforms. However, much of this regulation has been criticised for a
   variety of reasons, most prominently for concerns of infringing free
   speech and creating unfair burdens for smaller platforms. In addition to
   this, regulation is heavily centred around content moderation, however,
   fails to consider or address the psychosocial risks it poses to human
   content moderators. This paper argues that where regulation has been
   heavily criticised yet continues to inspire similar regulation a new
   regulatory approach is required. The aim of this paper is to undertake
   an introductory examination of the use of a social regulation approach
   in three other industries (environmental protection, consumer protection
   and occupational health and safety) to learn and investigate new
   regulatory avenues that could be applied to the development of new
   regulation that seeks to counter terrorist content on tech platforms and
   is concerned with the safety of content moderators.},

Title = {Road maintenance over the local election cycle},
Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {198},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {129-151},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite recognition that government officials have politically motivated
   incentives to pursue new infrastructure construction at the expense of
   infrastructure upkeep, no prior research directly addresses how
   political incentives affect road maintenance separate from road
   construction. This paper investigates how local political incentives
   affect local road maintenance using unique data on completed road
   maintenance projects and difference-in-differences which leverages
   exogenous timing of mayoral elections. Since residents complain about
   damaged roads and can also be frustrated by travel delays caused by road
   maintenance, it is theoretically ambiguous how elected officials
   manipulate road maintenance, assuming they do so for political purposes.
   We show local election cycles shift road maintenance timing and
   location. We provide evidence that maintenance follows different
   patterns in mayoral election years and that maintenance is shifted
   around sub-city geographic units based on those units' political
   similarity of registered voters. A mayoral election costs \$90,623 in
   additional road-related costs, translating to \$28,093,182 per election
   for large cities.},

Abstract = {Parties use political microtargeting (PMT) to address voter subsegments
   individually. Due to limited resources and legal restrictions, parties
   often rely on Meta's platforms and advertising ecosystem for PMT.
   However, using these external infrastructures and big data analyses
   might be risky for parties, since big data are criticized for their
   validity, robustness, representativeness, and usefulness. A mechanism to
   tolerate risks is trust. With the theoretical background of trust in
   technology, this study investigates the extent to which parties'
   communication managers perceive risks in their strategic use of PMT on
   Meta's platforms and how they evaluate big data's trustworthiness. Based
   on in-depth expert interviews with German parties' communication
   managers on state level, the results show that parties' communication
   managers perceive various risks in relying on Meta's platforms and are
   ambivalent about PMT's big data analytics in terms of quality and
   reliability. To minimize risk perceptions, parties adopt strategies such
   as inputting their own data or creating own target audiences. Parties'
   risk perceptions only partially influence their trust in big data and
   Meta. Despite varying degrees of trust, PMT is still used in campaigns
   as it has become too common and necessary to compete with other parties.},

Abstract = {How does the European Union balance the need to migrate data to the
   cloud with the imperative of reducing its dependence on foreign cloud
   providers? Cloud computing is a critical technology for the
   competitiveness of the European Union (EU) in the digital economy. This
   paper argues that the EU is adopting a host of regulatory requirements
   and industrial policy tools-which fall under the umbrella term of `data
   sovereignty'-not only to protect the confidentiality of European data,
   but also to counter the dominance of US vendors in the European cloud
   market. To demonstrate how data sovereignty principles are woven into
   current EU policy initiatives, the paper presents two case studies:
   Gaia-X and the European Alliance for Industrial Data, Edge, and Cloud.
   Linking data sovereignty to the lack of a competitive European cloud
   ecosystem sheds light on the strategic dimension of cloud computing in a
   way that treating them separately would not do.},

Abstract = {Australia's history as a settler colony within the British Empire
   fundamentally shapes its sense of security within the Indo-Pacific
   region. Australia has consistently looked outside of its region for
   security and sought partners on the explicit basis of political,
   cultural, and ethnic similarity. What role does Australia's history play
   in shaping its foreign policy? We argue that these choices in foreign
   policy are inextricable from Australia's history as a settler colony on
   the farthest reaches of the British Empire. The AUKUS Agreement (AUKUS)
   is an example of how Australia operates to preserve racial hegemony in
   the face of non-white threat - real or perceived. This research utilises
   critical discourse analysis to interrogate elite-level discourse around
   AUKUS to ascertain the dominant narratives that inform its creation, the
   issues it seeks to address in Australian security policy, how it is
   structured by historical narratives of security, and how it functions to
   structure those narratives going forward. This article seeks to
   participate in the growing push to decolonise International Relations by
   illuminating the way Australia is ontologically and epistemologically
   invested in the preservation of racial hegemony.},

Title = {Support for misinformation regulation on social media: It is the
   perceived harm of misinformation that matters, not the perceived amount},

Abstract = {Responding to harmful content on social media, calls for regulations are
   coming up to break down the black boxes of social media platforms in
   handling misinformation. Examples are requiring cooperations with
   fact-checkers or the government stepping in. So far, there is a lack of
   knowledge about predictors of policy attitudes in the context of
   misinformation besides attitudes toward and perceptions of censorship.
   Using a two-wave panel study in Germany at the beginning of the COVID-19
   pandemic and 8 months in, we examine the role of perceived
   misinformation exposure, perceived harm of misinformation, and trust in
   institutions involved in regulating misinformation on public support for
   misinformation regulation. Results show that trust in media and
   democracy increases policy support over time. Furthermore, perceived
   exposure to misinformation does not influence policy attitudes, but
   perceived harm of misinformation does. We discuss the implications for
   regulating misinformation in light of our findings.

   En respuesta al contenido danino en las redes sociales, estan surgiendo
   pedidos de regulaciones para romper las cajas negras de las plataformas
   de redes sociales en el manejo de la informacion erronea. Los ejemplos
   requieren cooperaciones con los verificadores de hechos o la
   intervencion del gobierno. Hasta el momento, hay una falta de
   conocimiento sobre los predictores de las actitudes politicas en el
   contexto de la desinformacion, ademas de las actitudes y percepciones de
   la censura. Utilizando un estudio de panel de dos olas en Alemania al
   comienzo de la pandemia de COVID-19 y ocho meses despues, examinamos el
   papel de la exposicion a la informacion erronea percibida, el dano
   percibido de la informacion erronea y la confianza en las instituciones
   involucradas en la regulacion de la informacion erronea sobre el apoyo
   publico a la informacion erronea. regulacion. Los resultados muestran
   que la confianza en los medios y la democracia aumentan el apoyo a las
   politicas con el tiempo. Ademas, la exposicion percibida a la
   informacion erronea no influye en las actitudes politicas, pero si el
   dano percibido de la informacion erronea. Discutimos las implicaciones
   para regular la desinformacion a la luz de nuestros hallazgos.},

Abstract = {Drawing on empirical data from document analysis, this paper will carry
   out a critical analysis of the effectiveness of the oversight and
   accountability system of the legislative sector of South Africa in
   detecting early warning signs prior to financial and governance
   collapse, by examining three provincial government departments. The
   results reveal that several key early warning signs preceded governance
   and financial collapse at the three provincial education departments but
   that the provincial departments ignored signals of repetitive financial
   irregularities flagged up by the Auditor General of South Africa. The
   article argues that there is a lack of political will to effectively
   respond to early warning signs of looming crises in provincial
   government departments in South Africa for the purpose of preventing or
   mitigating their negative impact.},

Title = {Social Trust, Human Values, and Anti-immigrant Sentiment: Does Trust
   Work With or Against Values?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Two separate lines of literature have analyzed the role social trust and
   human values, such as universalism and conservatism, have on
   anti-immigrant sentiment. While both show strong effects, the question
   of whether social trust weakens or strengthens already embodied values
   has not been addressed. The possibility that trust works against or with
   conservatism, for example, predicts two opposing forces on
   anti-immigrant sentiment. This study analyzes the potential moderating
   effect of trust on human values, and how this varies cross-nationally.
   It develops a conceptual framework that hypothesizes different models of
   trust and tests these using eight rounds of the European Social Survey
   (2002-2016). Findings point to trust consistently working with values,
   which suggests a magnification of conservative values' anti-immigrant
   effects. While there is little evidence for national cultures of trust
   and values, country-specific results show variation in how trust
   moderates values, with greater evidence for trust's moderation of
   conservatism and some unpredicted patterns in countries like Cyprus.
   Findings are discussed within the context of anti-immigrant politics and
   entrenched values, scholarly debates surrounding bridging and bonding,
   and the resulting extent of social trust's radius.},

Abstract = {Taking the example of conspiracy-related communication online as one
   form of contentious politics, this study examines the data collection
   challenges for multidimensional comparative research across platforms,
   time, and cultural embeddings. It compares the architectures and
   features relevant to data collection, access regimes, and use cultures
   for a set of digital platforms and communication venues. Differentiating
   between actor- and content-based strategies, this study discusses the
   potentials and limitations of these approaches, considering differences
   in platforms, temporal dynamics, and cultural embeddings as well as
   several layers of equivalence. The discussion highlights crucial
   insights into designing data collection strategies in multidimensional
   comparative studies.},

Abstract = {With this article, I present a public choice perspective on Russia's war
   on Ukraine. I criticise the realist view according to which Russia's
   security concerns, defined by President Putin, prompted the conflict. I
   argue that realism offers a deficient analytic framework to the extent
   that it disregards the political and economic structure of Russia and,
   generally speaking, how the political economy of each case study shapes
   preferences, strategies and intra-elite relations, which feed into
   foreign policy formation. Russia is a government-controlled economy and
   society; a key property of Russia's political economy is the dependency
   of key socio-economic actors and groups on the regime's survival. This
   landscape pre-empts the expression of genuine feedback and dissent from
   society, and explains why Putin's decision has faced very little
   disagreement and resistance. Given the previously close economic ties
   between Russia and Ukraine, this article also challenges capitalist
   peace theory for its blanket assertion that dense economic relations
   would provide a strong disincentive for countries to resort to war.
   Instead of talking about capitalism generically, we can discern
   varieties of capitalism, as they condition state-society relations
   differently. In Russia, the value that key socio-economic elites assign
   to their relationship with Putin outweighs the costs they are
   experiencing from the conflict and the external sanctions. Developing a
   public choice perspective in the study of international relations
   focuses on the preferences and strategies of the leadership and of
   domestic elitelevel actors within the aggressor state, and invites
   attention to the power asymmetries that characterise their relationship.},

Abstract = {Modern democracies pride themselves on enacting and implementing laws
   and procedures to ensure ballot secrecy. Notwithstanding these efforts,
   Gerber et al. (2013) show in 2008 and 2010 that a substantial portion of
   the electorate does not believe their ballot is secret, and a majority
   of voters freely share their vote choices with others. We demonstrate
   that similar dimensions of ballot secrecy exist across time. Although
   levels of psychological and social secrecy remain generally comparable
   from 2008 to 2020, our findings do diverge from Gerber et al. (2012) in
   terms of which groups are more likely to exhibit higher levels of
   insecurity as related to ballot secrecy. Chief among these is the
   partisan divisions that came to the forefront in the 2020 election, with
   Republicans and Democrats now significantly different in regard to their
   levels of psychological and social secrecy. More specifically, we find
   2020 voters, especially Republicans, have grown even more insecure about
   the secrecy of their ballot and less inquisitive about others' vote
   choices. Our findings also demonstrate that voters who are in the
   political minority at the local level are less confident about the
   secrecy of their ballot, compared with those whose vote choices match
   the political majority.},

Title = {Geopolitics and humiliation: The `sinking islands' of Tuvalu},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {105},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Emotions play a key role within geopolitics; spatial representations
   draw upon, create, and reinforce emotional responses within and from
   political actors. Bringing together critical literature on emotion and
   geopolitics, this paper sets out to examine the underexplored ways in
   which humiliation features in geopolitical discourse and practice.
   Through elite interviews and participant observation in the South
   Pacific at the 50th Pacific Islands Forum in August 2019, we analyse the
   impact of popular representations of Tuvalu in relation to sea-level
   rise on Tuvaluan diplomats. In doing so, we argue that atolls figure
   within climate politics as not only harbingers of potential climate
   futures, but also as objects of humiliation, ridicule, and mockery.
   Further, we elaborate on two components of humiliation. Firstly, that
   humiliation creates a hierarchical power relationship through the
   (neocolonial) production and subsumption of an Other; and secondly, that
   humiliation relies on and undermines existing relationships and is
   something that is seen, felt, and heard - it is not only emotive for the
   actor being humiliated but is directed towards and reaches a wider
   audience.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the efficiency of conciliation in consumer law. It
   will focus on general consumer relations, that is, those regulated by
   Law 1480 of 2011 that do not have special legislation. The regulations
   governing it, their characteristics, related juris-prudence, and
   quantitative data collected through rights of petition were analyzed.
   Topics of economic analysis of law will be introduced to enrich the
   research. The text concludes that through conciliation, optimal
   solutions can be obtained, costs to the parties can be avoided, and the
   relationship between the consumer and the producer can be improved.},

Abstract = {During the 1940s, four US states established a new form of social
   insurance, Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI), meant to provide wage
   replacement to breadwinners unable to work due to nonoccupational
   illness or injury. The first TDI state, Rhode Island, did not initially
   exclude coverage of pregnancy-related disabilities, threatening the
   health of the TDI trust fund. Administrators and lawmakers then sought
   to reduce or eliminate the pregnancy-related disability benefit on the
   grounds that pregnancy and related conditions were not ``real{''}
   disabilities. Subsequently, Rhode Island administrators advised
   lawmakers in California, New Jersey, and New York to exclude
   pregnancy-related disabilities from coverage. The breadwinner gender
   ideology animating New Deal social welfare programs intersected with
   gendered ideas of disability, creating a form of social insurance that
   excluded or marginalized pregnancy-related disability and further
   circumscribed women's social citizenship.},

Abstract = {While some scholars dismiss transnational private governance
   instruments, such as codes of conduct, social auditing and monitoring
   initiatives, as an instrument of corporate power, propaganda and
   control, others provide a positive assessment. This paper criticises
   both approaches by applying concepts developed by the French philosopher
   Jacques Ranciere. Against the background of worker-driven discontent in
   the Nike supply chain, the paper argues why a Rancierian reading may
   offer an alternative way of conceptualising the politics of
   transnational private governance, one that provides a more promising way
   to `ground' it in both conceptual and empirical terms.},

Title = {Investment in identity in the field-Nudging refugees' integration effort},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Social identity greatly affects behavior. However, less is known about
   an individual's investment in identification, i.e., in belonging to a
   social group. Using a language-learning platform utilized by refugees to
   learn the host country's language, we design a field experiment that
   allows us to make effort as an investment in a new group identity
   salient. The social identity in our treatment is a refugee's
   identification with the host society. We modified a mailing to 5600
   refugees who use an online language-learning platform to learn the host
   country's language. These treatment emails make salient that improving
   the host country's language ability increases the belonging to the host
   society. Our analysis reveals that the treatment has a significant
   positive effect on the effort exerted on the language-learning platform,
   leading to more completed exercises and more time spent learning the
   host country's language. This suggests that refugees invest in becoming
   part of the host country's society for its social identity component.
   Our findings can inform policy considerations on the use of nudges for
   other integration measures intended for refugees and immigrants in
   general.},

Abstract = {The idea of dignity is pervasive in political discourse. It is central
   to human rights theory and practice, and it features regularly in
   conceptions of social justice as well as in the social movements they
   seek to understand or orient. However, dignity talk has been criticized
   for leading to problematic exclusion. Critics challenge it for
   undermining our recognition of the rights of non-human animals and of
   many human individuals (such as children, the elderly, and people with
   disabilities). I argue that, on a plausible articulation of it, the idea
   of dignity does not lead to these exclusions and that it in fact helps
   defend an appropriately inclusive moral and political treatment of all
   individuals. Difficult issues about equality and diversity indeed arise,
   but a dignitarian approach can provide good answers to them or at least
   help make them clearer and more tractable.},

Title = {The Debate Over the Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous
   Australians: National Unity and Memories of the 1967 Referendum},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND HISTORY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the debate over constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians
   since 2010, the high ``Yes{''} vote in 1967 has been recalled as a
   benchmark of national unity and goodwill towards Indigenous Australians,
   something to which Australians must return. The 1967 referendum has been
   evoked as a ``step{''} towards reconciliation, with constitutional
   recognition presented as the next step. The ``recognition{''} that the
   1967 referendum enabled has been (mis)represented as allowing Indigenous
   Australians to be counted in the Census, hence to ``count{''} more
   generally. Explaining constitutional changes to voters in the referendum
   on an Indigenous Voice, ``Yes{''} and ``No{''} campaigns are likely to
   describe amendments in emotively powerful terms. False memories of
   ``recognition{''} obscure a political fissure within the myth of 1967.
   Some who celebrate 1967 have wanted the Constitution to continue to
   distinguish Indigenous from non Indigenous Australians, one
   understanding of the 1967 amendment to Section 51(xxvi); others have
   hoped that the next referendum would complete the deletion of
   distinguishing words that had begun in 1967 with the repeal of Section
   127. The myths of 1967 combine to accommodate opposing ideals of
   national ``unity{''}, allowing protagonists in the debate to read the
   ``lessons{''} of 1967 in ways that reinforce their own political
   perspectives.},

Abstract = {Amid the eurocrisis, scholars and policy makers sought to establish an
   EU-wide layer of social policy, aiming to ensure common standards
   through the EU and to provide a degree of common social protection.
   While public support for European social policy has been extensively
   studied, we don't know how regional (i.e., subnational) inequalities
   relate to preferences for European social policy. We analyse the effect
   of regional differences in socio-economic and institutional contexts on
   public preferences for European social policy in general and support for
   European unemployment insurance in particular. Combining original survey
   data collected in 2018 in 12 European countries with regional-level
   economic and political indicators, we find that regional-level
   self-interest impacts individual preferences but that the effect is not
   always clear-cut. Contrary to expectations, people in richer regions are
   more supportive of EU social policy than people in poorer regions, while
   citizens of politically more autonomous regions tend to have a generally
   more positive view of EU social policy. A conjoint experiment on support
   for different policy variants of European unemployment insurance sheds
   light on these counterintuitive findings: Citizens in richer regions are
   indeed more supportive of EU-level social policy, but only when it has
   limited redistributive implications and instead affects standards;
   conversely citizens in poorer regions are willing to forego their
   op-position to EU social policy for redistributive programs.},

Abstract = {From US President Donald Trump's Tweet labeling news media ``the enemy
   of the people{''} to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's
   establishment of a politically appointed Media Authority, media freedom
   is under threat in democracies and nondemocracies alike. According to
   Freedom House, in 2016 media freedom declined globally to its lowest
   level since 2003, with Europe experiencing the largest regional
   decrease. We investigate the relationship between government and media
   in Hungary and Poland and develop a theory that the rise of nationalist
   sentiment and leaders who leverage this sentiment to encourage
   censorship from the bottom-up has led to increased media restrictions
   from the top-down. We posit that bottom-up censorship will erode media
   credibility and make people more accepting of top-down media
   restrictions, which could, in turn, lead to nationalism unchecked by the
   fourth estate. Using a multilevel analysis of World Values Survey, we
   analyze the relationship between nationalism and media distrust. Using a
   cross-national time series, we analyze the relationship between
   nationalist sentiment and media restrictions. We find that increased
   nationalism is indeed associated with media distrust and media
   restrictions.},

Abstract = {Hate speech and misinformation are rife. How to respond? Counterspeech
   proposals say: with more and better speech. This paper considers the
   treatment of counterspeech in Maxime Lepoutre's Democratic Speech In
   Divided Times. Lepoutre provides a nuanced defence of counterspeech.
   Some counterspeech, he grants, is flawed. But, he says: counterspeech
   can be debugged. Once we understand why counterspeech fails - when fail
   it does - we can engineer more effective counterspeech strategies.
   Lepoutre argues that the failures of counterspeech can be theorised
   using the ideology of salience. Negative counterspeech fails because it
   reinforces the salience of the very ideas or associations that it
   contests. His solution? Positive counterspeech - a form of counterspeech
   which avoids the salience trap. I argue that the salience paradigm is
   ill-suited to theorise the failures of counterspeech. I suggest some
   alternatives. Further, I show that these alternative paradigms make
   importantly different practical recommendations - recommendations
   concerning how we ought to engineer our counterspeech - from those
   issued by the salience paradigm.},

Title = {From bad to worse? How protest can foster armed conflict in autocracies},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {103},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Many protest movements have brought down dictatorships and paved the way
   for democracy. However, protests can also foster large-scale violence at
   the level of civil war. How can we explain the development from protest
   to armed conflict? In this paper, we use geographically fine-grained
   data to examine how collective mobilization leads to civil war violence
   at the local level. We argue that two mechanisms can explain this.
   First, in a protest escalation dynamic, confrontations between
   protesters and state security forces increase the willingness of
   protesters to ramp up the use of force. Second, in a protest capture
   mechanism, protests attract attention and resources from the state,
   thereby providing other local non-state actors with the opportunity to
   use violence. We test our theoretical expectations in a spatial analysis
   of protests and armed conflict in autocracies from 2003 to 2014. Our
   results show that protests increase the risk of local armed conflict
   when violently repressed. Further analysis reveals that the second
   mechanism, protest capture, accounts for the majority of escalations to
   armed conflict we see in our data.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue that a `situated-portable epistemic nexus'
   characterizes postwar urban peacebuilding. The concept captures how
   knowledge in urban peacebuilding is produced by/productive of discursive
   and material conditions that are both, and simultaneously, situated in a
   particular urban environment and transnationally emergent and
   circulating. I illustrate this argument in an analysis of an urban
   peacebuilding project in postwar Pristina, Kosovo, that relied on the
   computer game Minecraft as the main technology. Despite a heterogeneous
   group of actors involved, and a primacy devoted to local perspectives,
   the at-once-situated and globally portable discourses, technologies and
   artefacts of the Pristina project conditioned the production of a
   relatively narrow urban knowledge and space that formed around a purely
   visual conception of the urban - overall limiting what the situated
   urban was and could become.},

Abstract = {France's idiosyncratic form of secularism, laicite, is a highly
   contested principle bound up in centuries of conflict over the state's
   relationship to religious practice. Of late, commentators have
   interpreted it as taking somewhat of an authoritarian turn as it is used
   to disproportionately identify and suppress signs of overt Muslim
   religiosity, including notably within the public school system. I apply
   Painter's `prosaic stateness' framework to understand how educators
   interpret and rework laicite within the French public school to produce
   `actually-existing' laicite. In particular, I show that educators are
   situated within three `spatialities' through which laicite inhabits
   French schooling: the idealised space of the French republic set against
   religious obscurantism, schools as spaces of inviolable neutrality, and
   risky bodies who refuse to conform to norms of republican citizenship.
   Within these spatialities, educators enact a prosaic stateness of
   laicite through their experiences of diversity of the student
   populations they serve, the incoherence of the institution they work
   for, and the divergence of the policies they end up applying.},

Abstract = {Cartography has historically been a weapon of colonists used to
   demarcate land stolen by empire. More recently, however, `critical
   cartographies' have emerged as a means of critiquing colonial
   discourses, revealing maps as representations of the dominating
   ideologies that produce them. This article explores a series of ongoing
   ques-tions raised by our own work seeking to map the intersection of
   colonial and Indigenous governance regimes in so-called Australia. As a
   visualisation of the intense intervention into Indigenous lives by the
   settler state, this map tells a story of colonial extraction and
   elimination, as well as of Indigenous survival, thriving, resistance and
   resurgence, ``denaturalis{[}ing]{''} settler geographies of power to
   contextualise current tensions in governance re-lations within a
   continuing history of colonisation (Razack, 2018). Drawing on Indigenous
   critical theory and the Latourian concept of the immutable mobile (1986)
   as a way of naming the apparatus that operationalises colonial mapping,
   we explore the ethical and political dynamics of critical cartography,
   characterised by a tension between reinscribing and undoing colonial
   power. We argue that, in navigating and attempting to fore-ground these
   tensions, our mapping project has value in its visual inversion of
   conventional representations of sovereignty. It reveals the fragility,
   incompleteness, and material violence of colonial sovereignty, which is
   so often understood as neutral and inevitable. It maps this colonial
   project in relation to and as rendered impossible by the endurance of
   Indigenous sovereignty. Against the colonial imagining of Indigenous
   sovereignty as fragile, disappearing and mutable, it resituates this
   sovereignty as inhering in the land and in Indigenous peoples as
   ``resilient existent{''} and as the true immutable (Moreton-Robinson,
   2021, p. 258).},

Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of parenthood on political engagement
   using the longitudinal British survey data and a repeated
   cross-sectional European Social survey. I construct a political
   engagement measure by applying confirmatory factor analysis to
   observable indicators of several different aspects of political
   engagement. Then, I estimate the impact of becoming a parent on
   political engagement based on an event study around the birth of an
   individual's first child, using UK data. The results indicate that
   having children reduces the political engagement of female parents but
   does not significantly affect the political engagement of male parents.
   The impact on women is temporary and disappears several years after the
   birth of their first child. The analysis of the impact of additional
   children on political engagement suggests that women's political
   engagement is reduced by the fact of becoming a mother rather than by
   the number of children. The results are confirmed using repeated
   cross-sectional data for European regions, controlling for fixed
   regional characteristics. The policy implications of these findings are
   discussed.},

Title = {Clientelism and fiscal redistribution: Evidence across countries},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {76},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article marshals empirical evidence from a cross-section of up to
   87 countries to consider the impact of clientelism on fiscal
   redistribution in the form of direct taxes and public transfers.
   Clientelism may directly undermine fiscal redistribution towards poorer
   individuals because their political support is cheaper to buy, political
   patrons will limit redistribution to keep clients dependent and,
   moreover, will eschew fiscal policies that target broad categories of
   citizens based on explicit criteria, and favor instead private benefits
   that they can disburse to individual clients with a relatively high
   degree of discretion. The empirical analysis controls for a range of
   potentially confounding covariates, explores various transmission
   channels and accounts for the real possibility that more extensive
   redistributive programs may undermine the strength of clientelism. The
   results strongly suggest that clientelism is inimical to income
   redistribution towards the poor through taxes and transfers and,
   moreover, identify reduced public good provision as one indirect channel
   through which clientelism may undermine fiscal redistribution.},

Title = {Emergent Veteran Identity: Toward a New Theory of Veteran Identity in
   Israeli Society},
Journal = {ARMED FORCES \& SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Israeli society has seen a gradual decrease in the proportion of
   compulsory and reserve soldiers amid growing criticism of the military
   from those who have previously served. This criticism is connected to a
   willingness on their part to organize collective action for postservice
   benefits and influence other postservice-related issues. We argue that a
   new theoretical concept of an ``emergent veteran identity{''} could
   explain this new social phenomenon for both the Israeli military and
   others. In this study, 248 Israeli veterans completed questionnaires
   designed to investigate emergent veteran identity. The results reveal
   that emergent veteran identity was explained by the perception of the
   role of the military in society, by the organizational dimensions of
   veterans' transition into society, and, to a lesser extent, by combat
   experiences. Female veterans had a higher emergent veteran identity and
   exhibited higher transformation limbo. The article also discusses the
   utility of this new concept for the study of veterans in general and the
   results' implications for threats to and the loss of military identity.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses how Chinese desert landscapes are being used as
   analogue sites for the public to gain a first-hand and embodied
   experience of Martian-like landscapes through the scientific,
   educational, and tourist facilities and activities that Mars Camp in
   Qinghai province of the People's Republic of China offers visitors. By
   analysing accounts and chronicles of visitors' experiences (mainly based
   on digital materials showcased by the Mars Camp website), this paper
   focuses on how the said camp rhetorically frames particular features of
   these landscapes to create both an imaginary and a material continuity
   between Earth and outer space, one which is produced through voluminous
   immersive encounters, that is, experiences that expand the very `sense'
   of territory upwards and outwards.},

Abstract = {BackgroundFor many Americans, pro-life attitudes are directly attached
   to their religious beliefs, especially white evangelicals. Some have
   argued that evangelicals came to oppose abortion not simply because of
   their views on the sanctity of life, but out of a growing racial
   resentment as government policy and society moved towards greater racial
   equality. ObjectivesThis study explores the relationship of
   evangelicalism, racial attitudes, and views on the legality of abortion
   to explore whether racial resentment is behind evangelical opposition to
   abortion. MethodsTo carry out this exploration this study employs
   American National Election Studies data from 2000 to 2020 and the 2020
   Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) Values survey. ResultsWe find
   no support for the idea that racial attitudes are disproportionately
   correlated with the abortion views of white evangelicals. Rather, we
   find that racial attitudes are now correlated with views on abortion for
   all Americans. Where abortion attitudes are distinctive from attitudes
   on other policy issues is in having very strong religious determinants,
   suggesting that genuine religious beliefs do indeed underscore the
   pro-life views of white evangelicals. ConclusionThis study provides a
   good baseline for understanding the relationship between racial
   attitudes, evangelicalism, and abortion attitudes at the cusp of the
   Dobbs decision overturning Constitutional protections for abortion, and
   should be revisited in the post Roe era.},

Abstract = {This paper demonstrates that the equilibrium determined by the
   commitment of a Central Bank to a non-stationary
   ({''}super-inertial{''}) interest rate rule (where the sum of the
   parameters of the lags of the interest rate exceeds one and does not
   depend on the persistence of shocks) does not correspond to the unique
   bounded solution and the stable equilibrium of Ramsey optimal policy for
   the new-Keynesian model. It always destabilizes inflation because of the
   rounding errors and the measurement errors of the parameters of the
   monetary policy transmission mechanism. By contrast, the commitment of a
   Central Bank to a stationary interest rate rule rule (where the sum of
   the parameters of lags of the interest rate is strictly below one and
   depends on the persistence of shocks) corresponds to the unique bounded
   solution and the stable equilibrium of Ramsey optimal policy.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The paper explores the configuration of corruption in democracies and
   simultaneously looks at whether civil society figures in this
   configuration. It does so via a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative
   Analysis of 30 democracies in the third wave of autocratization. Results
   of the analysis suggest that the presence of high perceived corruption
   is accounted for by the absence of a robust civil society combined with
   the absence of wide and independent public deliberation and the presence
   of high political exclusion. On the other hand, the absence of high
   perceived corruption is explained by the presence of wide and
   independent public deliberation combined with the absence of high
   political exclusion. It is particularly in the latter case that civil
   society's role, whether in its presence or absence, is elusive. The
   paper contributes to the discussion on the contextual dependencies of
   corruption and the conditionality of civil society's anticorruption
   role. Prospects for future research on the conditional and possibly
   indirect anti-corruption role of civil society in democracies are put
   forward.},

Title = {Financial Stress and Effect on Real Economy: Turkish Experience},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-67},
Abstract = {The core of this paper is an econometric estimation of the relation
   between financial stress and a number of macroeconomic variables
   (consumption, real GDP, investment, unemployment). This estimation is
   done on Turkish quarterly data for the period 2002-2021 using threshold
   vector autoregression (i.e., TVAR). The paper observes the non-linear
   trade-off between financial stress and macroeconomic indicators. The
   effect of financial stress appears to be adverse when the stress level
   is already at a higher level. During high stress episodes, any further
   increase in financial stress drags economic growth down and the effect
   appears to be prolonged in nature. Consumption and investment growth
   also moderate due to a higher stress level. Furthermore, the forecast
   error decomposition indicates sustained contribution of financial stress
   impeding growth prospects over the forecast horizon. The findings
   corroborate with the financial friction mechanism. As borrowing
   constraint tightens during a high stress regime, the effect of financial
   stress moderates economic activities. Lastly, the paper extends a local
   projection approach for estimating a threshold VAR model as a robustness
   check.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore and analyse the dynamic
   relationship between remittances inflows of Egyptians working abroad and
   asymmetric oil price shocks.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a
   vector autoregressive (VAR) model to explain the impulse response
   functions (IRFs) and the forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD).
   The rationale behind using these tools is its ability to examine the
   dynamic effects of our variables of interest.FindingsThe impulse
   response functions confirmed that remittance inflows have various
   responses to asymmetric oil price shocks. For instance, inflowing
   remittances increase in response to positive oil price shocks, while it
   decreases in response to negative oil price shocks. Also, the results
   indicate that the responses are significant in the short and medium-run
   and insignificant in the long run. The magnitude of these responses
   reaches its peak or trough in the third year. Further, the variance
   decomposition reveals that oil price decreases are more influential than
   oil price increases.Originality/valueThis means that remittances inflows
   in Egypt are pro-cyclical with oil price shocks. That explained by the
   fact that more than one-half of those remittances sent from GCC
   countries where real economic growth is very pro-cyclical with the oil
   prices. This empirical assessment will help policymakers to determine
   the behaviour of remittances and highlights the impact of different
   kinds of oil prices shocks on remittances. Unlike the little existing
   literature, this study is the first study applied the VAR model using a
   novel dataset spanning 1960-2016.},

Abstract = {The concept of political propaganda includes a theoretical contradiction
   between orthodoxy and popularity of ideology, and by implication, a
   practical contradiction between repressing and mobilizing public
   discourse. Post-socialist China offers a curious case. The
   neo-traditionalist bureaucratic system stresses absolute ideological
   correctness, while the mouthpiece media's need for adjusting to a
   marketized media industry demands popularity. How China confronts such
   contradiction is crucial for both understanding China's resilience and
   conceptualizing propaganda and ideology. Through in-depth interviews
   with insiders of the propaganda system, this article argues that China's
   mouthpiece media are compartmentalized into two separate branches. On
   one hand, the official print newspaper continues to define ideological
   orthodoxy. On the other, the newly developed online mouthpieces are
   granted greater autonomy to use various discursive strategies to
   popularize themselves. In the latter case, the subject of propaganda
   transforms from doctrine and dogma to discourse and culture, and
   ideology is integrated into everyday experience.},

Abstract = {This paper explores online bottom-up populism in China by examining the
   discursive logics of populism that emerge within expressions of populist
   discontent. Through a conceptualization of the affordances of social
   media that considers what they enable alongside what they constrain, it
   uses a computational grounded theory approach to examine individuals'
   posts and the use of hashtags in online communication on Sina Weibo
   around the \#DrivingIntoThePalaceMuseum case. Through its analysis,
   three discursive logics of online populism are identified: antagonistic
   logic, polarization logic and protest logic. However, while the
   affordances of social media enable populist discourse polarization, they
   also enable ``depolarization{''} through the government's censorship
   mechanisms. This results in a dynamic bottom-up populism articulation
   that reflects an awareness of China's censorship mechanisms. Within the
   Chinese media environment, this functions as a ``pressure valve{''}
   releasing the buildup of populist sentiment in a Chinese ``social
   volcano.{''}},

Abstract = {Educated individuals are believed to be more tolerant towards ethnic
   minorities-a finding widely inferred from standard survey items. We
   propose a new approach that helps mitigate the risk of socially
   desirability bias (SDB), using a multifactorial survey experiment with
   name-based vignette dimensions. The experiment is strategically inserted
   into a question about a social dilemma not related to ethnicity. By
   embedding our experiment into an established survey-the Swedish part of
   the European Values Survey-we show that individuals with a high level of
   education are more tolerant towards ethnic minorities, even under a
   lower risk of SDB. The study strengthens findings in prior research and
   supports the hypothesis that education can further ethnic tolerance.},

Abstract = {In a 2021 contribution to Politics and Religion, Jesse Russell wrote
   that St. Thomas Aquinas ``had a decidedly illiberal view of a
   government.{''} He says Aquinas ``advocates a government in which the
   people are not given public liberty{''} and did not ``prepare the way
   for the mixed monarchy of the English constitution.{''} But Aquinas
   places the rule of moral law above politics, endorses participatory
   government, prioritizes reciprocal duties rather than coerced
   conformity, favors a mixed regime with democratic representation, and
   sanctions resistance to tyrants. Each idea is an important component of
   modern understandings of freedom. Liberal democracy as a constitutional
   arrangement, and its various philosophical defenses, postdate Aquinas by
   centuries. It would be anachronistic to cast him as their partisan. But
   neither was he a proto-reactionary: his political philosophy is
   congenial to free, limited government that belongs to the people.},

Title = {Should Italy switch to a flat tax? An assessment based on a
   heterogeneous agents OLG model},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {80},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We use a heterogeneous agents overlapping generations (OLG) model to
   quantitatively assess the impact of a reform in which a personal income
   tax with increasing marginal tax rates is replaced by a flat tax
   possibly complemented with a deduction. The value of the flat tax rate
   is set in order to balance the government budget , accordingly it
   increases with the value of the deduction. The model is calibrated and
   simulated for Italy. For low values of the deduction, aggregate labor
   supply increases, though this aggregate effect masks a completely
   different impact on the intensive and the extensive margin of labor
   supply: in particular, the activity rate is reduced by the introduction
   of a flat tax. As to inequality, it rises and this increase can be
   mitigated by using an higher value of the tax deduction, which however
   dampens down the positive effect of a flat tax on economic performance.
   Finally, the effect of a flat tax on social welfare crucially depends on
   the degree of inequality aversion embedded in the social welfare
   function and on the Frisch elasticity of labor supply.},

Abstract = {This article explores how the threat of terrorism has been addressed at
   the policy level by offering a fine-grained analysis of a specific
   preventing and countering violent extremism (P/CVE) project implemented
   in Mali between 2018 and 2021 by a composite mix of international and
   national practitioners. Despite the current and almost complete
   detachment from the international and European security community, Mali
   has been, for a long time, a critical actor in the construction of what
   we identify as a transnational counterterrorism assemblage. This paper
   specifically focuses on three parts of the process leading to the
   assemblage: (1) the context and the political opportunities behind its
   creation, (2) how a specific north/south epistemic community of experts
   and practitioners has emerged in Mali and shaped the cognitive,
   normative and practical dimensions of the policy field and finally (3)
   the mechanisms at work in the practice of counterterrorism, from design
   to implementation on the ground. In doing so, the article contributes to
   the existing academic debate by problematising received interpretations
   of P/CVE as a north to south transfer of policy priorities and schemes
   of action. We show how current P/CVE activities are, rather, defining
   new social standards and practices of security elaborated at the
   intersection of the north/south divide. We finally offer some
   reflections on the unexpected consequences of such a construction in
   relation to the following national and international political crisis of
   the country.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to study empirically the relationship between
   political governance and public debt by testing a number of hypotheses.
   We examine the effects of the dispersion of power on public debt with an
   econometric study carried out on a sample of 13 developed countries
   using macroeconomic and political data covering the period 1996-2012. It
   is found that the lack of consensus between political parties in a
   government coalition and the dispersion of power within the government
   are factors explaining the increase in public debt.},

Title = {Geopolitical hostility and corporate innovation: Evidence from US

Journal = {ECONOMICS \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {This study aims to empirically examine whether and how the innovation
   activities would change in the face of shocks caused by heightened
   US-China tensions for US high-tech firms from trade sectors with China.
   It is found that although the overall innovation intensity slides down
   during periods of heightened geopolitical risk and policy uncertainty,
   innovativeness of the US high-tech companies from trade sectors with
   China is not completely suppressed by the escalated tensions and still
   maintains certain levels of momentum compared with other firms. However,
   the empirical evidence demonstrates that the superiority of the
   innovation intensity of US high-tech companies from trade sectors with
   China to other firms is curbed during periods of heightened tensions in
   comparison with periods in the absence of geopolitical shocks and
   economic uncertainty. Moreover, the negative impact of US-China tensions
   on corporate innovation is further amplified when the firm is less
   established, more financially constrained and of smaller size and less
   human power capital, each of which serves as an important moderator
   driving the negative relation. The findings of the paper are based on
   multifaceted empirical methods and contribute to the literature on
   corporate innovation, international trade, and geopolitical and economic
   tensions between nations.},

Title = {Assessing policy co-ordination in government: Text and network analysis
   of the UK's economic strategies},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Lack of consistency has long been noted as a weakness in government
   policy-making, but it has previously been difficult to assess the extent
   of the absence of strategic co-ordination. This paper investigates this
   shortcoming by applying computational linguistics and network tools to
   provide some evidence on the lack of policy co-ordination in the UK. We
   use two key economic strategy documents produced during the Johnson
   administration-the 2021 Plan for Growth and the 2021 UK Innovation
   Strategy-to analyse all subsequent policy documents produced by the same
   administration. The extent of linguistic discontinuity provides some
   indication of the extent of the absence of policy co-ordination in that
   administration's economic policies, reinforced by analysis showing a
   similar lack of `joining up' in government departmental networks.},

Title = {Corruption, scandals and incompetence: Do voters care?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Accountability theory posits that elections weed out badly performing
   politicians, whereas typeselection theory posits that politicians who do
   not represent a (sufficiently large) group are ousted. This paper tests
   this by estimating the impact of various forms of misconduct by Dutch
   local government politicians on the vote share of their parties. It
   shows that incidents that reveal incompetence cost their parties 1.5
   percentage points of the vote share, or roughly 10 percent of their
   voters. Incidents that expose politicians to be someone else than their
   public image suggests (i.e., scandals) have a similar cost. Incidents
   that reveal both simultaneously (i.e., corruption) cost parties almost
   double, namely 3 percentage points. The results show that the
   accountability and type-selection theories are both important in
   explaining voting behavior and suggest that there might be additional
   punishment when both theories predict a negative effect.},

Abstract = {As mobile-only use has increased over the last decade, research has
   found that mode of online access (mobile-only vs. mobile and computer
   use) is related to digital inequalities. Relying on the literature on
   affordances and digital inclusion, this study seeks to: (1) examine the
   effects of mode of access on the number of online activities, over time;
   and (2) understand how the context of transitioning between modes of
   access shape how people perceive technologies. We conducted a 3-year
   mixed-methods longitudinal study. First, we ran a two-wave
   representative panel survey in Chile (N = 512). People who became hybrid
   users increased their activities, whereas those who became mobile-only
   decreased them. Then, we interviewed a subsample of people who switched
   mode of access between waves (N = 22). We found that people's relation
   with devices and their choices evolve over time according to their
   shifting needs and contexts. These results point to users' agency and
   the relevance of the concept of affordances. Thus, we propose the
   concept of transitional affordances to explain how users' perceptions,
   experiences, and ability to compare between mode of access shape their
   relation, engagement, and perceived affordances of technologies.},

Abstract = {The paper contributes to the study of institutional trust by making a
   connection to ``cultural backlash{''} theory and analyzing more recent
   forms of news consumption. We examine how trust in politics, media, and
   science is shaped by ``cultural backlash{''} and media use in nine
   European countries. We employ representative survey data collected in
   2021 in Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Serbia,
   Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom as part of a large European
   research project. The results suggest that both exogenous (or
   ``cultural{''}) and endogenous (or ``institutional{''}) dimensions of
   cultural backlash matter for explaining institutional trust. Trust
   benefits from progressive-liberal values and less ideological extremism,
   but is hindered by discontentment with societal developments and
   political disengagement. Using public television is positively, and
   social media negatively associated with trust. While we find
   distinctions across institutions, there is huge consistency across
   countries.},

Abstract = {The Government of India has undertaken a novel step towards building new
   smart cities as well as transforming some of its existing cities into
   smart cities. However, tension relating to the governance of smart
   cities has emerged. Therefore, a mixed-methods approach was used based
   on a perception survey, case studies, and discussions with stakeholders
   and experts, to examine the current governance challenges in
   transforming existing cities into smart cities, and to explore various
   perspectives to propose a framework for an appropriate governance system
   for developing smart cities in India. The findings suggested that the
   current executive-led governance system, with special-purpose vehicles
   (SPVs) under the control of the state governments as the promoters of
   smart city development, might not lead to the smart governance system
   envisaged but, rather, add confusion and conflict, and undermine the
   constitutionally mandated, legislative-led urban local bodies. The
   argument in this article is for a people-centric, balanced governance
   approach with strengthened urban local bodies, enabled by advanced
   digital technology and the constructive participation of different
   social solidarities, in which the SPVs would act as the intellectual and
   executive wing of the urban local bodies.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to explore to what extent can the Saudi-US
   alliance endure, given the several challenges it has faced over the past
   decade. Using a conceptual framework from the alliance theory, the paper
   will trace the historical evolution of the alliance between the two
   countries, then will identify some of the challenges that have faced the
   alliance on both the regional and bilateral levels, and finally will
   assess the impact of these challenges on the resilience of the Saudi-US
   alliance.Design/methodology/approachThis paper will use the alliance
   theory literature to analyze the challenges and the resilience of the
   Saudi-US relations.FindingsThe Saudi-US alliance has encountered several
   challenges in the past decade such as the Arab spring, the Iranian
   nuclear deal and the Civil War in Syria and Yemen. However, this
   alliance proved to be resilient, and the strategic partnership between
   the two countries managed to overcome these
   challenges.Originality/valueThe importance of this paper stems from the
   fact that the USA and the Saudi Arabia are two pivotal countries, and
   their relationship affects regional and international dynamics. The
   paper contributes to the literature on the Saudi-US bilateral relations
   as well as their views on recent regional issues such as the Arab
   Spring, the civil war in Yemen and Syria. Assessing the limits and
   potentials of the alliance between the two countries could also help us
   understand the future of regional developments in the Middle East.},

Abstract = {In recent years, scholars have considered how activists are `being the
   change they want to see in the world' and have developed the concept of
   prefigurative politics to describe how movements for social change align
   the means of their changemaking practices with the end goals of their
   organisations. Whereas being and embodiment seem to be central to this
   slogan, relatively little systematic scholarly reflection has occurred
   on how `being political' emerges as a form of prefigurative politics.
   This article introduces one example of how being can be a form of
   prefigurative politics by thinking through contemplative activism: the
   use of contemplation as a way of responding to global challenges. It
   shows that the political imagination of transformation that
   contemplative activists offer is a form of being (a state of existence)
   rather than doing (working towards a particular goal). This article
   considers how a study of contemplative activism as a prefigurative form
   of being political can contribute to three main debates within the
   literature on prefigurative politics: the specific relationship between
   means and ends, temporal distinctions between the present and the future
   and the actualization of goals. Ultimately, the article argues that
   considering social change to occur on an ontological level contributes
   to advancing a broad understanding of prefigurative politics that not
   just includes non-hierarchical models of organization but also comprises
   affective, embodied, and spiritual experiences as forms of prefigurative
   changemaking.},

   Political Science},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Surveys are ubiquitous in the study of politics, making enumerator
   fabrication a critical issue. A prevailing view is that faked interviews
   affect inferences drawn from compromised datasets. Researchers have
   generated theories about how fabrication might affect inferences. Yet,
   speculation has outpaced systematic testing. We leverage a rare dataset
   to address this gap: a national face-to-face survey in Venezuela in
   which a uniquely high volume of falsified interviews was detected,
   canceled, and replaced. Comparing the verified and fraudulent datasets,
   we find that descriptive inference is sometimes affected, but
   correlational results hold, even in a dataset with an unusually
   high-fabrication rate. Enumerators largely fabricate plausible data.
   Though still egregious, enumerator fabrication may not constitute a
   grave threat to political science research.},

Abstract = {This research focuses on the under-studied phenomenon of maritime
   borders by providing a civilian perspective on how fishers live,
   negotiate, contest, and transcend state borders and surveillance at sea.
   It explores the everyday transboundary practices of Chinese fishers in
   the geopolitically sensitive South China Sea (SCS), examining their
   cross-border tactics to sustain fishing livelihoods and the mechanisms
   underpinning these tactics. Based on long-term, continuous ethnographic
   investigations, we unravel four tactics employed by Chinese fishers to
   elude the constraints of territorial borders: contract production,
   trans-territorial production, paying for the sea, and the appropriation
   of marine physicality. These transboundary strategies are supported by
   three mechanisms, including common fisher identity, historical
   transnational networks, and regional development structures. This
   research shows the agency and creativity of fishers in challenging and
   punctuating maritime territoriality in the context of increasing
   militarisation and securitisation of borderlands. It illustrates how the
   distinct materiality, mobility, and temporality of the ocean can be
   weaponised by fishers to undermine state-bordering processes. By
   exposing the extensive, dynamic, and complex civilian interactions and
   collaborations in the region, we demonstrate that the SCS is more than a
   geopolitical space but at the same time a social site of cooperation and
   solidarity. In doing so, this research contributes to studies of
   maritime borders and civilian geopolitical subjectivity by illuminating
   the flexibility of fishers in exercising powers on borders at sea. It
   also advances the existing SCS area studies by `peopling' the political
   geography of the region.},

Abstract = {The states of the Arabian Gulf present a novel case for the examination
   of relations between authoritarian governance and Christian
   organizations. The economic clout of the Gulf states has been central to
   political stability and legitimacy but they are increasingly seeking to
   expand and consolidate the soft power and resilience through political
   and diplomatic initiatives. This article examines how the Christian
   organizations established in recent decades by large migrant communities
   are incorporated into this strategy and how they are responding. It
   argues that religious tolerance has formed a central discourse in
   governmental policies and narratives that construct the Gulf states as
   modern progressive nations, despite their unique political systems based
   mainly on constitutional monarchies with limited political
   participation. This constructs local Christian communities as a source
   of soft power, despite their position as a religious minority.},

Abstract = {Adverse childhood experiences are traumatic early life experiences that
   can lead to poorer mental, physical, and social outcomes. Children in
   military and veteran families can face unique challenges compared with
   civilian families. This study utilizes data from 2017-2019 National
   Survey of Children's Health to examine 56,655 children living in
   military, veteran, and civilian families to predict the prevalence of
   adverse childhood experiences. Findings indicate that children living in
   veteran families (compared with civilian families) have higher odds of
   witnessing parents use violence and witnessing parents with alcohol or
   substance use problems. Children in military families had higher odds of
   divorce and lower odds of experiencing parental death. It is also noted
   that children living in military, veteran, and civilian families are
   similar across other ACEs including the incarceration of a parent, child
   as victim of violence, living with family with mental illness, unfair
   treatment because of race, and difficulty covering basics like food and
   housing.},

Abstract = {A moralised conception of freedom is based on a normative theory.
   Understanding it therefore requires an analysis of this theory. In this
   paper, I show how republican freedom as non-domination is moralised, and
   why analysing this concept therefore involves identifying the basic
   components of the republican theory of justice. One of these components
   is the non-moralised pure negative conception of freedom as
   non-interference. Republicans therefore cannot keep insisting that their
   freedom concept conflicts with, and is superior to, this more basic
   concept. I demonstrate how we can use pure negative freedom to formulate
   the republican theory more precisely. This exercise is more fruitful
   than the common focus on the alleged conflict between the two freedom
   concepts.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze the complex construction of sexual
   difference in Spain during the eighteenth and at the turn of the
   nineteenth century. Accordingly, a combined analysis is performed on the
   religious discourse of traditionalist Catholicism and that of the
   country's Enlightenment currents, plus their evolution, for they were
   the main perspectives from which the models of femininity and
   masculinity were constructed at the time. The intention is to
   demonstrate that the conceptualization of sexual difference in the
   transition to modernity was a convoluted process in which,
   notwithstanding the fact that they involved a key change in the way of
   understanding the body, gender and the relationship between the sexes,
   the Enlightenment's visions did not replace anti-modern religious

Abstract = {Ageing demographics have prompted widespread pension reforms across
   Latin America. This has left several countries with a significant
   financial burden related to the transition from one system to another.
   In this article, we evaluate two alternative methods of financing the
   recent pension reform in the Dominican Republic. We build on a simple
   real business cycle model with perfect competition and add a fiscal
   block that allows us to simulate shocks to the tax rates on capital and
   labour, based on the present value of the pension reform cost. We find
   that increasing the tax rate on returns to capital would not only fill
   the pension deficit, but also have a significantly smaller adverse
   effect on the macroeconomy, when compared with an increase to the tax on
   labour.},

Abstract = {This article examines how Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter's Armed
   Career Criminal Act attempted to respond to the 1980s crisis of state
   prison overcrowding while also maintaining a political commitment to get
   tough on crime. Although commonly thought of as a straightforward
   punitive sentencing bill, this article shows that the Armed Career
   Criminal Act was also a desperate attempt to navigate a national crisis
   of state prison overcrowding in the 1980s that threatened to undercut
   racialized ``get tough `` politics and the burgeoning carceral state. In
   doing so, this article reshapes scholarship on the history of the United
   States carceral state by demonstrating that the United States'
   decentralized political structure and federal government hostility
   toward funding state correctional expansion created significant gaps
   between a national discourse of law and order and actual anticrime
   policy making in the Reagan era, suggesting a far more contested
   development of the United States prison nation.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveGiven the detrimental consequences of income inequality and the
   importance of charitable giving in society, the relationship between
   income inequality and charitable giving has attracted much scholarly
   attention, but less is known about why and how income inequality is
   associated with charitable giving. This study intends to explore the
   role of government social spending in the relationship between income
   inequality and charitable giving. MethodBuilding upon previous
   theoretical arguments and empirical studies, I argue that income
   inequality is negatively related to government social spending, and
   government social spending is negatively related to charitable giving.
   Using the U.S. county-level panel data (2011-2017), this study runs a
   series of fixed-effects models. ResultsIt finds there is no significant
   relationship between income inequality and government social spending as
   well as between government social spending and charitable giving.
   However, income inequality has a robustly and significantly negative
   relationship with charitable giving. ConclusionGovernment social
   spending does not play a mediating role in the relationship between
   income inequality and charitable giving, but income inequality actually
   has a pernicious effect on individual philanthropy.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesThis study aims to contribute to our understanding of the
   relationship between income inequality, perceptions of income
   inequality, and support for redistribution. In particular, it asks
   whether income inequality affects support for redistribution by
   influencing perceptions of inequality. MethodsThis study combines the
   pay ratio measures from the International Social Survey Project with
   income inequality measures from the Standardized World Income Inequality
   Database. The analysis proceeds in three steps, asking whether (1)
   inequality is related to perceived inequality, (2) perceived inequality
   is related to preferences for inequality, and (3) perceived inequality
   is related to support for redistribution. ResultsIncome inequality is
   unrelated to perceptions of inequality. Perceptions of inequality
   strongly predict preferred inequality, reinforcing the prior conclusion
   that anchoring effects likely cause this close relationship. Perceptions
   of inequality also predict support for redistribution. However, because
   actual inequality is unrelated to perceived inequality, there is no link
   between actual inequality and either preferred inequality or support for
   redistribution. ConclusionThe overall pattern of results is consistent
   with the interpretation that perceptions of income inequality may be
   politically co-determined with support for inequality and
   redistribution, instead of perceptions being mental antecedents of these
   attitudes.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {77},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We model the political manipulation of deficits in a political budget
   cycle model. Assuming that a share of voters suffers from debt illusion
   the incumbent can increase her re-election chances by expanding
   government spending. However, the optimal manipulation may exceed the
   amount necessary to maximize re-election chances (over-manipulation) if
   the deficit is not very costly (low repayment obligation). Then, more
   selfish politicians (higher ego rents and, therefore, increased
   re-election motivation) reduce the over-manipulation. Conversely,
   ``excessive{''}spending may wrongly be interpreted as opportunistic
   government manipulation. Theoretical results are supported empirically,
   with very robust evidence in a sample of 87 democracies.},

Title = {Embodied geopolitics and negotiations of belongings from Turkey to
   Athens after 2016},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {102},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article employs the notion of embodied geopolitics in order to
   re-ground geopolitical relations at the scale of everyday life.
   Specifically, it explores how geopolitical relations between Greece and
   Turkey that historically oscillate between enmity and friendship,
   mediate the everyday lives of Turkish citizens who moved to Athens after
   2016, in a context of intertwined crises (i.e. the refugee,
   socio-economic and pandemic-related health crisis). Drawing on in-depth
   interviews with Turkish citizens, we seek to understand how their
   diverse positionalities defined by gender, class, ethnicity and
   religion, become reconfigured as they negotiate their belongings in
   Athens. We are interested, in particular, in how this negotiation is
   shaped by the ever-present geopolitical past, as well as the experiences
   of displacement and precarity. Through an engagement with critical and
   feminist geopolitics, we argue that the historical and political
   relations between Greece and Turkey `haunt' the lives of Turkish
   citizens, (re)producing stereotypes and othering processes. At the same
   time, we propose that their everyday relational geographies are
   constituted by `sheltered' spaces, which enable them to reconfigure
   their positionalities as well as boundaries, constraints, and haunting
   histories. The article concludes with a discussion of the potential the
   negotiations of belonging that ensue by the haunting geopolitical
   relations and the everyday sheltered spaces have, to challenge and/or
   reproduce geopolitical relations on the ground.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveAlthough a relation between smallness and democracy has often
   been examined, it cannot be said that an academic conclusion has been
   established. Focusing on Pacific island countries, this article has
   examined how democracy of microstates works and clarified a
   smallness-democracy relation in the political process. MethodsThis
   article focuses on the political institutions.such as the executive
   system, the legislature's system, the election system, and the political
   party system-, and examines how these institutions mutually influence
   one another. ResultsIn the Pacific island countries, some important
   factors, including smallness and traditional human relationships, play a
   vital role in the political process, which makes their politics
   democratic and stable. Conclusions{''}Micro-Cooperative Democracy{''} is
   presented as a new type of democracy that corresponds to neither the
   Majoritarian nor Consensus models.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to open a new path for the comparative cross-historical
   and cross-cultural analysis of deliberating or deciding assemblies. For
   this purpose, it makes use of a wide concept of parliament, in contrast
   to the conventional narrow one which focuses on democratic elections and
   a free mandate. The essay starts with an overview of the large variety
   of ``parliamentarianisms{''} across history and culture, and then points
   out the shortcomings of the ``historically flat{''} legislative research
   conducted to date. It goes on to show how the use of non-biological
   evolutionary theory can enhance comparative historical research on
   institutions. Finally, it is demonstrated how ``institutional
   morphology{''}, which draws a distinction between no fewer than five
   different forms of similarity, can be fruitfully used for empirical
   research into parliaments in particular, and institutions in general.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We study how the structure of social media networks and the presence of
   fake news affects the degree of misinformation and polarization in a
   society. For that, we analyze a dynamic model of opinion exchange in
   which individuals have imperfect information about the true state of the
   world and exhibit bounded rationality. Key to the analysis is the
   presence of internet bots: agents in the network that spread fake news
   (e.g., a constant flow of biased information). We characterize how
   agents' opinions evolve over time and evaluate the determinants of long
   -run misinformation and polarization in the network. To that end, we
   construct a synthetic network calibrated to Twitter and simulate the
   information exchange process over a long horizon to quantify the bots'
   ability to spread fake news. A key insight is that significant
   misinformation and polarization arise in networks in which only 15\% of
   agents believe fake news to be true, indicating that network externality
   effects are quantitatively important. Higher bot centrality typically
   increases polarization and lowers misinformation. When one bot is more
   influential than the other (asymmetric centrality), polarization is
   reduced but misinformation grows, as opinions become closer the more
   influential bot's preferred point. Finally, we show that threshold rules
   tend to reduce polarization and misinformation. This is because, as long
   as agents also have access to unbiased sources of information, threshold
   rules actually limit the influence of bots.},

Abstract = {This article investigated the effects and mechanisms of military service
   on health outcomes of Chinese elderly men aged 60 and older. While
   numerous studies explored the effect of military service on health in
   developed countries, we still knew little about the relationship between
   military service and later health outcomes in developing countries such
   as China. Using the data of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal
   Study, we found that military service is positively associated with
   better health outcomes of the elderly, in terms of physical health,
   cognitive abilities, and self-rated health. In addition, results of
   mechanism analysis show that, compared with nonveterans, elderly
   veterans had healthier habits, better education, higher individual and
   household income, and more favorable social medical security.Moreover,
   heterogeneity analysis indicates that this effect is more pronounced for
   older, rural, and spouseless elderly people. This article provided
   insights into elderly veterans' health security measures in developing
   countries.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the Iranian Kurds' production of territory
   during two rounds of street demonstrations in October 2014 and September
   2017. Findings from semi-structured interviews and qualitative online
   data indicate that Kurdish demonstrators produced imagined territory by
   employing embodied discourses and symbolic practices. Situating the
   demonstrations within the context of the Iranian state's securitisation
   of the Kurdish space, the article shows that the demonstrators deployed
   such discourses and practices as co-constructed tactics of resistance to
   avoid violent confrontation with security forces. The state's oppressive
   power and its securitisation of space, therefore, had the ironically
   productive effect of prompting demonstrators to articulate and produce
   imagined territory through embodied, discursive, and symbolic tactics.
   Expanding on research that has focused on the territorial struggles of
   minoritized populations, the article makes a broader point that
   marginalised yet persistent collective geopolitical imaginations - in
   this case, Kurdistan - simultaneously inspire and are reproduced by
   minoritized peoples' alter-geopolitical resistance.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to identify the factors affecting the political
   participation of Jordanian university students, especially their voting
   in national and local elections. The study examines the impact of
   gender, age, family income and regional affiliation that represent
   important social and economic factors affecting political participation
   on the voting of Jordanian university
   students.Design/methodology/approachQuantitative research method was
   used in this study. The study population contained three Jordanian
   universities representing the various segments of the Jordanian society:
   Al-Al Bayt University (Northern Region), Jordanian University (Central
   Region) and Mu'tah University (Southern Region). The study relied on a
   purposive sample of 900 students, 300 students per university (150 males
   and 150 females). The survey was conducted in the academic year
   2018-2019. A questionnaire reviewed by two jurors (peer reviewers) was
   used to collect the data.FindingsThe study concluded that the gender,
   age, family income and regional affiliation factors affect the voting of
   Jordanian university students in national and local elections. The more
   the gender varies, the more the voting shifts in favor of males
   students. The more the age varies, the more the voting shifts in favor
   of older students. The more the family income varies, the more the
   voting shifts in favor of high-income students. The more the regional
   affiliation varies, the more the voting shifts in favor of Jordanians
   students.Originality/valueThis study is an approach to interpret the
   factors affecting voting of Jordanian university students, such as
   gender, age, family income and regional affiliation, which led to
   different voting in the national and local elections.},

Title = {Recovery of Claims Arising from Abuse of Non-insurance Social Security
   Benefit System {*}},
Journal = {POLITICKA EKONOMIE},

Pages = {536-554},
Abstract = {The paper presents the volume of debts incurred as part of non-insurance
   social security benefits in the Czech Republic from 2016 to 2020 and
   defines the structure of these debts by individual types of
   non-insurance social security benefits, where 25\% is attributable to
   parental allowance, followed by housing allowance (17\%) and subsistence
   allowance (20\%). The analysis deals with the number of debts broken
   down into paid, collected, settled by other means, written off for
   uncollectibility or extinction of the right. The study works with unique
   data obtained by summarisation from the application programmes used by
   the Labour Office of the Czech Republic, which showed a continuous
   decrease in total identified claims by 46\% between 2016 and 2020. An
   analysis of time series and a regression and correlation analysis are
   performed in the paper. These methods confirm a decreasing trend in the
   number of total debts and a decreasing proportion of paid debts over
   time, in contrast to the ratio of outstanding debts, which has been
   increasing over time. Lastly, they also identify variability in the
   structure of social security benefits, i.e., inconsistency in the share
   of individual benefits over the period under review. Social expenditures
   are fundamental to state spending, but addressing their potential misuse
   is a sensitive political issue. From an economic perspective, this
   paradoxical situation leads to overlooking potential resources that
   could be potentially available through the elimination of purposeful
   exploitation of the social system, leaving the question of the frequency
   of purposeful claiming unanswered. Any potential political decision to
   reduce social expenditures, without an economic evaluation of the
   frequency and volume of purposefully claimed benefits from the social
   system, may not be optimal.},

   being raised. The so-called deinstitutionalization reform has been an
   important part of introducing children's rights legislation in
   contemporary Bulgaria. However, it is still unclear how the consequences
   of the reform relate to the normative framework of child's rights. To
   address this problem, we present the results of a study conducted in
   2020/2021 that explores the implementation of the re-form through the
   approach of action research. We analyse interviews with children, social
   workers and public officials conducted in two big cities in Bulgaria. We
   outline the ways and extent to which children's rights are integrated
   into the professional practice of social workers and in the lives of
   children that are part of the reform, as well as the reasons for their
   violation. We conclude that there are significant contradictions
   be-tween the `theoretical framework' of children's rights and their
   implementation in relation to the deinstitutionalization reform. The
   former may be seen as `unintended consequences' of the reform resulting
   from Bulgarian society's socio-cultural specificities.},

Abstract = {Given that the owners of a private firm might provide social
   responsibility incentives to their managers, this article examines how
   the presence of foreign investors alters the optimal degree of corporate
   social responsibility (CSR) in a mixed duopoly (public and private
   firms). Both modes of competition in terms of quantity (Cournot) and
   price (Bertrand) are analysed. We show that the private firm always
   engages in CSR when product market competition is less intense (Cournot)
   but will adopt a strategy of corporate social irresponsibility (CSIr)
   when the competition is more intense (Bertrand). In addition, we show
   that the presence of foreign investors leads to a decrease in the level
   of CSR under Cournot competition whereas the irresponsible practices are
   restricted under Bertrand competition. Furthermore, we show that, while
   CSIr is a strategy that is more profitable for the private firm, it
   results in a decline in social welfare.},

Abstract = {Barcelona was the place chosen by many indianos, who acquired their
   riches in Cuba and Puerto Rico, when they returned to Europe. During the
   Sexenio Democratico, indianos organised themselves in the Circulo
   Hispano-Ultramarino of Barcelona to lobby for the maintenance of slavery
   in both Spanish Antilles, first, and to undermine the Spanish Republic,
   later. This institution recruited, for its anti -ab-olitionist and
   pro-slavery campaigns, the leading Catalan economic organisations as
   well as broad sectors of the Catalonian elite. The latter publicly
   assumed the Circu-lo's arguments, participating in broader platforms
   such as the Liga Nacional or the Comision para la Defensa de los
   Intereses de Espana en Cuba. Moreover, although the pro-slave pressures
   could not stop the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico and Cuba, it
   favoured its continuity for a few more years in the island of Cuba
   through the institution of the Patronato. The most remarkable legacy
   (and also the most enduring) of the Circulo Hispano-Ultramarino of
   Barcelona was the Banco Hispano Colonial, a financial institution
   established in 1876 that would become a commer-cial bank that managed
   Cuban Customs until the end of the Spanish rule on the island in 1898.},
