Abstract = {Objective: This article examines how the limited national media
   reporting covered the pandemic in American Indian communities across the
   United States, specifically the Dine (Navajo) Nation, and whether and
   how this coverage differs from American Indian news sources.Methods:
   This article compares coverage related to COVID-19 by The New York Times
   (NYT) with coverage by the Navajo Times (NT), a Dine newspaper. The
   authors compiled their own database of news-based articles published by
   the NYT and the NT covering the pandemic and its impact on Native
   Nations between January 1, 2020, and September 30, 2020, and conducted a
   comparative content analysis of these articles.Results: While coverage
   was limited, the NYT articles highlight social inequities that settler
   colonialism and federal Indian law have fostered in the past and
   present, the cultural backdrop, which contributed to greater adverse
   impacts from COVID-19. However, coverage differs from the NT in
   important ways, particularly when considering the distinction between
   the Navajo Nation as a bureaucratic entity versus the Dine people, the
   framing of Native peoples as adaptive, and Indigenous investment in
   future creation.Conclusions: The NT was more nuanced in its coverage of
   stories of the impact of COVID-19 on American Indian communities as
   compared to the NYT.},

Abstract = {BackgroundInterprofessional collaboration (IPC) is a key contributor to
   the health-care organizational culture of wellness and health-care
   provider (HCP) morale.ObjectiveThe purpose of this study is examining
   the impact of IPC on their work stress among HCPs in China and comparing
   the differences in associations between IPC and work stress between
   Chinese physicians and nurses.MethodsWith a survey research design, 1036
   HCPs were electronically recruited. Five multiple linear regression
   models were developed to examine the association between IPC and work
   stress among general HCPs, physicians, and nurses.ResultsIPC can
   significantly reduce work stress among Chinese HCPs. Regarding IPC,
   achieving mutually satisfactory solutions, having a clear understanding
   of boundaries, and a sense of trust are negatively associated with HCPs'
   work stress, but team reflective revision was positively associated with
   HCPs' work stress during the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)
   pandemic. However, IPC factors are associated with work stress
   differently between physicians and nurses in China.ConclusionOur
   findings have important implications for practice, research, and policy.},

Title = {Understanding Germany's response to the 2015 refugee crisis},
Journal = {REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {577-604},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to understand the discrepancy between Germany's
   immediate positive response to the so-called ``Europe 2015's refugee
   crisis{''} and the strict asylum legislation adopted in Germany in the
   following year.Design/methodology/approachThe discrepancy is attributed
   to external and internal forces. The external force is Germany's
   obligation to adhere to the Common European Asylum System. The internal
   force is the role of the different policy actors. The paper focuses on
   the role of the media as an example of a private policy actor. Through
   adopting the theory of the social construction of target populations,
   the paper studies how the media constructs ``asylum seekers{''}, the
   target of the new asylum legislation. The role of the media is analyzed
   using the methodology of qualitative content analysis of a selected
   number of newspaper articles.FindingsThe majority of the studied
   articles problematized receiving and hosting refugees and focused on the
   reason behind migration differentiating between asylum seekers fleeing
   conflict areas and all others who might be abusing the asylum channel.
   The findings of the content analysis, as such, resonate with the
   amendments that focused on facilitating the integration of accepted
   ``refugees{''} but restricted further entry. As such, it could be argued
   that these findings explain the influence of the media on the amendments
   and as such provide an explanation to the discrepancy between the
   initial response and the amendments.Research limitations/implicationsThe
   analysis focused on one newspaper. The findings, as such, are not
   representative. The aim is only to provide an example of how the German
   media dealt with the refugee crisis and to suggest using the theory
   chosen by the paper to analyze the link between asylum legislation and
   the construction of asylum seekers. To understand how asylum legislation
   is influenced by how asylum seekers are constructed, more studies are
   needed. Such studies could analyze the role played by other media
   outputs and/or the role played by other policy actors in constructing
   the target of the policy.Originality/valueThe media's response is based
   on analyzing a sample of newspaper articles published by a German
   newspaper following the so-called 2015 refugee crisis. Accordingly, the
   findings represent an original endeavor to understand how the media
   reacted to the crisis.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to outline how the EU figures out
   the importance of strengthening its relations with Egypt as one of the
   most strategic countries in the region to keep the union secured and
   stable. The paper also assesses to what extent the EU succeeds to
   promote democracy in Egypt.Design/methodology/approachThe EU pursues its
   policy through a series of both bilateral and multilateral agreements
   with Egypt aiming at positioning their relations in a strategic context.
   The research adopted different approaches as descriptive and analytical
   ones.FindingsFollowing the Arab uprisings, the EU was caught by surprise
   and announced a paradigm shift in its relations and introduced a set of
   policies to foster democracy promotion that witnessed some successes but
   with extremely modest results in some areas compared to the costs of the
   process. The EU succeeded in important reforms in trade liberalization
   while it did not bring clear changes in the political arena in
   Egypt.Originality/valueThe findings of this paper convey that the Arab
   uprisings were a wake-up call for the EU. It was the right time for the
   EU to conduct such a strategic and sincere reflection based on the role
   it wants to play in the changing region. In addition, findings prove
   that the EU's response to revolutionary events has been weak and
   hesitant, and the EU has not an effective role in promoting democracy in

Abstract = {In order to continue to grow and prosper, modern society is increasingly
   adopting the products of companies, institutions, and organizations
   providing credit services. However, as a result, dissolution of a
   marriage tends to pose problems and raises unavoidable questions
   concerning the determination of the nature of the obligations of the
   spouses and the division of these obligations, which is why it is quite
   common in divorce cases for a third party, a creditor whose interests
   also need to be protected, to be involved. In cases concerning family
   relations, protection of the public interest predominates because
   protection of the legal interests of the spouses as well as the
   creditors must be guaranteed, also the proportionality of the protection
   of the legal interests between the parties must be achieved, because
   everyone has the right to defend their violated rights, and the state
   must ensure the protection of those legal interests. However, this
   protection is often compromised due to the lack of information available
   to notaries, which could be alleviated by more extensive use of
   technology. The article's aim is to analyze the amendments to the Civil
   Code of the Republic of Lithuania as of 1 January 2023 concerning
   extrajudicial divorce at a notary, its advantages and drawbacks, as well
   as to discuss the existing and the possibility of adaptation of new
   technological solutions with an aim of improving the protection of
   creditors in the divorce process.},

Abstract = {Online service providers (OSPs) provide a range of opportunities for
   individuals to engage in online child sexual exploitation, including the
   production and distribution of child sexual abuse material. As the
   failings of opaque content moderation systems have become apparent, a
   range of states have proposed or implemented new regulatory measures,
   amidst ongoing debates over the legitimacy of state intervention in
   online communication. This paper presents the findings of a survey of
   482 Australian adults regarding their expectations of technology
   companies and governments in relation to key issues of online child
   protection. The results suggest strong demands for greater action by
   OSPs against sexual exploitation, and for governments to legally
   enshrine some obligations for OSPs, as well as concern about the privacy
   of innocent users and about the data handling and cybersecurity of
   governments and technology companies. These findings indicate that
   governments and OSPs which are seeking to construct meaningful action
   against online child sexual exploitation might find significant support
   among the general public for such measures. Equally, these are very
   sensitive areas of governance for many. Governments and companies would
   draw significant assistance from understanding the views of users when
   navigating these challenging issues and ensuring that their measures are
   carefully calibrated to their legitimate concerns.},

Abstract = {Identifying sources of barriers to occupational mobility is central to
   evaluating the efficiency of the labor market. In this paper, we present
   an augmented Roy model in which workers self-select into occupations,
   subject to labor market barriers that are specific to their
   socio-linguistic group. Our findings provide evidence of differences in
   labor market outcomes across gender and linguistic groups in Canada. We
   argue that these differences could be attributed to barriers to labor
   mobility and that the reduction of these disparities would result in
   higher aggregate productivity in the country. In the augmented Roy
   model, the frictions result in inefficient allocation of labor across
   occupations. The study quantifies the change in aggregate productivity
   that would result from reducing the friction. The elimination of the
   frictions increased aggregate output on average by 6.2\% and 4.4\% in
   1991 and 2011, respectively. This finding highlights the importance of
   reducing language barriers and gender inequality in the labor market. We
   provide policy recommendations for mitigating the disparities in
   socioeconomic outcomes between gender and linguistic groups.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a history of more than a century of efforts to
   establish and main-tain a homegrown Canadian sugar supply -a
   twentieth-century version of what Eric Williams called the `war of the
   two sugars', or the global competition between sugar beet and cane. To
   resolve beet sugar's so-called `labour problem', the indus -try has
   collaborated with the Canadian state to produce new classes of temporary
   workers, mobilising incarcerated Japanese Canadians, migrant Indigenous
   families, and Mexican and Caribbean workers employed through the
   Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program. At the same time, the sugar
   industry has sought to refine itself of the racialised workers upon whom
   it relies by promoting the figure of the white Canadian worker. The
   Canadian `war of the two sugars' has been fought through the
   stratifica-tion of the labour force along the lines of citizenship,
   resulting in the production of unique racial forms.},

Abstract = {As a response to foreign election interference efforts, politicians and
   news media have adopted various frames which highlight the hinderance of
   such interference in electoral processes. However, little research has
   examined the impact of the framing of this election interference
   discourse on the attitudes and behaviours of voters. This research
   examines the impact of negative and positive election interference
   frames on Canadian voters using an experimental vignette design.
   Specifically, this study focuses on three dependent variables: citizens'
   trust in electoral institutions, their likelihood of voting, and their
   level of comfort using alternative methods of electoral participation.
   The results suggest that the framing of information on the topic of
   election interference can have an important impact on citizens'
   attitudes toward the electoral process. We find that positive, but not
   negative, information regarding election interference influences
   respondents' trust in the electoral system. We also find that the effect
   is greatest in politically uninterested individuals. Lastly, the results
   show that conservatives hold more negative attitudes towards elections
   and voting.},

Abstract = {As part of its strategy to win African votes for election to the UN
   Security Council (2008-12), Canberra sought to leverage its soft power
   potential by presenting Australia as having `` no colonial baggage{''}
   in Africa while framing Australia as ``a country from the Global North,
   located in the Global South,{''} and one that would ``work with other
   small and middle powers.{''} Ultimately, the campaign was successful,
   including up to 50 of Africa's 54 countries voting for Australia. This
   paper considers this framing in the context of a shared but
   differentiated colonial history, including its contradictions, given
   that Australians fought several wars on African soil on behalf of the
   British Empire, supported white minority regimes and anticommunist
   movements on the continent, and maintained the white Australia policy
   until the 1970s. The paper deploys decoloniality theory to engage
   Australia's lack of a neat fit within a historicised articulation of a
   ``coloniser-colonised{''} relationship between Europe and Africa. We
   show that, despite this lack of fit, Australia's relations with the
   countries of Africa reinforce long-standing of patterns of knowledge,
   power, and being associated with colonialism. Accordingly, the paper
   makes three recommendations for cooperation and innovative thinking in
   foreign policy and diaspora diplomacy between Africa and a more
   independent and multicultural Australia based on the ``equality of
   being.{''}},

Title = {Defector Politicians and Economic Growth: Evidence from India?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Political defectors refer to politicians who switch parties. This paper
   uses a close-election regression discontinuity (RD) model to estimate
   the impact of electing political defectors to Indian state legislatures
   on economic growth (proxied by night-light growth) in their electoral
   constituencies. I estimate that the election of a defector from the
   governing party causes a 0.13- 0.48 percentage point (2-7.5\%) increase
   in annual GDP growth in their constituency. Further, I find strong
   evidence that this increased growth is not driven by time-invariant ways
   in which defectors differ from non-defectors. Therefore, defectors
   improve economic outcomes in their constituencies either because (1)
   Defection provides politicians with resources and influence (for example
   in the form of ministerial positions) that they use to benefit their
   constituents, or because (2) Parties recruit politicians with increasing
   political influence, status or competence for defection. The evidence on
   which of these two channels explains the effect is inconclusive.},

Abstract = {This article defends the democratic ideal of inclusive public discourse,
   as articulated in Democratic Speech in Divided Times, against the
   critiques offered by Billingham, Fraser, and Hannon. Specifically, it
   considers and responds to three core challenges. The first challenge
   argues, notably, that the ``shared reasons{''} constraint should either
   apply everywhere or not at all, and that, if this constraint is to apply
   in divided circumstances, its justificatory constituency must be
   idealized. The second challenge contends that the resistance of hate
   speech and misinformation to counterspeech cannot adequately be
   explained by considerations of salience, and therefore cannot adequately
   by countered (as I suggest) by ``positive{''} forms of counterspeech.
   Finally, the last challenge objects that the ideal of inclusive public
   discourse I defend remains, as pessimists allege, excessively
   idealistic.},

Abstract = {Demands for intersectional organising have long been a priority for
   Black feminists, and in recent years it has also been taken up by a wide
   variety of social movement actors operating across different contexts.
   Analysing and actualising intersectionality as a strategic and
   generative tool presents a series of theoretical and empirical
   challenges and opportunities. In this article, we think through and
   about intersectionality in relation to two different social movements in
   the UK: the environmentalist movement and the disability rights
   movement. Discourse analysis undertaken of a range of groups' websites
   indicate that intersectional frameworks undergird some aspects of the
   ways that these two movements organise. We reflect on the ways that
   intersectional discourse is taken up by some groups within both
   movements to situate their politics. We also examine how intersectional
   frameworks shape some groups' framing of the issues under their
   ownership, and who the labour of intersectional organising falls to:
   (more often than not) women of colour.},

Abstract = {In the `global age', drug trades have become ever more seen as dynamic,
   flexible and fluid, since transnational crime nodes allegedly use a
   plethora of routes or pathways through which to move these `illegalized'
   com-modities. Most research on the subject centers around such global
   metaphors and lesser on the rural source contexts. Countless debates
   therefore have turned a blind eye to the development of the cocaine
   trade in Peru's ceja de selva (High Amazonia). Based on research in the
   Tocache Province, where smaller but also pivotal and more observable
   actors, groups and networks operated, this study follows the cocaine
   trade's `movements' in a rural context to understand how these
   activities became an expression of dynamic formations of order, control
   and governance. By connecting the changes in these local power
   structures to the area's shifting associations with cocaine's global
   commodity chains, it will be shown that rural drug trades, in fact, are
   both incessantly in motion while simultaneously deep-rooted in specific
   locations.},

Abstract = {The crime of stalking was recently typified in the Brazilian legal
   system, and the im-portance of the thematic examination translates into
   the countless daily situations of persecution, notably concerning women,
   to threaten the physical and psychological integrity of the victims,
   restrict their ability to move about or invade their sphere of freedom
   and privacy. The research examines the characteristics of the crime,
   making a historical and comparative law approach. Finally, it makes a
   critical analysis of the insufficiency of criminal law, concluding that
   the entire issue involves a multifactorial perspective, going through
   the execution of efficient public policies, not reducing the number of
   cases only by simple criminal protection.},

Title = {Squaring the circle: Settler colonialism, the international law of
   occupation and the separation barrier{*}},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {105},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Israeli High Court of Justice (HCJ) is highly invested in
   maintaining a facade of adherence to International Law (IL) in Israel's
   continuous occupation of the West Bank, and in mitigating the
   contradictions and complexities in Israel's implementation of this law.
   Our paper proposes a unique legal-geographical perspective to the
   analysis of this dynamic, while anchoring the critique of the HCJ's work
   within an understanding of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank as a
   settler colonial project. Empirically, we focus on the Court's evolving
   jurisprudence in relation to the inclusion of expansion plans for the
   Jewish settlements in the routing of the separation barrier. Through a
   close reading of the legal texts, we demonstrate how the Court strove to
   subject the settler colonial logic of permanent spatial transformation
   and settlement expansion into the IL's imperatives of temporality and
   conservation. Through this case-study we propose a nuanced empirical and
   methodological approach to the study of contemporary settler colonial
   legalities. This approach focuses on the intertwinement of everyday
   professional practices of space and law in order to unravel the weaving
   of settler colonial logics into contemporary imperatives.},

Pages = {471-487},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Despite Gordon Tullock's famous effort to motivate researchers to
   quantify investments in rent seeking, the empirical measurement of
   rent-seeking activity remains under-studied. This paper proposes a new
   estimate of rent seeking by comparing the industrial composition of MSAs
   that contain a state capital with those of a comparable synthetic match.
   Each of these synthetic matches are constructed as a weighted average of
   all MSAs that do not contain a state capital, where the weights are
   chosen via entropy balancing. This paper offers the first panel estimate
   of rent seeking in the United States by state and year for the years
   2004-2020. We also provide the first industry-specific measures of rent
   seeking, in addition to aggregate indexes of traditional, in-kind,
   indirect, and total rent seeking. All measures of rent seeking described
   in this paper have been made publicly available.},

Abstract = {This article focusses on ongoing discussions about the place of the
   Spanish Civil War (1936-39) and the Franco dictatorship (1939-75) in
   Spain's democracy. Following the suspension of Judge Baltasar Garzon by
   the Spanish Supreme Court in 2010, who had indicted General Francisco
   Franco (1892-1975) and thirty-four accomplices under international law
   for committing crimes against humanity, a debate arose between leading
   intellectuals in Spain about the growing international influence on
   Spain's war past. This debate revealed that a group of influential
   left-wing intellectuals attempted to curb the social and political
   influence of the citizens' memory movements. The author observes how
   this happened by applying three strategies: the foreign strategy, the
   nationalistic-ethical strategy, and the saturation strategy. He
   concludes that the growing international pressure on Spain's handling of
   the Civil War and dictatorship led to a ``Spanification{''} of the
   ``culture of the transicion{''} as a national memory, causing the memory
   movements to lose momentum and curbing the international influence on
   Spain's handling of its dictatorial past.},

Abstract = {This study investigates individual auditors' attitudes toward various
   corrupt behaviors in Palestine, an underexplored context. We examine the
   perception and determinants of auditors toward corruption and introduce
   the link between gender, job position, exposure to other cultures, age,
   and level of education as factors affecting attitudes toward corruption
   perception. Our findings reveal that auditors' perception of corruption
   differs across corrupt behaviors. In most surveyed behaviors, age is
   negatively associated with acceptance of corruption, and female auditors
   exhibit a higher attitude toward accepting corruption across various
   forms. Additionally, the auditor's position and outside education
   significantly impact their attitude toward accepting corruption. Our
   work fills an existing literature gap and provides valuable information
   for targeted regulators and professional bodies aiming to reduce
   corruption.},

Abstract = {In 2017, The Seasteading Institute (TSI) signed a Memorandum of
   Understanding with the Government of French Polynesia to begin the
   process of constructing an oceangoing semi-autonomous settlement. The
   Floating Island Project is a spatial and technological fix for the
   perceived failures of governance by contemporary states and territories
   justified by claiming that seasteading could offer solutions for coastal
   and island states facing the deleterious consequences of climate change.
   TSI's experiments in governance are not just experiments in the
   management of populations - they are efforts to perpetuate capitalist
   accumulation regimes. Using Marxist rhetorical analysis to understand
   how TSI, Blue Frontiers and the government of French Polynesia attempted
   to sell seasteading in documents and news articles, social media posts,
   including other literature on seasteading, the human and more-than-human
   geographies of the ocean, geographies of volume, and critical literature
   on the `green' and `blue' economies, allows us to examine how TSI, its
   spinoff organization Blue Frontiers, and French Polynesia's government
   sought to secure sustainable economic development in French Polynesia
   and political and economic autonomy for the seastead through controlling
   oceanic space.},

Title = {Non-random selection into entrepreneurship in the realm of government

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {For the past few decades, the extant literature on corruption has
   primarily relied on firm-level survey measures - for example, those from
   the World Bank - to explore the relevant empirical determinants of this
   illegal practice. However, these studies have potentially overlooked an
   underlying econometric problem - namely, non-random selection into
   entrepreneurship - that may bias all the estimated determinants to date
   if ignored in the analysis. Here, I assess this possibility by applying
   the traditional Heckman (1979) correction procedure in a novel way:
   using two different samples. I use my proposed solution in the context
   of government decentralization and firm-level corruption as a plausible
   application. Specifically, I revisit the question of the causal impact
   of government decentralization on firm-level corruption when the
   underlying sample selection issue is addressed. Results are worth
   noting. I find reasonable evidence of selection bias. On controlling for
   this, fiscal decentralization substantially decreases firm-level
   bribery, in general. This finding is in contradiction to the results
   reported by naive estimation strategies where the sample selection issue
   is completely ignored.},

   from a randomised survey experiment},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Why do (some) ordinary citizens support tax cuts for the rich? We test
   four prominent explanations - unenlightened self-interest, fairness
   considerations, prospect of upward mobility, and trickle-down beliefs -
   using a randomised, online information provision experiment, embedded in
   a representative survey of around 3000 US Americans. The results show
   that preferences for taxing the rich are fundamentally affected by
   information that shifts citizens' core fairness beliefs, as well as
   information on the past trajectory of top tax rates. In contrast, we
   find no evidence in support of the unenlightened self-interest or
   prospect of upward mobility explanations. Overall, our results align
   with theories of tax policy preferences that emphasise the importance of

Abstract = {Environmental sustainability, social engagement and robust governance
   gained growing attention from consumers and investors alike, leading to
   what we call `ESG finance'. ESG criteria are now shaping the behaviour
   and choices of enterprises, investors and consumers. Indeed laudable,
   the increased importance of ESG finance could raise concerns about the
   robustness underneath this new set of financial products. Moreover, the
   reliability of ESG-related data and information shared by companies may
   also be challenged due to the ability of those indicators to shape the
   public profile of companies and their attractiveness for investors. A
   new breed of ESG rankings and ratings is widening the metrics that
   consumers and investors use to make informed decisions about their
   consumption and investment. Yet, such rankings and ratings hinge on the
   individual disclosure approaches of the interested companies. This
   article wishes to complement available data and information about
   specific emissions data released by companies with the ESG disclosure
   levels, in particular relating to the ``environment{''} dimension. Based
   on these disclosure levels, the authors build a new metric with the
   purpose of reducing asymmetric information and promoting more
   responsible investment. Starting from ESG-related data and publicly
   available information, a new disclosure-adjusted pollution index
   (namely, the GHG Scope-1 DAdj index) is developed. The second part of
   the article puts forward an empirical analysis on the basis of this new
   index, suggesting that the rush to ESG finance could be poised to
   generate leeway for new types of asymmetries and possible distortions in
   investment decision-making, also providing grounds for potentially
   reckless speculative attitudes, especially in the domain of product
   development of financial instruments that may generate new forms of risk
   for investors. Using the GHG Scope-1 DAdj index makes a few companies
   less environmentally friendly and interesting for investors who are
   seeking responsible and sustainable investment options. The innovative
   index and the empirical analysis lead the authors to suggest to ``split
   the domains of ESG{''} to better gauge the relation between impact and
   compliance costs for companies as the individual components of
   environment, social engagement and governance are considered separately.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the successes and failures of Australian drought
   and water policy reforms. By analysing the influence of the ideas
   central to neoliberal economics and countrymindedness on the development
   and implementation of the National Drought Policy and the Murray Darling
   Basin Plan, we illustrate that drought and water policy reforms in
   Australia can be explained in the context of Karl Polanyi's double
   movement theory. We demonstrate that founding Australia's agricultural
   policy on economic assumptions is unlikely to be well-received in a
   nation that exhibits widespread sympathy for the plight of agricultural
   producers. As such, we postulate that neoliberal agricultural policies
   that ignore the relevant social and historical context will be unpopular
   and vulnerable to a countermovement that undermines the intent and
   hinders the implementation of the policy.},

Abstract = {Anchored in feminist theory, this article examines the relationship
   between mothers and their sons serving in Israel Defense Forces. A
   review of the feminist literature reveals that the military is one of
   the main sources of gender inequality and reproduction of traditional
   gender roles. The military plays a pivotal role in male socialization
   and encourages soldiers to distance themselves both physically and
   psychologically from their mothers and deny any feminine traits that may
   be attributed to them. Yet this qualitative study, which is based on 28
   interviews with mothers and sons, reveals a more complex picture.
   Although the military does serve as a gatekeeper that distances mothers
   and reinforces hypermasculinized culture, the participants depict the
   mothers' active involvement in the daily life of their soldier sons
   without any sense of inferiority in confronting the military apparatus.
   The mothers assume the role of psychologists, save the sons from
   entanglement with their direct commanders, and even organize their sons'
   service route. The extension of maternal practices into the military
   realm blurs the binary conceptualization of ``men in arms and women at
   home{''} and sheds more light on contemporary changes that have taken
   place in military-family relations in Israel.},

Title = {`Battleship at the port of Europe': Italy's closed-port policy and its
   legitimizing narratives},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {104},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {From March 2018 to August 2019, during Matteo Salvini's mandate as
   Minister of the Interior, Italy implemented the so-called `closed-port
   policy', the closure of Italy's ports to migrant-rescue ships. This
   policy was initially pursued by Salvini's direct will through circulars
   before being justified ex-post by a legislative act. This paper analyses
   the lively parliamentary debates around rescue at sea in order to
   illustrate the majority's discursive rationales in support of the
   closed-port policy and its transformation into law. Theoretically, this
   work adopts a multidisciplinary perspective which combines the works on
   critique and justification (Boltanski, The ` venot 2006; Boltanski,
   2011) with those on legitimacy (Schulze, 2015) to speak to the political
   geography debate concerning border and migration regimes. These
   literatures enable the paper to innovatively approach the crucial role
   of parliaments as conflictual arenas which require governing majorities
   to enact specific legitimation strategies. By adopting this perspective,
   this work sheds light on the disputed rationale of migration policies
   while exploring how legitimation practices worked within the Italian
   Parliament. My argument unfolds in three main stages: first, the article
   examines the genealogy of the closed-port policy; second, it explores
   the legitimation strategies put in place by the majority in order to
   justify its policy and law; and last, it looks at how specific
   geographical imaginaries underpin the main narratives constructed
   through these different legitimation strategies.},

Abstract = {This introduction to the special section focuses on the geopolitical
   relevance of tourism in the Indo-Pacific region. We first review the
   literature on everyday geopolitics, or Popular Geopolitics 2.0,
   elaborating the trend of attention to tourism activities in political
   geography. We then turn to tourism studies and find the divergence and
   convergence between these literatures. Finally, we argue that a focus on
   the Indo-Pacific offers new points of purchase for critical scholars
   reassessing the geopolitics of tourism. This introduction sets a scene
   for the other articles in this special section, calling for a
   re-thinking of the links between tourism and geopolitics from a more
   inclusive perspective that goes beyond Euro(American)centrism.},

Abstract = {Monique Deveaux's Poverty, Solidarity, and Poor-Led Social Movements
   makes a timely, compelling, and important intervention in the
   philosophical literature on poverty and global justice, and improves our
   understanding of the nature and extent of responsibilities of variously
   situated agents towards the poor. Deveaux's focus on poor-led social
   movements emphasizes that effective poverty reduction requires building
   up the collective capacities of the poor to engage in joint collective
   action to oppose and dismantle unjust structures. This approach
   politicizes poverty and provides a powerful refutation of some previous
   approaches that primarily formulated responses to global poverty to
   consist in mere charity to lighten the poor's deprivations, or top-down
   solutions imposed by technocrats and other development experts. Deveaux
   then extends the concept of solidarity to characterize the political
   responsibility of the nonpoor, which consists of acting in political
   solidarity with poor-led organizations and movements. It is this latter
   move to extend the concept of solidarity to characterize poor-nonpoor
   cooperative activities that I question in this commentary. When the
   concept of solidarity, understood as identification-based joint action,
   is stretched to encompass cooperation between all those who may act
   together to resist, oppose, and dismantle the structures of domination
   and oppression that constitute poverty, there is the danger of obscuring
   the alienation and oppositional social positions that attend conditions
   of structural injustice. To acknowledge the limits and dilemmas of
   solidarity practices between the poor and nonpoor is perhaps a sober
   reminder of one of the major costs of living in conditions of structural
   injustice.},

Abstract = {After the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, social media become the
   major contested field for both sides. Social bots are widely involved in
   the Russia-Ukraine war discussion as communication actors. However, how
   social bots build the war agenda has not been well answered. This study
   explores the role of social bots through time series analysis and
   Structural Topic Model. The study finds that at the aggregate level
   there is a two-way agenda-setting between social bots and human
   accounts, and at the secondary level, social bots show different or even
   opposite agenda-setting effects in national/regional discussion. In
   addition, we find that social bots exhibit multiple positions in the
   conversation, reflecting the complexity of the manipulators behind them.
   This multiplicity of positions reveals that the role played by social
   bots is still based on the opposition of one side to the other, and the
   end result may exacerbate the conflict of online public opinion.},

Journal = {TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Using referendums to settle the question of sovereignty might look
   intuitive, but self-determination is not always accompanied by a
   referendum empirically, and the existing literature largely points to
   politicians' instrumental motivations to hold self-determination
   referendums. Referendums are also notorious for their zero-sum nature.
   What exactly then makes referendums essential for self-determination? By
   analysing East Timor's 1999 referendum, this article uncovers three
   reasons referendums should be held to accurately ascertain the
   population's wishes in non-democratic contexts: the fear that
   representatives might be bribed or threatened in a hypothetical indirect
   vote; the simple nature of referendums; and the lack of democratic
   tradition.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the methodological writings of James M.
   Buchanan and relate them to those of the moral philosopher, Martin
   Buber. We analyze Buchanan's views, both explicit and implicit in his
   writings, on the morality of the exchange relationship between
   individuals. We imagine a hypothetical meeting between Buchanan and
   Buber and conclude that Buchanan would have agreed with Buber's
   dialogical philosophy of human interaction as a foundation for his
   catallactic point of view.},

Title = {Troubling the politics of island relation: The Comoros in between, on
   the edge, and as microcosm},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {101},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Relational approaches are gaining strength in political geography and
   the field of island studies but are often insufficiently reflexive of
   their own relational posi-tioning. This paper uses the case of the
   Comoro Islands to explore how scholars render places comprehensible and
   useful by setting them in general discourses of relation. In this case,
   relational approaches frequently construct Comoro as an island
   in-between, island on the edge, or island as microcosm. Based on a
   reading of English-language scholarship concerning the Comoros, the
   paper narrates the history of the Comoro Islands from these various
   relational perspectives before analysing their limitations in terms of
   serving islanders' needs and representing islanders' experiences. The
   paper ultimately argues for the necessity of scholars to acknowledge
   that the relational narratives they construct are necessarily partial,
   oversimplified, and politicised representations of a much more complex
   geographic reality.},

Abstract = {This study provides a comparative analysis of collective meaning-making
   processes by unpacking activists' discourses (within and in relation to
   their polis) and online (on Facebook) during the financial,
   post-financial, and COVID-19 crises in Greece (2011-2021). By analyzing
   71 semi-structured interviews with activists and 14,475 Facebook posts,
   we first evaluate actors' identity progression, then identify the
   differences and commonalities between activists' discourses attached to
   their collectivity, by investigating the role of Facebook therein. Our
   findings indicate that activists' efforts to delimitate their identity,
   primarily around the detachment of citizens from their polis, paved the
   way for the (re)invention of the meaning-making practices of each
   collectivity. Thus, the formation of an overarching identity of the
   citizen as an activist-subject unites subjects over power struggles,
   despite their political differences.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to present the analysis of the job
   stability of provisional workers in Colombia???s public sector in
   Colombia, for which a qualitative methodology based on a documentary
   review of the regulations and theoretical aspects related to the terms
   was used under the implementation of a paradigm of a
   historical-hermeneutical nature, with a descriptive and analytical type
   of investigation in which the positions of the Council of State and the
   Constitutional Court are considered. Results indicate that work is a
   fundamental right protected by international legal provisions, where
   provisionality has been regulated since 2004 by Law 909, which alludes
   to charges that imply temporary separation. There is a fundamental
   jurisprudential dispute between the Council of State and the
   Constitutional Court regarding the dismissal reasons of those who are
   provisional; although it is stated that a public servant declared
   non-subsistent through an administrative act that has grounds can be
   dismissed, the guarantee of their rights does not really issue a clear
   position especially on the part of the Council of State. For its part,
   the Constitutional Court reiterates the importance of restoring the
   rights of public servants appointed provisionally.},

Title = {The Swedish Brigade: From National Romantic Heroes to European
   Counter-Revolutionaries?},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the character and development of the Swedish
   Brigade, a small military volunteer unit in the Finnish Civil War of
   1918, in the context of the European counter-revolution. Volunteers in
   the various civil wars following the Russian Revolution have been
   studied extensively before, but have largely focused on countries that
   participated in the First World War. This case study of the `White'
   Swedish Brigade aims to highlight the importance of volunteers from
   neutral countries, and their specific role in the transnational
   counter-revolutionary movement. The Brigade was an ostensibly
   politically neutral unit, with a socially heterogeneous make-up. Heavily
   supported by the Swedish right-wing media, it was widely romanticized as
   a heroic effort to restore Sweden's honour by supporting the Finnish
   fight against the old Russian enemy, and defending the former Swedish
   province as a bulwark of Swedish culture, law and order against
   barbarism. While its political culture was steeped in a romanticized
   Finno-Swedish history and culture, shared by many of the volunteers, the
   brigadiers were quickly confronted by the realities of poor equipment
   and organization, political division, and above all an exceptionally
   brutal civil war and the morally degrading violence it entailed. Brigade
   archive documents and memoirs show that this quickly changed the
   character of the actual volunteer unit to contrast heavily with the
   right-wing press's romantic imagination. Additionally, through contacts
   with the Finnish and German military, and in the face of a Left Swedish
   critique of the Brigade as reactionary butchers, many of the volunteers
   reconceptualized their role in the civil war, not as one of heroic and
   historical significance for Sweden, but as part of a vicious European
   struggle against Bolshevism. This seems to some extent confirmed by
   their post-war history, which raises interesting questions about these
   volunteers' roles among the new Right of interwar Europe.},

Title = {A BARCELONA STAGE DESIGNER IN COLONIAL INDIA: CATALAN TRAVELLERS,
   TRANSIMPERIAL MOBILITY AND THE BRITISH RAJ IN SPAIN, C. 1908},
Journal = {HISTORIA Y POLITICA},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN-JUN},
Abstract = {In 1908, two travellers from Barcelona embarked on a year-long world
   tour. Stage designer Oleguer Junyent and textile heir Maria Recolons'
   trip was extraordi-nary by the standards of the metropolitan Spain of
   their time. A great portion of their tour took them across the British
   empire, with India emerging as one of their most significant stops. The
   article examines three major macrohistorical issues that arise from
   their experience in colonial India: the consolidation of a global
   tourism industry, the making of metropolitan understandings of European
   imperialism and anti-imperialism, and the production of colonial
   knowledge for metropolitan consumption. The article explores these
   issues through microhistory, with an in-depth examination of the written
   and visual sources produced around the tour -a travelogue, letters,
   articles, drawings, paintings and photographs. Through these outputs,
   Recolons and Junyent presented a vision of an all-powerful yet flawed
   British empire in colonial India. The article argues that the tour
   produced a rare and original body of knowledge on colonial India in
   early-twentieth-century Spain, where it was eagerly consumed by
   metropolitan audiences.},

Abstract = {This article investigates a campaign by the French Catholic Church to
   bring men to Mass in the first decades of the Third Republic. Historians
   have long noted the gender imbalance in religious practice in France in
   this era. Less attention has been paid, however, to the mobilization on
   the part of leading clerics to tackle the problem of male religious
   indifference. This response took the form of a range of initiatives -
   pastoral visits, male-only Masses, study circles, missions and more. But
   the Church went further in order to overcome the obstacle of the
   `respect humain', the fear of public mockery that kept so many men away
   from the Church doors. In order to inspire courage in laymen, it
   published narratives of Catholic heroes. Another means of encouraging
   piety was an association dedicated to the Sacred Heart which organized a
   male-only pilgrimage to Lourdes. An understanding of this campaign to
   evangelize men throws light on a neglected area of religious history,
   the relationship between religion and masculinity. It also offers a new
   dimension on the War of Two Frances which reached such a peak of
   intensity in the decade after 1900.},

Abstract = {This article examines the nationalist rhetoric of Biden and Trump in the
   2020 presidential election, focusing on how the candidates represented,
   and contested, the meaning of American national identity. To do so, we
   construct a novel analytical framework to undertake a contextual content
   analysis of Biden and Trump's campaign tweets (n = 4,321). We
   demonstrate that the meaning of national identity was a key source of
   contestation in the election, and that the parameters of this
   contestation closely tracked a longstanding cleavage in American
   political culture between civic and ethnic nationalist traditions. Biden
   largely drew upon the civic nationalist tradition to defend a conception
   of American national identity that is grounded in liberal myths and
   symbols. By contrast, Trump largely drew upon the ethnic nationalist
   tradition to defend a conception of American national identity that is
   grounded in white American myths and symbols. Critically, both
   candidates used these opposing nationalist traditions to frame each
   other as a grave threat to the nation's ``true{''} identity and,
   ultimately, as un-American. This ``nationalist polarization{''} of
   presidential politics is a troubling development for the future of
   American democracy.},

Title = {Respiratory negotiations: The elemental biopolitics of medical masks in
   times of atmospheric crisis},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Existing at the intersection of health, politics and affect, medical
   masks evoke lines and flights of contentions and resistance in everyday
   lives. They are instruments of negotiation that mediate across bodies,
   breaths, airs, faces, and lived experiences. Carrying a history that
   goes back only a few hundred years, masks gained unprecedented traction
   during the COVID-19 outbreak. The outbreaks of social anxiety,
   frustration, and anger following mask mandates live beyond immediate
   concerns of efficacy. In moment of atmospheric crisis masks articulate
   and give expression to racial, class, environmental, political, and
   cultural divisions. In this article, we study the development of medical
   masks through an exploration of three episodes of atmospheric crisis,
   starting with their earliest recorded appearance at the time of the
   first edition of Hobbes' Leviathan to the present day. Using an
   elemental mode of thinking, which foregrounds embodied entanglement with
   air, we explore the ways in which masks speak to biopolitical concerns.
   The episodes we draw from constitute and represent different mask
   regimes, both in their materiality and design, mirroring historical
   change as well as evolving biopolitical orders. We show that medical
   masks are not simply filtering devices against exposure from respiratory
   viruses; instead, they are biopolitical techniques through which regimes
   of inclusion and exclusion are enacted. By focusing on masks, we make a
   broader argument that work on biopolitics could gain insight from
   elemental thinking.},

Abstract = {A long line of research has established that Americans who subscribe to
   Christian nationalism have a preference for those inside their group and
   animosity toward those outside their group. These beliefs may impede the
   equal application of the rule of law, a link that has been suggested but
   not formally tested. Utilizing experimental data from a survey conducted
   in fall 2021, we assess the equal application of the rule of law for in
   and outgroup members conditional on Christian nationalism and belief in
   Christian persecution. We suggest that ingroup love may move distinctly
   from outgroup hate. Our results suggest that Christian nationalists have
   a preference for the ingroup, but do not automatically denigrate
   outgroups. However, belief in Christian persecution drives animosity
   toward outgroups, while not elevating the ingroup. Christian nationalist
   outgroup hatred must be triggered by threat, which has been the project
   of movement and party elites.},

Abstract = {The Spanish far-right party Vox has undergone, together with other
   similar forces in Europe, an ``ecological turn{''}. To analyze this
   case, the article starts from the premise of the need to understand
   better the far-right parties' discursive mechanisms and their engagement
   with environmental issues. Theoretically, we criticize the ideological
   and ontological approaches to the current wave of national populism;
   instead, we argue that the dominant form of authoritarian national
   populism is more usefully analyzed in terms of embodied narratives,
   metaphorical imagination, mythmaking, and affective intensification.
   Empirically, using discourse analysis (Laclau, 2005) and drawing on the
   affective turn in political ecology, first, we argue that Vox's
   eco-narrative is interpretable as a combination of national populism and
   biopolitical imaginary pitting a ``culture of death{''} against the
   ``culture of life{''}. Vox's key rhetorical mechanisms, we intimate, are
   hyperbolical metaphorization and rhetorical inversion, have an
   intensifying effect at two interconnected levels: fear and indignation
   concerning the degeneration of Spain, pride and hope regarding Vox's and
   its male hero's promise of salvation and the Reconquista of the Spanish
   way of life. Second, by looking into key policy areas (energy and
   water), we argue that Vox has systematically chosen the former in
   conflicts between capitalist interests and environmental issues.},

Abstract = {1Internet shutdowns have become a popular instrument for repressive
   regimes to silence dissent in a digitized world. While authorities seek
   to suppress opponents by imposing Internet outages, we know little about
   how the public reacts to such incisive measures. The regime might face
   anger and resentment from the public as a response to Internet
   deprivation. Why do regimes still use Internet shutdowns when they do
   not only face economic but also societal losses? In this paper, I argue
   that Internet shutdowns lower the public's evaluation of the political
   leadership as citizens blame the government for the service outages. For
   the analysis, I combine fine-grained data on Internet outages with
   survey data from the Afrobarometer and apply an ``unexpected event
   during survey design.{''} Results show that citizens do not hold the
   government accountable for Internet disruptions, thus making Internet
   shutdowns a powerful tool for autocrats to silent dissent digitally.},

Abstract = {Over the past 40 years a tradition of Marx interpretation has built up
   around a single passage concerning Black slavery in an 1853 letter from
   Marx to Engels, in order to demonstrate that Marx's support for
   emancipation was conditional on the level of `civilisation' attained by
   Black slaves. I will argue that this interpretation, which attempts to
   prove Marx's racist defence of slavery, is overdetermined by an
   inattention to historical context and a hypersensitivity to Marx's
   nineteenth-century epithets. This is important because the alleged
   anti-Black racism of Marx and the place Black workers occupy in his
   historical-materialist vision of class struggle are of the utmost
   significance for properly conceptualising the relationship between
   Marxism and Black liberation.},

Abstract = {Using a sample of Chinese A-share listed firms over the period
   2010-2017, this paper investigates the impact of local donation culture
   on corporate tax avoidance. We find that firms located in areas with a
   strong local donation culture are less engaged in tax avoidance. The
   results remain robust under a variety of robustness tests. Furthermore,
   we find that this relationship is driven by enhancing the moral identity
   of managers. In further analysis, we also explore the role of media
   attention, chief executive officer's (CEO's) childhood famine
   experience, and CEO duality in the relationship between local donation
   culture and corporate tax avoidance. This study enriches the existing
   literature on culture and firms' behaviors, and the conclusion of this
   paper has significant policy implications for governing corporate tax
   avoidance.},

Abstract = {At a subnational level, studies typically find that embedded or local
   leaders are better at providing public goods relative to leaders
   appointed from other areas. This paper tests whether this finding holds
   in the context of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Specifically, it
   examines the impact of a cadre transfer policy whereby the central
   government assigns (nonresident) officials to provincial leadership
   positions rather than them being elected locally. Using data covering
   the period 2005-2017, changes in the development of provinces led by
   local (embedded) leaders versus nonlocal leaders are compared.
   Provincial development is measured using the incidence of headcount
   poverty as well as ``vegetation{''} and ``build-up{''} indices
   constructed using satellite data. Using fixed-effects modeling, findings
   suggest that improved provincial development is associated with nonlocal
   leaders. This finding is in contrast to those of existing studies
   including those examining embeddedness in other authoritarian states.},

Abstract = {The conventional wisdom guiding pandemic policy is that the complexity
   of externalities justifies a centralized government response and
   suppression of economic freedom. We argue that public choice offers a
   compelling argument that the opposite is the case: complex global public
   health crises justify polycentric responses and protection of economic
   freedom. We show this by considering three distinct themes in the public
   choice analysis of pandemics. The first theme is that government
   failures are ubiquitous during pandemics. The second is that polycentric
   governance institutions are more appropriate than monocentric ones to
   address pandemic externalities. The third is that while economic freedom
   may make controlling pandemics more challenging in the short run, in the
   longer run, economic freedom is what ultimately contributes to a more
   robust response to pandemics through technological innovation and wealth
   creation. Together, public choice provides what we call a liberal
   political economy of pandemics in which polycentricity and economic
   freedom are appropriate institutions to deal with complex, novel
   externalities.},

Abstract = {States oversee most regulation of oil and gas extraction in the United
   States. When relying on regulation, state oil and gas agencies may be
   susceptible to capture by firms developing resources. This may be
   particularly problematic during booms of resource development when
   information asymmetries are largest and existing regulations risk
   becoming obsolete. If regulators are captured, they may take actions
   that serve concentrated private interests in preference to the public
   interests they are charged with upholding. I develop and test hypotheses
   that oil and gas regulators are captured. The primary empirical tests
   use data from state regulation in North Dakota to prevent resource waste
   by restricting natural gas flaring. The empirical results are consistent
   with the theory of regulatory capture, providing empirical evidence that
   captured regulators serve well-organized specific interests in
   preference to diffuse general interests. These results provide novel
   granular evidence of the mechanisms for regulatory capture by showing
   differences in regulatory responses across firms and locations. This
   detailed evidence has implications for the design of regulations and
   reliance on regulatory interventions to protect the public interest.},

Title = {Italian Physicians at the Habsburg Courts (1550-1620): Hiring Processes,
   Professional Networks and Integration into the Court Space},

Abstract = {In the second half of the sixteenth century, many Italian learned
   physicians moved to the Habsburg courts, entering the service of the
   imperial family. This paper traces their professional itineraries,
   identifying the decisive socio-cultural factors which influenced their
   hiring at court. Most of the Italian physicians achieved significant
   advancements, enhanced their social status, and obtained economic
   privileges. In this context, they proved their professional versatility,
   carrying out non-medical tasks as well as providing medical services.
   However, pursuing a long-term career depended not only on a large
   spectrum of unpredictable factors - the Emperor's will, the economic
   means at his disposal, and the need of the imperial family for health
   assistance - but also on the physicians' ability to earn the Emperor's
   favour and that of his entourage. Based on a comparison between Italian
   and non-Italian court and imperial physicians in terms of recruitment,
   tasks, remuneration, privileges, and duration of career, this article
   also tries to understand to what extent Italian physicians integrated
   into the Habsburg courts and what legacy they left there.},

Abstract = {Intellectual property (IP) can internalize positive externalities
   associated with the creation and discovery of ideas, thereby increasing
   investment in efforts to create and discover ideas. However, IP law also
   causes negative externalities. Strict IP rights raise the transaction
   costs associated with consuming and building on existing ideas. This
   causes a tragedy of the anticommons, in which valuable resources are
   underused and underdeveloped. By disincentivizing creative projects that
   build on existing ideas, IP protection, even if it increases original
   innovation, can inadvertently reduce the rate of iterative innovation.
   The net effect of IP law on innovation and welfare depends on the
   relative magnitude of these positive and negative externalities. We
   argue that the current regime probably suffers from excessive, and
   excessively rigid, IP protection. This motivates the search for
   institutional alternatives and complements. We suggest that a
   monocentric IP rights regime may not be the only, or the most efficient,
   way to internalize the positive externalities of innovation. The
   knowledge economy supports the emergence of diverse, polycentric forms
   of bottom-up self-governance, both market and community led, that entail
   the citizen coproduction of the norms and practices of intellectual
   creation and discovery.},

Abstract = {This paper explores whether the assessment of local government officials
   affects firm participation in targeted poverty alleviation. Using a
   sample of Chinese A-share listed companies in the Midwest from 2016 to
   2019, the results show that the greater the importance of officials'
   poverty alleviation assessment, the higher the participation of firms in
   precise poverty alleviation. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) contribute
   more to the reduction of destitution than private enterprises. We
   further find that local SOEs' participation in precision poverty
   alleviation enhances the likelihood of executive promotion, while
   private enterprises' participation in precision poverty alleviation
   increases government subsidies and reduces the cost of debt financing.
   These findings imply that the evaluation mechanisms of Chinese officials
   can effectively promote enterprises fulfilling social responsibilities.},

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between welfare state or social
   expenditure composition and health human capital in 37 OECD countries
   spanning 1980-2018. Our findings confirm that public health spending has
   a positive effect on health capital formation. Dissecting social
   expenditure according to other nine social spending categories reveals a
   positive influence for old age pensions and unemployment benefits. The
   results for the remaining social programs vary with the health capital
   proxy and estimation method used. It thus appears that more
   comprehensive and universal social programs, possibly by guaranteeing
   the necessary income, do a better job in improving health human capital.},

Title = {A spatial analysis of local corruption on foreign direct investment:
   Evidence from Chinese cities},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper examines local corruption's direct and spillover effects on
   city-level foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in China. The empirical
   analysis is based on a new dataset on local corruption at various
   disaggregation levels. Using a convex combination structure in spatial
   econometrics, we decompose the overall effect of local corruption into a
   direct and an indirect effect and derive six novel empirical results.
   First, corruption has an economically and statistically significant
   negative effect on home city FDI inflows (the direct effect). Second,
   home city corruption has a significant and positive spillover effect on
   FDI inflows to competing cities (the indirect effect). Third, the direct
   effect is 16 times greater than the indirect effect, which leads to an
   overall negative effect of corruption on FDI. Fourth, the effect of
   corruption on FDI is heterogeneous across different FDI quantiles with
   the most pronounced effects being present in the lowest 80th percentile.
   Fifth, FDI inflows to the inland and lower-income cities are more
   sensitive to local corruption. Sixth, the indirect effect is more
   pronounced for cities within the same province.},

Title = {Do strong oligopolies reverse Green Paradox effects?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In a competitive market renewable energy subsidies or postponement of
   carbon pricing tend to boost emissions and global warming in the short
   run. This so-called Green Paradox effect may be reversed if fossil-fuel
   firms operate under an oligopoly and the number of members is low
   enough. A reversal of the Green Paradox always occurs under a fossil
   fuel monopoly. If the extraction costs of fossil fuel depend on the
   aggregate remaining stock of reserves, Green Paradox effects vanish if
   the number of oligopolists becomes infinitely large. For an intermediate
   number of members, a Green Paradox occurs. The strength of the Green
   Paradox effect depends non-monotonically on the number of oligopolists.
   We also show that a Green Paradox is more likely for higher slopes of
   the demand curve, higher sensitivities of unit extraction costs with
   respect to remaining reserves, and lower interest rates.},

Abstract = {Many studies have argued that watchdog journalism cannot flourish under
   authoritarianism. However, the effect of the democratization of
   previously authoritarian regimes on watchdog journalism is still poorly
   understood. This article aims to fill this knowledge gap by using
   Kompas, Indonesia's oldest daily newspaper, as a case study. Drawing on
   four years of ethnographic fieldwork (2013-2017) within Kompas's
   newsroom and one year of archival review (2020-2021), this study shows
   that the newspaper did not truly function as a watchdog. Instead, it
   developed a specific style that we conceptualize as ``polite{''}
   watchdog journalism, that is, monitoring the wrongdoing of those in
   power in such a manner that does not hurt the feelings of those in
   power. This style of journalism was developed in response to the
   cultural and political-economic forces that intersected in and shaped
   its newsroom. Kompas developed close relationships with authoritarian
   power holders, thereby avoiding the persistent threat of bans and
   securing the economic advantages of their close ties with those in
   power. After the regime change, polite journalism continued to be
   practiced, both to maintain its political leverage and to preserve its
   economic advantage in the post-authoritarian era.},

Abstract = {An emerging line of research has drawn attention to the significance of
   national identity in shaping digital diplomatic practices. In this
   study, we look at the reciprocal construction of national identity on
   Twitter by corresponding foreign missions. Specifically, we examine one
   year of Twitter posts from the South Korean missions in Japan and the
   United States as well as the reciprocal missions of Japan and the United
   States in South Korea. Our study indicates that tweets from the Korea-US
   dyad reproduce the two nations as allies, even as the United States is
   constructed as the ``big brother{''} to Korea's ``little brother,{''}
   while the Korea-Japan dyad enacts and reinforces an adversarial
   relationship. Tweets from all four embassies reflect deep-rooted
   national aspirations: Japan's hope to be accepted as morally superior to
   Korea, the US interest in maintaining its position as a global leader,
   and Korea's desire for international ascendance through economic and
   cultural export. We find that reciprocal identity construction is most
   evident in the text of the tweets but not so much in the use of
   Twitter's visual and interactional features. Going beyond reciprocity,
   our analysis sheds light on to how tweeting practices reproduce
   asymmetries of power in the international order.},

Title = {Refugee-Ness and Exploitation: A Feminist Geography of Shitty Jobs},
Journal = {GEOPOLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 12},
Abstract = {Few people who participate in refugee resettlement programs expect
   long-term employment in shitty jobs, yet this is what many find in the
   United States. For Shamimah, Azizah, and Nila, three Burmese Muslim
   women who were resettled in Aurora, Colorado from Malaysia, the local
   workplaces where they find themselves are crucibles of oppression,
   albeit ones that are distinctively global. This essay is concerned with
   theorizing the relationship between global topographies of displacement
   (Katz 2001), resettlement programs, and capitalism through a study of
   two Colorado workplaces that affix refugee-ness to people through
   specific forms of worker discipline and subjectivization. While a
   significant subset of feminist scholarship on refugees and re/settlement
   rightfully focuses on state institutions, the workplace remains
   understudied. I argue that affixing refugee-ness to women is both an
   expression of racial capitalism and a process of commodification.
   Burmese women's experiences clarify how refugee-ness works both as
   otherness and a discrete identity to dehumanize immigrants, smooth
   processes of exploitation, and sow division among similarly racialized
   immigrants. Though employers may foreclose many forms of immigrant
   solidarity, the women's forceful rebukes of workplace abuse and their
   community activities outside work likewise underscore their toughness,
   creativity, and the enduring significance of social reproduction spaces
   for supporting solidarities between precarious workers.},

Abstract = {The rise of social media as a source of science and health information
   has brought challenges to informed citizenship and social trust due to
   the spread of misinformation, particularly anti-vaccination messages
   that incite hatred and discourage necessary health precautions. These
   messages often employ emotional appeals and identity cues. However,
   scholarship examining emotional appeals and identity cues in anti-vax
   messages is still at the nascent stage. Furthermore, most literature on
   emotions and identities on social media has focused on text-based
   platforms, despite the increasing popularity of interactive, multimodal
   platforms. To address these gaps, our paper analyzes recent TikTok
   anti-vax videos and incorporates the framework of multimodal frame
   processing, emotion-as-frames model, affective intelligence theory, and
   social identity theory. Our paper uncovers how different message
   modalities affect the impact of emotional narratives and identity cues
   on user engagement. We also investigate sociopolitical identity cues
   beyond partisan identities, expanding the current terrain of political
   communication. Our results demonstrate that audiences engage with
   emotional and identity cues in anti-vax videos differently based on
   distinct message modalities. We also found that identity cues related to
   interpersonal relationships (e.g. parental) and conspiracy groups were
   prevalent, in addition to partisan identity cues. These results offer
   new insights into sociopolitical identities beyond partisanship and
   highlight the importance of considering the multi-modal nature of video
   platforms. Overall, our paper sheds light on the complex relationship
   between emotions, identities, and message modalities on social media and
   provides important implications for addressing misinformation and
   improving science communication on digital platforms.},

Abstract = {BackgroundJudicial reformers have long debated the merits of different
   types of judicial selection methods. ObjectivesWhile many of the debates
   center on how selection methods impact decision making, I argue that
   selection methods may also affect how justices approach opinion writing.
   MethodsUsing opinion data from 1953 to 2014 in 21 states and opinion
   data from 1953 to 2019 in five states, this article investigates whether
   selection methods influence the clarity of the opinions. ResultsThe
   results show that selection methods do not have a substantive impact on
   opinion clarity. What does have an effect on opinion clarity is when
   justices are ideologically distant from their constituents. Opinion
   clarity increases when nonpartisan justices are ideologically distant
   from their constituents, indicating that justices may use written
   opinions to demonstrate support for public opinion on specific issues,
   even if they do not generally vote in line with public opinion. In
   contrast, opinions in states that changed from partisan to nonpartisan
   are less clear, indicating that when a court changes its selection
   method, opinion authors may purposefully obfuscate their views and rely
   on their incumbency advantage to hold on to power. ConclusionThe
   findings suggest that judicial selection methods only influence opinion
   clarity in certain contexts.},

Abstract = {Various polities have imported soldiers to compensate for a lack of
   manpower, to reduce costs, or to avoid the risk of arming potentially
   disloyal citizenry. However, importing soldiery is not without dangers.
   Foreign soldiers may carry with them subversive ideas, continue
   homegrown conflicts in their employer's territory, be unreliable, or,
   worse, revolt. How importers of foreign soldiers might mitigate these
   risks is little studied. This case study reveals the repertoire of
   measures Britain used to mitigate the risks posed by one group of
   imported soldiers-the Dhofaris from Oman's restive southern province who
   served from the late 1950s to 1973 in the British protected Trucial
   States, which became the United Arab Emirates in 1971. It concludes that
   intelligence collection measures were hampered by an inability to
   penetrate the Dhofaris's linguistic and sociocultural world, and that
   threat analysis failed to accurately consider the impact of the conflict
   in their homeland.},

Abstract = {I construct a simple theoretical model that incorporates the role of
   ideas and contested persuasion in processes of institutional change,
   specifically democratization. The model helps reconcile the view that
   extensions of the franchise in Western Europe tended to occur as a
   response to the threat of revolution with the view that these occurred
   based on a change of social values due to the Enlightenment. In
   particular, the model puts forward the argument that institutional
   changes become possible once ideological entrepreneurs -the carriers of
   an alternative worldview- win an ideological contest against the holders
   of traditional ideas so that the rest of society adopts their worldview,
   and a revolutionary threat becomes credible. The model shows that the
   preferences of the ideological entrepreneurs are key. A revolution takes
   place only if they prefer it to a peaceful transition. Also, the model
   predicts that actual revolutions occur only when the probability of them
   being successful is either low or high. Finally, the ideological
   benefits associated with adhering to a specific ideology affect whether
   institutional change is peaceful or not. A strong traditional ideology
   generating large psychological benefits of adhering to the status quo
   makes it more likely that democratization occurs through revolution. On
   the contrary, a strong alternative ideology favoring the extension of
   the franchise makes it more likely that democracy emerges but has an
   ambiguous effect on the likelihood of a revolution.},

Abstract = {Governments are expected to tackle externalities such as pollution,
   epidemics and environmental catastrophes, but whether and how
   governments themselves generate externalities is a question equally
   important for exploring socially beneficial policies and institutional
   reforms. The problem with defining government externalities is that
   governments, through regulation and distribution, inevitably allocate
   costs and benefits asymmetrically due to preference heterogeneity in
   society. This problem also concerns the rules and rights governing
   market transactions, blurring the boundaries between market failure and
   government failure. In this paper, I define government externalities as
   costs passed on us by government actions taken outside a decision-making
   system in which we participate as insiders. Views about what being an
   insider is differ. Some will be content with democratic citizenship in
   majoritarian decision-making processes. Others may subscribe to Buchanan
   and Tullock's liberal and more demanding normative theory based on
   constitutional consent. In either case, I argue, there will be
   externalities generated by clientelism, namely informal deals between
   politicians and special interests for the distribution of benefits that
   occur outside, and in violation of, the formal norms of participation.
   These are complex externalities, infiltrating policymaking and
   distorting institutions governing the operation of markets too. They
   create government failure on the same grounds that some market
   externalities are considered market failure: (a) the costs fall on
   outsiders and (b) negatively affect the terms for the production and
   exchange of goods and services. Government externalities influence both
   governance and markets simultaneously and illustrate the limits of what
   institutional design can constrain or achieve.},

Abstract = {Terrorists attacked the United States diplomatic compound and adjoining
   CIA Annex in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012. Despite repeated
   warnings from officials about the security risks in Tripoli and
   Benghazi, we argue that intelligence, security, and organizational
   deficiencies within the Department of State created vulnerabilities
   contributing to the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador
   Christopher Stephens. Scholarly assessment of these failures has been
   precluded as a consequence of the incident's use in partisan attacks.
   Republicans in Congress used investigations into the incident to damage
   presumed 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton,
   who was then President Obama's secretary of state. Setting aside
   political considerations and examining the failures that led to the
   attack is important to protect diplomatic personnel abroad in the
   future.},

Abstract = {This article studies how and why the policies of the Bulgarian and
   Romanian states towards Muslim/Turkish minorities differed widely from
   each other between 1923 and 1936. Minority policies in Bulgaria shifted
   from tolerance during the Agrarian People's Union government in 1919, to
   assimilation and repression in the 1930s. In contrast, the Romanian
   state tolerated and favourably treated Muslim minorities throughout the
   interwar period. In order to account for this difference, we highlight
   the influence of Turkey's diplomatic relations on Bulgarian and Romanian
   state policies towards minorities and the responses of the latter. While
   Turkish-Bulgarian relations see-sawed, Turkish-Romanian relations
   constantly improved from the 1920s to 1930s. We argue that, whenever
   Turkey's diplomatic relations with Bulgaria and Romania ameliorated,
   Bulgaria's and Romania's minority policies improved. Yet, whenever
   diplomatic relations deteriorated, so did the minority policies.},

Abstract = {The fall from power of Francisco de Cea Bermudez, Ferdinand VII's last
   minister, represented the definitive end of absolutism in Spain, and
   marked the beginning of the process which led to the liberal society, in
   the context of the carlist civil war. This article contends that this
   break-up was imposed to the regent Maria Cristina de Borbon by a strong
   movement within public opinion, channelled by the family and affinity
   networks in the << political class >> of the Monarchy, whose members
   acted moved by a sincere belief that a better representation of the
   Nation was necessary, as much as by their own interests. It also argues
   that there were no specific role played by the military, integrated as
   they were within the functionaries. The part played by Francisco Javier
   Castanos and Pedro Agustin Giron is emphasized.},

Title = {Unraveling State governance in the Chilean Cordillera: Privatization,
   precariousness, and arrhythmia},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {105},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article discusses how communities from the Chilean cordillera
   negotiate their presence and reproduction with the Chilean State. We
   analyze people and animals' mobility through a multisite ethnography,
   which took place between 2021 and 2022. In this context, communities
   seem independent while facing the weak and inconstant State presence.
   However, processes of change concerning extractive economies, decreasing
   State aid, and consequences of climate change complicate the practices
   once thought to be autonomous in the mountain range. The State appears
   to favor certain degrees of independence through arrhythmic governance.
   Such an arrangement allows a fluctuating and unstable relationship that,
   despite the grip of the State, translates into emergent forms of
   autonomy that nonetheless end up being a specific type of precarization.
   In this sense, mountain communities maintain, complicate and, on
   occasion, deepen the relations of dependence towards a State that they
   either ignore or elude. Finally, the intertwined movements of
   neoliberalization, environmental stressors and precarious State
   governance are elements that deepen the production of an arrhythmic
   State movement; which also redistributes agency among actors on the
   terrain.},

Abstract = {This study provides insights on how journalists in the Western Balkans
   conceptualize and practice audience engagement during electoral
   campaigns. Taking a holistic approach, we first explore audience demand
   and news supply of strategic and negative election news on Facebook,
   then turn to news editors to explore what type of audience logic drives
   their reporting. Our data confirm previous findings about audience
   demand for strategic news but contradict the predominance of audience
   negativity bias in the context of Southeast Europe. These findings
   support generic trends in how social media audiences engage with
   political information, but also emphasize the importance of the
   socio-political context as a determinant of audience engagement with
   online news. Interview data identified an alignment between journalists'
   imagined readership preferences with the reality, yet reporting patterns
   on Facebook do not entirely follow engagement trends. Together, these
   findings suggest that journalism culture developed in this region is
   more nuanced than previously defined, while news editors embrace new
   technologies to serve the commercial needs and audience strengthening
   logics in parallel during electoral campaigns.},

Abstract = {Populist leaders are often described as ``strongmen,{''} receiving a
   somewhat two-dimensional Western press coverage that cannot explain
   their local popularity. Based on visual and textual analysis of
   Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Facebook, we argue that he has a
   more complex social media persona. Orban's Facebook shows him as (1) a
   fighter against a variety of enemies, (2) a symbolic condensation of the
   nation, (3) a relatable politician with (4) a gentleness toward children
   and animals, and (5) a strong competence in elite political contexts.
   Orban uses his charismatic authority on Facebook to draw the boundaries
   of the Hungarian nation, presenting himself as the iconic representation
   of ``Hungarian-ness.{''} The building blocks of his image are constantly
   being adapted to the current political situation and to shifts in public
   opinion. The Orban image is, thus, a fluid and pragmatic material with
   only a few core principles and its popularity remains steadfast despite
   the brand's contradictions. Understanding the appeal of Orban's
   self-representation may help us better grasp populist regimes' variation
   and success worldwide.},

   Culture Change},
Journal = {ARMED FORCES \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 11},
Abstract = {While the workforce is becoming increasingly more modernized and
   diverse, masculine norms are prevalent among certain organizations that
   remain male-dominated. Namely, the military is an institution that
   promotes masculine stereotypes and a culture where such stereotypes form
   a normative system of hierarchy. This study, surveying 145 military
   cadets at the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC), found that social
   dominance orientation, or preference for in-group superiority and
   out-group inequality, was associated with higher conformity to masculine
   norms. Moreover, higher levels of social dominance explained the
   relationship between masculine conformity and less acceptance toward
   cultural reforms in the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). These findings
   suggest that achieving true organizational culture change in the
   military involves challenging not only masculine norms but, more
   importantly, the dominant and nonegalitarian attitudes of social
   dominance.},

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, interest in and conversion to Islam among
   non-Muslims in the West has been on the rise. There is a view in the
   scholarly literature that Western converts to Islam are overrepresented
   in regard to politicized interpretations of the religion, commonly
   referred to as political Islam or Islamism, and even militancy or
   jihadism. This article presents the findings of a national survey of
   Muslim Australians. It focuses on views amongst Australian converts to
   Islam concerning political Islam, including views and understandings of
   such concepts as the caliphate, shariah, and jihad, and the relationship
   between Islam and politics, democracy, and conflict. The findings
   suggest that in the Australian context, converts to Islam are not more
   likely, and in some cases less likely, than the broader born-Muslim
   population, to understand and interpret Islam in accordance with
   political Islamist ideology.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We introduce a new methodological approach for studying the effect of
   biased polls on election outcomes and apply it to a set of new
   experiments with 375 participants. Voters may observe and learn about
   the bias by playing multiple voting rounds. While in control conditions,
   polls are unbiased, in treatment conditions, participants view only poll
   results where a particular candidate's vote share is the largest. This
   candidate is consistently elected more often in the treatments than in
   the controls, because biased polls robustly distort voters' expectations
   about vote shares. This effect holds after eighteen election rounds, out
   of which the first three are practice rounds, but somewhat more weakly
   in our main treatment where voters are explicitly informed about the
   bias.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper studies the role of institution in a Darwinian evolutionary
   process of cultural selec-tion. The primary function of an institution
   is to determine how citizens in a society are matched pairwisely to
   interact. We examine three different types of institutions: utilitarian,
   egalitarian, and Nash. Two cultural types stand out in the long run
   through the evolutionary process. The opportunistic cultural type
   maximizes individual payoff against another opportunistic cultural type,
   while the civic-minded cultural type maximizes the total payoff of a
   pair. We show that the structure of the underlying interactions among
   citizens plays a critical role. On the one hand, the evolutionary
   stability of the civic-minded cultural type requires supermodularity of
   the citizens' payoff function under the utilitarian institution and
   log-supermodularity in addition under the Nash institution. On the other
   hand, the evolutionary stability of the opportunistic cultural type
   requires submodularity of the citizens' payoff function under the
   utilitarian institution and log-submodularity under the Nash
   institution. Neither type's evolutionary stability is guaranteed under
   the egalitarian institution.},

Abstract = {The last decade has been tumultuous for democracy in Central and Eastern
   Europe (CEE). While the beginning of the 21st century saw many
   post-communist countries in the region democratize and become full
   members of the European Union, the last 10 years have been wrought with
   stagnation and democratic backsliding. By the 2020s, some of the
   strongest democratizers in the region had experienced significant
   issues. This study attempts to answer two questions related to whether
   social media users' satisfaction with democracy relies on a country's
   quality of democracy. The first question explores this relationship in
   the overall context of democracy, while the second examines the
   relationship with democratic backsliding. The findings show that social
   media use correlates with higher satisfaction with democracy when their
   country's democracy is more robust. Furthermore, as backsliding occurs,
   social media use is correlated with lower satisfaction with democracy.},

Abstract = {In recent years, European states have become creative in developing
   strategies to curtail international migration while escaping their
   obligations under human rights law. These strategies aim at stopping
   migrants before they can enter a state's jurisdiction, under the
   argument that states are not bound to their obligations while operating
   outside their jurisdictional boundaries. This article adopts a
   geographic perspective to examine the concept of jurisdiction under the
   European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), and particularly its nexus with
   territory. During the last decade, the ECtHR has interpreted
   jurisdiction to encompass situations where states apprehend migrants
   outside their borders, thus extending jurisdiction to extraterritorial
   operations. However, states can circumvent this by manipulating the
   territorial organisations of their borders to prevent migrants from
   reaching their territory without directly apprehending them. These
   strategies include agreements with countries of transit along with
   other, specific interventions. I take the case of N.D. and N.T. v. Spain
   as an example of this trend, and of the ECtHR's failure to make European
   states accountable. As a solution, I argue that jurisdiction should be
   interpreted to encompass territoriality as one of its components, and
   under a definition of territory informed by geographic research, and
   distinct from its conventional definition under international law.},

Abstract = {This article investigates European majority members' perceptions of the
   prevalence of ethnic discrimination. We use individual-level data from
   the Eurobarometer `Discrimination in the EU' series, covering 26
   European countries and six years (2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2015, and
   2019), enriched with contextual information on political elite
   discourses from the Comparative Manifesto Project. We shed light on
   significant and substantive cross-country and cross-temporal variations
   in these perceptions. Next, we explore how these variations are related
   to national political elite discourses by employing multilevel models.
   By disentangling between and within country variations, we find that
   particularly changes in political elite discourses within countries over
   time are associated with variations in majority members' beliefs about
   the prevalence of ethnic discrimination in their society. Exclusive
   discourses, which emphasize nationalistic ideas and demarcate strong
   boundaries between ethnic groups, are associated with majority members
   thinking that ethnic discrimination is less widespread in their country.
   The reverse holds for inclusive discourses: when political elites
   underline the importance of cultural diversity and multiculturalism,
   majorities perceive more ethnic discrimination. While these discourses
   are only related to within country variations, our descriptive and
   multilevel results show that the national context matters for
   majorities' perceptions of the prevalence of ethnic discrimination.},

Abstract = {The way in which both renewable and non-renewable resources are used,
   and the speed at which these are being exploited, are rapidly eroding
   the planet's capacity to regenerate the resources and environmental
   services on which our prosperity and growth are based. The clothing and
   textile industry is characterized by a linear (take-make-waste) economic
   model and huge use of non-renewable resources. In order to integrate
   circular economy as one of the challenges in the clothing and textile
   industry, we must boost past research directly to innovation to bring
   about a higher quality of life for all. Corporate social responsibility
   (CSR) has gained special importance among researchers, the business
   community, and customers in recent years. Today, manufacturers have to
   take another step forward to promote their positive social attitude and
   take care of their responsibility towards society. In the framework of
   sustainable development, CSR is carried out by achieving economic,
   social, or environmental goals. Consumers and shareholders currently
   expect a responsible approach from clothing and textile companies in the
   production of sustainable clothing, recycling, or ensuring suitable
   working conditions for employees. It is important not only to support
   socially responsible businesses but also to raise awareness of the
   negative environmental impact of the clothing and textile industry.
   Based on the recognition of the importance of shifting from a linear to
   a circular approach in the clothing and textile industry, we see
   potential in recycling the textile fiber in order to close the loop and
   use innovative technology to transform the textile waste into recycled
   material by keeping in mind barriers in technology. This article
   evaluates the social responsibility of a selected company in the field
   of sustainable development by setting a good example in the Slovak
   market through the results of a questionnaire survey.},

Abstract = {Prior to the introduction of rent seeking into public choice, the
   research program was focused primarily on collective decision-making.
   The incorporation of rent-seeking into public choice shifted the
   emphasis of the research program toward analyzing causes of government
   failure. Although Gordon Tullock's 1967 article clearly lays out the
   concept of rent-seeking, the transformation of the public choice
   research program by the theory of rent-seeking did not occur until after
   the publication of Anne Krueger's 1974 article on the rent-seeking
   society. This paper explains why Krueger's presentation of the paper at
   the Public Choice Center at Virginia Tech was instrumental in this
   transformative shift in the public choice research program.},

Abstract = {Australia's interactions with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
   (DPRK), henceforth known as North Korea, have ebbed and flowed
   throughout their seventy-five-year history. In times of detente on the
   Korean Peninsula, Australia actively engaged North Korea and sought to
   facilitate its integration into the international system. However,
   during the recent detente in 2018-2019, Canberra broke with tradition
   and watched on as Trump, Moon, and Kim sought to negotiate a deal
   towards Pyongyang's denuclearisation. Why has Australia not followed its
   security partners and engaged, despite being an Indo-Pacific middle
   power and an advocate for non-proliferation? Answers to this question
   remain unknown in the international relations literature. Therefore, I
   conducted process tracing and identified seven ``critical junctures{''}
   in Australia's relationship with North Korea while analysing its
   responses using middle power theory. Australia's preference for
   non-engagement is due to a shift towards a ``maximum pressure{''} policy
   reliant on sanctions, reducing incentives to engage. This stems from a
   normative objection to Pyongyang's violation of the Treaty on the
   Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and limited material
   capabilities to persuade North Korea to denuclearise unilaterally. I aim
   to give an up-to-date account of Australia-North Korea relations and
   draw attention to a neglected area in Australia's non-proliferation
   policy.},

Title = {Escape from tariffs: The political economies of protection and
   classification},
Journal = {ECONOMICS \& POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The literature on the political economy of trade protection has focused
   on how firms lobby for their preferred tariffs, but opportunities to
   change the tariff schedule in the United States by legislation are
   relatively uncommon. How can importers lobbying in their private
   capacity escape from tariffs without relying on Congress? In the United
   States, products must be sorted into tariff categories by the customs
   office before the appropriate duty can be determined. This article
   documents how firms seek to lower their tariffs by strategically
   requesting product classifications from customs. Firms hire lawyers to
   make legal arguments to customs officials promoting an interpretation of
   the tariff schedule which lowers their costs. Lobbying for favorable
   classification is most important to the firm when similar categories
   have very different tariffs. The language of product descriptions is
   political because legal arguments for a particular classification are
   more persuasive when the descriptions are worded flexibly. Using a data
   set of over 200,000 classification rulings between 1990 and 2020, I find
   evidence that firms request classifications in response to certain
   quotas and the China tariffs. The findings characterize the tariff
   schedule as a living document and describe how the distribution of
   tariffs and the language of product descriptions affect the structure of
   protection.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic had the potential to wreak havoc on elections.
   Democracies initiated varied policies to minimize health risks to voters
   and election workers. This study assesses the impact of voting policies,
   personal exposure to COVID, and partisanship on voter behavior in the
   2020 U.S. general election. Using a comparative state-politics approach
   and new data, we demonstrate that exposure to COVID substantially
   influenced voter turnout, and election policies had a major effect on
   whether a voter cast a ballot by mail, early in-person, or in-person on
   Election Day. Unique circumstances, including the emergence of voting
   policies as a polarizing issue, also spawned a new partisan voting gap
   that is especially prominent among heavy news consumers. Compared to
   2018, many more Democrats than Republicans abandoned Election Day voting
   in favor of mail voting.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on social networking sites and their role in
   partisan-based affective polarization and political antagonism. We
   examine the relationship by testing variables that indicate selective
   exposure to counter-attitudinal and pro-attitudinal information. The
   results from Czech survey data (n = 2,792) collected in 2020 show a
   positive relationship between both perceived discussion disagreement and
   attitudinal homogeneity of the network to political antagonism, and a
   positive relationship between the perceived attitudinal homogeneity of
   the network and affective polarization. The results thus question the
   existence of a single universal social media use pattern contributing to
   polarization.},

Title = {Missing the Global Turn: Italy, the 1951 Refugee Convention, and the
   Belated Removal of the Geographical Limitation},
Journal = {EUROPEAN HISTORY QUARTERLY},

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Italy abolished the `geographical limitation' permitted by the 1951
   Refugee Convention only in 1990. Thereafter, it could award refugee
   status to people in flight from countries outside Europe. Why did Italy
   come so very late to this resolution? To answer this question, this
   article intercuts analysis on various different fronts: the strategies
   of successive national governments; the actual presence on Italian soil
   of people needing asylum, and the response of local communities; and
   Italy's location in the international setting. It demonstrates that
   until the end of the 1970s the Italian authorities continued to see the
   refugee issue as principally a problem for its internal policy. Italy
   remained disconnected from the global turn in policy on refugees, which
   many historians have placed in the period that spans the late 1950s and
   early 1960s. In their view, state institutions, voluntary agencies, and
   the international public experienced profound changes at this time in
   their perception of refugees, starting to see them as a problem at the
   global level rather than just affecting Europe. For Italy, however, this
   was not the case, and we therefore need to question the actual impact of
   the global turn delineated by the studies.},

Abstract = {This research note draws from the social identity model of
   deindividuation effects (SIDE), uncertainty-identity theory, and
   intergroup threat theory to investigate the conditions under which
   members of online political networks are likely to endorse extremism.
   Using a national survey of 717 U.S. adults who self-identify as members
   of an online group comprising politically like-minded others, we find
   that when perceived group threat is high, group cohesion relates to
   radicalism intentions. Moreover, additional analysis suggests this
   relationship was particularly concentrated among conservatives. We argue
   that this may relate to the different ways in which conservatives and
   liberals manage uncertainty and threat.},

Abstract = {Certain ethical views hold that we should pay more attention, even
   exclusive attention, to the worst-case scenario. Prominent examples
   include Rawls's Difference Principle and the Precautionary Principle.
   These views can be anchored in formal principles of decision theory, in
   two different ways. On the one hand, they can rely on
   ambiguity-aversion: the idea that we cannot assign sharp probabilities
   to various scenarios, and that if we cannot assign sharp probabilities,
   we should decide pessimistically, as if the probabilities are
   unfavorable. On the other hand, they can rely on risk-avoidance: the
   idea that we should pay more attention to worse scenarios, even when we
   can assign sharp probabilities. I distinguish these two foundations. I
   also show how they can be modified to support versions of these views
   that pay more but not exclusive attention to worst-case scenarios.
   Finally, I argue that risk-avoidance provides a superior foundation than
   ambiguity-aversion for the Difference Principle and the Precautionary
   Principle; in particular, it correctly identifies which ethical facts
   should matter to those who champion these principles.},

Abstract = {The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), like most gender-integrated militaries,
   has a serious issue with sexual misconduct. However, despite the
   ubiquity of this form of violence, civil-military relations (CMR),
   arguably the dominant theory for addressing the politics of the civilian
   control of the armed forces, has paid little attention to gendered power
   relations. In this article, we utilize Canada as a case study to
   question the utility of CMR to address sexual misconduct. We find that
   major changes to the approach are necessary if CMR is to remain relevant
   to the study of emerging and increasingly complex challenges faced by
   militaries, like sexual misconduct. To this end, we suggest three
   strategies to develop the theoretical and analytical foundations of the
   CMR approach.},

Abstract = {The British parliamentary system is generally praised for its longevity
   and stability. However, the flaws of British democracy were highlighted
   following the referendum of June 2016. This withdrawal was not only an
   earthquake for the European project, it was also the source of
   unprecedented constitutional controversies in the UK itself. In
   particular, it raised a series of questions about the respective
   competences of national institutions and local institutions in the field
   of European affairs and, more broadly, in foreign affairs. Since the
   British Constitution is not a written one, the rules for the
   distribution of competences in these areas are essentially the result of
   practice.
   The UK's parliamentary regime, that was in the process of collapsing in
   September 2019 appears, against all odds, to have recovered following
   the early elections of 12 December 2019. The result of those elections
   has apparently provided a way out of the crisis, although it is unclear
   whether it will be temporary or not.},

Abstract = {In this article, I contrast two of the main schools of thought within
   eco-Marxism, namely Metabolic Rift (MR) and World-Ecology (WE). These
   differ above all else in their accounts of the ontological status of
   society and nature. The Covid-19 pandemic constitutes a moment of
   concretisation of this long-standing debate, which is able to dissolve
   at least in part its issues. The article consists of four parts. I begin
   with a summary of the two schools of thought and their core stances,
   before proceeding to unpack their respective theoretical points of
   contention. I subsequently proceed to explore the conceptualisation of
   health according to the Marxist scientists Richard Levins and Richard
   Lewontin through the model of dialectical biology. In the third section,
   I unpack the conceptualisation of the Covid-19 pandemic by the
   epidemiologist Robert Wallace, before finally concluding with the
   contrasts of the two schools in the light of dialectical biology.},

Abstract = {We are measuring the effect of a disability situation, targeting visual
   impairment, on access to housing in the private rental sector in
   Ile-de-France region using a protocol that allows us to compare this
   effect with that of a North African origin of the applicant. Between
   June and July 2020, we responded to 1,000 property advertisements, which
   corresponds to the sending of 3,000 messages requesting a visit to a
   property. Even though we use a weak signal of disability, a situation of
   poor eyesight, we show a high impact on the chances of being invited to
   visit a property. The applicant who reports this type of disability has
   a positive response rate that is 7.4 percentage points lower than the
   applicant who does not report a disability, a penalty of about 15 \% in
   relative terms. The difference is significantly lower to the one
   obtained when the fictitious candidate reports a North African origin
   through the consonance of his/her first and last names, which is 10.5
   percentage points.},

Abstract = {Social media corporations have become fixtures of daily life to the
   extent they are regularly compared to states in size and scope. These
   corporations and their platforms have become the dominant stakeholders
   of cyberspace, operating as state-like cyber actors, or net states.
   Previous approaches have limited the net state to the online, framing
   their populations and agendas separate to the material reality of their
   everyday operations, overlooking the tangible overlap between
   sovereignty and cyberspace. In this article, we examine whether net
   states can be co-opted into the apparatus of state in a manner
   comparable to client states. We examine the case of WeChat, the Chinese
   multipurpose messaging and social media app developed by Tencent in its
   operation as a client net state of the People's Republic of China. The
   interactions between these actors are mapped using a methodological
   framework incorporating actor-network theory to demonstrate the
   existence of client net states, and how they may be deployed to expand a
   state's influence and cyber sovereignty beyond its physical borders.},

Abstract = {PurposeCombining two organizational change theories, life cycle and
   organizational development, this study examines how strategic change
   cycle has been adopted and implemented across three different
   organizations, a public organization, an NGO and an intergovernmental
   organization toward achieving their
   goals.Design/methodology/approachThis study triangulates three different
   qualitative research methods: open-ended semi-structured interviews
   conducted with UN Women Egypt's director, text analysis of the three
   organizations' websites and the discourse analysis of the Tri-County
   Foundation's leaders.FindingsStrategic change cycle has been differently
   formulated, adopted and implemented by the three organizations based on
   their goals, resources and contexts. While Office Board of Investment
   adopted a comprehensive reactive change, Tri-County Foundation followed
   a partial proactive transformation and UN Women Egypt developed a
   partial reactive strategy. Henceforth, public organizations and
   nonprofit organizations can develop different strategies of change in
   function of needs, resources, goals and context.Originality/valueThis
   study advances a theoretical framework on organizational change by
   integrating two theories, life cycle and organizational development,
   presenting four patterns of change: comprehensive reactive,
   comprehensive proactive, partial reactive and partial proactive.},

Abstract = {Which harms and benefits should be viewed as relevant when considering
   whether to launch cyber-measures? In this article, we consider this
   question, which matters because it is central to determining whether
   cyber-measures should be launched. Several just war theorists hold a
   version of what we call the `Restrictive View', according to which there
   are restrictions on the sorts of harms and benefits that should be
   included in proportionality assessments about the justifiability of
   going to war (whether cyber or kinetic). We discuss two such views - the
   Just Cause Restrictive View and Rights-based Restrictive View - and find
   both wanting. By contrast, we defend what we call the `Permissive View'.
   This holds that all potential goods and bads should be included in
   proportionality decisions about cyber-measures, even those that appear
   to be trivial, and where the various harms and benefits are given
   different weights, according to their agent-relative and agent-neutral
   features. We argue further that accepting the Permissive View has
   broader implications for the ethical frameworks governing cyberwar, both
   in terms of whether cyberattack provide just cause for coercive
   responses, including kinetic warfare and cyber-responses, and whether
   cyber-measures should be governed by just war theory or a new theory for
   cyber-operations.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a novel account of freedom of dissociation,
   construed as the ``right to a fair exit.{''} It defines freedom of
   dissociation as the right to end an association without excessive and
   undue costs. This novel account contrasts with the classic right of exit
   that some liberal philosophers have theorized as the bedrock of
   associational freedom. The original right of exit is first and foremost
   concerned with the protection against excessive exit costs, while the
   right to a fair exit broadens its scope to include undue costs as well.
   State policy should aim at monitoring and resourcing exit not only to
   ensure that leavers have adequate exit options, but also that the costs
   of exit are fairly divided between parties. This account illuminates a
   range of cases, such as divorce, dissolution of employment contracts,
   and contested exits from religious associations.},

Abstract = {In 1966, Ernesto `Che' Guevara arrived in south-east Bolivia assuming
   that the region's forested mountains and the poverty of the peasantry
   constituted `favourable terrain' to start a revolution. Instead, he
   encountered a hostile terrain that led to the defeat of his guerrilla
   force and to his death. In this article, I offer a spatial and affective
   analysis of Guevara's conceptualizations of `favourable' and
   `unfavourable' terrain, of his gendered experience of a `hostile
   terrain' in Bolivia, and of how these ideas and his emphasis on
   revolutionary determination were subsequently debated and reformulated
   by guerrilla fighters and radical movements in Latin America. Drawing
   from an analysis of the interface between terrain, place and territory
   in rebellions, I show how the dichotomy between favourable and
   unfavourable terrain misses that spatially attuned insurrections can
   potentially weaponize any type of terrain, but also that they always
   confront a `hostile terrain', understood as the social and territorial
   conditions that hinder their spatial proliferation. This means
   conceptualizing revolutions as spatial and affective processes through
   which determined multitudes overcome this hostility by attuning to
   place, empowering their strategies through engagements with different
   types of terrain, and expanding rebel territories. I conclude by
   discussing why these questions are relevant today to radical politics
   amid the climate crisis.},

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this article is to define and validate the
   ``system is broken{''} index. The index measures anti-establishment
   attitudes cross-nationally. Methods: Using survey data from 25
   countries, we test the reliability of the system is broken index and
   then demonstrate its convergent and divergent validity. Results: The
   results reveal that the system is broken index is a reliable and valid
   measure capturing perceptions that the political system, in any given
   country, is broken and is not working for the average person. The index
   predicts related attitudes (nativism and populism) and provides stable
   estimates of anti-establishment attitudes over time. Conclusions: The
   system is broken index helps to predict the conditions that give rise to
   anti-establishment candidates and populist movements. Tracking the
   measure across three decades provides unique insights into the
   challenges confronting contemporary politics, including the rise of
   populism movements.},

   Turkana Wind Power, Kenya},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {102},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The attempt to mitigate climate change has focused much attention on the
   technical solutions offered by renewable energies (RE). Investing in
   such infrastructure can illuminate the concrete development and
   potential prosperity it may provide to the local and global environment.
   The wind turbine's remote location challenges centre-periphery relations
   in specific regions and the ability to realise the UN Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs). While analysing the Lake Turkana Wind Power
   project (LTWP) establishment in northern Kenya, we focus on the
   socio-political challenges to local pastoralist populations' relations
   with the political centre. En-counters between LTWP and the neighbouring
   local populations occurred at different times and in three different
   spaces: Sirima village, grazing lands under the turbines, and courthouse
   corridors. This article demonstrates how the wind farm could have
   altered the imbalanced relations between the centre and periphery, a
   change that did not fully materialise. While examining geopolitical
   centre-periphery relations, we found that land has become a productive
   resource for the centre, leaving the periphery population socially,
   economically, and politically neglected. The marginality of the local
   population may also hinder the inclusive achievement of the SDGs, the
   very goals which the article aims to achieve.},

Title = {The material politics of slurry: Mobilisations and transformations along
   the waste-fertiliser continuum},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {101},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Agriculture is a major source of excess nitrogen inputs into the
   environment. In Germany's Weser Ems region, the extreme concentration of
   intensive livestock farming translates recent improvements in nitrogen
   regulation into a `slurry problem' that makes manure disposal services
   increasingly vital for the beneficiaries of an agroeconomic production
   system based on ongoing intensification and externalisation. The paper
   uses ethnographic research to focus on the material politics of
   different sociomaterial assemblages of slurry. It shows how manure
   export and new technologies to materially transform slurry both
   facilitate a further integration of livestock farming by in-termediaries
   such as nutrient brokers and feedstuff producers. As slurry is mobilised
   and transformed, the ma-terial politics of slurry hinges upon shifting
   material properties and ontological struggles that position slurry along
   a continuum between nutritious natural fertiliser and abject organic
   waste. While slurry export to arable regions is problematically framed
   as a circular economy approach, the aim to transform slurry instead of
   transforming the unsustainable agroeconomic structure is embodied in
   hopes set upon `full processing' of slurry into products akin to mineral
   fertilisers. The disposal of excess slurry eventually depends on both
   material and ontological transformations. Emerging protest against
   central manure processing facilities shows that slurry and its odour
   make intensive livestock farming a material and `sensible' presence that
   can be acted upon politically. Embodied reactions and abjections related
   to this material agency of slurry can potentially bridge everyday
   practice and structural questions of socioecological wellbeing and
   justice in a more-than-human world.},

Title = {Policing the Sicilian Mafia: Repression and Control of the Mafia
   Phenomenon in Late Nineteenth-Century Italy},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the repression of the Mafia phenomenon in Sicily
   between 1896 and 1901. The close attention paid to the Mafia by the
   authorities during this period produced a strong evidence base which
   this article examines through the lens of policing practices. These
   practices remain neglected as to date the historiography has focused on
   tracing legal developments rather than examining the application of laws
   by the forces of law and order. Accordingly, the article puts forward a
   series of historiographically important questions: what was the attitude
   of police forces in controlling dangerous individuals? How much do the
   practices adopted by police forces tell us about the possibilities for
   state intervention and the limits of its influence? What was the
   relationship between the perception of a criminal threat, police
   operations and the construction of judicial truth? The article reveals a
   very clear image of the Italian state in the liberal era. In fact, state
   officials and high-ranking institutional figures seemed interested in
   strengthening the social and political order by establishing control
   networks which could operate in any circumstances. They aimed to make it
   impossible not to interact with state officials. In this sense, rather
   than seeking a complete monopoly of violence, they aimed to oblige local
   power holders, social groups and semi-public figures to bargain with
   state officials. The effect was that social groups with means of
   violence at their disposal did not necessarily become a threat to the
   maintenance of order and nor did they necessarily forestall the
   possibility of state mediation and hegemony.},

   between 1933 and 1940. Some efforts were successful, but most were not
   due to political, economic, and social constraints on immigration policy
   making, especially in Congress. Yet, she reorganized the enforcement
   functions of her department when she created the Immigration and
   Naturalization Service. Narratives abound about the period, though few
   delve into this reorganization. In this article, I share an analytical
   framework that I developed, ``policy innovation through bureaucratic
   reorganization, `` to explain how Perkins temporarily eased the
   debarments, as well as deportations, of newcomers by adjusting agency
   resources, including staffing, budget, and infrastructure. I describe
   how she responded to pressures from immigration restrictionists by
   tightening these functions. My narrative adds to the literature on
   immigration policy history, which has not fully appreciated the role of
   bureaucratic reorganization. This research bolsters the perspective in
   political control theory that bureaucratic structure merits as much
   attention as does legislation as a tool for control.},

Abstract = {This study aims to identify growth-conducive institutions unique to
   emerging economies. For that purpose, we examine the roles of
   Anglo-American institutions in fostering total factor productivity
   growth through the improvement of technical efficiency in emerging
   economies. Specifically, the impacts of the liberalistic and
   paternalistic types of regulatory institutions are discerned. The
   results show that institutional qualities such as reverence for the rule
   of law and effective governments robustly promote total factor
   productivity by improving technical efficiency, while voices of citizens
   and political stability exhibit a symbiotic relationship, where the
   efficacy of one of these qualities requires the sufficient prevalence of
   another. Regarding regulatory institutions, we found evidence that calls
   for protectionist policies to foster innovation, which is the key driver
   of technical efficiency.},

   military families (called ``Hero Squad{''}) is positively related to
   overall human flourishing among children, family units, and

   between multiple dimensions of religiosity (including reading sacred
   texts) and different aspects of flourishing (e.g., physical health,
   psychological well-being, character and virtue, social connections and
   support), so it was hypothesized that program participation would
   promote flourishing over time. Two waves of survey data were collected
   on a sample of 175 U.S. military families in 2021 and 2022, and
   differences between pretest and posttest surveys were analyzed. As
   hypothesized, improvements in indicators of flourishing were observed
   over time. These findings contribute to published work on religious
   participation by showing that Bible reading may promote overall mental,
   physical, and social well-being. Implications and limitations of these
   preliminary findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship has demonstrated a shift in media discourse about
   marijuana, yet few studies investigate how structural conditions
   influence variation in engagement with frames about marijuana. Moreover,
   given the long history of racialized discourse surrounding marijuana, it
   is surprising that scholars have not investigated framing in media
   produced by and for communities of color. Drawing on news articles about
   marijuana in regional Black newspapers in the United States from 1991 to
   2016 (n = 2,625), regression analyses reveal that structural factors
   like political action (e.g., ballot initiatives) and crime rates
   influence engagement across four unique framing domains: youth,
   policing, crime, and policy. I argue that, as newsworthy events, ballot
   initiatives provide opportunities to (re)frame marijuana as a policy
   issue, whereas conditions of crime shape the extent to which Black
   newspapers discuss marijuana as a problem impacting youth.},

Abstract = {In their online communications, political elites may choose to
   strategically eschew mainstream media sources and engage with
   alternative media outlets based on ideological and strategic
   considerations about the type of content they wish to legitimize or
   amplify to their followers. This is particularly true on social media
   which has become a fertile breeding ground for viral non-mainstream
   media content. Using an extensive dataset of social media posts sent
   from Members of the U.S. Congress between 2011 and 2022 (6.3 million
   tweets, 2.3 million Facebook posts), this article explores how media
   engagement in congressional online communications has evolved over time.
   The results suggest clear trends of asymmetric polarization, both in
   terms of media link sharing and media handle engagement, with Republican
   homophily and extremity of engagement growing steadily over time. This
   growing extremity is explained by changing Member behavior rather than
   changes in the composition of Congress and is primarily driven by more
   ideologically extreme Members of the Republican party increasingly
   engaging with rightwing and alt-right media. These trends have
   intensified in recent years, especially after the election of Donald
   Trump in 2016. Collectively, these results shed light on shifting
   ideological trends in media engagement and have important implications
   for our understanding of the relationship between political elites and
   the media in a highly polarized contemporary political environment.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates whether local cooperative banks played a role in
   mitigating income inequality within Italian municipalities following the
   main crises that marked the European landscape from 2008 to 2015, namely
   the financial and sovereign-debt crises. Our empirical findings indicate
   that, despite the overall rise in income inequality during the
   post-crisis periods, municipalities hosting at least one cooperative
   bank branch experienced a comparatively smaller increase. This
   mitigating effect on income inequality is not observed in the case of
   noncooperative banks. Furthermore, the size of the cooperative banking
   sector emerged as a significant factor in shaping income distribution:
   municipalities characterized by larger amounts of cooperative banks
   loans and deposits displayed lower levels of income inequality. The
   distributional impact of cooperative banks following the two crises was
   particularly pronounced in smaller municipalities, and where the degree
   of financial and industrial development was higher.},

Abstract = {What explains politicians' involvement in foreign elections?
   Understanding this behavior is important not only because it has
   received little scholarly attention but also because it could undermine
   public faith in electoral integrity in target countries. In this study,
   I consider an electorally based explanation, which suggests that
   politicians' electoral incentives to appeal to expatriate voters in a
   foreign country can explain their rhetorical involvement in that
   country's elections. I test this argument in the context of the 2020 US
   presidential election, where more than 50 Colombian MPs extensively
   promoted or attacked Joe Biden and Donald Trump on social media. My
   analysis indicates that whether Colombian MPs competed for Colombian
   Americans' votes and their popularity in the US are the systematic
   correlates of how much they got involved in the 2020 US election. The
   findings highlight how diaspora enfranchisement is important to
   understand elite online communication that cuts across national borders.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes to adapt a simple disease spread model for political
   persuasion. More precisely, we observe how a policy presented by a
   leader prevails in acommittee divided into two groups: supporters and
   opponents. At each date, agents from the two groups meet and influence
   each other due to the leader's persuasion force. If the leader's
   persuasion force dominates (is dominated), then some opponents
   (supporters) become supporters (opponents). Moreover, agents can also
   change their opinions simply because of the symbolic attraction force
   exerted by the group or the leader. In the long run, it appears that a
   high attraction force can compensate for a lack of persuasion force to
   ensure that more than half of the members subscribe to the policy
   presented by the leader. Such a situation is stable. Conversely, a high
   persuasion force, when the attraction force of the leader's group is
   relatively low, can generate the occurrence of a two-period cycle
   through a flip bifurcation such that the leader loses the majority from
   one period to another.},

Abstract = {The ideas and political commitments of the revolutionary abolitionist
   and Spencean Robert Wedderburn (1762-1835) represent a compelling
   example of a form of universality, articulated in the midst of the Age
   of Revolution, which defied European colonialism and plantation slavery.
   An engagement with Wedderburn's writings on the Haitian Revolution,
   maroon warfare and his proposal of a Spencean communist programme will
   clarify ongoing debates about Enlightenment, empire, slavery and
   universality, and might inform a re-engagement with the idea of
   universal emancipation in the political present.},

   Divergences in Polarized Partisan Expression on Immigration},

Abstract = {Extending literature on political polarization and political expression,
   we study patterns of polarized expression by vocal partisans from
   opposing camps on social media. Specifically, we argue that polarized
   partisan expression can be characterized by three divergences: 1)
   different thematic emphases on the same issue; 2) response to different
   real-world events on the same issue; and 3) a temporal disconnect at the
   aggregate level. Highlighting how online expression by different
   partisan groups is animated by discrete concerns and events and exhibits
   different temporality, the three divergences in polarized partisan
   expression not only reflect and explain existing polarization concepts
   but also speak to the epistemological chasm between partisan groups. Our
   empirical analysis is based on Twitter discussion about the issue of
   immigration in the U.S. and applies topic modeling and time series
   analysis. Results demonstrate that liberal and conservative tweets
   exhibit different thematic emphases, are often spurred by different
   event features, and remain largely temporally independent, though both
   Trump's tweets and emotionally evocative events can draw simultaneous
   reaction from both sides. These findings suggest that opposing partisan
   groups not only hold different views on the same issue, but also weave
   different events and facts about the issue into partisan expression in
   response to different exogenous factors. In short, they ``talk past each
   other.{''} These polarized partisan expression patterns indicate a
   splintered public sphere, a concerning quality for deliberative
   democracy.},

Abstract = {Practices labelled as corrupt in nineteenth-century European elections
   are generally conceived either as a form of domination where the
   candidates and their agents use exclusive resources for personal gain or
   a means of transaction between candidates and voters, on the assumption
   that candidates deploy corrupt practices in order to perusade voters.
   Consequently, electoral corruption in the nineteenth century is
   considered a tool that limits the participation of enfranchised
   citizens, whose conception of corruption is largely uncultivated. This
   study challenges this notion and demonstrates how corrupt practices by
   electors in societies where freedom was not guaranteed, did not restrain
   but instead extended the possibilities of political participation. The
   novelty of this study is based on integrating research focused on
   politicization beyond the elite and the new history of corruption, using
   Great Britain, France, and Spain as case studies. This integrated
   process found that corruption was used by electors to overturn
   unfavourable results, thus providing a platform for participation beyond
   voting.},

Abstract = {Asking about people's views of the Bible in a single survey question has
   become the prevailing way to understand the mass public's religious
   beliefs. Nevertheless, the standard survey items raise questions about
   what is being measured. The questions used to measure one's views of the
   Bible are often double-barreled and leave considerable room for
   interpretation. In this paper, we assess the measurement error in the
   standard three-category question from the American National Election
   Study (ANES) by developing new items to gauge what it might mean to a
   respondent to select one of the three options in the standard Bible
   question. Using original data from two online surveys, we demonstrate
   that there is substantial measurement error in the standard ANES item.
   Analyses also show that our new items predict responses to the standard
   ANES item and are potent predictors of political attitudes-often
   performing better than the widely used three-category question.},

Abstract = {This paper examines whether the shooting decisions under the leading
   (/lagging) condition moderate (/stimulate) risk taking. Using the task
   of field goal attempts in basketball competitions involving National
   Basketball Association regular season and playoff games, I find strong
   evidence of a significantly causal effect of interim performance
   information (IPI) on the probability of a risky shooting. Our results
   support the leading, lagging, and nothing-to-lose effects on individual
   risk taking under different conditions of time and score proximation in
   high-stakes dynamic competitions when performing skill-based tasks.
   Furthermore, the IPI effects are found to differ between Covid and
   non-Covid periods.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study examines the influence of upcoming general elections on the
   sales revenues of major defense companies. Based on the empirical
   findings, several broad conclusions can be drawn. First, as a result of
   election-induced procurement decisions, the total revenues of defense
   com-panies in major arms-producing countries increase when domestic
   elections are approaching to boost the performance of the economy.
   Second, elections in democratic foreign countries cause a fall in the
   revenues received by domestic defense firms as foreign governments are
   likely to shift their public expenditures away from defense imports and
   towards domestic contractors or to other public spending categories. In
   contrast, elections in autocratic foreign countries slightly improve the
   defense sales of arms producers as authoritarian rulers try to deter any
   political actions of challengers by signalling their military
   capabilities. Finally, governments of countries that are subject to
   serious security risks are more likely to increase their purchase of
   military -strategic items abroad when elections are upcoming for
   protection purposes.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the 2008 Great Recession, a section of the Dodd-Frank Act
   (DFA) ostensibly provided greater protection to low-income borrowers by
   capping bank charges on small dollar mortgages (defined here as less
   than \$100,000) and requiring more bank oversight by outside auditors.
   Previous research has shown that both actions had the perverse
   consequence of reducing the availability of mortgage credit to
   low-income borrowers. Building on these findings, we investigate the
   following question: Did the decline in access to credit lead to a
   decrease in demand for homes in high poverty census tracts, and a
   corresponding decline in property values in these areas? Using an OLS
   regression model of home values and census tract data in Forsyth County,
   North Carolina from 2007 to 2020, we calculate that nominal home values
   dropped by over 40\% in the county's lowest income census tracts after
   the institution of the DFA, relative to the rest of the county. Our
   paper offers evidence that DFA has harmed those that the Act was
   intended to help.},

Title = {Ta over bar , Va over bar , and La over bar : Re-imagining the
   geopolitics of the Pacific Islands},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {105},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Oceanic perspectives seldom appear in the geopolitical discourse of
   metropolitan powers, and the agency of Pacific Island states and peoples
   is often overlooked. Inspired by calls from political geographers for `a
   more ambitious geopolitical imagination' (Sharp, 2013), and from Oceanic
   scholars `to examine indigenous epistemologies, ontologies and
   cosmological ideas and philosophes so that global conversations include
   local and indigenous understandings' (Vaai \& Nabobo-Baba, 2017), our
   article represents a conversation between four scholars from differing
   backgrounds about how analyses of Pacific geopolitics could be
   re-imagined. We argue that dominant western accounts do not adequately
   account for the geopolitics of the Pacific because they overlook the
   multi-temporal, multi-spatial, multi-scalar, and relational ways in
   which states and other actors behave in the Pacific, and how Pacific
   Island states and Oceanic peoples perceive, respond to, and influence
   their behaviour. We instead propose that the intersecting sociospatial
   conceptualisations of ta over bar (based on the Tongan word taimi,
   time), va over bar (vava, space-place), and la over bar (latri, big or
   wide-ranging) can be brought into conversation with the political
   geography concepts of time, space, and scale. We do not generalise from
   this example, nor imply that all Oceanic peoples will share our
   understanding - the region is highly heterogenous. We instead pursue the
   modest goal of demonstrating how gaps in understanding might be bridged.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesThis study has investigated the impact of democracy on the
   sustainability of the environment in 52 African countries between 1990
   and 2020. MethodsThe study utilized the ordinary least square as the
   baseline estimation technique, the two-stage least square to account for
   endogeneity, and the quantile regression to account for existing levels
   of carbon emissions (CO2), which is a proxy for environmental
   sustainability. ResultsOur findings show that improving the quality of
   African democracies will see a significant reduction in the level of CO2
   emissions. Electoral and egalitarian democracy have a greater impact on
   reducing CO2 emissions in Africa and thus improving environmental
   sustainability. Further findings show that improving the quality of
   Africa's democracy will better dampen the level of CO2 emissions in
   African countries where the existing level of CO2 emissions is at its
   highest levels. ConclusionsThe findings highlight the importance of
   political institutions in improving environmental sustainability in
   Africa.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis study analyzes how authoritarian leaders use the judicial
   system to solve the principal-agent problem in the government hierarchy.
   We argue that autocrats recentralize court personnel to enhance the
   central government's monitoring power over local officials. MethodsOur
   empirical analysis takes advantage of a judicial personnel rotation
   reform in which the Chinese Communist Party recentralized court
   personnel by rotating provincial-level court leaders in 14 out of 31
   provinces. ResultsPanel data analysis shows that judicial
   recentralization increased adjudicated administrative lawsuits by nearly
   30 percent. We also demonstrate that the enhancement in judicial
   responsiveness is not driven by alternative channels such as learning or
   the substitution between different ways of petitions. ConclusionThis
   study explores the dilemma faced by authoritarian leaders in balancing
   the need for an effective court system to address local governance
   issues while maintaining control, highlighting the compromise solution
   of recentralizing local judiciaries to partially insulate them from
   local interference.},

Title = {On the behavioral impacts of violence: Evidence from incentivized games
   in Kenya},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Political violence is a major impediment to economic development,
   damaging social, physical and human capital. By contrast, the manner in
   which violence influences prosocial behaviors is less clear cut, even
   though these behaviors likely contribute to post-conflict outcomes at
   individual and aggregate levels. We propose that the standard routes
   through which the experience of violence is thought to increase
   prosocial behaviors offer different theoretical explanations under
   heterogeneous conflict exposure histories and for different behavioral
   domains. We test these hypotheses using incentivized behavioral
   experiments, collected in the context of electoral violence in Kenya.
   While we provide some evidence that exposure to violence increases
   prosocial behaviors, results display significant heterogeneities
   relating both to the dimensions of behavior analyzed and whether or not
   individuals were personally injured.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have examined not only whether people answer correctly
   to questions about political knowledge, but also whether ``don't
   know{''} (DK) is a response that implies low self-confidence in their
   knowledge. However, while it has become clear that different people have
   accurate knowledge in different topics, there has been little discussion
   of whether knowledge on specific facts promotes self-confidence.
   Furthermore, it is believed that people learn about politics through
   news media, but it is unclear whether the type of media consumption
   correlates with patterns of correct, incorrect, or DK responses on
   political knowledge questions. We conducted a survey that asks about
   knowledge on a variety of topics, such as the political system and
   current affairs, to (1) categorize patterns of correct, incorrect, and
   DK answers, and (2) examine their relationship to media choices. We find
   that those who read newspapers or online news are more knowledgeable
   about the political system and tend not to choose DK even on questions
   about knowledge they do not know accurately. In contrast, those who gain
   knowledge of current issues from watching TV have less confidence in
   their knowledge and answer DK to questions for which they do not know
   the correct answer.},

Abstract = {Does the expansion of voting by mail lead to higher turnout rates? Our
   thesis challenges the theoretical motivation underlying existing studies
   that expect merely a substitution effect, or worse, a decrease in
   turnout, in states that have more expansive convenience voting
   mechanisms in place, in particular, mail voting. The COVID-19 pandemic
   reshaped how we usually conceive of convenience voting, from the timing
   of the vote to the modality. But even before the 2020 election, we show
   voter turnout across the states is consistently higher in every general
   election over the past decade in states with greater shares of overall
   ballots cast by mail. Drawing on turnout data from the 2012-2020 Current
   Population Survey (CPS) and the Cooperative Election Study (CES), we
   find states with greater usage of mail voting experience higher overall
   voter turnout.},

Abstract = {While ample research on audience trust in the news media uses survey
   questions that ask respondents about their trust in a generic ``news
   media,{''} only scant research has investigated what types of news
   outlets respondents have in mind when answering such questions. These
   previous investigations originated mostly in the US and resulted in
   inconsistent findings. To further investigate this question, we use data
   from a large-scale survey (N = 2,337), collected in Sweden, including
   both general media trust measures and specific measures about trust in
   20 mainstream and nonmainstream news outlets. The results demonstrate
   that our respondents seemingly averaged across all mainstream sources
   when they formed their general evaluations of the news media's
   trustworthiness.},

Abstract = {With the advent of digital media and social media platforms, the speed
   of innovation and technology adoption in campaigns have increased
   tremendously. At the same time, the campaign environment and its rules
   are in constant flow, as platform logics, party operations, and voter
   alignments both reflect and create instability in many political
   systems. Additionally, disinformation, foreign interference in
   campaigns, hyper-partisan media ecologies, and hyperactive users have
   all created changes in opinion climates. In light of these developments,
   and building on the theoretical concept of increasingly disrupted and
   dissonant public spheres (developed by Barbara Pfetsch and Lance
   Bennett), this special issue seeks to expand research on campaigning
   beyond assumptions of well-functioning political systems, to better
   understand the erosion of institutional legitimacy and trust, and their
   effects on communication processes. The special issue is organized
   within two conceptual approaches. The first cluster of manuscripts
   observes how political candidates, organizations, and parties optimize
   their behaviour within the dissonant political environment. The second
   part examines responses, perceptions, and consequences of the disrupted
   environment on the public. Finally, four integrated forum essays look
   into how dissonant public spheres may disturb democratic processes,
   discuss the role of data-driven campaigning, and address how limited
   access to platform data affects our understanding of dissonant public
   spheres.},

Abstract = {Military veterans serving in the U.S. House of Representatives during
   the 113th-115th Congresses (2013-2019) exhibited distinct legislative
   behavior on selected defense-related topics compared with their
   nonveteran colleagues. Examining 208 House roll call votes on issues
   salient to military veterans in which more than 90,000 individual
   Representative votes were cast as well as by categorizing more than
   19,000 bills sponsored, this study finds that there was a small but
   distinct veteran voting trend that opposed Global War on Terrorism
   (GWOT) troop reductions. In addition, younger members exhibited a trend
   that suggests future Congresses may be more willing to approve use of
   military force than in previous decades. Finally, this study empirically
   demonstrates the tension in conservative fiscal policy preferences
   between increasing defense spending versus restraining total government
   expenditure.},

Abstract = {Forced returns from Europe are politically highly sensitive across West
   Africa. Yet, there is enormous pressure from the European Union on West
   African governments to improve cooperation on returns. This paper seeks
   to answer how countries such as Nigeria, Senegal and The Gambia are
   resisting this pressure. Based on 129 qualitative interviews on both
   continents, the paper develops a typology that shows that states use a
   range of responses in the face of external and domestic pressures. These
   range from reluctant compliance to both reactive and proactive
   incompliances. States are likely to use all these strategies at
   different times, sometimes simultaneously. Thus, countries are resisting
   return, albeit in subtle ways given their asymmetric bargaining
   position.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the impact of the Great War on two countries that
   remained neutral throughout the conflict, Spain and Argentina. It
   focuses on three aspects that are analyzed from a transnational
   perspective in order to show a transatlantic space: neutrality as a
   matter of dispute between pro-Allies and pro-German sectors; the debate
   about what positions should be assumed in order to guarantee a world
   without war; and the polemics on the ideas of nations that should
   prevail in each country. The hard confrontation between two opposing
   views on the principles on which the country should be sustained and the
   socio-economic upheaval accelerated the crises of the liberal regimes.
   Even though they were part of a cycle of crises and revolutions that
   assumed global characteristics, Spain and Argentina had travelled
   similar paths and their evolutions had been marked by both national
   contexts and a shared transnational space.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses Mexico's governance of migration and its
   geopolitical moral dilemma: an enthusiastic champion for migrants' human
   rights in the international sphere and a tough migration control
   enforcer. I consider this seemingly ambivalent and contradictory
   approach through the lens of euphemisms and dysphemisms, more
   specifically by analysing the use of euphemistic rhetoric and
   dysphemistic practices in the governance of migration. Through document
   analysis, I examine Mexico's use of euphemistic rhetoric in its role as
   migration control enforcer, as well as in its positioning in the
   relation to the Global Compact on Migration. Drawing on the experiences
   of irregularised migrants in Mexico and information obtained though
   Freedom of Information Requests, I analyse three dysphemistic practices
   in migration management: (i) bureaucratic negligence, (ii) precarious
   infrastructure, and (iii) spatial fixation and waiting. The Mexican case
   illustrates the discrepancy between discourse and practice in migration
   management and is an example of the ambivalences of global migration
   governance, which instrumentalises euphemistic rhetoric while promoting
   and tolerating dysphemistic practices.},

Abstract = {Political debates over religious freedom in Australia became prominent
   in the context of marriage equality, achieved in 2017. The Australian
   Christian Right (ACR) has driven these debates, but there is little
   research focusing on its discourse of religious freedom. This article
   examines a range of texts from ACR actors. Using discourse and
   theoretical analyses, we identify three key turns in the religious
   freedom rhetoric of the ACR: ``ontological security,{''} ``existential
   stress,{''} and ``meaning vertigo.{''} We also explore how mimetic ACR
   discourse is compared to the United States' Christian Right (USCR). As
   with the USCR, this research demonstrates how the ACR-suffering meaning
   vertigo and aiming to re-secure its previously taken-for-granted
   worldview-has successfully reframed the discourse of religious freedom
   by positioning itself as a besieged minority.},

Abstract = {The online platform economy in China has grown to become one of the
   largest in the world. Its growth has contributed to China's economic
   development and played an important role in its innovation path. We
   present a three-stage structured explanation of China's governance
   approaches toward its homegrown platform firms. Using Chinese government
   documents and secondary sources to conduct a historical process tracing
   analysis, we argue that the growth of China's main platform firms and
   the government's governance of them was co-evolutionary, guided by the
   party-state's goals of maintaining social-political stability, economic
   growth and strengthening technological self-sufficiency. By so doing
   this paper addresses the fundamental question of how a ``strong{''} and
   ``capable{''} state such as China's has responded as platform firms went
   from providing various online services to becoming core infrastructure
   in the economy and society to the point of threatening core government
   objectives.},

   and Other Offenses Among US Military Service Members},
Journal = {ARMED FORCES \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 10},
Abstract = {Interviews and focus groups with active-duty U.S. military service
   members and students at military service academies investigated
   relationships between espoused and enacted culture in perceptions of
   sexual assault and harassment versus other types of offenses. Results
   show that participants widely understood and accepted an espoused
   culture that is intolerant of sexual misconduct. The enacted culture
   included tolerance of some forms of sexual misconduct, differences in
   conduct in private versus public settings, and widespread resentment of
   frequent trainings. Results also showed cynicism about service
   treatments for all types of offenses, but especially for sexual
   misconduct. Of note is that participants tended to perceive
   inconsistencies in consequences for sexual misconduct in terms of who
   faced punishment, whereas for other offenses, they tended to see
   inconsistencies in what types of consequences were administered. Results
   demonstrate the value of efforts to align trainings with cultures that
   consistently discourage behaviors trainings are designed to eliminate.},

Title = {Italy: Immigration and the evolution of populism},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {76},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We study the effect of immigration on the upsurge of right-wing populism
   in Italy. Our data considers electoral results at the municipality level
   of the Senate of the Italian Republic and the Chamber of Deputies over
   the period 2006-2018. Using an IV strategy based on the shift-share
   instrument, we find that immigration generates a sizable causal increase
   in votes for the right-wing populist party Lega. Immigration also works
   as a major catalyst for the electoral distance between Lega and its most
   direct competitors. We explore how different levels of tax autonomy
   impact the results, as well as how the re-branding of Lega as a national
   movement affects the relation between immigration and support for the
   party.},

Title = {Indigenous tree tenure in the times of charismatic carnivore
   conservation: Territoriality and property in the forests of central
   India},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {101},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the forested landscapes of central India, elite anxieties around
   extinction threats to charismatic carnivores has brought about a deeply
   exclusionary conservationist turn in state territoriality. This article
   draws a conceptual distinction between territoriality for extraction
   (TE) and territoriality for conservation (TC) in forested landscapes,
   since they have different implications for space, nature and society.
   Through a case study from the Kuno forests of central India, it examines
   the impact of the shift from TE to TC on indigenous ways of knowing and
   using the forest. It shows that the Sahariya Adivasi community had
   evolved a dynamic, site-specific and resilient indigenous system of tree
   tenure (ITTS) to use and manage the Boswellia serrata (Salai) forest,
   from which they harvested chir gum for sale. Based on participatory
   mapping and in-depth interviews, it contends that the ontology of
   property-as-relations rather than as property-as-possession is more
   productive for theorizing indigenous use and access of valuable tree
   species in forest landscapes of the global South. The ITTS is defined in
   terms of tree tenure, property-as-relations, and indigenous claim-making
   over resources, and is borne out of people's everyday use, harvest and
   labour practices around specific plant species. It shows how the ITTS,
   which withstood more than a century of colonial and postcolonial
   impulses of TE, is crumbling under the onslaught of a more pernicious
   form of TC driven by the material and discursive practices associated
   with cheetah conservation.},

   political swearing in Hong Kong's Anti-Extradition Movement},

Abstract = {This is the first dedicated study on how verbal violence is
   strategically and instrumentally used in social movements. Its primary
   objective is to contribute to the emerging debate on protest violence.
   Its secondary objective is to enrich the interdisciplinary field of
   swearing research by identifying `political swearing.' Based on data on
   Hong Kong's Anti-Extradition Movement, I identify four major
   instrumental uses of political swearing: attacking enemies of the
   movement, mobilization and politicization, identity-building, and
   `personal political emotion work.' I find that political swearing can
   directly hurt people and indirectly do so by initiating violent
   enchainment processes. I also find that political verbal violence yields
   instrumental utility for social movements. This study's data include
   in-depth interviews with 30 informants, documentary and video data, and
   participant observation.},

   Perspectives from the Greek, Jewish and Palestinian diasporas},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {101},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper examines the geographies of how young people, aged 11-25, in
   the Greek, Jewish and Palestinian diasporas in the Midlands region of
   England articulate notions of formal and informal politics. In doing so,
   it connects work on diasporic politics with work on the geographies of
   diaspora, young people's politics, and, in particular, diasporic youth
   politics. The paper discusses how young people have views on politics
   and on being political but feel that they struggle to have their voices
   heard by those in positions of power. At the same time, it paints a
   picture of how these participants articulate such feelings of politics
   in complex, multi-scalar, multi-directional ways. In doing so, they are
   potentially creating new spaces to feel and be political. The paper
   therefore stresses that it is important that diasporic politics takes
   into account the views of young people and that assumptions should not
   be made as to where such politics are located.},

Title = {Enjoying climate change: Jouissance as a political factor},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {101},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this paper, we explore this dissonance between knowing and acting
   that produces the current climate deadlock by focusing on `enjoyment' as
   a political factor. The enjoyment that infuses the climate change
   consensus and climate activism stands as an avatar for the wider impasse
   that characterizes most attempts to inflect the tra-jectory of the
   future away from `accumulation for accumulation sake' and its associated
   socio-ecological ca-tastrophe. Considering enjoyment as a political
   factor might open avenues for re-framing the impasse of the present
   socio-ecological condition. We engage the Lacanian notion of enjoyment
   (jouissance). Our overall argument is that climate, and its change, is
   not only a threat to the world, but also something that is enjoyed in
   one way or the other. To illustrate the Lacanian take on enjoyment, we
   will differentiate between two dominant strands of enjoying climate
   change: First, a passionate engagement in destroying Nature based on an
   imperative to enjoy fossil fuels and what they metonymically stand for,
   and second, an equally passionate commitment to saving Nature based on
   an imaginary enjoyment that stems from renunciation and sacrifice. The
   paper proceeds by arguing for the need to traverse the fantasies that
   sustain the very deadlock of the current situation, a process that
   requires re-scripting the process of political subjectivation and our
   libidinal attachments to the enjoyment of climate change.},

Abstract = {Military organizations have adapted to the logic and dynamics of social
   media to transmit their institutional narratives. Instagram is the most
   popular social network, but one of the most understudied in relation to
   the Armed Forces. This research note presents a comparative study of the
   content of the official accounts of the Spanish, French, the United
   States, Israeli, and Australian armies throughout 2021 (n = 1,922). The
   specific objectives are to describe and analyze the hashtags, the
   accounts mentioned, and the main topics of the post. Results show that
   armies can convey multiple messages in a single post, and reveal that
   armies make similar use of Instagram, notwithstanding the various
   differences between Israel and the other armies due to organizational
   and contextual elements.},

Abstract = {In recent years, trial waivers (plea bargains in the United States) have
   been introduced into many legal systems around the world. Once trial
   waivers (TW) were introduced, most-if not all-of these legal systems
   witnessed a steep increase in the usage of TW, to the extent that trials
   are virtually disappearing. Our model explains why introducing TW into a
   legal system would almost inevitably trigger a dynamic process whose
   ultimate result is that all defendants choose the TW. The crux of the
   idea is that defendants who choose the TW option impose a negative
   externality on other defendants: the former help the prosecution save
   resources, thus forcing the latter to face stronger prosecution if they
   choose to go to trial. This further explains the observed increase in
   conviction rates in trials. We also show that the introduction of TW
   increases total sanctioning and reduces the welfare of many, if not all,
   defendants. The intuition for this is that a harsh punishment in a TW,
   which initially attracts only the most risk-averse defendant, becomes
   over time attractive to more and more defendants as the expected
   sanction in trial becomes more severe.},

   consists on a quantile regression for the period 2004-2019. The results
   show a negative and significant impact of total public expenditure on
   economic growth, with a higher effect in the high tail of the growth
   distribution. In a more detailed analysis, the study of three large
   public expenditures, considering the percentage of total public expense,
   reveals an insignificant effect of health, and a negative impact of
   education and social protection, higher in the low tail of the growth
   distribution. Our findings allow better understanding of the effects of
   public policies on development beyond linear approaches.},

Abstract = {This article is based on an apparently impossible assumption: the
   collaboration between marginal individuals of Catalan separatism and
   Lerrouxism to perpetrate a chimerical attack against French Marshal
   Joseph Joffre on his visit to Barcelona to preside the 1920 Jocs Florals
   event. Regarding its preparation, the authors propose how the
   traditional interpretation of Catalan political and social reality was
   not limited to the simple confrontation between right and left and among
   nationalisms, but that the game of alliances and friendships in their
   political substratum was a lot more complex than traditionally revealed
   by Catalan and Spanish historiography. The context in which the
   conspiracy takes place is marked by the crisis of the liberal state
   model and the emergence of different nationalist and revolutionary bets
   in Europe, which had in common a horizon of civil servant promotion that
   allowed the meeting of two political movements with seemingly disparate
   political motivations.},

   definition of financial development. Estimates are made using the
   two-step system Generalized Method of Moment (GMM). Over the 1984-2013
   period, our results show that in SSA, the level of financial development
   is a decreasing function of conflicts, whether these are internal,
   external or general. Our results, which do not depend on the choice of
   financial development and conflict indicators, are robust to both ``de
   jure{''} and ``de facto{''} financial openness, ethnic heterogeneity,
   currency unions and regional trade agreements, and the Rajan and
   Zingales {[}2003] hypothesis. They seem to suggest that the reduction of
   conflicts, in addition to its humanitarian objectives, is also crucial
   for economic progress.},

Abstract = {In this chapter I focus on an analysis of ordinary practices for
   overcoming disagreement in nonidealized political settings. My goal is
   to show that compromises are the most common outcomes of public
   procedures of adjudication among disagreeing parties over political
   matters, rather than consensus-based decisions. If my analysis of the
   actual epistemic circumstances of democracy is convincing, it follows
   that wide-spread consensus over political decisions is an unrealistic
   goal for democratic settings in a pluralistic world. Against this
   backdrop, my analysis will show that certain forms of political
   compromises do however rely upon normative commitments, even though in a
   less straightforward way than it is usually imagined for consensus-based
   political decisions. The normative dimension of compromise agreements
   rests on the quality of the intersubjective exchange; it is a matter of
   relational justice, since it demands that the parties involved
   reciprocally respect one another. Realistically, each party tries to get
   as much as it can from the negotiation. Yet, we can distinguish between
   a principled, mutually respectful way, to negotiate with others and a
   dynamic in which power relations and manipulative attempts are
   everything that counts. Since, however, it appears quite obvious that
   power dynamics can deeply affect compromise, in the last section of the
   chapter I introduce some cautionary remarks on the possibility that
   principled compromises can warrant an adequate response to structurally
   entrenched asymmetries of power and to stark differences in public
   visibility for members of different social groups.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN HISTORY QUARTERLY},

Volume = {53},

Pages = {32-39},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Masque of Blacknesse was a carnival-cavalcade of colour, - it was
   brash, bold and performed with swaggering pomposity in 1605. The Masque
   was written by Ben Jonson and staged by Inigo Jones. In it, the Queen of
   England, Anne of Denmark and her noble friends were painted Black and
   pretended to be the daughters of the River Niger (personified as a God
   King). This article unpicks the ethnographic themes in King Niger's
   speech where he extols the beauty of blacknesse. The author suggests
   that whilst early modern fiction may echo themes present in that
   society, it needs to be decoded and in some cases decolonised to
   decipher early modern ethnography.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis article examines the effect of China's soft power projection
   through the Chinese media in Africa on the African audiences' perception
   of China's national image through a case study of the residents of
   Nairobi. It adopted Joseph Nye's soft power model and sought to address
   three fundamental questions : What is the extent and objective of
   China's media diplomacy in Africa? How has China's media ``offensive{''}
   in Africa impacted African audiences' imagery of China? What are the
   implications, if any, of China's media diplomacy on the Kenyan public
   view of China?Design/methodology/approachThis article used a
   mixed-methods research design, which deployed elements of positivism and
   interpretivism. It used a deductive approach and deployed the survey
   strategy, which entailed the collection of data from Nairobi city
   residents. The secondary data were collected from relevant academic
   literature sources. The primary data were analyzed empirically using the
   Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), while the secondary
   data were analyzed using discourse analysis.FindingsChina's soft power
   projection through the Chinese media in Africa is aimed at addressing
   the ``misinformation{''} about China. China seeks its share of
   representation among the African public to correct negative perceptions
   of China. Kenyans had a generally positive attitude toward China. South
   Africa and Angola have ``Fairly{''} positive perceptions of the Chinese
   media. However, this study did not reveal whether the perception was due
   to the influence of Chinese media. These findings implied that the
   African public's positive imagery of China cannot be fully attributed to
   Chinese media's influence.Originality/valueThis study is groundbreaking
   in that it is one of the few studies that have focused on China's public
   diplomacy in Africa and assessed the impact of Chinese media on the
   African public's perception of China.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveUnder the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, Likud-Israel's most
   successful political party in the past 50 years-transformed from a
   highly institutionalized leader party into a personal party. This study
   explores the personalization of Likud and its various manifestations and
   analyses the causes of this process and its consequences.MethodsA case
   study. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis.ResultsAlthough the
   Likud party leader's formal roles, powers, and authorities did not
   change significantly, many informal developments enhanced the firm grip
   Netanyahu held on the party. Netanyahu manipulated leadership contests,
   and they became uncompetitive; the party's internal institutions were
   almost nullified and became no more than a rubber stamp to Netanyahu's
   interests; and Likud's representatives in the Knesset were transformed
   into a group of submissive cheerleaders.ConclusionsWe conclude that
   essential, routinized procedures within Likud were abandoned in favor of
   personalization of decision making; the ``value{''} of the party
   organization was replaced with that of a single leader as perceived by
   important internal party actors and the electorate; and that other
   parties perceived Likud as personalized. On all fronts, the Likud
   underwent a personalization process. Moreover, the personalization of
   Likud, the ruling party, contributed to Israel's democratic backsliding.},

Abstract = {In 2003, Iraq was invaded, ostensibly to remove a nuclear threat, by a
   coalition led by George W. Bush. At the same time select allies were
   invitited to participate in Bush's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership
   which aimed to limit the spread of nuclear enrichment and reprocessing.
   This came as climate change gave emphasis to the development of nuclear
   energy, especially in Asia. With an abundant supply of uranium and
   strict nuclear safeguards, Australia was well placed to provide a site
   for the full suite of nuclear services. The recent AUKUS nuclear
   submarine agreement has underscored its failure to do so. This article
   makes the case for the adoption of nuclear power as a necessary step in
   the development of advanced manufacturing; the provision of a domestic
   capability to fuel nuclear attack submarines and other naval craft; and
   as a contribution to global nuclear non-proliferation.},

Title = {The politics of mourning in conservation conflicts: The (un)grievability
   of life and less-than-human geographies},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Accounts of conservation conflicts often reveal that people living
   around protected areas feel like their lives are less valued than
   animals' lives -they are confined to `less-than-human geographies'.
   Recent literature on necropolitical ecology illustrates how such
   geographies were created and maintained by the state, which holds the
   power to decide over life and death in and around conservation areas.
   This paper integrates Judith Butler's politics of mourning into
   necropolitical ecology to interrogate which lives are considered
   grievable and which ones are not in conservation landscapes. It focuses
   on two vignettes of violent human-carnivore interactions in Queen
   Elizabeth National Park, western Uganda: the poisoning of allegedly 11
   (but actually three) lions and the killing of a baby girl by a leopard.
   Both incidents happened in the park's condoned fishing villages, where
   historically marginalised Basongora pastoralists have been confined to
   live since the park's creation. We examine how the lost lives -of humans
   and animals- are publicly mourned and which lives are actually
   considered lost. We show how the politics of mourning in violent
   human-wildlife encounters goes beyond the (colonial-)state; rather, the
   unequal distribution of precarity is entrenched by a range of public
   authorities (e.g., (social) media, (I)NGOs, and politicians). This is,
   in part, because sovereignty in conservation territories has become
   trans nationalised as post-colonial states allow international NGOs to
   carve out their own zones of influence. This coloniality of power
   influences human-carnivore relations and reifies racialised conservation
   spaces as less-than human geographies.},

Title = {Oil price fluctuations and economic growth: the case of MENA countries},
Journal = {REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Pages = {353-379},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to explore the extreme effect of crude oil price
   fluctuations and its volatility on the economic growth of Middle East
   and North Africa (MENA) countries. It also investigates the asymmetric
   and dynamic relationship between oil price and economic growth. Further,
   a separate analysis for each MENA oil-export and oil-import countries is
   conducted. Furthermore, it studies to what extent the quality of
   institutions will change the effect of oil price fluctuations on
   economic growth.Design/methodology/approachAs the effect of oil price
   fluctuations is not the same over different business cycles or oil price
   levels, the paper uses a panel quantile regression approach with other
   linear models such as fixed effects, random effects and panel
   generalized method of moments. The panel quantile methodology is an
   extension of traditional linear models and it has the advantage of
   exploring the relationship over the different quantiles of the whole
   distribution.FindingsThe paper can summarize results as following:
   changes in oil price and its volatility have an opposite effect for each
   oil-export and oil-import countries; for the former, changes in oil
   prices have a positive impact but the volatility a negative effect.
   While for the latter, changes in oil prices have a negative effect but
   volatility a positive effect. Further, the impact of oil price changes
   and their uncertainty are different across different quantiles.
   Furthermore, there is evidence about the asymmetric effect of the oil
   price changes on economic growth. Finally, accounting for institutional
   quality led to a reduction in the impact of oil price changes on
   economic growth.Originality/valueThe study concludes more detailed
   results on the impact of oil prices on gross domestic product growth.
   Thus, it can be used as a decision-support tool for policymakers.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the role of global migration and the nature of
   national borders within the co-constitution of class and race. We begin
   with Marx's critique of the value-form - a critique that rests upon a
   distinction between the `essence' of social reality and its immediate
   appearances. The paper elaborates how Marx's understanding of the
   emergence of a society based upon generalised commodity production leads
   to a certain conception of the `political state' and citizenship - and
   thus borders and national belonging. This reveals the distinctive
   territorial forms of capitalism vis-a-vis those found in pre-capitalist
   societies, and moves us away from transhistorical conceptions of borders
   and the nation-state. In the second half, the paper turns to look at
   what this conception of borders and migration might mean concretely for
   how we think about the co-constitution of race and class today. Here the
   focus is on three crucial aspects of the contemporary world market: (1)
   the relationship between the cross-border movements of labour and
   processes of class formation, (2) migration and the determination of the
   value of labour-power, and (3) coercive and unfree labour.},

Abstract = {The concept of `new' state capitalism has garnered increasing attention
   among scholars due to the emergence of a polymorphism of state
   interventions in recent years. These interventions are now being
   examined through a spatial lens, departing from the previously dominant
   methodological nationalism. In this case, the `new' Chinese state
   capitalism is particularly noteworthy. The People's Republic of China
   (PRC) has adopted a spatial state-led strategy to facilitate the
   Renminbi (RMB) transnationalization. This strategic approach transcends
   traditional national boundaries, stretching across different spaces. Our
   research focuses on the specific case of Luxembourg in relation to this
   spatial strategy. We assert that the RMB transnationalization represents
   a distinctive feature of the `new' Chinese state capitalism, as it is
   underpinned by explicit Chinese state policies, unlike other currencies
   whose global use was the result of growing economies. Moreover, we
   contend that the PRC's explicit policies regarding the RMB do not aim
   for full convertibility and widespread acceptance like the US-Dollar
   (USD). Instead, they prioritise its role as a trade currency for
   international trade settlements, as the main goal is to reduce the
   dependence on the USD and to create a stable International Monetary
   System (IMS) that will bring benefits to its trade-oriented economic
   model. Overall, this paper significantly contributes to the existing
   literature by offering a novel perspective on the RMB
   transnationalization within the framework of the `new' Chinese state
   capitalism, emphasising China's quest for autonomy from the USD.},

Abstract = {In dialogue with Della Porta's work on protests as critical junctures
   and drawing on the comparative analysis of four case studies in Europe
   (Barcelona and Dublin) and North America (Baltimore and Montreal), the
   paper develops a neo-Gramscian perspective on the impact and legacies of
   urban resistance to austere neoliberalism after the Global Economic
   Crisis (GEC) of 2008-9. Framed by the postulated `interregnum' in the
   hegemony of neoliberalism, it argues that the conjunctural politics of
   the period are defined by a continuing conflict between passive
   revolutionary subsumption and generative anti-systemic politics, which
   plays out in acute form in the international urban arena. The paper
   accordingly contributes to the journal's work on the relationship
   between protests and social structures, situating urban movements in
   multi-scalar socio-economic, political and cultural contexts and
   developing reflections on the conjunctural significance of anti-systemic
   struggles.},

Abstract = {It is well-established that market governance can be provided by both
   public (state) and private organizations. However, the concept of
   private governance has been used, this article contends, to refer to two
   distinct forms of non-state governance: private governance and community
   governance. We distinguish between these two forms, arguing that private
   governance should be understood as the provision of market governance by
   (external) private parties, while community governance refers to a
   process where a group, a community, or society has the autonomy to
   govern its own affairs without interference from external authorities.
   The former internalizes the externalities associated with governance,
   while the latter comes about mainly as an unintended externality of
   social interaction in markets. To further illuminate the differences,
   and the relative strengths of these types of non-state governance, we
   distinguish among three elements of market governance: (1) the formation
   and interpretation of rules, (2) the administration of rules of
   ownership and exchange, and (3) the enforcement of rules. We argue that
   community governance is of great relevance for the formation and
   interpretation of the rules of ownership and exchange, which is
   consequently very hard to outsource to external parties, private or
   public. Community governance also plays a frequently overlooked role in
   administration and enforcement through the process of co-production.
   Rule formation and interpretation are theorized as the epistemic
   components of market governance, which can be analyzed within the
   Governing Knowledge Commons framework.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Politicians respond to incentives when they decide how to allocate their
   campaigning time and effort. The literature suggests electoral rules
   impact politicians' incentives. We argue that the candidate selection
   process is an equally important source of incentives. We develop a
   two-stage model in which parties select candidates before the election.
   Elections are under first past the post (FPTP) or closed list
   proportional representation (PR). Selection is competitive or
   non-competitive. When selection is not competitive, effort is higher
   under FPTP. With competitive selection, effort is higher under PR as,
   under PR, competition motivates candidates to exert effort to be
   selected (as under FPTP) and to be ranked higher on the list. The
   results point to a causal relationship between electoral rules and how
   parties organize. They suggest empirical studies comparing electoral
   rules should consider how parties organize.},

Abstract = {Using neo-institutionalist approach, crowdwork platforms can be
   considered as mesoinstitutions (Menard {[}2014, 2018]), acting as
   regulators on their own labor market. As the legitimacy of a
   meso-institution influences the efficiency of its governance and of its
   incentive system (Menard {[}2016]), the legitimacy of crowdwork
   platforms appears essential to guarantee workers' effort. This paper
   therefore questions the link between the legitimacy of the platform as
   perceived by the micro-workers and their response to the incentives put
   in place. Based on a multiple correspondence analysis of a questionnaire
   conducted with workers of a French micro-tasking platform, we build two
   composite indexes for the legitimacy and the strength of the incentives
   to test a possible correlation. Our findings show that positive
   legitimacy is significantly related to strong effort incentives, but
   that this relationship becomes more tenuous as legitimacy and the
   strength of response to incentives decreases. Crowdwork platforms must
   therefore not neglect the perception of their legitimacy if they want to
   secure workers' efforts and survive against other platforms.},

Title = {Towards a solid-fluid territory: Sand dredging, volumetric practices,
   and earthly elements},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {106},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Since 2020, although Taiwan has expelled dredgers and sand-transporting
   vessels from areas under its control, it has failed to stop sand loss.
   Marine researchers have noted that such issues problematise the ontology
   that underlies work on territory and ocean governance, wherein the ocean
   is regarded as a flat space that can be zoned and territorialised.
   Attention has thus shifted from considering the ocean as a flat
   terrestrial legal boundary to regarding it as a dynamic, volumetric
   entity, constantly shaped by the distinct qualities of the ocean and
   human endeavours. While such thought-provoking work offers crucial
   insight into our understanding of territory, its emphasis on the
   distinct qualities of water unconsciously reinforces the distinction
   between the land and the sea. Informed by recent materials-related
   social studies, this paper proposes the notion of the marine environment
   as a solid-fluid territory that foregrounds the importance of planetary
   dynamic geological processes. I argue that in this sense, territory is
   always involved in the governance of solid-fluid transitions in
   different voluminous contexts. The solid-fluid territory, I suggest, is
   characterised by three elements: solid-fluid transitions, resources, and
   volumetric practices. With reference to the controversy over sand mining
   in the Taiwan Strait, this paper reveals that while various
   geotechnologies are deployed to manage solid-fluid materials, state
   security practices often complicate our understanding of these shifting,
   dynamic geological processes and challenge human boundary-making.
   Therefore, geopolitics must acknowledge the nuances resulting from such
   solid-fluid movements and transitions, as well as their impacts on
   territorial issues.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a measure of `equitability of taxation', in the
   context of progressivity and the income tax. By postulating
   specifications of `extreme equitability' and `extreme inequitability' of
   a tax system, the paper advances a measure of tax equitability as the
   normalised area distance of a `tax concentration curve' from its most
   inequitable version. The measure is derived, and a procedure is outlined
   for the decomposition of differences in the measure across regimes into
   a `distribution effect' and a `tax system' effect. A criterion is
   established for asserting `unambiguously greater equitability' in
   comparisons across regimes, in terms of a dominance relation akin to the
   Lorenz quasi-ordering. The measure is illustrated with the help of
   numerical examples.},

Abstract = {As developing countries have started to host the mega-events (e.g.,
   FIFA, Olympics), the focus has shifted toward the human rights
   conditions in the host country rather than the competition itself. Up to
   now, far too little attention has been paid to the impact of mega-events
   on human rights. This study aims to fill that gap by examining the
   relationship between mega-events and human rights violations in hosting
   countries. By applying panel data techniques to a rich dataset, we find
   that hosting mega-events has a positive impact on human rights. These
   findings remain statistically significant after several different

Abstract = {From 2020 onward, sweeping reforms were implemented in China's domestic
   Internet sector that stirred debate about its future. Analyzing all
   Chinese government policies and penalties issued on domestic Internet
   enterprises from 2020 to 2022, this article provides the first
   systematic account of the authoritative themes that guided the design of
   the policy reforms. Latent Dirichlet Association topic modeling and
   qualitative content analyses reveal that policy reforms are guided by a
   state techno-nationalist agenda shifting closer to a framework of
   environmental, social, and governance concerns (ESG). The results show
   that the new policies restructured Internet firm operations, capital
   allocation decisions, and accountability mechanisms with local
   government collaborators to ultimately push firms toward improving ESG
   adherence: social wellbeing, corporate governance, and environmental
   sustainability. This article theorizes that these changes reposition the
   Internet sector in a new techno-nationalist agenda, shifting it from a
   vehicle of unfettered economic growth to an incubator for social
   wellbeing and sustainable finance.},

Title = {Postpartum Women's Perceptions of Risk of Musculoskeletal Injuries in

Abstract = {Musculoskeletal injuries (MSKi) are a major concern within military
   forces, significantly reducing productivity and military readiness.
   Within the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), MSKi are the most common cause
   of delayed deployment of members. There is a lack of research
   specifically focused on the experiences of postpartum CAF members and
   their perceived risk of MSKi. Drawing on Giles et al.'s equity-centered
   4 E's injury prevention framework (education, engineering, enforcement,
   and equity), we highlight that individuals who experience pregnancy may
   perceive themselves to be at heightened risk of injury due to sex and
   gender-based inequities in their workplace. This qualitative research
   draws on data from focus groups with 32 individuals who experienced
   pregnancy while serving in the CAF. Using reflexive thematic analysis,
   we identified the following findings related to perceived increased risk
   of MSKi: (a) nature of relevant physiological and anatomical changes in
   pregnancy, (b) unreasonable pressures to return to work at peak physical
   readiness, and (c) perceived challenges associated with accessing
   resources and services to support physical recovery. There are
   opportunities to improve access to injury prevention resources and
   support for pregnant and postpartum CAF members to reduce rates of MSKi.
   Findings from this study may be additionally relevant to armed forces
   more broadly or other professions that require return to physical
   readiness.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Abstract = {Quite often an expert takes position on an issue where certain actions
   can be perceived as biased. If the expert has an informational concern
   and she does not want the listener to perceive her as biased, she has an
   incentive to avoid the biased action, even if she thinks this is the
   correct action. This paper shows that when an expert has multiple types
   and two concerns, an informational concern and a bias concern, the
   incentive to contradict private relevant information and avoid the
   biased action can even increase when the listener observes the quality
   of the expert's advice. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions
   for this perverse effect of transparency on consequences to emerge and
   discuss variations of the model.},

Abstract = {Journalism has long been presumed to serve as a check on the powerful,
   shedding light on wrongdoing; however, as local newspapers reach market
   failure, extant theory predicts corruption will go unchecked. We
   operationalize corruption as federal prosecutions for public corruption
   (PPCs), defined by the US Department of Justice as crimes involving the
   abuse of public trust by federal, state, and local public officials. We
   examine changes in the local news media ecosystems: first, whether
   declines in local newspaper employment and circulation are associated
   with changes in PPCs; and second, whether efforts to supplement watchdog
   journalism with nonprofit journalism might mitigate associated declines
   in federal PPC. Our findings suggest nonprofit interventions in failing
   local commercial news markets may be an important safeguard for keeping
   public officials accountable.},

Abstract = {This research analyzes the aggravated vulnerability in consumer law. The
   thesis proposes that it is necessary to incorporate a human rights
   approach , a gender perspective in order to apply the concept of
   `aggravated vulnerability' to female consumers, con-sidering that, under
   the paradigm of structural discrimination, women constitute a
   disadvantaged group. Structural discrimination conceptually contributes
   to determining `totalizing experiences' as a theoretical proposal for
   Chilean experiences that affect the collective interest of women
   consumers.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the relationship between partisan foreign
   policy positions on Israel and the voting behavior of religious
   minorities in Canada. It discusses Stephen Harper's strong pro-Israeli
   stance in foreign policy when the Conservatives were in power and
   focuses on two main explanations accounting for such politicization of
   Israel, namely moral obligations and political clientelism. These
   hypotheses are tested using the 1968-2015 Canadian Election Study (CES)
   surveys and the 2011-2015 Vox Pop Labs election data. The results
   suggest that the Israeli issue had an impact on the support for the
   Conservatives among voters from religious minorities. Considering the
   effect of this foreign policy positions, Jewish Canadians are shown to
   be more supportive of the Conservatives, while the opposite pattern is
   observed among Muslim Canadians. The implications of these findings are
   then discussed.},

Title = {Is european attachment sufficiently strong to support an EU fiscal
   capacity: Evidence from a conjoint experiment},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Based on a conjoint survey experiment with 10,000 respondents from
   France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Spain at the end of
   March/beginning of April 2020, we explore how individual characteristics
   shape support among Eurozone citizens for a European Union (EU)
   budgetary assistance instrument to combat adverse temporary or permanent
   economic shocks hitting EU Member States. We consider particularly the
   role of socioeconomic factors, such as income and education, covid fears
   and European attachment. Remarkably, how covid worries and European
   attachment affect the support for specific designs of the assistance
   instrument is not affected by other factors, in particular not by
   socioeconomic factors. These latter factors play an important role
   affecting support, independent of European attachment. Programs with
   European Commis-sion monitoring (and recommendations) and cross-country
   redistribution, possibly even mandatory towards poor countries, can
   count on stronger support from those with higher Eu-ropean attachment.
   Those with strong covid fears are generally more in favour of EU
   budgetary assistance, mandatory spending of assistance on healthcare and
   redistribution to poor countries. Programs with Commission monitoring
   (and recommendations) receive extra support from high -income and
   highly-educated individuals. Also, the latter group specifically favors
   potential or mandatory cross-border redistribution. The independent role
   of individual European attachment suggests that instruments other than
   socioeconomic policies, e.g. better information provision about its use,
   may help raise support for an EU assistance instrument.},

Title = {Do your tax problems make tax evasion seem more justifiable? Evidence
   from a survey experiment},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Taxpayers often view tax rules and filing processes as complicated. I
   study whether the perceived tax uncertainty among peers makes tax
   evasion more acceptable among the general public. I find strong
   supportive evidence for this hypothesis using a survey experiment and a
   large representative sample of the German population. Providing
   randomized information that others are uncertain about how to file their
   taxable income decreases individual support for tax compliance. This
   suggests that subjects judge tax evasion less harshly in response to
   this peer information. Studying related heterogeneous treatment effects,
   I find that both older and left-wing subjects are more responsive to tax
   uncertainty of others. Less harsh views on evasion are persistent for
   very high compliance levels in a follow-up survey.},

Title = {Trust and attitudes toward income inequality: Does individualism matter?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the last decade authors have increasingly examined the role of two
   cultural traits - trust and individualism - on a variety of economic
   outcomes ranging from gendered attitudes to entre-preneurship, human
   capital accumulation, and economic development. While both have positive
   effects, recent literature suggests that the effects of trust are often
   conditional on other variables, and this aspect has been neglected in
   the literature. Indeed, a recent paper found that with respect to
   gendered attitudes, there are important interactions between the traits
   of trust and individu-alism. Building on this foundation we explore how
   views of trust and individualism interact to affect attitudes about
   income inequality. Our results show that while views regarding social
   trust generally positively affect the desire for income equality, this
   effect is strengthened in the pres-ence of high individualism.
   Alternatively stated, distrust in highly individualistic environments
   leads to a greater desire for income differences (inequality). Our
   result highlights the important role played by market-based price and
   profit incentives in fostering economic activity and ex-change in
   larger, impersonal extended orders where interpersonal trust and
   reputational effects are generally absent (in contrast to personal,
   small group exchange). Our results are robust to a variety of techniques
   to establish identification and account for sample selection and omitted
   variable bias.},

Title = {Obedience to the symbol of authority: Experimental evidence on the
   symbolic source of legitimate authority{*}},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The performance of government activities, including law enforcement and
   regulation, depends on whether citizens perceive them as legitimate.
   Although substantial studies have explored the institutional sources of
   legitimacy, how non-institutional factors affect perceived legitimacy
   remains unclear. Human societies have a long history of employing
   symbolic icons to enhance the legitimacy of a given authority. This
   study reports a laboratory experiment of public goods that investigates
   whether (and to what extent) symbolic factors enhance perceived
   legitimacy. In the contexts of various incentive schemes and
   transparency levels, an ``authority{''} in each group decides whether to
   target a ``citizen{''} for punishment after observing the contributions
   of ``citizens,{''} and untargeted citizens then choose to support or
   hinder the authority. A symbolic scepter is issued to the authority in
   the treated group, whereas this symbol is absent in the control group.
   The experimental results suggest that the political symbol significantly
   enhances the authority's legitimacy regardless of the payment scheme and
   information transparency. A further analysis shows that the political
   symbol is not associated with the authority's choices regarding
   enforcement. Rather, the symbol's effect on perceived legitimacy is
   primarily driven by the citizens' side-that is, the increasing intrinsic
   tendency to support authority.},

Abstract = {How does the withdrawal of troops after a military intervention
   supporting the government affect the number of rebel groups in the long
   term? This study argues that the withdrawal of foreign support for the
   government affects the number of rebels by directly provoking a
   nationalist backlash in the short term and threatening government
   legitimacy in the long term. Whether or not nationalism is provoked and
   whether legitimacy is enhanced or eroded depend on whether or not it was
   a humanitarian intervention. If rebels win, the intervention withdrawals
   also indirectly affect the number of rebel groups in the long term
   through the militias' presence. Using interrupted time-series estimates
   between 1961 and 2005, this study found that humanitarian intervention
   withdrawals decrease the number of rebel groups in the long term,
   whereas nonhumanitarian intervention withdrawals promote the growth of
   militias and increase the number of rebel groups.},

Abstract = {In 1951, performers from Daly River and Tiwi Islands Aboriginal
   communities staged a corroboree strike. The musicians and dancers had
   routinely entertained visiting cruise ships in the Darwin Botanic
   Gardens, but now joined dockside workers to protest the jailing and
   exiling of two Aboriginal agitators Lawrence Wurrpen (Urban) and Fred
   (Nadpur) Waters. In Melbourne, the Australian Aborigines' League
   expressed solidarity with the Darwin strikes and protested the exclusion
   of Aboriginal voices from the Jubilee of Australian Federation. The
   League's leaders Doug Nicholls and Bill Onus produced a new work of
   musical theatre featuring east coast Aboriginal performers Fred Foster,
   Margaret Tucker, Georgia Lee, Harold Blair, and others in `Out of the
   Dark - An Aboriginal Moomba'. In this paper we examine political uses of
   performance in Australia's assimilation era, and show how Aboriginal
   agitators used music and dance to connect struggles for rights across
   Australia, and to keep cultural identity alive. In doing so we show how
   performance operated both as work and as assertion of cultural
   sovereignty.},

   Settlement1},

Abstract = {During the Second World War, Australia received almost \$2 billion worth
   of Lend-Lease aid from the United States - the largest foreign debt ever
   incurred by the Commonwealth. The settlement terms for this debt,
   however, were never defined or discussed during that conflict, remaining
   ``an uncertain obligation to be assessed by an unknown person on an
   unspecified day of judgment.{''}(2) This paper examines the economic,
   military, and geopolitical factors that shaped Australia's Lend-Lease
   Settlement Agreement of June 1946. It focusses on the military aircraft
   which accounted for a quarter of this foreign debt. The least saleable
   of all Lend-Lease surpluses, these also proved the most challenging for
   US and Australian negotiators. Having contested initial US claims and
   secured sizeable debt reductions, Lend-Lease settlement was trumpeted by
   the Chifley government as a great diplomatic success. Findings from this
   investigation indicate instead that Australia's Lend-Lease settlement
   terms were restrictive, and possibly punitive, having been substantially
   determined by US domestic and partisan-political considerations.
   Moreover, these details and their significant implications were withheld
   from the public, the media, and the parliamentary opposition in the
   months leading to the September 1946 federal election.},

Abstract = {This introduction to the special section explores geopolitical
   dimensions of conflict and violence in cities, pointing at the need to
   continue learning from marginal urban settings. It broadens the scope
   across differentiated approaches, such as the francophone and anglophone
   urban geopolitical traditions. By opening up a wider perspective, the
   emphasis is not on cities as part of a matrix of global hierarchies of
   geographical power but on the multiscalar relational significance of
   urban geopolitical inquiry. The introduction positions the special
   section articles within a wider review of urban geopolitical
   provocations outlining a new political vocabulary of urban conflict and
   violence. It concludes with a general call for a methodological and
   empirical broadening of the field of urban geopolitics as part of a
   broader de-colonial social and spatial science research agenda bridging
   the disciplines of political geography, urban studies, architecture and
   planning.},

Abstract = {Rather than rewarding applicants seeking relief from the draconian 1905
   Aborigines Act, Exemption Certificates in Western Australia became a
   bureaucratic weapon to enforce their rigid control through enforced
   prohibitions on alcohol for Nyungar people. Applications were routinely
   rejected, regardless of the applicant's way of life, which quickly
   deteriorated under the ``care{''} of the Aborigines Department. At the
   same time, new laws further enforcing prohibitions through increased
   fines and imprisonment, meant few had any hope of release. This
   combination derailed the exemption process. The injustices were recently
   revealed by the Ancestors' Words: Nyungar Letter Writing in the Archives
   Project, which located activist application letters written by Ancestors
   of today's Nyungar families, letters which were held for many decades in
   archive files of the Aborigines Department. The files also contained
   devastating letters of rejection written by the Minister, his officers
   and local police. The Ancestors' letters of courage and their
   distressing rejections in reply are examined here in a powerful case
   study developed in conversations between two Nyungar Elders, the
   writer's granddaughter, and the project researcher. The study also
   reveals how the project's respectful return of letters to the Elders can
   restore these important stories from the past to the flow of living
   family memories, down the generations.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesWhile some argue that parties reduce voter uncertainty to
   attract more votes, others claim that parties increase vote shares when
   beclouding their policy positions. To address the puzzle, I argue that
   as the degree of consensual characteristics increases, strategic
   uncertainty is electorally more helpful because parties in consensus
   models should consider the governing coalition and facilitate
   cooperation with other parties due to multiparty systems. MethodsUsing
   the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, I employ multilevel modeling
   to analyze 335 parties in 32 countries including both advanced and
   postcommunist democracies. ResultsI find empirical evidence that as the
   political institutions have more consensus models, it is more beneficial
   (or less costly at least) for parties to pursue voter uncertainty with
   broad appealing strategies primarily in advanced democracies.
   ConclusionThe findings suggest that democratic institutional settings
   shape the incentives for parties to adopt either broad or narrow appeals
   in the context of party competition.},

Abstract = {A substantial number of soldiers develop moral injuries, yet just as
   many do not. Therefore, it is important to explore the question: How do
   military service members generally interpret and cope with moral
   challenges related to their profession? This article analyzes the
   accounts of 80 (former) soldiers, examining how they perceived their
   profession and the coping strategies they tend to use in the face of
   moral challenges. The findings show that they generally did not
   experience as much moral tension as one might expect. Yet, when they
   did, they used coping strategies of simplification, justification, and
   rationalization, including doing good, rules and instructions,
   reciprocity, numbing, and compartmentalization. This leads to a middle
   position between the view that military personnel never experience moral
   challenges and the position that they find violence actually highly
   problematic, with important implications for research on moral injury,
   trauma, and soldiers' experience.},

Abstract = {Objective: Despite declining and historically low membership, labor
   unions remain important and relevant actors in American politics.
   Accordingly, we have learned a good deal about the economic and
   political consequences of labor unions and union membership. However, we
   know less about the dynamics, determinants, and political consequences
   of public attitudes toward organized labor.
   Methods: I use a variety of survey data to (1) track public support for
   labor unions over time, (2) to examine the microlevel determinants of
   labor attitudes, and (3) to examine how such attitudes shape voting
   behavior in national elections.
   Results: First, I show that American public opinion has consistently
   been ``pro-labor{''} and that such sentiment is growing in recent years,
   despite historically low levels of union membership. Second, I show that
   while the strongest individual-level correlate of union support is labor
   union affiliation, pluralities, and in some cases majorities, of
   nonunion-affiliated Americans hold ``pro-labor{''} attitudes as well.
   Finally, I show that labor union attitudes significantly predict (among
   both union and nonunion-affiliated Americans) support for the Democratic
   presidential candidate, net of partisanship, ideology, core political
   values, and macroeconomic conditions.
   Conclusion: Overall, these results show that low levels of union
   membership do not imply an ``anti-union{''} mass public. These findings
   also demonstrate that attitudes toward labor unions are politically
   consequential.},

Abstract = {This article responds to the analysis about the Spanish Emergency
   Military Unit in the research note by Perez et al. in Armed Forces \&
   Society, which emphasizes the efficiency of the Spanish Emergency
   Military Unit and how it has enhanced the image of the Spanish Armed
   Forces. We believe that a more critical understanding of the development
   of this military unit is necessary, as its deployment pitfalls and the
   literature on civil-military relations were neglected. Consequently,
   four policy traps are identified: response to civilian emergencies has
   become a central task of the armed forces rather than an auxiliary role;
   behind the pragmatism of its employment, there is potential for a
   worsening of civil-military relations, as highlighted by the scholarly
   literature; there are serious inefficiencies in its organizational
   design, related to human and financial resources; and image improvement
   is an illusion, strongly conditioned by political cleavages, with
   potential long-term counterproductive results.},

Title = {The Empirical Determinants of Violent Nonstate Actor Drone Adoption},
Journal = {ARMED FORCES \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {883-912},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Commercial drone advancements have enabled terrorists with crude
   airpower, challenging states' aerial dominance. Today, many groups
   skillfully use drones for propaganda generation, surveillance and
   reconnaissance, command and control, and attacks. Despite their obvious
   value, there is wide variation in adoption begging questions about who
   is using drones and why. Prominent in practitioner and security provider
   circles, academics are just skimming the surface of this important
   phenomenon. The small existing literature suggests that violent nonstate
   actor drone use is little more than Iran-sponsored jihadist terrorists
   with territory in the Middle East. Using an original data set on
   characteristics across 998 armed nonstate groups from 1995 to 2019, we
   explore the empirical determinants of drone adoption. Although
   Iran-sponsorship is a significant factor, we find that network
   affiliations are the strongest predictors of adopting a drone program.
   We also demonstrate that groups with more intensive attack profiles and
   narco groups are more likely to pursue unmanned aerial systems. Our
   study provides the first quantitative probe of the drivers of armed
   nonstate drone use, putting academic assertions and policy prescriptions
   on firmer empirical ground.},

Abstract = {The prominence of the figure of Don Juan marks the Spanish literature on
   masculinities which will be analyzed in this article. This distinctive
   trait, obvious when comparing it to English-speaking masculinity
   studies, is responsible for the highest achievements of masculinity
   studies in Spain. Those studies benefit from the fact that the figure of
   Don Juan is a stylization of modern masculinity. Other historiographies
   could also benefit from it, but for that to happen, Spanish scholars
   must intensify their dialogue with those historiographies. A critical
   thinking on masculinities based on Don Juan will not be beneficial,
   however, if Don Juan is taken as a description of a specific territory,
   whether it be Castile, Spain or Latin America. Beyond Don Juan, the
   relation between masculinity and nation and with other phenomena on the
   process of modernization has concentrated a good deal of effort among
   Spanish scholars; this article contends that the figure of Don Juan
   could shed new light on that field of research.},

Abstract = {Military service can require soldiers to act beyond their moral beliefs,
   something that can impair soldiers' mental health. However, little is
   known about the shaping of soldiers' moral identity within their
   institutional context. This article explores how the moral identity of
   20 experienced Norwegian soldiers is (re-)shaped in the Army. Findings
   from unstructured interviews suggest that they accept compromising their
   moral beliefs and give priority to an institutional obligation to follow
   orders. They present three mediating arguments justifying such a
   compromise and one effort to reduce the potential burden of carrying out
   illegal or immoral orders. I argue that these compromises are made
   possible through a shared belief they are socialized into through
   interactions in their military context. The study complements our
   knowledge of socialization processes in the military and identifies two
   theoretical concepts useful to gain knowledge about the (re-)shaping of
   soldiers' moral identity.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {77},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The population exchange of 1923 between Greece and Turkey consolidated
   the influx of more than 1.5 million refugees from Anatolia and East
   Thrace into Greece. In this article, we exploit the regional
   distribution of refugees at the sub-prefectural (province) level as a
   natural experiment in order to delineate the political effects of what
   the Greeks call the Asia Minor Catastrophe. We find that the settlement
   of refugees produced positive persistent effects on the electoral share
   of left-wing parties in the interwar and postwar periods. This is
   particularly the case for provinces with a high settlement rate of
   refugees originating from Asia Minor rather than from East Thrace or the
   Black Sea region. However, the refugee impact on the left-wing vote
   disappears completely in the post-dictatorship period.},

Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Drawing on an online survey of mayors from the German federal state of
   Baden-Wuerttemberg this article analyses (1) to what extent social media
   is used abusively at the municipal level, (2) how mayors react to hate
   speech and (3) whether the experience of such insulting comments and
   threats is correlated with their perception of social media as a tool
   for political communication. The analysis shows that hateful comments
   are part of the social media experience on the local level. 53.9\% of
   the mayors have at least once experienced personal insults and
   hostilities on social media in their role as politicians. The majority
   of them (56.7\%) ignored the hate speech without reaction. Significantly
   fewer reacted more actively: 29.8\% responded to the insulting message,
   5.4\% blocked the hater, and 8.2\% filed a judicial complaint. The
   statistical analysis shows that mayors who use social media in a more
   professional way are more likely to react to hate speech in such an
   active manner. Moreover, the experience of hate speech and particularly
   an active type of reacting are found to be positively related to mayors'
   perceptions of how useful they consider social media to be for political
   communication.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that infrastructuring can be a driver of
   regionalization. Referring to the case of the Ruhr region in Germany, it
   shows how regional water governance outpaces other metropolitan
   governance initiatives in a context of competing regionalizations. The
   explanation for this result is strong output legitimacy attributed to
   the organization being in charge of waste water treatment. The Ruhr
   region has a long and ongoing history of city-regional collaboration,
   with regional planning and watershed management being the main functions
   that have found institutional anchors. In 1899, the Prussian government
   created the Emschergenossenschaft, an inter-municipal association
   responsible for waste water treatment, the sewage system and flood
   control. The Emscher Association gained prominence from the late 1990s
   onwards as it is responsible for the construction of a new sewage system
   and the regeneration of the Emscher River, which has been used for more
   than a century as an open sewer for industrial and municipal waste
   water. The case demonstrates that infrastructure regionalism opens new
   avenues of research.},

Abstract = {When do political communities support territorial amalgamation in
   referendums? Existing research has identified heterogeneity between
   communities as a key hurdle for integration reforms. In this paper, I
   demonstrate that asymmetries between communities do not necessarily
   impede political integration. An analysis of 1500 municipal merger
   referendums held in Swiss municipalities since the new millennium shows
   that voters' support for integration is lower when potential merger
   partners are poorer or larger than their own community. However, the
   effects of wealth and size differences are interdependent. They
   reinforce each other's effect on merger support if they point in the
   same direction, for example, in a relatively rich and relatively small
   community, but they can also cancel each other out, for example, in a
   relatively small, but relatively poor community. These results have
   important implications for understanding under which conditions
   integration reforms are politically feasible.},

Abstract = {I investigate the impact of voter turnout on top marginal tax rates in
   OECD countries between 1974 and 2013. I find that higher turnout leads
   to higher taxes for top earners, a result broadly consistent with the
   median voter theorem. Using novel survey data, I confirm that
   individuals in all but the wealthiest income bracket prefer higher taxes
   on the rich more than they prefer greater government spending in the
   economy. In line with these preferences, I find that turnout has a
   significantly negative effect on top income shares but no effect on the
   size of government or on public welfare expenditure. An instrumental
   variables approach confirms my findings. Overall, the paper is the first
   of its kind to link turnout to measures of redistribution that affect
   top earners and to preferences for redistribution.},

Title = {Extending the Cognitive Mediation Model to Examine Public Support for

Abstract = {Despite the rapid development of science and technology (S\&T) in China,
   few studies have examined the factors related to public opinions toward
   funding S\&T development. Using a nationwide sample from an online
   survey in China (N = 702), this study examined how Chinese attention to
   S\&T information on digital media was associated with public support for
   funding, based on an extended cognitive mediation model, in which their
   scientific literacy and nationalism toward scientific and technological
   development in China were examined as the outcomes of information
   consumption and as predictors of support for funding S\&T development.
   The results indicated that attention to S\&T information on digital
   media was positively associated with two information processing
   strategies-elaboration of S\&T information and digital media engagement
   with S\&T topics. Moreover, elaboration was positively related to
   scientific literacy and nationalism, whereas digital media engagement
   was positively associated with the nationalism but not with the
   literacy. Next, individuals' scientific literacy and nationalism were
   positively associated with their support for funding S\&T development.
   The theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveWe consider the primary sources of COVID-19 infection, the main
   precautionary actions taken, and common understandings of their
   difficulty and necessity in order to understand why it has been
   difficult to control the pandemic. MethodsOnline data collected in all
   50 states during the Delta wave of the pandemic (n = 10,022) are used to
   examine how infection occurs and evaluate 32 precautionary actions.
   ResultsThe most common source of respondent infection was at home, from
   someone they lived with. While most precautions were widely practiced,
   avoiding close contact with cohabitants was uncommon. This precaution
   was considered to be the most difficult and least necessary by a wide
   margin. ConclusionDuring the first 2 years of the pandemic, there was a
   mismatch between actions taken to avoid infection and the main way that
   people became infected. Many precautions caused people to stay at home,
   which may have increased their likelihood of infection. The
   identification of this ``paradox of precaution{''} contributes to an
   understanding of why the pandemic could not be controlled in spite of
   the extensive and well-intended precautions that were taken.},

Journal = {ARMED FORCES \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},

Number = {4},
Pages = {913-930},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Although the literature on veteran differences in science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupational outcomes by gender is
   established and veteran/nonveteran differences in STEM outcomes are well
   studied, we fill a gap in the literature by examining the following two
   research questions in this study: (1) are rural veterans less likely
   than urban veterans to be employed in a STEM occupation and how does
   race/ethnicity modify this relationship; (2) among veterans in a STEM
   occupation, does total income vary by rural/urban location and
   race/ethnicity? We retrieved data on employed military veterans (n =
   845,467) aged 18 to 65 years from the 2008-2020 American Community
   Survey. Results showed that rural-dwelling Black and Hispanic veterans
   were less likely than Whites to be employed in a STEM field. Among
   veterans employed in a STEM field, rural-dwelling Hispanics had lower
   annual incomes than Whites. As such, future STEM education programs
   should target rural-dwelling veterans of color.},

Title = {Financial inclusion in Egypt: the road ahead},

Abstract = {PurposeThe literature review stated that financial inclusion (FI)
   influences economic growth through different channels. Hence, this paper
   aims to investigate the underlying process of FI in Egypt theoretically,
   and to derive some policy implications for promoting the process and
   achieving more improvement in different financial and economic aspects,
   that is basically through discussing the opinions of FI's main
   stockholders in Egypt.Design/methodology/approachThe analysis used
   secondary data from the Global Findex and FAS Database, namely,
   automated teller machines, outstanding deposits and loans with
   commercial banks, debit and credit cards ownership. The research
   particularly used scientific methods as method of deduction, methods of
   graphical and tabular representation of data, comparative analysis and
   synthesis of partial knowledge. The paper is also based on a descriptive
   approach in addition to in-depth interviews with the main stakeholders
   of the financial inclusion process in Egypt.FindingsThe analyzed results
   of interviews revealed that new FI vision should have a deep
   understanding of the financial lives of the poor and low-income groups,
   including how they acquire, manage and use their money. However, the
   impact is becoming more prominent for the efficiency of the banking
   system and hence economic growth rather a regulatory and sound
   institutional framework enhances it. This finding supported the fact
   that Egypt can design an appropriate FI strategy, but the main challenge
   is how to implement it with the required speed and outreach capacity,
   especially in underprivileged communities.Research
   limitations/implicationsThe result of this study has interesting
   implications for Egypt's ability to attain effective FI initiatives that
   promote sound financial choices and behavior which in turn help to
   stimulate financial and economic growth.Originality/valueThe study
   contributes to the literature by assessing the FI level in Egypt, its
   implications and how it should be enhanced for better performance and
   results in the future. It addresses the deep fact of this process
   through inclusive surveys and interviews that help in determining the
   road ahead.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the reception of an international medical team in
   the Medical Relief Corps (CAM) of China's Red Cross (CRC). A team of
   seventeen doctors and two nurses who participated in the Spanish civil
   war as volunteers in the International Brigades joined the CAM in
   Tuyunguan, in the province of Guizhou, between July 1939 and October
   1940. This article profits from several primary sources, amongst them,
   the archive of the CAM, and the memoires of some of these doctors. The
   article aims to draw general conclusions from a specific case study by
   using the methodology of global microhistory. The incorporation of a
   sanitary team from the International Brigades to the CAM was possible
   thanks to the efforts of several internationalist associations. However,
   this process was fraught with difficulties, due to individual
   divergences, institutional constraints, and the global instability
   during the first year of the Second World War. The article analyses
   these problems, which hindered the practice of internationalist actions
   in that context of total war. However, despite these impediments, the
   CAM ultimately benefited from the experience of that sanitary team to
   improve its know-how in war medicine.},

Abstract = {The engine that drives prosperity in the modern world is the
   increasingly rapid emergence of use-ful knowledge. The aim of the paper
   is to present the basic ideas of the economic theory of in-novation. The
   first part of the paper outlines the theory of endogenous growth and
   technological change. The second part reveals the nature of innovation.
   The third part presents creative destruc-tion as part of technological
   development. The fourth part explains the paradox of progress: why we
   produce more from less. The fifth part outlines the future as an age of
   abundance.},

Abstract = {Max Weber was a forerunner and one of the most innovative sociologists
   of his time. Among the many and diverse contributions to his extensive
   work, this article aims to highlight his importance and pioneering
   spirit in the analysis of ethnic and racial re-lations. Based on the
   fact that Romani people (known as Ciganos in Portugal) comprise the most
   numerous minority in Europe (10-12 million), we aim to discuss the
   relevance and limits of certain conceptual tools and forms of (self)
   categorization of Ciganos/ Roma, namely those based on racial and ethnic
   phenomena, revisiting Max Weber's writings. Based on a qualitative study
   carried out on Portuguese Ciganos/Roma, using in-depth interviews of
   women and men resident in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, we seek to
   question the pertinence of these forms of categorization when applied in
   operative and empirical ways to Ciganos/Roma persons in contemporaneity.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes relationships between Islamic religious behaviors
   and civic engagement in Europe and North America. Using data from an
   original survey of Muslims in Canada, France, Germany, the UK, and the
   United States, it finds that Muslim religious behaviors relate to civic
   behaviors in varied ways. The conventional distinction between public
   and private religious behaviors does not graft perfectly on to Islamic
   religious behaviors, but the way Islamic religious behaviors straddle
   the public-private divide help explain their relationships with civic
   behaviors. Mosque attendance, an example of public religious behavior,
   is positively associated with secular organizational membership and
   mainstream political behaviors, and negatively associated with protest
   activity. Private, or quasi-private, religious behaviors are more
   commonly associated with protest activities. There are some
   national-level differences in patterns of civic engagement after
   controlling for other determinants, but not many, suggesting similar
   mechanisms mobilize and facilitate Muslim civic incorporation across
   national contexts. The results suggest that Islamic religious behaviors
   create diverse opportunities for Muslims to engage as civic citizens.},

Abstract = {The paper challenges mainstream theories of Latin American development,
   showing their theoretical weaknesses and pointing to their role in
   ideologically mediating the region's `truncated' capitalism. To that
   end, the paper presents an alternative view of Latin American
   development that starts by considering capitalist social reproduction as
   a worldwide process and regional/national politico -economic development
   as mediations in the structuring of global capital accumulation. Latin
   America's specific variety of capitalism is understood to have emerged
   from its original transformation by expanding European capital into a
   place to produce raw materials under favourable natural conditions. On
   the one hand, this has reduced their price and that of the labour -power
   directly or indirectly consuming them; on the other, it has resulted in
   a flow of surplus -value towards the owners of those natural conditions
   of production. The historical development of Latin American societies
   has expressed the partial overcoming of that antagonistic relationship
   between rent -paying capital and rent -appropriating landed property.},

Title = {Revolutionary resistance against full autocratization. Actors and
   strategies of resistance after the 2021 military coup in Myanmar},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {Resistance against autocratization is an important contemporary issue
   that calls for increased scholarly attention. The global wave of
   autocratization has generated a proliferation of research on the drivers
   of autocratization, but fewer studies on the possibilities, strategies,
   spatialities, and effectiveness of resistance. This article responds to
   these knowledge needs through a case study of revolutionary resistance
   against full autocratization in Myanmar after the 2021 military coup.
   The article examines the junta's strategies for autocratic control,
   trace the development of the resistance movement and analyze its
   strategies, spatialities and effectiveness. The article shows that the
   coup has been followed by a mass resistance movement that is remarkably
   successful in countering the regime strategies for authoritarian
   consolidation and survival. We argue that this effectiveness rests on
   the movement's ability to deploy mutually reinforcing strategies of
   economic, symbolic, political, and armed resistance to contest the
   military's claims on state authority, legitimacy, economic resources,
   and monopoly of armed force. The Myanmar case thus confirms the
   centrality of civil resistance under full autocratization, but also
   points to the importance of insurgent political institutions and armed
   resistance to counter authoritarian repression, legitimation, and
   co-optation strategies. The case study also shows that the spatialities
   of resistance strategies - being both embedded in places and territories
   and extended through spatial networks and scalar strategies - are key
   contributors to the effectiveness of the movement. This broad
   mobilization behind a common revolutionary goal offers the best prospect
   for defeating military dictatorship in Myanmar and provides relevant
   lessons for similar cases elsewhere.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates how party connections affect the ability of
   local politicians to obtain central government funds for their
   municipality. Using a novel data set for mayoral elections in Germany
   spanning 2322 municipalities in eight states in the years 2000 to 2008
   and regression discontinuity design, I find that party alignment between
   a local mayor and the state government increases transfers to a
   municipality by 20\% per year. Such favoritism has been interpreted as a
   sign of partisanship and blamed on central governments which use public
   funds for partisan purposes. I show that local political conditions,
   such as reelection incentives and information transmission can partly
   account for the alignment effect. Taken together, the results provide
   alternative channels for the interpretation of alignment effects.},

Abstract = {Governments implemented fiscal stimulus packages to alleviate the global
   financial crisis of 2007-2009. Using annual data from 1996 to 2019, we
   investigate economic growth in a large sample of countries for pre-and
   post-Global Financial Crisis years. Our approach analyzes the
   interaction between institutional quality and government size
   (government expenditures as share of GDP), reinforced by threshold
   estimations. We document that economies react to government size
   depending on the quality of the institutions in question. First, fixed
   effects models indicate higher institutional quality has positive
   effects on growth, while government size-and its interactions with
   institutional quality-has negative effects. Second, the coefficients of
   government size on economic growth are negative with higher
   institutional quality and become larger in the post-Global Financial
   Crisis years. These combined results indicate that higher-quality
   institutions make economies less tolerant of rising government
   expenditures than lower-quality institutions. Our main findings support
   institutional quality as the channel through which fiscal policy has
   real effects. The evidence herein is robust to measures of institutional
   quality from different databases.},

Title = {Where have all the sediments gone? Reservoir silting and sedimentary
   justice in the lower Ebro River},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {107},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {At the intersection of natural and social sciences, interest in river
   sedimentary fluxes and their alteration by human activities is
   increasing in the context of general retreat of delta formations. Since
   the 1950s, the construction of large dams in the main course of rivers
   has produced, among other impacts, a radical decrease in sedimentary
   fluxes - a key factor in the worldwide sedimentary crisis. While
   sediment accumulates in reservoirs, the resulting sediment scarcity
   downstream contributes to land subsidence and coastal erosion,
   endangering livelihoods in low lying areas such as river deltas.
   Focusing on the case of the Ebro River and delta (Spain), this article
   builds on Katherine Dawson's notion of sedimentary justice to examine
   the articulation of a social demand to mobilise the sediments trapped in
   reservoirs to counter delta subsidence and coastal erosion. Using a
   historical perspective and paying attention to matters of both sediment
   quantity and quality, we show how this demand has developed hand in hand
   with the emergence of a scientific interpretation of the Ebro delta's
   origins that emphasises non-human forces and the importance of
   sedimentary fluxes before human interferences. Activists have taken up
   this argument to demand the restoration of sedimentary fluxes, exposing
   corporate hydropower interests and insisting on the mobilisation of
   sediment trapped in reservoirs. Overall, by scrutinizing the power
   relations embedded in the immobilization of river sediments, this
   article contributes to recent work that integrates the materiality of
   sediment to the hydrosocial framework of analysis and argues that
   sedimentary justice provides new avenues to incorporate the non-human
   world to the literature on environmental and water justice.},

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},

Volume = {107},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article unravels the processes of abjection that render certain
   nonhumans as abject, devoid of value and amenable to elimination and
   killing. It argues that these processes play a constitutive role in
   practices of statemaking and sovereign power. Abjection works towards
   the exclusion and rejection of certain parts of a supposed
   socio-material order, which, for one reason or another, confuse dominant
   categorizations, trespass certain spatial boundaries or challenge
   socially produced distinctions and hierarchies (Bataille, 1970 {[}1934];
   Kristeva, 1982). Abjected nonhumans thus regularly become the target of
   state-induced practices of elimination and culling - as is the case, for
   instance, with species classified as `invasive', as `pests', as
   `biosecurity threat' or as `disease reservoirs'. Yet, abjection also
   points to the ability of nonhumans to unsettle, challenge and confuse
   dominant boundaries and established orders. Abject beings inhabit
   ``unruly edges{''} (Tsing, 2012) from which they challenge and transcend
   sovereign impulses to order, govern and eliminate their existence.
   Taking cue from previous works on abjection and sovereign power, on the
   one hand, and works on the role of nonhumans in political processes, on
   the other, I argue that abjection and state-making are not only
   intertwined but also crucially played out in relation to nonhuman forms
   of life and death. My wider conceptual aim is to illustrate what an
   engagement with processes of abjection has to offer for the agenda of
   more-than-human political geographies.},

Title = {Residential concentration and political engagement among racialized
   Canadians: The moderating role of intragroup contact},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {107},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Does living in communities with others from the same racialized minority
   background help or hinder political engagement? What role does social
   interaction with members of the same racialized minority group
   (intragroup contact) play? This paper addresses these questions with a
   systematic empirical investigation of political engagement in a large
   sample of racialized Canadians. Prior research assumes greater
   residential concentration of racialized group members leads to
   intragroup contact, but there is disagreement about whether the
   conse-quence is higher or lower levels of political engagement among
   members of racialized minority groups. We find no evidence that the
   residential concentration of Canadians from racialized groups has any
   independent effect on the political attitudes of racialized Canadians
   from the same groups. However, there is strong evidence of a more
   complex, conditional dynamic: if racialized minorities exhibit
   substantial intragroup social ties, then higher local concentrations of
   people from the same racial background leads to greater levels of
   political engagement among racialized minorities; however, if racialized
   minorities exhibit weak intragroup social ties, then higher local
   concentrations of people from the same racial background results in
   lower levels of political engagement among racialized minorities.
   Moreover, we find that, in part, this dynamic may be an indirect
   consequence of the ways in which non-racialized populations respond to
   local racial diversity. The findings may help to account for the
   incongruent results of previous studies of the effects of residential
   concentration on the political engagement of members of racialized
   minority groups.},

Title = {Regulating tuwei culture and migrant youth through Kuaishou's
   platform governance},
Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {This study examines the platform governance of Kuaishou, a popular
   short-video and live streaming platform that attracts many youngsters
   from rural areas in China. The platform's economy encourages these
   migrant youth to participate as content producers, offering them hope
   for upward mobility. Nevertheless, their cultural practices have
   frequently faced criticism for being vulgar and low-brow. This article
   focuses on the evolving forms of platform governance, exploring how the
   state and the platform collaborate to devise new strategies for
   regulating users' cultural practices and how migrant youth creatively
   respond to increasing censorship measures. Drawing on over 4 years of
   field observation spanning from July 2017 to February 2022, this study
   investigates the dynamic process of the state's alliance with the
   platform. This alliance encompasses a range of approaches, from direct
   control to co-optation and cooperation, as both the platform and its
   users actively engage with the state's political agenda to avoid
   punitive measures. The research suggests that migrant youth's platform
   practices cannot be simply characterized as a subculture subordinate to
   state-approved narratives. Instead, they represent a complex negotiation
   involving the platform, the state, and subaltern subjects.},

Title = {Transition from Idealized Science to Culture of Skepticism in South
   Korea: Micro-Level Evidence for the Two-Culture Model of Public
   Understanding of Science},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Using data from a national survey in South Korea, this study offers
   micro-level evidence for the two-culture model of public understanding
   of science, which posits that a shift from an industrializing to a
   post-industrial society is accompanied by a transition from a culture of
   idealized science to a culture of skepticism. We investigate whether
   older South Koreans, who spent much of their lives during the intense
   industrialization of the country, hold more positive perceptions about
   science than younger generations, who grew up mostly in a
   post-industrial era. As predicted, older individuals perceived greater
   contributions of science, suggesting that they held more idealized
   perceptions of science than younger individuals. Perceived importance of
   economic development, scientific knowledge, ideology, uncertainty of
   scientific risks, and formal education mediated the link between age and
   perceived contributions of science, suggesting that these mediators may
   function as causal mechanisms that could explain why citizens in
   post-industrial societies tend to have more skeptical perceptions about
   science than those in industrializing countries.},

Title = {Political monetary cycles: An empirical study},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {79},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {After decades of research, discussions related to the link between
   political events and monetary policy have been ongoing. The purpose of
   this study is to examine whether electorally induced cycles in monetary
   policy exist. To achieve this, a unique panel dataset comprising 110
   countries over 32 periods (1985-2016) was constructed, incorporating
   election periods and political regimes. This study provides evidence
   that elections influence monetary policy in developed and developing
   countries. Specifically, the study reveals that the growth of monetary
   mass (measured as the growth rate of M1) is significantly higher during
   pre-electoral periods. On average, the growth of monetary mass is
   between 1.1\% and 2\% higher during the 12 months prior to a national
   election. Furthermore, the study conducts an extensive analysis on the
   type of institutional frameworks that may mitigate these political
   monetary cycles. it suggest that free and fair elections, left-wing
   incumbents and the seniority of central banks contributes to reducing
   the magnitude these political monetary cycles.},

Abstract = {We use comparative constitutions project (CCP) data to explore whether
   Constitutions that follow revolutions are designed differently. We
   employ matching methods using 36 treatments (revolutionary
   Constitutions) and 162 control units (new Constitutional adoptions
   without a revolution). We find some evidence that revolutionary
   Constitutions are less rigid (i.e., their procedural barriers to
   amendment are weaker). Otherwise, revolutionary Constitutions seem
   similar to non-revolutionary ones. However, we do find strong evidence
   that revolutionary Constitutions are associated with a greater
   likelihood of ex post democracy. The results (less rigid, higher
   likelihood of democracy) hold for those not associated with ending
   colonial rule or the fall of the USSR. The greater ex post democracy
   result is reported for various democracy measures.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveTaxation is crucial for revenue, political participation, and
   the demand for accountability in Africa. Most existing theories do not
   predict tax attitudes in informal economies with weak institutional
   capacity nor do they demonstrate how service delivery translates to
   stronger tax regimes. This article examines the fiscal exchange theory-
   how government's expenditure affects voluntary compliance-across Africa,
   showing mechanisms through which service delivery affects tax morale.
   MethodsThe study uses a public opinion survey of over 41,000 respondents
   from 29 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The statistical analysis
   employs an ordered logit model and linear probability model to test the
   hypotheses. ResultsThe study finds that service delivery determines tax
   attitudes. In addition, the study examines aspects of service delivery
   that are of most concern to citizens and finds that services that cater
   to individual needs are stronger in inducing tax morale than those that
   address collective needs. The article also finds that citizens'
   acknowledgement of receipt of goods is not an indication of inherent
   incumbent support. ConclusionThis study sought to understand the
   relationship between different modes of service delivery and the
   likelihood of having tax morale among African citizens and ultimately
   sheds light upon citizen-state relationships, effective governance, and
   voluntary compliance.},

Abstract = {This paper is about the liberatory affective states associated with
   participation in naked body protests. The article will also touch on
   notions of gender as performative and located within the habitus, since
   affective states are intertwined with gender performance, embodiment and
   social construction. Exploration of these phenomena is done by analysing
   interview data from 16 women who participated in various naked body
   protests in South Africa. These include protests in Dobsonville, Soweto
   in 1990 and student protests at four universities in 2016. The study
   draws upon Wetherell's theorisation of affect, especially their concept
   of affective practice. The findings illustrate that affects are always
   embedded in acts and practices, including forms of protest. In addition,
   using Judith Butler's gender performativity theory, the study
   demonstrates that naked body protests have performative possibilities
   that both reify and challenge gender.},

Abstract = {I argue that health insurance emerged as an important aspect of Nixon's
   domestic policy agenda as a result of ``policy escalation.{''} By policy
   escalation, I mean a cascading line of reasoning that causes policy
   makers focused on one apparently discrete issue to formulate approaches
   for dealing with other interconnecting policy areas. Policy escalation
   serves as an internal agenda-setting mechanism: as policy makers
   contemplate policy changes, they may attempt to imagine the ways in
   which change will affect the rationale, fiscal position, and execution
   of programs in other policy areas. In the case of health insurance, the
   Nixon administration's proposal for replacing Aid to Families with
   Dependent Children with a guaranteed minimum income forced policy makers
   to consider how the new program would interact with the existing
   Medicaid program. Consideration of this question ultimately led them to
   formulate an approach to overhauling the nation's entire health
   insurance system.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A growing body of literature scrutinizes the harmful consequences of
   capital flight to offshore financial destinations. While financial
   integration is a well-known facilitator of capital flight, we shed light
   on an under-appreciated determinant-the availability of an IMF bailout.
   Expanding on previous literature analyzing moral hazard in the context
   of IMF programs, we introduce a socially even more destructive mechanism
   that we label the `crash for cash' effect. We argue that by drawing on
   the IMF, elites can benefit from accumulating excessive debt to extract
   rents and hide these safely in offshore financial destinations while
   steering their countries into financial disaster. To test this
   mechanism, we show that elite wealth in offshore bank accounts has a
   first-order impact on a captured government's willingness to draw on a
   lender of last resort. From a policy perspective, our analysis
   underscores the importance of closing financial loopholes to mitigate
   the devastating socio-economic effects of sophisticated financial
   engineering in a financially integrated global economy.},

Abstract = {The effect of inequality on income bias in voting is a contentious topic
   in the literature. In this article, we explore the effect of inequality
   in terms of social context. We argue that perceptions of inequality and
   regional economic inequality provide a social context in which citizens
   form relative class identity and shape their political behavior. We
   analyze individual-level surveys and administrative district-level data
   consisting of 252 South Korean administrative units in 2012-2020. The
   findings of the individual-level analysis suggest that perceptions of
   high inequality boost voter turnout, and that this effect is stronger
   among citizens with low incomes. As lower-income earners recognize
   themselves as being at a greater distance from the higher-income group,
   it activates a grievance effect and increases their incentive to
   participate in voting. The results from the district-level analysis
   suggest that the participation of lower-income individuals is more
   likely to increase in response to local inequality than the
   participation levels of their higher-income neighbors. Our findings
   suggest that the mass public utilizes their perceptions of inequality
   and the degree of intra-regional economic inequality as a heuristic to
   decide whether to turnout to vote, and that this occurs among both the
   rich and the poor.},

Title = {The Conditional Association Between Populism, Ideological Extremity, and
   Affective Polarization},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {In recent years there has been an increasing interest in whether
   populism is related to opinion extremity. Yet, research on the topic
   offers little direct evidence on whether and under which conditions
   populist ideas at the individual level are related to policy extremity
   and inter-party dislike. This article aims to fill this gap by focusing
   on the reasons populist individuals hold more or less extreme opinions.
   Using data from the 2016 American National Electoral Study, I find that
   populist attitudes are a strong correlate of both ideological extremity
   and affective polarization, yet this association is conditional on
   respondent's party affiliation. Populism is related to higher levels of
   ideological extremity among Democrats and stronger negative leader
   evaluations among Republicans. This finding indicates that the
   relationship between populism and citizens' political judgements varies
   depending on the ability of populist leaders to make certain dimensions
   of the competition salient (i.e., ideological or affective) and exploit
   pre-existing ideological and partisan rivalries (i.e., party identity).},

Abstract = {Can protest influence elections? We examine whether Black Lives Matters
   (BLM) protest during the summer of 2020 shaped the November presidential
   election. We hypothesize that BLM demonstrations are associated with
   increased voting for the Democratic candidate. We examine a secondary
   hypothesis that more contentious events (with arrests, injury, or
   violence) are likely to produce a negative impact. We use data collected
   from news media, official election returns, and survey data combined
   with demographic and political control measures to test our hypotheses.
   We find strong evidence that BLM protests were associated an increased
   likelihood of voting for the Democratic candidate, with this effect
   concentrated among the less contentious protest events. Our findings
   bolster and extend the emerging theoretical claims and evidence that
   protest plays a substantial role in shaping electoral behavior.},

Title = {Transmission and territory: Urban bordering during COVID-19},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {104},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The governance of COVID-19 has involved the proliferation of territorial
   practices, through border controls designed to regulate movements not
   only across national and state borders, but also within cities and city
   re-gions. We argue that these urban territorial practices have been
   significant to the biopolitics of COVID-19 and warrant close scrutiny.
   Focusing on the Australian cities of Sydney and Melbourne, this paper
   offers critical analysis of the urban territorial practices of COVID-19
   suppression, which we categorise as practices of closure, confinement
   and capacity control. We observe these practices in measures including
   `stay at home' orders, residential building and housing estate
   lockdowns, closure of and capacity limits on non-residential premises,
   postcode-and municipality-level restrictions on movement, and hotel
   quarantine. These measures, we argue, have reinforced and at times
   exacerbated pre-existing social and spatial inequalities. However, we
   also recognise COVID-19's real and highly uneven threats to life and
   health, and therefore ask what a more egalitarian form of pandemic
   governance might look like. We draw on scholarly writing on `positive'
   or `democratic' biopolitics and `territory from below', in order to
   outline some more egalitarian and democratic interventions that have
   been pursued to suppress viral transmission and to reduce vulnerability
   to COVID-19 and other viruses. This, we argue, is an imperative of
   critical scholarship as much as the critique of state interventions.
   Such alternatives do not necessarily reject state territorial
   interventions per se, but instead point towards a way of addressing the
   pandemic by recognising the capacity and legitimacy of biopolitics and
   territory from below. They point towards ways in which we might see a
   pandemic `like a city' in a way that prioritises egalitarian care
   through a politics premised on democratic negotiations among diverse
   urban authorities and sovereignties.},

Abstract = {Contemporary political and policy debate rhetoric increasingly employs
   the language of `rights': how they are assigned and what entitlements
   individuals in a society are due. While the obvious constitution design
   issues surround how rights enumeration affects the relationship between
   a government and its citizens, we instead analyze how rights framing
   impacts how citizens interact with each other. We design and implement a
   novel experiment to test whether social cooperation depends on the
   enumeration and positive or negative framing of the right of subjects to
   take a particular action. We find that when rights are framed
   positively, there exists an `entitlement effect' that reduces social
   cooperation levels and crowds-out the tendency of individuals to act
   pro-socially.},

Abstract = {Building upon previous studies that divide the governance of digital
   platforms into three eras (Flew, 2021; Bowers \& Zittrain, 2020), this
   study investigates how one of the most influential digital platforms,
   Google, has handled removal requests from governments. By sketching the
   regulatory terrain of Google, the current study seeks a more balanced
   understanding of content moderation. This study selected an exploratory
   case study approach using Google's Transparency reports and accompanying
   public data sets relating to governments' content removal requests filed
   for all Google products from 2009 to 2021. The findings reveal a growing
   influence of nation states on moderating online content, delineating the
   surging point as occurring in 2016. In addition to the sheer increase of
   take-down requests raised in various areas, since 2016 the trend of
   government interventions has outpaced those of courts; during the same
   period, Google, which had been more compliant with court decisions than
   with governmental entities' requests, showed similar compliance with
   government requests. The results also demonstrate how the practices of
   requesting content removal differed by political system while singling
   out Russia's distinctive characteristics. This study sheds light on our
   understanding of the role of nation states in shaping online
   environments in the era of platformization.},

Abstract = {We build a model based on a structural dynamic approach to assess the
   Non-Observed Economy (NOE) over the period 1990-2019 in France. Our
   strategy is focused on a systematic scan of the potential causes of
   shadow economy. We show that the discrepancy between electricity
   consumption and real GDP growth rates is the main drivers of the NOE.
   However, factors, such as drug offences and net shipments of banknotes
   also have significant effects on hidden activities even though their
   effects do not seem to be as strong. The NOE remains non-negligible in
   France, but its ratio, relative to the GDP, has decreased considerably
   in the 2000s. Finally, we observe strong links between the NOE index and
   the cash demand indicators. Thus, concordance tests show a noticeable
   synchronization between the NOE indexes (global and legal components)
   and the net issuance of banknotes, especially the total net issuance and
   the net issuance of the (sic)50 and (sic)200 denominations. Furthermore,
   the NOE indexes and GDP as well as self-employment are synchronized. We
   also observe positive correlations between the cyclical components of
   the total net issuance of banknotes and the estimated shadow economy
   indexes. Finally, there are some bi-directional causal relationships
   between the NOE indexes and the aggregate banknote demand. However,
   there is only a unidirectional causality between these indexes and the
   demand for Small denominations ((sic)5, (sic)10, (sic)20).},

Abstract = {The article contributes to literature that critically scrutinizes
   knowledge production and transfer in conflict and intervention contexts.
   Drawing on original research on the Tunisian transitional justice
   process, it contributes an empirically grounded picture to the study of
   co-production of governance orders and security knowledges through
   transnational assemblages. These transnational assemblages are formed by
   complex coalitions of actors from the Global North and South, and the
   socio-material context they operate in. The article shows how security
   knowledge is produced, channelled, and steered into confined knowledge
   flows as transitional justice processes unfold. It then shows the
   ambivalent nature and different qualities of confined knowledge flows as
   they may be enabling and limiting, exclusionary and protective, and
   implicated with power relations. By doing so, it contributes to the
   understanding of how the (neo-)liberal politics of transitional justice
   are reproduced.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the interest rate
   pass-through of euro area monetary policy to retail rates outside the
   euro area, contributing to the literature on the consequences of
   unofficial financial euroization and on the transmission channels of
   monetary policy spillovers. The results suggest that in the long run,
   more than the one-third of all euro retail rates in euroized countries
   of central, eastern, and south-eastern Europe is linked to the euro area
   shadow rate. Compared with euro area monetary policy, the share of
   cointegration of the domestic monetary policy rate is on average lower,
   suggesting that domestic central banks in euroized countries with
   independent monetary policy can only partially control the ``euro
   part{''} of the interest rate channel. Furthermore, euro area monetary
   policy shocks are fast and persistently transmitted into euro retail
   rates outside the euro area, which constitutes an additional channel of
   international shock transmission.},

Abstract = {Modern societies are characterized by unprecedently broad and fast
   diffusion of various forms of false and harmful information. Military
   personnel's motivation to defend their country may be harmed by their
   exposure to disinformation. Therefore, specific education and training
   programs should be devised for the military to systematically improve
   (social) media literacy and build resilience against information
   influence activities. In this article, we put forward a useful
   methodological approach to designing such programs based on a case
   study: the process of developing a media literacy learning platform
   tailored to the needs of the Estonian defense forces in 2021. The
   approach is grounded in data on (a) the current needs and skills of the
   learners, (b) the kinds of influence activities that the learners may
   encounter, and (c) the learning design principles that would enhance
   their learning experience, such as learning through play and dialogue
   through feedback.},

   mobilization in Chile},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {103},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We aim to explain the long-term territorial patterns of conflict across
   Mapuche communities in southern Chile. The Mapuche indigenous people
   have resisted external invasions by colonial settlers and the Chilean
   state for about five centuries. However, not all Mapuche communities
   have mobilized for their demands. While conflict between communities and
   external invaders has been a historical constant in certain areas, in
   others, Mapuche communities have remained largely passive. We explain
   subnational patterns of Mapuche mobilization by identifying
   path-dependent sequences -that range between conflictive and passive-
   that trace back to the social complexity of pre-colonial societies.
   Specifically, we claim that communities with stronger pre-colonial
   indigenous organization had a higher capacity to resist colonialism.
   Conversely, communities with weaker levels of organization had less
   capacity to mobilize to fend off colonialism. As a result,
   path-dependent sequences emerged, which persisted throughout the
   post-colonial period and explain the differing levels of conflict -or
   its absence- across Mapuche communities.},

Abstract = {The dominant narratives on how to confront climate change are often
   presented as neutral proposals concerned with the well-being of the
   planet and its inhabitants. The main objective of this article is to
   exemplify how concepts like Ecological Modernization and Sustainable
   Development are used in the name of energy transitions to prolong
   illegal military occupations in two territories, namely occupied Western
   Sahara and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. By combining first-hand
   and secondary data from our cases, we also expose the enduring
   coloniality of such concepts that have been critiqued not only for their
   lack of neutrality but also for their contribution to the denial of
   basic human rights such as self-determination, sovereignty, and the
   right to resourcehood. We argue that renewable energy projects, in the
   two settings studied, are a manifestation of an ecological modernization
   that ignores aspects of justice and self-determination. Although touted
   as a solution to mitigating climate change, wind energy development in
   these two cases violates international law and the principle of
   self-determination.},

Abstract = {In recent years, user-generated live streaming platforms have grown
   significantly in their popularity. However, the circulation of
   objectionable live streaming content and the unpredictability and
   high-intensity user engagement generated by live streaming has posed
   challenges to the existing regulatory frameworks. In China, the
   situation of regulating Zhibo (literally `live streaming') is arguably
   even more complex due to the rapid industrial changes, a mass scale of
   video content along with the Wanghong Economy, and fragmented internet
   governance. Drawing on interviews and analysis of regulatory documents,
   this study investigated the dynamic negotiations among regulatory actors
   in Chinese live streaming sectors, underscoring that the idea of
   multiple levels of self-regulation with minimal state oversight has
   become the principal strategy for regulating live streaming in a
   multiactor coordination context. Regulation of the Zhibo is
   characterized by a conflict between uneven accountability and
   decentralized regulatory activities in the contemporary regulatory
   regime.},

Abstract = {This article describes the work of the Forum on a Family Friendly and
   Inclusive Parliament (the Forum) which was established by the Ceann
   Comhairle (Speaker of Dail \& Eacute;ireann) in 2O21. The Forum was
   established to make recommendations that would result in a more family
   friendly parliamentary community that better reflects Irish society in
   terms of its diversity and inclusivity. The article discusses the terms
   of reference of the Forum, it describes the makeup of the Forum and how
   it worked to engage with stakeholders and made 51 recommendations. It
   then sets out some of the key recommendations and approaches to their
   implementation. The Forum is distinguished from similar initiatives in
   other parliaments because of its focus on the parliamentary community as
   a whole and not just the elected members, and further because it was
   focused on diversity and inclusivity beyond gender.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the theory of the plastic object as it was developed
   by the Peruvian art critic Mirko Lauer in the 1970s and 1980s, in
   dialogue with other ideas related to the Teoria Social del Arte (Social
   Theory of Art) developed in Latin America. Focusing on the Peruvian
   cultural debate, the author reconstructs Lauer's trajectory and
   emphasises his critique of `Marxist aesthetics', and explores them as
   conceptual tools for discussing the horizon of contemporary art today.},

Abstract = {This research studies how Russian authorities disseminated strategic
   narratives on Twitter from January 1(st), 2020, to March 11(th), 2021,
   this last date coinciding with the first anniversary of the COVID-19
   pandemic. 111,077 tweets in English from 203 Russian authorities'
   accounts, including Governmental profiles, embassies, and diplomats, are
   considered. To recognize the narratives, a sequential design is
   implemented. First, Bertopic is used to perform both traditional topic
   modeling and dynamic topic modeling. The frequency and thematic
   significance of the 15 most salient topics are analyzed. Second, the
   strategic narratives' approach is adopted to identify thematic and
   structural patterns among the most representative tweets of each topic.
   The findings disclose that Russia's efforts to shape perceptions on
   Twitter are grounded in a gradual and coordinated approach informed by
   identity and system narratives. They portray Russia as a
   long-established beneficial force to the world unlike the West, depicted
   as a hostile antagonist. Issue narratives during the pandemic, such as
   the supply of health resources, are presented as a logical outcome of
   this rationale. Thus, these seemingly scattered tweets can be better
   understood when they are interpreted within the overarching narratives
   they form over time.},

Abstract = {Many governments are failing to act sufficiently strongly on climate
   change. Given this, what should motivated affluent individuals in
   high-consumption societies do? This paper argues that social norms are a
   particularly valuable target for individual climate action. Within
   norm-promotion, the paper makes the case for a focus on anti-fossil fuel
   norms specifically. Section 1 outlines gaps in the existing literature
   on individuals' climate change obligations. Section 2 characterises
   social norms. Section 3 provides seven reasons why social norms are a
   particularly worthy target for individual climate actors. Section 4 asks
   which social norms individuals should emphasise, arguing that
   anti-fossil fuel norms have advantages over emissions reduction and
   offsetting norms. Section 5 outlines the pathways and mechanisms
   individuals might exploit to promote anti-fossil fuel norms.},

Abstract = {This article examines of the life of Nancy Verna Power, an Aboriginal
   woman born in north-west Queensland in 1910. Nancy Power was given an
   exemption certificate in 1933. The certificate released her from control
   by the Department of Native Affairs in 1933 and led her to remain silent
   about her identity in the later years of her life. This article examines
   Nancy's early life as a domestic servant, when she was under the control
   of the Chief Protector, the superintendent of Purga Mission and other
   government administrators. Using Phillips and Bunda's principles of
   ``storying `` each author describes a period of Nancy's life with an eye
   to their own connection to, and ability to tell, the story. Judi Wickes,
   Nancy's niece, tells her story from 1910 to 1924 and from 1934 to 1950
   using family records and her own memories. Katherine Ellinghaus, a
   non-Indigenous historian, uses the official written records created by
   the Queensland government to describe Nancy's life between 1930 and
   1934.},

Abstract = {Scholars across various disciplines have discussed the role of ICTs and
   social media in contentious politics and social movements. Other studies
   have also highlighted the duality of data particularly in the context of
   contentious politics: data is simultaneously an object of political
   struggle and a weapon in repertoires of political struggle. Taking the
   protesters' collective and networked program of sousveillance during the
   2019 Hong Kong Anti-ELAB Movement as an example, this article examines
   protesters' and pro-establishment's engagement with data, the
   datafication of police as proxies of the state, and attitudes towards
   various forms of `veillance'. The doxing at the heart of this case study
   provides an example in which data as constituents of movement repertoire
   and data as a contentious issue in its own right are conflated. This
   article bridges the surveillance and social movement literature by
   examining data practice and doxing during the protest.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic unleashed a torrent of conspiracy theories across
   different social media platforms. Parallel to this conspiracy wave was a
   heightened sense of nationalism, which manifested through both in-group
   solidarity and perceived out-group threats. In this study, we examine
   how individuals' use of government social media to gather political
   information correlated with nation-related conspiracy beliefs during the
   pandemic. Data were collected from 745 subjects in China and analyzed
   through path analyses, which allowed us to examine the direct
   association with political information consumption from government
   social media and the indirect association with nationalism on conspiracy
   beliefs. The results indicated that the use of government social media
   to gather political information was associated with greater beliefs in
   nation-variant COVID-19 conspiracies, both directly and through
   different mediations of nationalism. Our findings highlight the
   importance of examining government social media use and how nationalism
   can have differentiated mediation effects on beliefs in conspiracy
   theories.},

Abstract = {While there is a large literature on the determinants of political trust
   in government organizations, little attention has been paid to the
   emergency organizations, neither has explored the role of social media
   and risk perception in shaping political trust in emergency
   organizations. This article investigates how social media and risk
   perception shape political trust in emergency organizations. Using data
   from a questionnaire survey after the severe flooding disaster in Anhui,
   China, in July 2020 (N = 745), it found that people with disaster
   awareness and upholding reliability for official media have more trust
   in emergency organizations. Besides, official media could be an
   important mediator, through which it significantly increases the
   strength of the causal relationship between disaster awareness and
   political trust in emergency organizations. These findings have broad
   implications on emergency management, functions of social media are
   attainable within the political trust of emergency organizations and
   could sustain a positive outlook in risk governance.},

Abstract = {Recent changes in Canadian legislation have enabled First Nations to
   adopt property taxation and other forms of taxation on reserves, thereby
   allowing them to directly finance their local governments through local
   tax revenues. In this paper, we compile data on the passage of First
   Nations tax laws over a 30-year period from a centralized national
   database on First Nations by-laws, the First Nations Gazette. We combine
   those data with additional sources to analyze the factors that are
   associated with First Nations exercising their taxation authority. We
   find evidence of geographic policy diffusion consistent with First
   Nations learning from their neighbors and direct evidence that formal
   educational and institutional resources are important correlates of tax
   law adoption. Understanding that process informs the broader literature
   on the evolution of taxation structures and local political incentives,
   the analysis may contain important lessons for Indigenous tax
   jurisdiction in other contexts. It is also a critical first step towards
   assessing the long-term consequences of First Nations' new fiscal
   powers.},

Abstract = {How can work be a genuine good in life? I argue that this requires
   overcoming a problem akin to that studied by Marx scholars as the
   problem of work, freedom and necessity: how can work be something we
   genuinely want to do, given that its content is not up to us, but is
   determined by necessity? I argue that the answer involves valuing
   contributing to the good of others, typically as valuing active
   pro-sociality - that is, valuing actively doing something good for
   others. This makes work better in one way, and may even make work
   something we are genuinely glad to have in our lives. Contemporary
   philosophical thinking about good work tends to focus on how work can be
   good for the person doing it, by providing, for example,
   self-realization or social relationships, while underappreciating the
   special importance of valuing social contribution. People will typically
   only really want work if they want a part of their lives to be about the
   good of others. This also means that work may be a part of the best
   life, something we should take into account when discussing work-related
   policies and the desirability of a `post-work' future.},

Abstract = {The article reassesses the role played by parliaments and other
   representative structures in the European state-building processes. It
   points to a need of going beyond the traditional antagonist conception
   of the relationships between rulers and social forces rooted in
   comparative historical political science, substituting it with a theory
   grounded in the concept of political exchange. A preliminary analysis of
   four cases (Brandenburg-Prussia, Dutch Republic, Poland, and Sweden) is
   conducted, with the purpose of singling out the ``internal ``
   determinants - that is, institutional properties of the assemblies -
   that allowed them to integrate into the institutional framework of the
   states in formation, or that hindered such an integration. These
   determinants are found to consist in three main factors: organisational
   centralisation, working autonomy, and a significant interdependence
   relationship with a distinct and relatively autonomous governmental
   centre.},

Journal = {INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS},

Abstract = {The inclusion of digital technology in family life has led to the
   emergence of new practices of `being together'. Communication between
   family members is mediated by digital technology, thus producing changes
   that can be observed in family dynamics. Eleven families participated in
   the present study that aimed to analyze family interaction with digital
   technology. Our qualitative study was guided by two research questions:
   How do children and adults use and subjectively assess digital
   technology in their everyday lives? and How do families react to digital
   technology use and inclusion in their daily family routines? Referring
   to the different forms of digital behaviors that a family can manifest
   in relation to the use of digital technology, we identified three
   specific family approaches to digitalization: Resistant, Retained, and
   Receptive. The 3Rs family conceptual model regarding the acceptance and
   use of digital technology includes children's and adults' perspectives
   and provides a constructivist approach to understanding how digital
   technology connects all family subsystems and ultimately produces
   changes in the dynamics and construction of family life and identity.},

Abstract = {In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (PE), Max Weber
   examines the eco- logical domination of instrumental rationality to the
   detriment of value-oriented action. The concept of the calling (Beruf in
   German) becomes a key one for interpreting the process of value
   rationalization. One can find Weberian value-rationality among the
   Portuguese Roma/Ciganos, who seek alternative livelihood strategies via
   school- ing, although they are still characterized by a high rate of
   early school dropouts, with a very low number of students attending
   secondary education. The EDUCIG (School performance among Ciganos/Roma:
   action research and co-design) project was launched in 2019 to grasp the
   multiple factors involved in this social problem. The pro- ject
   interview-based analysis entailed the participation of 31 Roma/Ciganos
   students from the metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto. Results
   suggest that despite the so- cial, cultural and economic constraints
   affecting their school pathways, the academic success of young
   Roma/Ciganos is facilitated by the influence of religion, specifically
   the Pentecostal Evangelical Church and its respective values. Moreover,
   we can recog- nize the emergence of a new `spirit' in these young
   Roma/Ciganos, a `spirit' that does not aim at instant gratification but
   represents an investment in the future and, simul- taneously, a desire
   for integration.},

Abstract = {Colombia and Chile have been a country that has always been immersed in
   violence, corrupt governments and deaths of innocent people who
   demonstrate in the hope that the state will listen to them and guarantee
   their rights fairly. That is why it was decided to carry out this
   research work on the right to protest in these two governments with the
   aim of exposing the causes, circumstances and social and political
   effects suffered by these countries, taking into account the motives of
   the protests they had. place during the period of the year 2020-2021 and
   a comparison was carried out with the purpose of identifying the
   similarities and differences in the contexts of these countries,
   likewise the fundamental and human rights that were violated to the
   population and individuals were identified belonging to the public force
   in the period of the protests and finally an analysis was carried out
   from the Machiavellian perspective, which has been applied by the states
   in question with respect to the mechanisms implemented in response to
   the demonstrations. However, certain violent and disruptive responses
   from the governments under study were obtained as a result, which
   directly affect fundamental rights, in addition, with the actions of
   these states, a certain inconsistency is evident with what was proposed
   by the author Machiavelli, in As for contemplating the protests as
   suitable means to be able to know the disagreements that the people
   present in order to strengthen the government, on the other hand, it was
   found that not in all aspects these governments operate contrary to what
   was proposed by the author in question due Because, as he establishes in
   his work, the prince, the important thing is to maintain power
   regardless of the means or consequences involved in achieving it.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is the application of some Weberian conceptual
   categories to the contemporary Islamic world. The reconstruction of
   Weberian thought on the reli- gion of Muhammad seems to retain some
   heuristic capacity: although modified over time, the organization of
   Islam gave rise to dynasties with charismatic political leader- ship who
   constituted patrimonial-sultanistic forms of power, with their own
   armies and personal bureaucracy. Characteristics of this type can be
   traced in the Maghreb and Mashriq countries, where there was an almost
   exclusive monopoly of power by the state and the prevalence of personal
   relationships over institutions. A political form that Weber described
   in terms of neo-patrimonial societies, with a strong role of the
   charismatic figure of the leader, a society conceived as a collection of
   groups and not individuals, a centralization of power by the state, and
   a private and clientelistic management of economic resources by ruling
   elites. The Arab revolutions of 2010 can be read as a struggle against
   this neo-patrimonialist model in countries such as Egypt, Tunisia, and
   Syria. More than a decade after the outbreak of the revolutions, the pur
   -pose of this paper is to examine whether indeed these countries have
   overcome those obstacles to modernization and development identified by
   the German sociologist in Islamic societies.},

Abstract = {The political transformation that culminated in the Personal
   Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act fueled scholarly
   interest in welfare history. As politicians dismantled welfare, scholars
   discovered long histories of raced and gendered social control,
   intertwined public and private interests, and fixations on work and
   personal responsibility. They also recovered more promising
   possibilities of cash assistance. This article examines foundational
   welfare histories published between 1971 and 2018. I suggest that this
   somewhat isolated body of work has shed bright light on the history of
   neoliberalism from the perspective of people never fully included into
   social citizenship. It exposes how neoliberalism is and is not different
   from mid-century liberalism and recovers a long history of resistance.
   In an era when few talk about cash assistance, welfare historiography is
   vital for restoring fading memory of its redistributive potential.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present the novel M3-dataset. This global dataset
   brings together 30 existing and newly developed indicators and a total
   of 140,000 observations on three dimensions of material, political, and
   societal militarization from 1990 to 2020. We introduce a novel,
   multidimensional concept of militarization, explain the construction of
   the dataset, data-collection process, and the measures taken to ensure
   the validity and reliability of the data. We illustrate the usefulness
   of the dataset for researchers by analyzing for the first time the
   impact of military policing as one aspect of societal militarization on
   violence and human rights violations at the global level. We conclude by
   discussing the significance of the M-3 dataset and outlining how
   scholars in different fields and with various research interests,
   including (de-)democratization, armed conflict, and human development,
   can benefit from incorporating this dataset into their studies.},

Journal = {PUBLIC CHOICE},

Abstract = {After World War II, the quest for rights began to address the interests
   of particular groups, including minorities, children, women, animals,
   the environment, and workers. Many groups, however, continued or started
   to rely on the market, or private collective action, to further their
   interests. This paper offers a model to explain the choice between
   market and political action. Benefits achieved through collective action
   are a club good whose benefits are enjoyed and costs are borne by the
   group. Rights are a public good which benefits the whole class of people
   who qualify while its costs are borne only by the fighters, which
   invites free riding. Therefore, rights are more costly to achieve, but
   their benefits are higher because they are harder to undo and may
   facilitate further action; so they are chosen if their benefit/cost
   ratio is higher than that of collective action. The history of the
   American labor, black freedom, and women's movements, and their
   intersections, provides a good fit for the model's predictions.},

Title = {Calling on the Third-party Privacy Control into Algorithmic Governance
   Framework: Linking Users' Presumed Influence with Control Agency Theory},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {In the algorithmic society, personal privacy is exposed to ever-growing
   risks since the platform requires huge volumes of data for algorithm
   training. Globally, ordinary users, faced with the formidable platform
   and black-boxed algorithm, usually feel powerless against elusive
   privacy invasion and then have set about turning to third-party proxy
   institutions like the government and legislature to counterbalance the
   algorithmic privacy security framework. Starting from it, the present
   study examines what triggers users' support for third-party proxy
   control, and a moderated serial mediation model has been estimated based
   on a Chinese cross-sectional sample (N = 661). Our research suggests
   that users' algorithm awareness and their presumed algorithmic privacy
   risk to self and others (elders and minors) significantly predict their
   support, and serial mediating effects of the presumed algorithmic
   privacy risk can be more pronounced at the higher level of perceived
   effectiveness of platform policy. These findings help to identify the
   crucial role of algorithm awareness, which equips users to navigate risk
   and behave as responsible digital citizens, and also extend the
   influence of presumed influence model and the control agency theory in
   algorithmic contexts, making contributions in both theory and practice.},

Abstract = {The spread of online databases and the increasingly sophisticated search
   solutions in the past 10-15 years have opened up many new opportunities
   for lawyers to find relevant documents. However, it is still a common
   problem that the various legal databases and legal search engines face
   an information crisis. Legal database providers use various information
   extraction solutions, especially named entity recognition (NER), to
   mitigate this problem. These solutions can improve the relevance of the
   lists of results. Their limitation, however, is that they can only
   extract and create searchable metadata entities if the latter have a
   well-defined location or regularity in the text. Therefore, the next era
   of search support for legal databases is semantic processing. Semantic
   processing solutions are fundamentally different from information
   extraction and NER because they do not only extract and make visible
   and/or searchable the specific information element contained in the text
   but allow for the analytical analysis of the text as a whole. In
   addition, in many cases, legal database developments using machine
   learning can be a significant burden on a company, as it is not always
   known what kind of an AI solution is needed, and how the providers could
   compare the different solutions. Legal database providers need to
   customize processing their documents and texts in the most optimal way
   possible, considering all their legal, linguistic, statistical, or other
   characteristics. This is where text processing pipelines can help. So,
   the article reviews the two main natural language processing (NLP)
   solutions which can help legal database providers to increase the value
   of legal data within legal databases. The article then shows the
   importance of text-processing pipelines and frameworks in the era of
   digitized documents and presents the digital-twin-distiller.},

Abstract = {Social media platforms offer people a variety of options to engage with
   politics, from directly following elected officials to discussing
   politics with social peers. Despite major advances in recent research on
   online political exposure through the lens of selective exposure, filter
   bubbles, and ideological echo chambers, little is known about the
   fundamental questions of what types of political actors people are
   exposed to on social media, and how these distinctive types vary across
   sociodemographic groups. We address this gap in the literature by
   analyzing unique panel data on more than 600,000 registered U.S. voters
   on Twitter during the 2020 U.S. Presidential campaign. We analyze this
   dataset to identify distinct types of political consumers and how they
   vary in terms of sociodemographics. Our findings suggest that the bulk
   of the population has a meaningful share of political content available
   from social peers, that the majority of this content originates from
   traditional sources of political information (media organizations,
   journalists, and politicians), and that media organizations are the
   dominant and direct source of political information on Twitter for
   nearly 20\% of the sample population. These results advance our
   understanding of the way citizens learn about politics in new media and
   pave the way for next-step research to identify the causal effect of
   exposure to distinct curators of political content on individuals'
   political attitudes and political behavior.},

Abstract = {The full-scale invasion and partial occupation of Ukraine by Russian
   forces in February 2022 onwards is a tragedy first and foremost for the
   people of Ukraine. The invasion illustrates the importance of
   intersecting and diverse interdisciplinary perspectives on territory,
   politics and governance within and beyond Ukraine and Russia. Our
   editorial initially addresses some of the more localised and
   nationalised consequences of the invasion. Thereafter, the focus shifts
   towards the realignment of extra-territorial flows of people, money and
   objects, including grain and oil. The territorialised of agency of
   states and non-state actors alike continues to vary revealing in turn
   opportunities for competitive or geopolitical advantage. Longer term,
   the mixed reactions to the Ukrainian crisis reveal both the potential
   for solidarity but also the difficulties in store for those seeking
   forms of climate and food justice.},

Title = {Opportunistic privatization},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {80},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the run-up to elections, self-interested politicians use
   privatization opportunistically to buy votes and increase their
   probability of re-election. When state-owned firms are privatized,
   politicians use (implicit) subsidies to persuade managers to choose
   inefficient but politically beneficial strategies such as excess
   employment. Under plausible assumptions, politicians have a strict
   preference for privatization over state ownership in the run-up to
   elections. We test these predictions using a unique dataset covering the
   full population of former socially owned enterprises in post-Milosevic
   Serbia (2002-2019). We report robust conditional correlations consistent
   with our theory. Privatization sales and revenues increase significantly
   in pre-election periods. The firms privatized before elections are sold
   at a lower price, and exhibit higher total costs after privatization,
   than otherwise similar privatized firms. They also have a higher
   probability of bankruptcy and, conditional on surviving, achieve lower
   profitability than otherwise similar privatized firms. These findings
   highlight the link between privatization, elections and corruption, and
   point to the need for monitoring, or even suspending, privatization
   sales during election periods.},

Abstract = {This article examines the pathways followed by peripheral elites to gain
   access to the Moroccan state apparatus and play a broker role between
   the centre and the periphery in Morocco. It focusses on Riffian elites
   and how their profile has changed since independence according to the
   different social pacts and dynamics of inclusion promoted by the
   Moroccan regime. The study pays special attention to analysing the
   landscape of the new elites that emerged during the reign of Mohammed VI
   through what has been termed associative clientelism, the limits of this
   new model of inclusion and the decline of these elites.},

Abstract = {Ballot dropboxes provide voters who fill out mail-in ballots with a
   secure and convenient method for returning their ballot. During the
   COVID-19 pandemic, the use of ballot dropboxes increased dramatically as
   voters sought to cast ballots safely and conveniently. In the wake of
   the 2020 election, ballot dropboxes have come under considerable
   scrutiny as many Republican-controlled state legislatures have sought to
   eliminate them or sharply reduce the number available and/or limit the
   hours in which they can be used by voters. This article uses novel data
   on the number of ballots collected in Georgia dropboxes paired with
   measures of how accessible these dropboxes were to voters in order to
   analyze how the allocation of dropboxes affected voting behavior in an
   election where voters could choose to vote in a variety of ways. When
   controlling for the number of potential users, dropboxes closer in
   distance to voters are used at higher rates. Individuals located closer
   to dropboxes are more likely to vote by mail and are less likely to fail
   to return requested mail-in ballots. Our findings carry important
   implications for election administrators seeking to make voting
   accessible by adding additional ballot dropboxes and for administrators
   seeking to adjust to mandated decreases in the number of dropboxes
   provided to voters.},

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {107},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper interrogates the discursive production of the ``birth
   tourist{''} and associated opposition to jus soli birthright citizenship
   in the United States. I trace the intersecting axes of heteropatriarchy
   and racism that underpin history of opposition to jus soli citizenship,
   and position contemporary media and political attention to ``birth
   tourism{''} as an extension of those axes. Through a critical discourse
   analysis of popular media coverage and public commentators, I position
   the ``birth tourism{''} category within a broader national discourse of
   white supremacy, before linking this discursive production to
   national-level regulatory efforts. Interrogating the ``birth tourist{''}
   categorization as a discursive tool of white, patriarchal
   ethnonationalism, I advance the study of political geographies of
   fertility and argue that contradictions embedded within the ``birth
   tourism{''} discourse ultimately work to fuel fears of white supremacy's
   collapse. Keywords: birth tourism, birthright citizenship, white
   supremacy, intersectionality, feminist geopolitics.},

Abstract = {Changes in the organisation chosen by groups wishing to engage in
   collusion practices in several markets are analysed. If the synergies
   between the different activities are strong, the groups bring together
   their activities within a conglomerate. Although synergies are weak, the
   groups prefer to divide their different activities into several
   autonomous firms when they engage in collusion in several markets. When
   the competition authority dissolves one of the collusion agreements, the
   groups merge to combine their activities and benefit from the potential
   synergies. This dynamic of the group organisation reveals a conglomerate

Abstract = {Within the field of social movement studies, scholars have devoted
   increasing attention to how protesters reclaim and organize public
   spaces. Case studies reveal that protesters often split up larger
   reclaimed spaces by drawing internal, sometimes invisible, boundaries.
   So far, however, the subdivision of protest spaces remains an
   under-theorized phenomenon. Through a case study of Lebanon's 2019
   October Uprising, this article contributes to disentangling how spatial
   subdivisions emerge and shape relations between protesters. The study
   relies on fieldwork observations and interviews with 51 protesters from
   Lebanon's second-largest city, Tripoli, where the protest space was
   divided into three main zones, reflecting social, ideological, and
   tactical fault lines in the city's uprising. By employing Low's concepts
   of spacing and synthesis, it analyzes how Tripoli's protesters came to
   associate these three zones with diverging identities, ideologies, and
   tactical orientations, while also connecting them together as functional
   parts of the larger movement. Although the separation of Tripoli's
   protest space did not alleviate disagreements and conflicts, the article
   finds that subdivisions facilitated a thin form of order and helped
   protesters make sense of their internal differences.},

Abstract = {Geographies of city regionalism are variegated. In developed market
   economies, the provision of regional transport infrastructure has been
   affected by territorial politics, which reflects the nature of
   collective provision. Today, territorial politics are the foundation of
   city regionalism, and involve a wide range of stakeholders. In China,
   the city region has recently been selected as a new development
   strategy; accordingly, the development of regional transport
   infrastructure in China has been driven, partly, by national policies.
   Given the various stakeholders involved in such processes, this study
   sought to illuminate the processes of city regionalism formation in
   China. We used the case study of the development of metro transit
   infrastructure in the city region of Nanjing, which revealed that city
   regionalism is state-guided and involves coordination between
   administrative commands from different levels of government,
   negotiations between local governments, and an overall shift in policy
   sentiment from competition to collaboration. Ultimately, this study
   ascertains that while transborder transit projects are primarily state
   guided (involving upper government intervention), they are also
   constituted by bargaining between local governments in the city region.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveFor years, scholars have employed Justice Harry Blackmun's
   private grades of attorneys to measure attorney oral argument quality.
   Using archival data, I analyze whether Justice Blackmun experienced
   order effects.MethodsI estimate numerous ordinary least squares
   regression models on private archival data.ResultsBlackmun's respondent
   grades appear to have been influenced by his perceptions of how the
   petitioners performed. This finding holds across a series of checks,
   including those that examine whether some cases simply attract better or
   worse attorneys.ConclusionThe results suggest that scholars should not
   use the Blackmun grades as ``point estimates{''} but, instead, as
   rankings. They also suggest that previous findings may have overstated
   the influence of oral argument. The fact that one justice displayed
   evidence of a cognitive illusion also suggests that such effects may
   exist in various aspects of decision making.},

Abstract = {Considerable attention has been paid by researchers to social media
   platforms, especially the `big companies', and increasingly also
   messaging applications, and how effectively they moderate extremist and
   terrorist content on their services. Much less attention has yet been
   paid to if and how infrastructure and service providers, further down
   `the tech stack', deal with extremism and terrorism. Content Delivery
   Networks (CDN) such as Cloudflare play an underestimated role in
   moderating the presence of extremist and terrorist content online as it
   is impossible for these websites to operate without DDoS protection.
   This is evidenced by the takedown of a wide range websites such as The
   Daily Stormer, 8chan, a variety of Taliban websites and more recently
   the organised harassment site Kiwifarms following refusal of service by
   Cloudflare. However, it is unclear whether there is any formal process
   of content review conducted by the company when it decides to refuse
   services. This article aims to first provide an analysis of what
   extremist and terrorist websites make use of Cloudflare's services as
   well as other CDNs, and how many of them have been subject to takedown
   following refusal of service. Following this the article analyses CDNs'
   terms of service and how current and upcoming internet regulation
   applies to these CDNs.},

Abstract = {This article sheds light on the partisan involvement of non-state
   networks in secession conflicts. Building on the patron-client relations
   framework, it develops a concept of civil society patronage that allows
   zooming into the relationship between secessionist movements and their
   allies in international civil society. This framework is then applied to
   the Biafra conflict (1967-70) and the activities of the so-called
   `Biafra Lobby' in the United States to examine the motives, instruments
   and impact of support. The study offers a fresh perspective on the
   international relations of secessionist movements and demonstrates the
   benefits and also the limitations of non-state support.},

Title = {Transparency for what purpose?: Designing outcomes-focused transparency
   tactics for digital platforms},
Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Transparency has long been held up as the solution to the societal harms
   caused by digital platforms' use of algorithms. However, what
   transparency means, how to create meaningful transparency, and what
   behaviors can be altered through transparency are all ambiguous legal
   and policy questions. This paper argues for beginning with clarifying
   the desired outcome (the ``why{''}) before focusing on transparency
   processes and tactics (the ``how{''}). Moving beyond analyses of the
   ways algorithms impact human lives, this research articulates an
   approach that tests and implements the right set of transparency tactics
   aligned to specific predefined behavioral outcomes we want to see on
   digital platforms. To elaborate on this approach, three specific
   desirable behavioral outcomes are highlighted, to which potential
   transparency tactics are then mapped. No single set of transparency
   tactics can solve all the harms possible from digital platforms, making
   such an outcomes-focused transparency tactic selection approach the best
   suited to the constantly-evolving nature of algorithms, digital
   platforms, and our societies.

   La transparencia se ha presentado durante mucho tiempo como la solucion
   a los danos sociales causados por el uso de algoritmos por parte de las
   plataformas digitales. Sin embargo, que significa la transparencia, como
   crear una transparencia significativa y que comportamientos se pueden
   modificar a traves de la transparencia son cuestiones legales y
   politicas ambiguas. Este documento aboga por comenzar aclarando el
   resultado deseado (el ``por que{''}) antes de centrarse en los procesos
   y tacticas de transparencia (el ``como{''}). Mas alla de los analisis de
   las formas en que los algoritmos impactan en la vida humana, esta
   investigacion articula un enfoque que prueba e implementa el conjunto
   correcto de tacticas de transparencia alineadas con los resultados de
   comportamiento predefinidos especificos que queremos ver en las
   plataformas digitales. Para profundizar en este enfoque, se destacan
   tres resultados conductuales deseables especificos, a los que luego se
   asignan las posibles tacticas de transparencia. Ningun conjunto unico de
   tacticas de transparencia puede resolver todos los danos posibles de las
   plataformas digitales, lo que hace que un enfoque de seleccion de
   tacticas de transparencia centrada en los resultados sea el mas adecuado
   para la naturaleza en constante evolucion de los algoritmos, las
   plataformas digitales y nuestras sociedades.},

Abstract = {The present study applies the communication mediation model (CMM) to the
   increasingly prevalent patterns of partisan communication in
   contemporary polarized politics and fragmented partisan media
   environments. Specifically, we test the CMM considering (a) two types of
   news consumption (like-minded and cross-cutting) in the place of overall
   news use and (b) both affective and cognitive responses. We propose a
   partisan CMM that consists of a two-step mediation linking partisan news
   consumption to participation through talk and affective polarization.
   Results from national survey data covering three U.S. presidential
   election cycles (the 2012, 2016, and 2020 American National Election
   Studies) generally supported the model, with like-minded and
   cross-cutting news use having differential mediation processes on
   participation.},

Journal = {ECONOMICS \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {407-431},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A government sets the level of taxation to provide a public good valued
   by consumers. There are two groups of consumers, the rich and the poor.
   The government has redistributive preferences, but is initially
   constrained to use lump-sum taxation. This potentially leads the
   government to provide a very low level of the public good out of concern
   for not reducing private good consumption of the poor. In this context,
   allowing a small amount of redistribution from the rich to the poor may
   be Pareto improving. The loss in private consumption by the rich may be
   more than offset by the added utility from increased public good
   provision. I also analyze the extent to which a flat income tax can
   induce the government to choose a level of public good consistent with
   the Samuelson condition. When consumers have a survival constraint on
   private consumption, a progressive tax code is required to induce the
   government to choose the efficient level of the public good. Generally
   speaking, there is a trade-off between a desire to restrain the
   government's ability to redistribute income and a desire to induce it to
   choose the level of the public good implied by the Samuelson condition.},

Title = {Legal bordering of asylum through liminality},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {106},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Unlike the permanent and legitimizing protections of asylum more widely
   available to other nationalities, current US immigration law and legal
   mechanisms maintain large numbers of Central American asylum seekers in
   a perpetual state of legal limbo and precarity. Those able to argue
   their case in immigration court are most often denied asylum but
   increasing numbers are allowed to stay in the US in a legally liminal
   status. The resulting legal limbo for these would-be asylees subjects
   them to a permanent state of legal violence in the US' racialized
   immigration climate. Analysis of US immigration court outcomes from 1997
   to 2022 traces the historical denial of asylum to Salvadoran,
   Guatemalan, and Honduran nationals. A recent administrative tactic to
   address the historic immigration court backlog of asylum cases,
   dismissal of cases, are the latest in a historic pattern of granting
   Central American asylum-seekers temporary status with no pathway to
   permanent legal status. We argue that the rapid rise in immigration
   court dismissals is the latest means of denying asylum and casting
   Central American asylum seekers into a prolonged state of legal
   ambiguity in the US. While allowing refugeemigrants who are fleeing
   violence to remain in the US, these same individuals are excluded from
   legal protections and are exposed to the racialized violence of living
   as a criminalized underclass in US society.},

Abstract = {PurposeAfter the collapse of the USSR, Eurasian integration projects,
   proposed by Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey, began to develop in the
   post-Soviet space. Hence, there is growing interest in Eurasianism as an
   ideology. In this context, the study of the use of the Eurasianism's
   ideas in practice becomes relevant. The argument of this article is that
   Russia, Turkey, and Kazakstan have their own interpretations of
   Eurasianism's ideas to develop the ideological basis of their own
   integration projects. The purpose of the article is to answer the
   question: How is the Eurasianism used in integration projects of Russia,
   Turkey and Kazakstan?Design/methodology/approachThe concept of
   Eurasianism has been viewed in terms of constructivism. On the basis of
   the principles of social constructivism, and in particular the works of
   constructivist ideologue Alexander Wendt, a comparative analysis was
   made. The ideas of Eurasianism in the integration processes of Russia,
   Kazakhstan and Turkey has been carried out based on the criteria such as
   the role of common ideas, identity, consciousness, memory and culture.
   The examples of mentioned countries were compared, to consider the
   development of the ideas of Eurasianism in practice.FindingsThe ideas of
   Eurasianism have a significant impact on the integration processes of
   the post-Soviet space. Eurasianism advocates for important factors such
   as respect for cultural and civilizational differences between different
   nations, their equality in the overall union and common development
   opportunities. Such factors are undoubtedly important for the success of
   integration projects. The reflection of many individual thoughts of
   classical Eurasians and Neo-Eurasians can be seen in the statements of
   various ministers and leaders of Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey. The
   initiatives of these countries in creating integration projects also
   show the influence of the Eurasian concept.Originality/valueIn the
   1990s, the study of Eurasianism gained new significance in academic
   circles. Articles and periodicals devoted to this concept were
   published. However, all parallels between variations in concepts of
   Eurasianism have been conducted on a theoretical level. The importance
   of this article lies in the fact that conceptual differences are
   compared in practice. Researchers had not previously considered the
   study of the relevance and productivity of Eurasianism in practice by
   comparing examples and experiences from different countries. The novelty
   of this article lies in its attempt to solve this problem.},

Abstract = {Analyses of comparative survey data can contribute to a more thorough
   understanding of citizens' perceptions of and attitudes toward
   government. Thus, especially in public administration research, survey
   data can be a valuable research resource. This research note aims at
   providing an inventory of comprehensive, open-access survey data to
   advance quantitative public administration research about citizens'
   attitudes. Applying a systematic dataset research, we found a total of
   23 surveys useful for advancing public administration research,
   especially research on citizen-state interaction. As major
   contributions, first, the note sheds light on current survey status quo
   by capturing both data origin and usage in research. Second, it outlines
   an agenda for future research to draw scholarly attention to research
   opportunities in public administration research that could be addressed
   by the data.},

Abstract = {This essay explores four questions through a critical dialogue with
   Black Marxist, Decolonial, and Political Marxist accounts of racism.
   First, is it possible to speak of rac-ism before the advent of
   colonisation in the Americas? Second, what were the deter-minants for
   the production of these earlier modalities of racism? Third, who were
   the key actors responsible for the production of such racism? And
   fourth, what were the linkages between these developments and racisms
   that would unfold with the capital-ist colonisation of the Americas? I
   contend that the historical formation of racism as a material force lies
   in the formation and dissolution of absolutist states in Western Europe
   between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries. By demonstrating how
   elite political cultures of Western European societies were suffused
   with the logic of raciali-sation prior to the colonisation of the
   Americas, the essay helps render transparent hitherto occluded
   connections between histories focusing on the internal racialisation of
   Europe and the racialisation of the European exterior. And in doing so,
   it establishes the constitutive part racism played in the emergence of
   capitalist modernity.},

Abstract = {This study examines War's Inefficiency Puzzle in a resource bargaining
   model, where the nature of the resource (e.g., water or land) can
   influence resource division valuation. In the model, an embedded
   resource conflict or contest model equilibrium constitutes the
   disagreement point. We first show that the Puzzle holds across all
   winner-take-all conflict forms in a generalized family given a standard
   bargaining (in the shadow of conflict) framework. When introducing
   resource division discounts, we find conditions in which a bargaining
   solution does not exist such that conflict is chosen over settlement.
   Resource division discounts can cause conflict to be chosen over any
   settlement point in the feasible set, thus providing a solution to War's
   Inefficiency Puzzle. This solution does not assume that a resource
   cannot be divided. It only assumes that division may lead to division
   discounts. We then consider a generalization of a classic tragedy of the
   commons model and find that division of an innate commons leads to
   division discounts as an equilibrium outcome.},

Abstract = {Dr. Harold Black has made a career of investigating the effects of
   different rules and institutional arrangements on the extent to which
   market participants in finance can exercise a taste for discrimination.
   This paper considers the nature of Black's contributions, and reviews
   some particulars of his voluminous published research, focusing
   especially on his work on the number of ``overages{''} charged by banks,
   and the differences in the effects of the race of bank owners, as
   explained by the race of customers. The paper concludes by connecting
   Dr. Black's work to his ``origin story,{''} which helps explain his
   consistent focus on careful empirical distinctions rather than
   preconceptions and biases.},

Abstract = {BackgroundPublic opinion has a dynamic relationship with policy and
   real-world outcomes in liberal settings where reliable information is
   abundant. In these settings, the public continuously updates its
   opinions with reliable policy-relevant information, and the changes in
   public opinion go on to affect policy and outcomes. It is unknown
   whether this dynamic exists in illiberal settings where the public's
   access to reliable information is heavily restricted. ObjectivesThis
   article advances a theory of public opinion's dynamic relationship with
   policy and outcomes that applies to illiberal settings. MethodsOur study
   examines a vital public good in one of the world's most restrictive
   information environments and estimates a dynamic model of relationships
   among three variables-public opinion, policy, and outcomes-with a focus
   on public opinion and outcomes as the key dependent variables. The
   analysis looks at air pollution remediation in 274 Chinese localities.
   ResultsWe find that public opinion reacts to objective air pollution
   outcomes and not to misleading information that downplays air pollution
   severity, which suggests the public can accurately evaluate the
   reliability of available information. We also find that local public
   opinion's impact on local air pollution is substantively meaningful on
   timescales as short as 1 to 2 years, indicating that the additional
   policy effort prompted by public opinion change is sufficient to yield
   tangible real-world outcomes even in the short term. ConclusionPublic
   opinion has a dynamic relationship with policy and real-world outcomes
   even in highly illiberal settings. We argue that these findings are
   likely to generalize across issue domains with outcomes that can be
   directly observed by the public.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study examines the moderating role of gender diversity
   in the relationship between asset preferences and firm performance over
   the firm life cycle. Methods: Panel regression analysis is used to
   analyse 2008-2019 data of the S \& P 500 firms. Results: Results show
   that gender diversity significantly moderates the relationship between
   asset preferences and firm performance. Second, this relationship varies
   across different life cycle stages of the firm. Third, women on board
   influence this relationship more in the introduction, maturity, and
   shakeout stages, while female executives have more influence in the
   introduction and maturity stages. Fourth, gender diversity enhances
   asset preferences with firm performance but reverses the relationship
   with many asset categories. Lastly, gender diversity positively
   moderates firm size relationship with maturity and shakeout stage
   performance while negatively moderates firm size in the introduction
   stage. Conclusion: This study has practical implications for firms that
   diversify their board and management structure to improve performance.},

Abstract = {While existing research suggests that the closed digital spaces of
   Instant Messaging (IM) platforms have important democratic implications,
   this study examines how users actively curate such spaces through
   disconnection. Using a mixed-method approach within the context of Hong
   Kong politics after the introduction of the National Security Law (NSL),
   we examine the extent to which and why IM users engage in disconnective
   behaviors (tie dissolution, content filtration), and explain the
   behaviors through socio-psychological and structural factors.
   Statistical analysis of survey data (N = 946) shows that encountering
   political disagreement on IM platforms predicts disconnection, which is
   strengthened by fear of social isolation and perceived systemic
   victimhood. Thematic analysis of open-ended survey questions
   contextualizes these findings: Through tie dissolution, IM users
   regulate their own visibility and remove problematic contacts to avoid
   being penalized by authorities and peers. By muting disagreeable
   content, they turn away from contentious political discourse perceived
   as risky and ineffective under the NSL to focus on personal and social
   well-being. Overall, we argue that disconnection is a necessary means to
   curate safe spaces of withdrawal to cope with an uncertain and insecure
   political environment - it follows the logic of self-care and is a
   product of social and systemic threats.},

Title = {Left behind in a public services wasteland? On the accessibility of
   public services and political trust},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {105},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Public discourse and scholars alike argue that the spatial divide in
   voting behavior and attitudes is rooted in geographic inequalities that
   serve as breeding grounds for political discontent. In previous studies,
   scholars have mainly focused on the economic conditions to analyze how
   place-based context influences the voting behavior of citizens. However,
   this focus on voting behavior and a small set of contextual variables do
   not allow us to draw direct conclusions as to how, and which,
   place-based factors relate to discontent on the attitudinal level. I
   argue that the accessibility of public service infrastructure
   specifically serves as a low-intensity information cue for citizens to
   evaluate the political performance of modern welfare states. These
   evaluations complement objective economic perceptions and are part of
   the performance-trust link. Hence, citizens should trust the government
   less if public services are not provided or only hard to access. I test
   this relationship for the German case by spatially linking the addresses
   of survey respondents with the location of public service facilities and
   collective municipallevel data. The resulting unique data set allows to
   explore the relationship between the accessibility of public service
   facilities and political trust as well as their temporal development.
   Results of multilevel analyses indicate that shorter distances to train
   stations are associated with increased trust in the government, but all
   other results, such as the change in service provision, remain
   inconclusive. The findings implicate that a long-term lack of public
   services contributes to geographically polarized discontent in Germany.},

Title = {Infrastructure as biopolitics: Fencing, categorizing and valuing animals
   for wolf conservation in Germany},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {105},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper takes a critical look at biopolitical practices under the
   current regime for wolf conservation in Ger-many. One profound
   difference between human and more-than-human biopolitics is that it
   concerns multiple, more-than-human bodies, demanding a close examination
   of governance practices aimed at enabling conser-vation. My core
   argument is twofold: first, I argue that conservation policies in
   Germany attempt to frame wolves as collectivities and apply a population
   perspective on these animals. However, the very technologies that aim to
   monitor wolves as population, namely genetic analyses, also produce
   individual wolves that complicate con-servation efforts due to their
   affective force (Lorimer, 2015). Second, as active wolf management in
   the form of population control is rare due to legal regulations, there
   is a strong focus on livestock protection measures. These
   infrastructuring practices (Barua, 2021) continue to fail because they
   rest on the idea that convivial coexistence can be quantified and ignore
   that technologies such as fences can alter animals' atmospheres (Lorimer
   et al., 2019) profoundly. As a result, infrastructuring practices aimed
   at enabling coexistence may run counter to their initial purpose. With
   fences becoming habitats, lively and discursive multispecies relations
   are renegotiated.},

Abstract = {Is democracy a better political regime for economic prosperity than
   autocracy? This paper shows that the answer depends on the initial
   economic development level during the democratic transition when the
   foundation of institutions was laid. Democracy facilitates growth only
   in countries that already have adequate development at transition time.
   These countries are more likely to create and sustain growth-enhancing
   institutions than others. Without appropriate development, democracy
   does not improve growth; this applies to about 40\% of the third-wave
   democratized countries. These results are based on a sample of 153
   countries in 1960-2010 and robust to various specifications and
   endogeneity issues.},

Title = {Racial capitalism and spheres of influence: Australian assertions of
   white possession in the Pacific},
Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {105},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Australian governments and security analysts have long claimed that
   Australia exercises a sphere of influence in the South Pacific. This
   paper argues that this assertion of a sphere of influence is driven by a
   racial capitalist dialectic of possession and dispossession. This
   dialectic has legitimised and facilitated the expro-priation of Pacific
   land, labour, resources and sovereignty for the building of the
   Australian colonial settler state. It is premised on geographic
   moralities consisting of intertwined white supremacist, antiblack,
   anti-Indigenous and anti-Asian ideologies which confer on Australia a
   right and obligation to assert influence over the Pacific based on
   geographic contiguity and racialised discourses of Pacific incapacity.
   The paper makes this argument using Aileen Moreton-Robinson's notion of
   white possession, Nancy Fraser's expanded conception of capitalism and
   Jose \& PRIME; Marti's concept of geographic morality, tracing the
   evolution of Australia's sphere of influence politics over four periods:
   the imperial era, the Cold War period, the post-Cold War period until
   the 2010s, and the present era of inter-imperial rivalry between China
   and the United States. This analysis brings together perspectives from
   critical race and indigenous studies, critical geopolitics, and radical
   geopolitics to connect race, capitalism and the construction of
   geopolitical space in Australia's assertion of a sphere of influence in
   the Pacific. It advances recent conceptual discussions of spheres of
   influence, which are race-blind because they draw on theories that
   foreground white subjectivity.},

Abstract = {After the humanitarian crisis, caused by COVID-19, enterprises have to
   face a post-pandemic economic crisis. As small and medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs) constitute 99\% of EU enterprises and create every
   third workplace (European Parliament, 2021), it is important to monitor
   their situation not only to survive but also to develop and build strong
   economies in the future. The aim of this research is to investigate
   development trends and opportunities in (SMEs') development, with a
   special focus on start-ups (STPS) as representative of these. Also,
   special attention is paid to the concept of sustainable development
   (SD), which fulfils the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs). The proposed methodology consists of three stages: desk
   research, in-depth interviews, and primary data analysis, and uses a
   qualitative method. The article describes the findings of recent Polish
   studies undertaken to verify and augment earlier pilot research. The
   novelty of the article is the examination of the dependence between the
   STPS survival rate and the SD as a measure of SDGs' fulfilment. The
   limitation may be the specificity of the pandemic, as well as the study
   of post-pandemic trends that shows a strictly binding need to have a
   stable strategy for establishing, managing and developing enterprises
   and increasing their survival rates.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThe middle class has historically played a decisive role in
   mass movements and rebellions against the status quo, including in both
   peaceful and violent protests that spread throughout the Middle East and
   North Africa following the events of the Arab Spring. Yet, we know
   little about why the middle class tends to be over-represented in
   protest movements, or why that protest takes nonviolent versus violent
   forms. MethodsWe develop a model in which protest constitutes a
   ``costly{''} signal of discontent, where violent actions are more costly
   than peaceful demonstrations and where the cost of action increases with
   individual income. Under such assumptions, the upper-middle class will
   engage in nonviolent protest, the lower middle class will support
   violence against the government, while the poorest and richest will
   abstain from opposition activities. ResultsSurvey data from the World
   Values Survey and the Gallup World Poll across 20 Arab countries
   supports these hypotheses. Using both parametric and semi-parametric
   analyses, we find that participation in nonviolent protests and general
   strikes rises from the first (lowest) and peaks at the fourth income
   quintile, then declines thereafter. Meanwhile, support for political
   violence rises sharply between the first and second quintiles, falling
   for individuals in the upper quintiles. Our findings are robust to
   broader measures of wealth and status, as well as to corrections for
   regime type, levels of regime support, and joint determination of
   anti-regime behaviors. ConclusionsThese findings shed light on why
   certain socioeconomic groups engage in anti-governmental behaviors,
   while others do not, and suggest that income subgroups within the middle
   class may choose different modalities of protest.},

Abstract = {How are social ties formed in the contentious campaigns led by relatives
   of victims of criminal and political violence? Drawing on the work of
   Latin American social anthropologists such as Myriam Jimeno, Morna
   Macleod and Natalia De Marinis, I argue that the contentious campaigns
   of a victim-led social movement provide the physical and symbolic spaces
   where the participants form a political-emotional community by sharing
   testimonios (testimonial narratives) and developing a victim-centered
   ethos. To substantiate my claim, I discuss the case of the Movement for
   Peace with Justice and Dignity (Movimiento por la Paz con Justicia y
   Dignidad) in Mexico drawing on twelve in-depth interviews and a
   documentary review. This article opens a dialogue between the literature
   on political-emotional communities and the scholarship on social
   movements offering a new perspective to analyze the development of
   social ties. In other words, future research projects can make use of
   the introduced theoretical proposal to understand victim-led activism
   more in-depth. The approach of this article can be of interest, for
   example, for scholars dedicated to the study of contention by survivors
   of genocide, mobilizations against racial violence, and protests in
   contexts of armed conflict.},

Abstract = {Radio B92 was an iconic independent media institution in Serbia. Founded
   in 1989, B92 provided Belgrade listeners with subversive rock music,
   high-quality journalism, and independent perspectives on politics in the
   former Yugoslavia. An early adapter to the internet, B92 has been
   credited with sparking the many demonstrations that took place in
   Belgrade during the 1990s. While the role of Radio B92 during the
   turbulent days of the Yugoslav Wars is well known, less known is the
   role of its first CEO and news director in the creation of what would
   become the Media Development Investment Fund (MDIF). Drawing on
   semi-structured interviews with journalists, scholars, funders,
   diplomats, and media observers conducted in Belgrade in 2022, this study
   argues that much can be learned from the case of Radio B92 and the short
   history of independent media in Serbia. Although B92 ultimately met a
   tragic death at the hands of privatization and ``market censorship,{''}
   the ``impact investment{''} model of media development it sparked lives
   on. Combining affordable loan and equity financing with technical
   assistance and advisory services, MDIF's model helps struggling news
   organizations avoid dependency on grants. Although the 2022 reelection
   of President Aleksandar Vucic demonstrates his party's successful state
   capture of Serbian news media, a look back at the case of Radio B92 has
   implications for the broader question of what works in international
   media assistance and why.},

   Based on the cognitive-affective personality system theory and social

   employee well-being and knowledge sharing and explores the moderating
   effect of organizational social capital. Method.The study used
   longitudinal design, three-wave, and 409 valid supervisor-employee pairs
   (233 direct supervisors and 409 employees) from 10 companies in Taiwan
   to test these hypothetical relationships. Results. The findings of this
   study showed that: (1) workplace haters negatively affects employee
   well-being; (2) employee well-being positively affects knowledge
   sharing; (3) employee well-being mediates the relationship between
   workplace haters and knowledge sharing; and (4) organizational social
   capital moderates the relationship between workplace haters and employee
   well-being. Conclusion. The study has important contributions to the
   literature on workplace haters, coworker interaction, and social
   capital. Implications for behavioral researchers and human resource
   managers are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article explores contemporary understandings of military duty and
   dynamics of cohesion during deployment with a focus on host-citizen
   relations. Duty is treated as a perception-based dynamic construct
   shaped, in part, by operational experiences. Traditionally, Western
   military duty is defined by conventional obligations of loyalty to the
   military unit and mission in the context of combat operations, in these
   ways linked to military cohesion. However, in response to increasingly
   ``population-oriented{''} military operations, I argue the need to
   broaden the study of military duty and cohesion beyond interpersonal
   bonds of the military organization to include the role of host-citizen
   relations. In-depth interviews with Swedish service members reaffirm the
   centrality of conventional duty to the mission and military unit, yet
   also indicate varying levels and forms of obligations to local actors.
   Overall, understandings of duty matter to cohesion both as a unifying
   force and source of tension within the mission.},

Abstract = {The increasing prevalence of news snacking - that is, the brief,
   intermittent attendance to news in mainly digital and mobile media
   contexts - has been discussed as a problematic behavior potentially
   leading to a less informed public. Empirical research, however, that
   investigates the relationship between news snacking and political
   knowledge is sparse. Against the background of changed opportunity
   structures in increasingly digital and mobile media environments, this
   study investigates how news snacking relates to the breadth and depth of
   political knowledge in society. Based on an online survey of the German
   population (N = 558), we examine how snacking news affects political
   event and background knowledge gains using different digital news
   platforms. Results show that users who exhibit high levels of news
   snacking learn substantially less from news use across different types
   of digital platforms.},
