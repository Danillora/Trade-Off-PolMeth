   Response to the Belt and Road Initiative in the Post-COVID Era},

Abstract = {After the limbo caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese investments
   have picked up in the first quarter of 2023. Investments through China's
   Belt and Road Initiative are carried out by approaching potential
   participants individually, or via dedicated platforms outside the EU's
   legal and institutional framework. Thus, the EU Framework for the
   Screening of Foreign Direct Investment - which is likely to get its
   so-called ``baptism of fire{''} after its COVID-induced hibernation -
   can be seen as an implicit response to said Chinese initiative. This
   framework should be considered a message directed simultaneously towards
   foreign actors, discouraging them from attempting to carry out
   investments in the EU with the intention of bypassing the relevant
   European rules, and also towards Member States, cautioning them against
   facilitating such operations. The author will argue that the regulatory
   model has too many in-built unknowns that could prevent the framework
   from achieving its objectives.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Abstract = {As part of their response to the COVID-19 pandemic, law enforcement
   agencies in Long Island's Suffolk and Nassau Counties reached out to
   Latino immigrant communities with a message to ``educate over
   enforce.{''} Yet, this messaging did not echo enough in the lives of
   immigrant communities who were the most vulnerable and hardest hit
   populations in the area. Based on fieldnotes from sixteen virtual
   meetings spanning five months (March-July), which are part of a larger
   qualitative project, we argue that communication gaps persisted and
   continued to plague community/police relations in several ways. First,
   the messaging around education was a one-way street with very little
   input from community members. Second, ``light{''} enforcement still took
   place with the issuing of summons on social distancing and requiring
   mask wearing. Third, the closing down of precincts meant that there was
   no way to access police services, especially in Spanish, the community's
   language. Finally, law enforcement's response to the community's needs
   was ``virtually{''} absent. We conclude this examination with lessons
   learned so police departments can better serve and protect the immigrant
   community.},

Abstract = {Digital market regulations respond to technological changes and global
   dynamics, but also to how political actors shape markets. Focusing on
   the Digital Markets Act, this article explains the EU's marketcraft as
   the result of a struggle in the policy field between political actors
   promoting competing economic ideas in a rapidly evolving technological
   and geopolitical context. We show that significant discursive and policy
   change in digital market governance has occurred because of shifting
   coalitions between three constellations of actors, which we call
   market-correctors, market-busters, and market-directors. Tracking the
   ongoing campaign to challenge Big Tech and define the meaning of digital
   sovereignty, we argue that market-directors have ushered in potentially
   comprehensive policy change.},

Abstract = {Why do states and their agents abuse citizens? Traditional explanations
   focus on contentious politics, the presence of institutions, and
   international pressures. Despite this, accounts dissecting the state and
   its agents in this context of abuse remain largely theoretic in nature.
   This article offers a breakthrough for within-the-state accounts of
   human rights abuses by focusing on state leaders and their relationship
   to broader government institutions and function. We posit that
   personalist leaders have fundamentally different relationship with
   institutions that foster human rights respect, arguing that leaders
   relying on their own merits and qualities are less likely to either
   activate or manipulate institutions of accountability for human rights
   abuses. Using data from 1991 to 2019, we show that the presence of
   leaders legitimizing themselves within personalist framing can worsen
   human rights conditions.},

Abstract = {The article examines the European Union's response to Russia's 2022
   invasion of Ukraine in the field of migration, arguing that EU visa and
   refugee policies encompassed a distinctive foreign policy and soft power
   dimension. On one hand, by restricting visa policy for Russia, the EU
   signalled the delegitimization and isolation of the Kremlin. On the
   other hand, by adopting temporary protection for Ukrainians, it sent a
   clear message of support to Ukraine, while also portraying the EU as the
   defender of freedom and democracy. Through an analysis of EU documents
   released in the first month of the war, the article thus posits that
   both visa and refugee measures were employed as soft power tools,
   contributing to the juxtaposition of an aggressive and isolated Russia,
   against a responsible and united EU.},

Title = {Using the Pandemic as a Pretext Voter Absenteeism in the 2020 Elections
   in Romania},
Journal = {COMMUNIST AND POST-COMMUNIST STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {56},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {One of the most visible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is on voter
   turnout. Earlier research concludes that the pandemic depresses turnout
   by looking at statistical patterns and testing the explanatory power of
   pandemic casualties against alternative causes. Based on the existing
   results, we only assume that the pandemic was related to depressing
   turnout but we do not know if that happened. In this sense, there is
   limited attention paid to people's perspectives. This article addresses
   this gap in the literature and analyzes the importance of the pandemic
   for absenteeism through the eyes of (non)voters. It focuses on Romania,
   a country with a particularly low turnout in the 2020 national elections
   compared to the previous elections. The analysis uses 21 semi-structured
   interviews conducted with persons with a different sociodemographic
   profile who voted in 2016 but did not vote in 2020. We use inductive
   thematic analysis to identify the reasons behind their absenteeism. The
   main findings reveal that the main reasons for absenteeism are rooted in
   voters' long-term attitudes toward the political system and elections.
   The COVID-19 pandemic did not appear to influence people's absenteeism,
   but was sometimes used mainly as a pretext to stay at home.},

Abstract = {On February 24, 2022, the world was surprised by Russia's full-scale
   invasion of Ukraine and, perhaps even more so, by Ukraine's fierce
   resistance to it. In this article, we examine mainstream and feminist
   International Relations (IR) debates that have emerged in response to
   Russia's invasion, as well as the older debates revived through them.
   Building on decolonial and feminist scholarship, prominently centering
   feminist debates from Europe's East and Central Asia, we argue that
   dominant Western IR debates on Russia and Ukraine are shaped by
   inter-imperiality. We trace issues of epistemic injustice, epistemic
   imperialism and coloniality of knowledge production in mainstream IR and
   see them replicated in feminist debates, including from global South
   perspectives. We conclude with a contemplation on the structural changes
   warranted across academia to eliminate the coloniality of knowledge
   production about Ukraine and fellow societies as well as Indigenous
   nations affected by Russian colonial and imperial violence.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the authors look at the relationship between the Sami
   Parliament in Norway and the Sami civil society as seen both from the
   perspective of the party leaders and representatives, the civil society
   organisations, and the voters. While strong civil societies are
   important in ensuring responsive democratic governance systems in
   general, they may be particularly important in a political system such
   as the Sami. Sami politics operates within the Norwegian unitary state,
   where the tension between Sami autonomy and integration into the
   Norwegian is systemic and where the pressure towards increased
   co-optation is constantly present. The authors find that Sami interest
   and participation in civil society are at the same level as that of the
   population at large when the authors measure participation in Sami and
   Norwegian organisations combined, but only one out of four memberships
   are in a strictly Sami organisation. The authors also find that the
   level and type of contact between the parties represented in the Sami
   Parliament and Sami civil society organisations is very limited, except
   for organisational contact with the Sami Parliaments' administration for
   information and services. Little points in the direction of these
   organisations having an important advocacy role. Their control- and
   opposition role is weak. The rise of a new challenger party,
   Nordkalottfolket, becoming the second largest party in the election of
   2021, breaking with what makes Sami politics indigenous, seems not to
   change the structure of the relationship between civil society
   organisations and the Sami Parliament.},

Abstract = {Why do states use violence to repress dissent? When do opposition groups
   escalate conflict by employing violent tactics? We argue that not all
   opposition groups are created alike, and that understanding who is
   involved in protest is important for event outcomes. Because of their
   age and social status, student protesters are more likely to adopt
   confrontational behaviors, even when engaged in nominally peaceful
   protest. As such, students are more likely to be seen as threats by
   security forces tasked with responding to social unrest. Although
   frequently unplanned, spontaneous interactions between dissidents and
   regime forces can lead to an escalatory spiral. As such, we expect that
   student protests are more likely to escalate to violence than protests
   by other actors, and that security forces are more likely to use
   repression against students. This relationship will be especially
   pronounced when youth unemployment is high, leading to heightened
   grievances and fewer social constraints. Using event data combined with
   actor information on protest dynamics across seven countries in Africa
   and Latin America from 1990 to 2016, we find that although student
   groups are not more likely to engage in riots at the outset, when they
   do protest, violent interactions with police are more likely. Moreover,
   youth unemployment significantly increases the potential for violence.},

Abstract = {Recently, the authorities in Lagos have implemented policies
   progressively restricting the operation of okadas (motorcycle taxis). We
   analyze the enforcement of these measures through the lens of
   street-level bureaucrats (SLBs) and street-level policy entrepreneurs
   (SLPEs). Doing so, we introduce two novel features into the literature.
   First, the extant literature focuses primarily on policies that deliver
   public services, whereas policies can also control proscribed behavior.
   We refer to these as service delivery and regulation, respectively.
   Second, the exercise of discretion by SLBs and SLPEs can result in both
   ``underenforcement{''} and ``overenforcement{''} of regulatory policies,
   the latter potentially involving breaking the law. Drawing on extensive
   fieldwork in Lagos between 2021 and 2023, we find strong evidence of
   both underenforcement and overenforcement of okada bans over time, but
   with more overenforcement. This offers important insights conceptually
   for the SLPE literature and empirically to the challenges of policing
   urban Lagos.},

Abstract = {China is engaging in a broad and systematic effort to align its legal
   capabilities with its strategic goals in the South China Sea and the

   fill gaps in international law. Yet, while China's assertive
   `wolf-warrior diplomacy' has received considerable attention, its legal
   diplomacy has largely gone under the radar. Despite their insistence on
   the importance of the rules-based international order, the United States
   and other Western powers have been less proactive and methodical in
   their use of international law as compared to China. In an age of
   great-power competition, countries are drawing on a diverse range of
   tools - military, diplomatic, economic, developmental and intelligence -
   to gain strategic advantage. Countries that fail to bolster their own
   legal capabilities and to integrate legal diplomacy into their
   national-security strategies may surrender the power of legitimacy to
   China, even if, particularly in the South China Sea, Chinese actions
   have indubitably contravened international law.},

Abstract = {Based on an understanding of politicization as an increase in the
   relevance of political criteria in the selection and deselection of
   civil servants, this article proposes an innovative approach to measure
   civil service politicization with individual-level career data. For this
   purpose, two core types of political experience in civil servants'
   careers are distinguished: frontstage political experience as elected
   politician and backstage political experience in non-elected offices
   close to politics. For each core type, two subtypes are defined. The
   empirical measurement of the four different types of political
   experience is illustrated by the analysis of an original dataset of more
   than 2100 top civil service appointments in Germany in the time period
   1949-2017. Findings reveal a significant increase in backstage political
   experience. The approach developed for this article can be applied to
   explore various facets of politicization not only in longitudinal
   perspective but also in comparative studies.},

Abstract = {The global nuclear order - encompassing measures to prevent nuclear war,
   slow the proliferation of nuclear weapons and manage peaceful nuclear
   technology - today faces pressures that threaten its very viability.
   Global cooperation to limit arms racing has all but ceased. Frustration
   with the failure of the nuclear powers to make progress towards
   disarmament has called into question the durability of the
   Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The mixture of incentives and penalties
   to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons is losing its potency. A new
   grand bargain, equal in creativity and ambition to the one that birthed
   the NPT, is needed. The United States must signal willingness to make
   significant concessions to achieve a fresh consensus on global nuclear
   policy with two objectives. The first one is the prevention of a new
   arms race among the nuclear powers and the cessation of further
   proliferation. The second is a recommitment to sharing peaceful nuclear
   technology as part of a worldwide campaign to combat the climate crisis.},

Abstract = {How do we know when corruption has become widespread? Despite the rich
   body of literature on the problem, there are few proposed methods to
   conceptualize and empirically identify it within a geographic context.
   Using spatial analysis, this paper expands the means to identify
   corruption as an informal institution by examining the degree to which
   favoritism-in the form of preferential treatment for politically
   connected firms-is widespread in the Czech procurement sector. Using the
   conceptual guidance from literature on informal institutions, the
   empirical results show the prevalence throughout space, the stability
   over time, and the places by which preferential mechanisms coordinate
   widespread construction award disparities. These preferential patterns,
   which are not limited to one or a few individuals, exhibit
   characteristics that the problem is less of an exception and more of the
   rule.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The aim of this study is to understand the levels (i.e. mild
   vs intense) of task conflict (TC) expressions between angel investors
   and entrepreneurs at the post-investment stage and how it affect angel
   investors' follow-on investment intentions with the same
   entrepreneur.Design/methodology/approach - Survey data was gathered from
   71 angel investors in China. Mplus was used to test the proposed
   research model.Findings - This study found that angels perceive
   affective conflict (AC) when engaged in intense TC, unlike the case for
   mild TC expressions. Furthermore, the analysis shows that, unlike mild
   TC expressions, intense TC expressions impede angels' reinvestment
   intentions when they perceive ACs. Other results indicate that when
   angels perceive that entrepreneurs are not open to coaching, the
   prominence of mild TC expression is sharply mitigated and becomes as
   detrimental as intense TC expressions.Research limitations/implications
   - This study only focused on one specific aspect of the
   angel-entrepreneur post-investment relationship: The effect of their TC
   expressions on angels' reinvestment intentions. By no means do the
   authors imply that TC expression in the angel-entrepreneur
   post-investment relationship is the only factor that matters to angel
   investors in their follow-on investment intentions with the same
   entrepreneur.Practical implications - The findings suggest that
   entrepreneurs should pay careful attention to TC that may arise between
   them and their financiers. TCs are not entirely detrimental, but their
   negative effect might depend on how they are expressed. An appropriate
   level of TC may also improve enterprise performance and collaboration.
   Thus, angels and entrepreneurs should set clear goals and performance
   standards, where task interactions mainly focus on the goals and
   expected outcomes.Originality/value - Prior to this study, little was
   known about whether all TCs potentially lead to ACs. By distinguishing
   between levels (i.e. mild vs intense) of TC expressions between angels
   and entrepreneurs, this study adds a novel aspect to it by showing that
   TC, in and of itself, does not necessarily lead to AC but can lead to AC
   once its intensity grows.},

Abstract = {This article explores the reasons for the recent populist assault
   against elite academic institutions in Hungary and Turkey. After
   exploring the literature on populism, social mobility, and social
   pluralism, it then focuses on the modalities of the attack against two
   elite academic institutions, established upon the U.S. liberal arts
   college tradition, the Central European University (CEU) and Bogazici
   University, respectively, and its implications for Hungarian and Turkish
   politics. Two arguments are put forward: First, such attacks have
   emerged in the context of a populist narrative against institutions
   facilitating social mobility. Social mobility undermines the ``us versus
   them{''} populist narrative where the masses are permanently placed on
   the ``losers{''} side and therefore depend on the charismatic populist
   leader. With social mobility facilitated through high-quality academic
   institutions, these ``losers{''} have the chance to improve their
   material and non-material well-being through education. Second, these
   institutions promote social pluralism and critical thinking, cultivating
   a mode of reflection that contradicts the simplistic populist
   dichotomies and opposes democratic backsliding.},

Abstract = {The Ukrainian far right has attracted massive media interest, from
   Russian media condemning Ukraine's alleged Nazi takeover to
   international media warning of it becoming a transnational far-right
   hotspot. Countering these misconceptions, this article empirically
   studies the Ukrainian far-right movement to explain its mobilisation
   dynamics 2004-2020. Why did mobilisation peak in 2010-2014, and decline
   after? I argue that a combination of political and discursive
   opportunities offers an answer. However, these opportunities played out
   differently in Ukraine - a hybrid regime at war - than conventional
   social movement theory suggests. The Ukrainian case thus furthers our
   understanding of far-right movements beyond consolidated democracies.},

Abstract = {The pandemic caused by the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus
   and the associated COVID-19 disease brought to light not only the
   foundations of Western modernity and its assumptions about economic and
   social development but also the huge contradictions of the prevailing
   globalizing model. The pandemic exposed the structural and intrinsic
   contradictions of neoliberal globalization. The current economic and
   social consequences are related to the deepening of that model and
   particularly to the history of the prevailing employment structures and
   social inequalities. The emerging scenarios are uncertain, but the
   acceleration of an already advanced process of digital capitalism
   appears in sight. This process will entail, as part of the ``new
   normal,{''} new forms of precarity and social inequality.La pandemia
   causada por la rapida propagacion del coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 y la
   asociada enfermedad COVID-19 puso en evidencia no solo los fundamentos
   de la modernidad occidental y sus supuestos sobre el desarrollo
   economico y social, sino tambien las enormes contradicciones del modelo
   globalizador imperante. La pandemia expuso las contradicciones
   estructurales e intrinsecas de la globalizacion neoliberal. Las
   consecuencias economicas y sociales actuales estan relacionadas con la
   profundizacion de dicho modelo y, en particular, con la historia de las
   estructuras de empleo prevalecientes y las desigualdades sociales. Los
   escenarios emergentes son inciertos, pero la aceleracion de un proceso
   ya avanzado de capitalismo digital es inminente. Este proceso implicara,
   como parte de la ``nueva normalidad{''}, nuevas formas de precariedad y
   desigualdad social.},

Abstract = {The power of African labour to bargain for better terms of employment is
   an important precondition to ensuring decent jobs under energy
   transition-related resource (ETR) extraction and the global renewable
   energy sector more broadly. Through the lens of graphite mining
   communities in Cabo Delgado Province in Mozambique, this article
   examines the socio-economic contradictions constraining the power of
   residents to negotiate decent jobs from ETR projects in Cabo Delgado and
   other regions of the country. Six principal but intertwined
   contradictions are identified, including regional antipathies and
   limited livelihood alternatives, engaging energy transition discussions
   in Mozambique on the issues unfolding at the local level which inhibit
   workers from negotiating decent jobs. A micro-level perspective to
   examining challenges to decent African jobs enables critical reflection
   on the local aptness of climate change policies, such as the energy
   transition, which are predominantly discussed at the global, regional
   and national levels.},

Abstract = {The case of China gets at one of the core questions that the Berggruen
   Governance Index (BGI) poses-can we necessarily assume that democratic
   accountability makes for better governance performance? China has
   steadily improved in public goods and state capacity according to the
   BGI data from 2000 and 2019, especially in terms of economic public
   goods and fiscal capacity due to its rapid GDP growth under an
   investment-led growth model. However, China's democratic accountability
   has worsened, presenting an uncommon case of improved governance
   performance. Now China's economy stands at a crossroads amid the
   precedent-breaking leadership of Xi Jinping. Will China disprove the
   `autocratic fallacy,' whereby a dominant state setting priorities and
   making decisions for a society is sufficient? To what extent can China
   improve public goods provision and expand state capacity while limiting
   voice processes? This article examines key policies and strategies of
   China's governance performance over the past two decades. It also
   identifies future challenges underlying China's party-dominated and
   whole-of-nation approach to governance and its investment-led and
   export-oriented development model.},

Abstract = {This article explores how compartmentalised diplomacy, defined as the
   compartmentalisation of a comprehensive set of previously linked issues
   into separate but gradually and substantively expanding issues, helps
   forge an agreement on contested issues among member states in the United
   Nations Security Council. Based on a strategic bargaining framework, the
   article argues that subtracting issues from a comprehensive negotiation
   serves to create compartmentalised issues disassociated from other
   issues negotiated in the same context. Once an issue is separated,
   Council members may exploit a ratchet effect to expand a subtracted
   issue beyond what veto players initially may have preferred. Based on
   documentation by the non-profit organisation Security Council Report and
   news sources, an in-depth case study of Security Council action
   regarding Syria demonstrates how compartmentalised diplomacy helps
   Security Council members to forge landmark agreements on several
   contentious issues, even if members chiefly disagree on other issues.
   For comparative leverage and to assess the limits of the proposed
   mechanism, the analysis is briefly extended to other high-profile cases
   discussed in the Security Council (Sudan and Ukraine). The findings have
   implications for this essential tool of the Security Council to react to
   threats to peace.},

   capabilities from 1970 to 2014, drawn from the International Institute
   for Strategic Studies Military Balance. While practitioners have long
   recognized the importance of what weapons states own, scholars have
   largely examined surrounding questions in piecemeal fashion due to data
   limitations. The Distribution of Military Capabilities dataset
   identifies the weapons portfolios of states over the past half century
   at various levels of aggregation suitable to a wide variety of research
   questions. This paper begins by explaining the value of data on
   disaggregated national military capabilities, the data's scope, and the
   data collection process, including the creation of a new modular
   typology of weapons categories consistent across time and space. I then
   identify some initial trends about changes in the distribution of
   military capabilities and their implications for China's military rise.
   These data allow scholars to better investigate important questions
   concerning power projection, military innovation, conflict outcomes, the
   use of force decisions, and interest group lobbying.
   Este articulo presenta un conjunto de datos en materia de capacidades
   militares nacionales desagregadas desde 1970 a 2014 extraido del Balance
   Militar realizado por el Instituto Internacional de Estudios
   Estrategicos. Si bien los profesionales han reconocido durante mucho
   tiempo la importancia que tiene el tipo de armas que poseen los Estados,
   los academicos han estado examinando, en gran medida, las preguntas
   circundantes de una manera fragmentada debido a las limitaciones de
   datos. El conjunto de datos de Distribucion de Capacidades Militares
   (rDMC, por sus siglas en ingles) identifica la gama de armas que han
   tenido los Estados durante el ultimo medio siglo en varios niveles de
   agregacion, que resultan adecuados para poder responder a una amplia
   variedad de preguntas de investigacion. Este articulo comienza
   explicando el valor de los datos sobre capacidades militares nacionales
   desagregadas, el alcance de estos datos y el proceso de recopilacion de
   datos, incluyendo la creacion de una nueva tipologia modular de
   categorias de armas que resulta consistente en el tiempo y el espacio. A
   continuacion, identificamos algunas tendencias iniciales en materia de
   cambios en la distribucion de las capacidades militares y sus
   implicaciones para el ascenso militar de China. Estos datos permiten a
   los academicos poder investigar de mejor forma cuestiones importantes
   relacionadas con la proyeccion del poder, la innovacion militar, los
   resultados de los conflictos, las decisiones sobre el uso de la fuerza y
   la presion por parte de grupos de interes.
   Cet article presente un ensemble de donnees sur la desagregation des
   capacites militaires nationales entre 1970 et 2014 de l'evaluation
   annuelle << Military Balance >> (equilibre militaire) de l'International
   Institute for Strategic Studies. Bien que les professionnels admettent
   depuis longtemps l'importance des armes possedees par les etats, les
   chercheurs ont surtout analyse des questions peripheriques de facon
   fragmentaire a cause du manque de donnees. L'ensemble de donnees
   Distribution of Military Capabilities (rDMC) identifie le portefeuille
   d'armes des etats au cours des cinquante dernieres annees a differents
   niveaux d'agregation pour convenir a un large eventail de questions de
   recherche. Cet article explique d'abord la valeur des donnees sur la
   desagregation des capacites militaires nationales, leur portee et leur
   processus de collecte, y compris la creation d'une nouvelle typologie
   modulaire des categories d'armes coherente dans le temps et l'espace.
   J'identifie ensuite quelques tendances initiales relatives aux
   evolutions de la distribution des capacites militaires et leurs
   implications pour la montee en puissance militaire de la Chine. Ces
   donnees aident les chercheurs a etudier d'importantes questions
   concernant la projection de puissance, l'innovation militaire, les
   resultats d'un conflit, l'utilisation des decisions du recours a la
   force et le lobbying des groupes d'interet.},

Abstract = {PurposeCustomised capacity building is thought to be essential for
   organisations. However, empirical studies are lacking with respect to
   its effect on employee outcomes. This study aims to examine the effect
   of customised capacity building on employee outcomes including employee
   empowerment and employee engagement through employee learning in
   Ghanaian local government institutions.Design/methodology/approachValid
   responses from 281 employees of Metropolitan, Municipal, and District
   Assemblies (MMDAs) in Ghana were collected through a survey. A
   structural equation model was used to analyse the data and test the
   hypotheses formulated.FindingsThe results showed that customised
   capacity building has an effect on employee learning, employee
   empowerment, and employee engagement. Employee learning also had an
   effect on employee empowerment and employee engagement. In addition,
   employee learning partially mediated the effect of customised capacity
   building on both employee empowerment and employee
   engagement.Originality/valueThis study is of particular relevance to
   public organisations. As there is a dearth of studies focusing on
   customised capacity building, this study provides insight into
   incorporating the phenomenon into public sector organisations to enhance
   employee learning, empowerment and engagement.},

Abstract = {The fight against corruption is presented as a leading principle in
   policy papers and at donor conferences discussing Ukraine's
   reconstruction. It therefore mirrors the usual narrative surrounding
   post-war reconstruction and democracy promotion attempts. However,
   reconstruction aid has historically been used for illicit means by
   elites and ended up strengthening an uneven system rather than building
   a resilient and successful country, despite the window of opportunity
   for the latter. Rather than just proposing principles, this paper
   therefore poses the question of how actors involved in the
   reconstruction process can be bound to stick to their previously
   propagated and formally existing principles. The analysis combines
   academic and policy-oriented studies and highlights the combined
   importance of the external and internal dimension for a successful
   outcome. It proposes a `double conditionality' mechanism, where an
   independent, technocratic institution holds frozen, Russian assets and
   partially reimburses Western donors only after successful audits on the
   reconstruction aid are conducted. This conditionality puts domestic
   pressure on aid givers to follow through with the anti-corruption
   conditions formulated beforehand and to call out any reform bluff on
   Kyiv's side. Paired with a credible EU accession perspective, this can
   bring about the much-needed stimulus for a build back better scenario.},

Abstract = {In the face of the complexities of problem-solving, experts are gaining
   centrality in policymaking (Weiss, 1979). At the same time, they are
   increasingly challenged in their legitimacy, which is not only technical
   but also political. Challenges to the legitimacy of experts suggest that
   other types of legitimacy are important for policymaking. Issues of
   legitimacy are particularly important for sound policymaking when the
   authority of experts and the value of evidence are contested and when
   the debate over policy solutions is particularly conflictual and
   ideological. In this paper, I use three exploratory cases of the use of
   expertise in education policy in Italy to show how policymakers design
   different advisory committees to enhance different types of legitimacy
   (epistemic, bureaucratic, and political). The findings suggest that
   while policymakers design advisory committees primarily to meet their
   legitimacy needs, the legitimacy of a decision requires different types
   of sources to generate consent and to allow for the impact of expertise.},

Abstract = {Many government agencies operate with fewer personnel than they need to
   perform effectively. Yet little research has explored how agencies might
   allocate their personnel so as to maximize performance with the
   personnel they have. I address this gap through a study of Brazil's
   federal protected areas agency, which manages the world's third largest
   system of conservation areas. Based on 66 interviews and econometric
   analyses covering 322 administrative units, I find that three moderators
   influence the relationship between sub-unit size and performance: the
   size of a sub-unit's jurisdiction, a sub-unit's likelihood of near-term
   failure, and the strength of a sub-unit's ties with local stakeholders.
   Personnel re-allocation strategies informed by these factors may have
   reduced deforestation on the order of 26\% over the agency's first
   decade. This study contributes a framework for analyzing the efficacy of
   personnel allocation strategies, with implications for management of one
   of the world's greatest natural assets.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic unleashed a socioeconomic catastrophe on the
   region with the highest rate of inequality in the world, Latin America.
   Never before have social protections (especially in public health)
   become so important and so demanded by large sections of society. A
   study of the social protection systems of some of the most important
   Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay) in the
   light of the observed ideopolitical alternation between progressive and
   conservative governments reveals how the sociopolitical environment gave
   rise to a neoconservative cycle that, in combination with the COVID-19
   pandemic, resulted in the decay of these systems and the recognition of
   their importance.A pandemia da COVID-19 desencadeou uma catastrofe
   socioeconomica na regiao com o maior indice de desigualdade do mundo, a
   America Latina. Nunca antes as protecoes sociais (especialmente da saude
   publica) se tornaram tao importantes e tao exigidas por grandes setores
   da sociedade. Um estudo dos sistemas de protecao social de alguns dos
   mais importantes paises latino-americanos (Argentina, Brasil, Chile e

Abstract = {We establish the prevalence of partisan schadenfreude-that is, taking
   ``joy in the suffering{''} of partisan others. Analyzing attitudes on
   health care, taxation, climate change, and the coronavirus pandemic, we
   find that a sizable portion of the American mass public engages in
   partisan schadenfreude and that these attitudes are most expressed by
   those who are ideologically extreme. Additionally, we find that a
   sizable portion of the American public is more likely than not to vote
   for candidates who promise to pass policies that ``disproportionately
   harm{''} supporters of the opposing political party, and we demonstrate
   experimental evidence of demand/preference for candidates who promise
   cruelty among those who exhibit high amounts of schadenfreude. In sum,
   our results suggest that partisan schadenfreude is widespread and has
   disturbing implications for American political behavior.},

Title = {Understanding the search for more autonomy in Greater Manchester: an
   alternative perspective on the politics of devolution in England},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {Critical social scientific accounts of the confused and inconsistent
   process of ``devolution{''} in England in recent years have rightly
   emphasized the place that Greater Manchester and, most recently, the
   Greater Manchester Combined Authority, has occupied at the forefront of
   UK metropolitan institutional reform. They typically give little credit,
   however, to the long-running, independent processes of mobilization and
   institution-building that have resulted in Greater Manchester achieving
   this vanguard position. This article challenges the idea that
   contemporary metropolitan governance in Greater Manchester can be seen
   merely as a pawn in the hands of a regressive, centralist state or else
   as an undemocratic vehicle designed to enable a city elite to dominate
   its metropolitan neighbors. In taking a longer historical perspective
   than is common to critical accounts, the article demonstrates that
   metropolitanization in England has not followed a coherent centralizing
   script and neither has the current Combined Authority been constrained,
   or chosen, to adopt the narrow economic development logic its critics
   allege. The latter is exemplified by an empirical examination of the
   work done in Greater Manchester on the theme of work and health. The
   article concludes with an assessment of how a fragile and very English
   form of devolution might develop in the difficult context in which the
   UK now finds itself, arguing that social scientific analysis can perform
   much better in identifying ways in which further enhancements of
   sub-national autonomy can support the realization of progressive social
   and environmental goals.},

Abstract = {The effectiveness of and its boundary conditions regarding fact-checking
   news exposure have significant normative and practical implications.
   While many of the prior studies have focused on the attitudinal
   consequences of fact-checking news delivered by neutral third parties
   such as fact-check organizations, relatively less is known as to the
   effect of fact-checking news delivered by partisan media. Based on the
   frameworks of motivated reasoning and the hostile-media effect, we
   investigate the possibility of decoupling between attitudinal persuasion
   and perceptual backfire by fact-checking news by partisan media-that is,
   exposure to fact-checking news increases bias perception of such news
   yet nevertheless attitudinally persuades audiences. Based on a series of
   original experiments conducted in South Korea and in the United States,
   we find consistent support for our prediction, in that exposure to
   fact-checking news produces the corrective effects, yet at the same time
   perceived bias of the fact-checking news systematically varies as a
   function of the ideological slant of partisan media.},

Abstract = {Among the legal instruments that address organized right-wing extremism
   in Europe, proscription is one of the most severe. Yet there is scant
   comparative work on where, how frequently, and against which right-wing
   extremist organization proscriptions have been applied. This article
   presents a new dataset on Proscribed Right-wing Extremist Organizations
   (PREOs) in Europe. A typology of countries' proscriptive regimes
   illuminates how proscription by executive decrees is more frequent than
   proscription by judicial ruling, and how proscription by executive
   decrees appears to be more responsive to high-profile incidents of
   extremist violence. We complement this descriptive overview with a close
   investigation of patterns in Germany, the state that has most frequently
   used proscription against right-wing extremist organizations.
   Furthermore, the article presents paired case studies of the
   proscriptions of Blood \& Honour in Germany (by executive decree) and
   the Nordic Resistance Movement in Finland (by judicial ruling), which
   point to the causal factors underlying proscription of right-wing
   extremist organizations.},

Abstract = {Instead of acting consistently with international law and its own
   refugee law, the EU has adopted an ambivalent stance over refugee
   arrivals to Europe. Member states increasing anxiety led the EU to
   tighten border controls and outsource its humanitarian responsibilities
   by agreeing on a statement with Turkey to prevent refugees from entering
   the EU irregularly. This paper focuses on the human rights breaches and
   contradictions of the EU-Turkey Statement by specifically investigating
   the one-in-one-out mechanism and the argument that Turkey is safe
   country. It is argued that the Statement has turned the refugee issue
   into the subject of the European market because the political
   architecture of EU human rights norms has historically been part of the
   neoliberal hegemony. Hence, the refugee case reveals how inadequately
   produced norms inside Europe's borders reproduce inequalities and cause
   mismatches between the EU's claimed role as rights promoter and its
   practical inadequacies and market-based pragmatism.},

Abstract = {Public procurement is crucial for effective crisis responses, but is
   also prone to corruption. To ensure a swift provision of medical
   supplies in the COVID-19 pandemic, the public procurement regulations
   were dramatically relaxed. However, the implications for corruption
   require attention. This paper analyses how the regulatory responses to
   the crisis affected the risks and perceptions of corruption, by changing
   public-private interactions and the regulatory environment for public
   procurement. We compare the contrasting cases of Italy and Germany and
   triangulate legal analyses, secondary contract and survey data, and an
   online survey of public administrations (N = 445) and businesses (N =
   175). Unexpectedly, in both countries, objective risks of corruption
   increased similarly. Sector-specific corruption perceptions stem from a
   low competitiveness of procedures, rule ambiguity, and a politicised
   bureaucracy. To avoid wasting resources and losing trust, regulatory
   responses to the crisis should include clear rules that safeguard
   competitive public procurement procedures and preserve bureaucratic
   independence.},

Abstract = {This article critically explores what peace means for 39 practitioners
   and stakeholders in the city of Acapulco, Mexico in 2021. Working in
   non-formal education, community development, the arts, and culturally
   based activities across the city, their responses provide unique insight
   into what peace might look like in a city with high levels of
   inequality, drug-related violence, and crime. Facilitating their vision
   of peace and getting participants to articulate what peace would look
   like for them, this article provides insights into practitioners' views,
   changing the narrative from them being victims of violence to agents of
   positive social change. Peacebuilding literature frames the discussion,
   and the article concludes with lessons derived from the detailed
   analysis of participant views which might offer a pathway for others
   living and working in similar contexts.},

Abstract = {More than two decades after the 9/11 attacks, the militarised approach
   to counterterrorism initiated by the George W. Bush Administration
   remains firmly in place. Growing frustration with these actions has
   prompted debates on `forever war'. This article traces the origins of
   `forever war' to the interplay of neoconservatism and conservative
   nationalism in the George W. Bush Administration, which aimed at
   preserving American primacy through the cultivation of overwhelming
   military power. The Administration's support for the revolution in
   military affairs contributed to the development of a more remote
   counterterrorism approach, which helps explain the continuities in US
   counterterrorism policies across the latter Bush administration as well
   as the Obama and Trump presidencies. By helping embed a `common sense'
   understanding that further 9/11-style attacks could only be prevented by
   enduring and aggressive military action against transnational terrorist
   organisations, neoconservatism shaped the evolution of American
   counterterrorism policy. The specific influence of neoconservatism must
   be qualified and contextualised, however, because the strategic
   commitment to primacy had wider support within the Bush Administration.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes through qualitative and quantitative analysis of
   European Union (EU) policy documents the framing of EU policy on
   energy-efficient buildings from the 1970s to 2022. We find that it has
   been framed in different ways over the decades and the framing has
   expanded to include more and more benefits. Through this expansion,
   energy efficiency has been linked to other policy areas, such as
   security, environmental, economic, and social policy. The shifts in
   framing can be seen as responses to external events. The expansion can
   also be explained using two metaphors to analyze how the framing differs
   depending on political positioning. One where policy is seen as a Swiss
   knife, able to solve multiple political problems, and one where policy
   is seen as a Trojan horse, where new policy domains are snuck in by
   policymakers disguising it as energy efficiency policy to increase EU
   competency in relation to national governments.},

Abstract = {The establishment of official diplomatic relations between the State of
   Israel and the Kingdom of Morocco in December 2020 is undoubtedly a
   significant event. However, it must be seen as a step forward within the
   con-text of wide-ranging pragmatic geopolitical cooperation between Tel
   Aviv and Rabat since the middle of the twentieth century. Considering
   this perspective, this article presents an analysis using the
   neoclassical realism approach to re-lations between Israelis and
   Moroccans, which have made the North African country one of the most
   notable actors in Israel's peripheral strategy to streng-then its
   national security.},

Abstract = {This article identifies two distinct varieties of economic nationalism
   in the United States that have strong and lasting implications for
   transatlantic trade relations and traces their origins to how the two
   major parties use narratives to form competitive coalitions including
   trade critics since 2020. The Republican Party links trade critics with
   culture war supporters, allowing them to enhance their collective impact
   on domestic and foreign policy, including confrontation with Europe on
   trade. Democrats' pursuit of trade critics in 2020 and beyond means a
   focus on domestic development and industrial policy appealing to
   centrist and progressive voters, and eschewing trade agreements. This
   developmental economic nationalism offers room for allied
   interdependence across the Atlantic.},

Abstract = {Paul Kelly pays scant attention to the so-called `democratic peace'
   thesis that has played a major role in recent International Relations
   scholarship, a lacuna which we regard to be serious. Our paper
   investigates the normative background to the connection between
   democracy and peace, commonly associated with Immanuel Kant. We argue
   that attention should be devoted instead to the critique of
   international conflict found in the writings of Thomas Paine, who
   (unlike Kant) offers a politically grounded account of both why peace
   among nations is desirable and how that might be achieved. In
   particular, we consider Paine's views on democratic peace through the
   lens of his goals of eliminating the tyranny of kings and aristocrats
   and of ameliorating the material conditions of the poor. Paine contended
   that the establishment of global peace paralleled a process of global
   democratisation that would liberate the masses from their political and
   economic exploitation at the hands of a powerful few, whose interests
   converged in the prosecution of war.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the differences between candidate turnover at
   national legislative and European Parliament elections. Multilevel
   analysis is applied on original data containing 2754 electoral lists,
   clustered within 79 political parties, within 48 national and European
   elections. These comparative data allow (1) to test hypotheses on
   second-order EU elections within the context of electoral recruitment
   and (2) to measure the effect of systemic turnover drivers, which in
   turn may differ for EP elections. As such, this paper builds further on
   the emerging literature on candidate renewal by offering a comparative
   perspective and understanding the particular dynamic for EP elections.
   Results suggest that candidate turnover is lower at EP elections.
   Moreover, the effects of turnover drivers differ at EP elections:
   candidate turnover is lower on lists of fringe parties at the European
   level and elections with higher electoral volatility are characterised
   by higher candidate turnover, particularly at European elections.},

Abstract = {Our paper addresses the question of how governments respond to the
   politicisation of preferential trade agreements (PTA). How have
   governments responded to business interest mobilisation while
   negotiating PTAs? Moreover, if there has been an increase in the
   salience of a trade agreement, has this changed the government response?
   First, we assess politicisation in terms of the mobilisation patterns of
   private sector interests during PTA negotiations. Our central argument
   is that governments liberalise more when a broad range of business
   interests involving a large number of sectors mobilise in response to
   trade negotiations, as this would provide legitimacy to their policy
   positions. Second, we study governments' reactions to the level of
   salience of the trade agreement at hand. We argue that governments
   liberalise less when the agreement in question is highly salient and
   provokes increased public debate. We take an actor-centred and
   comparative approach to our research questions and use a novel dataset
   of 157 PTAs covering the period from 2005 to 2018. Both of our
   hypotheses are supported by our analysis. Our results also reveal an
   important difference between PTA `depth' and `rigidity', which are often
   perceived as closely correlated in assessing trade openness.},

Abstract = {Extensive institutional and policy change is necessary for the values of
   co-operation and constructive dialogue in international relations to be
   restored in the current context of the declining world order. But that
   alone is not sufficient. We also need behavioural changes in the world's
   top leaders. Hypermasculine and hubristic performance in strongman
   leader behaviour have consequences for stable world order. While there
   is robust research on corporate leadership, similar research focusing on
   the personal socio-psychological agency of strongman leaders in
   international relations is in its infancy. This paper uses the
   psychoanalytic frameworks: of narcissism and hubris syndrome to focus on
   the styles and practices of strongman leadership in international
   relations. The cognitive behavioural practices of this kind of
   leadership on co-operation and dialogue reflect a set of
   gender-performative, hypermasculine practices. While this is not an
   exercise in feminist scholarship, it is our analytical and not very
   subtle normative and prescriptive conclusion that any reform of
   international co-operation will be greatly limited without a greater
   gendered understanding and practice of power, if we are to combat the
   all too easily condoned rebarbative behaviour of strongman leaders in
   international relations.},

Abstract = {Reinforced by the technological decoupling and the related battle for
   technological supremacy between the United States and China,
   telecommunication technology has become increasingly politicised. As the
   functioning of global telecommunication technology relies on
   interoperability and compatibility, government and private actors have
   strong incentives to shape the underlying standards in their economic
   and political interests. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
   and its Members play a central role in setting these standards for
   future telecommunication technology. Despite the ITU's importance in
   this field, relatively little is known about the organisation's work on
   standardisation and the actors behind it. This Policy Insight introduces
   a new data set on the involvement of over 800 government and private
   actors and their almost 50,000 contributions to ITU standardisation
   processes between 2000 and 2022. A descriptive analysis of the data set
   illustrates that particularly Chinese actors-Huawei, ZTE, China Mobile,
   China Unicom and China Telecom-have been actively driving the ITU's
   standardisation processes in the areas of transport, access and home but
   also future networks and cloud. The data set introduced here is
   envisaged as a source which allows researchers to study the reasons and
   implications for certain actors' involvement in the international
   standardisation of telecommunication and digitalisation.},

Abstract = {Social media communication makes visible the linkages between
   governments' actions to diplomatic events and domestic audiences'
   reactions. This study analyses tweets that discuss the recent diplomatic
   crisis between Japan and Korea. Through the detection of clusters of
   Twitter users and the content analysis of the tweets in the two
   countries, this study shows the public's interpretation of a crisis
   widely differs by their stances towards their country's government. The
   analysis finds that the clusters are aligned with their pro- and
   anti-stances towards the current government and that pro-government
   clusters tend to interpret the diplomatic crisis through a historical
   perspective, while anti-government clusters interpret it as a matter of
   present-day politics. Furthermore, we find strong negativity in the
   tweets discussing the opponent online groups, especially by the
   anti-government cluster against the pro-government online camp. These
   findings suggest that a diplomatic crisis may create or deepen domestic
   polarisation.},

Title = {Under God, indivisible? Religious salience and interstate territorial
   conflict},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {How and under what conditions do religious factors explain the
   militarization of interstate territorial disputes? We argue that
   inconclusive findings in previous studies stem from inadequate
   consideration of the interaction between challenger state religiosity
   and the domestic constituencies actually invested in religiously salient
   territorial claims. To address this gap, this article differentiates
   between secular regimes, which provide minimal support to their state's
   dominant religion and religious regimes, which strongly support their
   dominant religion. It also considers narrowly salient coreligionist
   populations, which appeal almost exclusively to religious audiences,
   versus broadly salient contested sacred sites, which appeal to much
   broader constituencies. We argue that the interaction between these two
   factors produces very different patterns of interstate conflict
   behavior. Secular regimes avoid escalation over narrowly salient
   religious claims because they do not depend upon religious constituents
   for support. However, they lack the necessary religious legitimacy to
   manage outbidding challenges that frequently arise over more broadly
   salient claims. Religious regimes, by contrast, enjoy high domestic
   religious legitimacy, enabling more peaceful engagement with broadly
   salient religious claims. Yet their political dependence upon religious
   constituencies incentivizes conflict when disputes involve narrowly
   salient religious claims. We test these propositions utilizing original
   data on the religious salience of interstate territorial disputes in the
   post-Cold War era, from 1990 to 2010. Analyses, using both dichotomous
   and continuous measures of regime religiosity, confirm these inferences
   and contribute to highly nuanced understandings of how state-religion
   policy and religious salience interact to influence patterns of
   interstate violence.},

Title = {Influences of Islamist Radicalization: A Configurational Analysis of
   Balkan Foreign Fighters in Syria},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 17},
Abstract = {Recent research on Islamist radicalization has directed greater
   attention to the conjunctions of causes and staged processes that draw
   individuals into violent extremism. Yet research is still grappling with
   the varying extents of individual action and external factors, including
   social networks, peer pressure, propaganda, cultural and socio-economic
   conditions, on radicalization processes. At bottom, this investigation
   revolves around the context in which individuals live and the influences
   acting upon them. Identifying patterns of these conditions is essential
   to understanding how individuals come to engage in violent extremism.
   This article presents a configurational analysis of foreign fighters
   that travelled to fight in the Syrian War. The paper presents data
   gathered from interviews, security and judicial records, and secondary
   sources on individuals from the Western Balkans (predominantly Bosnia
   and Herzegovina) that joined Islamist groups in the Syrian War.
   Individuals' relationship with longstanding Balkan radical milieus and
   with key Islamist preachers were coded. Using qualitative comparative
   analysis (QCA) techniques, we present a systematic description of
   characteristics of foreign fighters.},

Abstract = {This article grounds the morality of secession on two forms of
   collective self-determination: one manifests the communal goods of
   secessionists and the other the value of shared political institutions.
   Secession is morally valuable when the two are incompatible such that
   the claimant confronts persistent alienation. For remedial rights
   theories, only `strict violations' permit secession. For primary rights
   theories, `broad violations' grant secession as a last resort, and so
   this thesis, `collective self-determination as nonalienation', should be
   accepted regardless. First, as the two collective forms of
   self-determination develop two forms of territorial rights, it
   supplements cogent accounts of territorial justification for, and claims
   to, secession. Second, as persistent alienation can have both strict and
   broad interpretations, it also provides moral grounds shared by remedial
   and primary rights theories if they concede the value of collective
   self-determination. The strict sense refers to persistent coercion that
   violates personal autonomy and nullifies state legitimacy. The broad
   interpretation denotes long-term political frustration caused by
   unreasonable prevention of greater collective autonomy that even
   legitimate states may achieve. Third, to verify whether this amounts to
   long-term political frustration and to address persistent alienation,
   secession should be regarded as a last resort, despite its support from
   the primary rights account.},

Abstract = {This article examines Polish underground publications (samizdat)
   interpreting Ukraine's role in the Polish-Soviet war of 1920. The
   research analyzes a large number of underground journals, newspapers,
   and books. It shows the relationship between the political thought of
   Polish emigres and the opposition within the Polish People's Republic.
   The article argues that the Polish oppositionists considered rethinking
   the history of relations with Poland's eastern neighbors an essential
   precondition for gaining its sovereignty. They regarded the
   Polish-Soviet war of 1920 as one of the most critical episodes in
   Polish-Ukrainian-Russian relations in recent history. A common feature
   of most opposition publications on the Polish-Soviet war was emphasizing
   the joint struggle of Ukrainians and Poles against the Bolsheviks. The
   authors often emphasized the combat value of Ukrainian units and
   stressed that Poland did not correctly appreciate their contribution to
   the common struggle. They also believe that the conditions of Polish aid
   were too painful for Ukraine. The defeat of the project for an
   independent Ukraine laid the foundations for the Soviet attack on Poland
   in 1939. The main conclusion from this historical episode, for most
   Polish oppositionists, was that supporting Ukraine's independence was of
   strategic interest for Poland. In turn, Poland must abandon competition
   with Russia for Ukraine as a sphere of influence in the future. Only
   equal relations with its eastern neighbors will give Poland lasting
   security.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the 15 elections that took place between 2010 and
   2019 in four South European countries - Greece, Italy, Portugal and
   Spain - through the lenses of the retrospective vote theory. The large
   within-country variation of economic conditions justifies the adoption
   of an original subnational perspective, while the explicit test of
   alternative economic quantities and horizons provides a more credible
   assessment of voters' behaviours. Besides offering a taxonomy of local
   retrospective voting, the research found that citizens assessed the
   incumbents against regional unemployment levels and national growth
   dynamics, further benchmarking the local economic conditions against
   their past performances. These results give credit to the idea that the
   South European electorate shares similar references in assessing the
   economic competences of incumbent governments.},

Abstract = {Understanding population-level variability in responses to pathogens
   over time is important for developing effective health-based messages
   targeted at ideologically diverse populations. Research from
   psychological and political sciences suggests that party and elite cues
   shape how people respond to major threats like climate change. Research
   on responses to the COVID-19 pandemic suggests similar variability
   across party identities; however, prior work has methodological
   limitations. This prospective, longitudinal study of a large
   probability-based nationally representative U.S. sample assessed in
   March-April 2020 (N = 6,514) and then 6 months later in
   September-October 2020 (N = 5,661) demonstrates that COVID-19 fear,
   perceived COVID-19 death risk, and reported health-protective behaviors
   became increasingly polarized over the first 6 months of the pandemic.
   Initial differences between Democrats and Republicans failed to converge
   over time and became more pronounced. Responses among Republicans were
   further polarized by support for former President Donald Trump: Trump
   Republicans initially reported weaker responses to COVID-19 than
   non-Trump Republicans, and these differences became more pronounced over
   time. Importantly, political identity and Trump support were not linked
   to perceived infection risk of a nonpoliticized pathogen, the flu.
   Finally, political identity and Republican Trump support prospectively
   predicted COVID-19 vaccine intentions 6 months into the pandemic.},

Abstract = {This project assesses the process of moderation within three Islamist
   political parties, specifically, the Kurdistan Justice Party, the
   Kurdistan Islamic Union and the Islamic Movement in Kurdistan. The
   process of Islamist moderation is a gradual and complicated one and
   there are numerous factors affecting this process. In the literature,
   `inclusion-moderation theory' is a key thesis that outlines the factors
   concerning Islamist moderation. It argues that the inclusion of
   Islamists in the political arena consequently gives rise to their
   moderation. However, this study expands upon this thesis and argues that
   while it holds true for these three Islamist parties, there are other
   essential factors associated with the moderation journey experienced by
   these parties. These parties' behavioural changes, in the form of
   political moderation, are more common compared to ideological
   moderation. This conclusion is based on two distinct sources of
   evidence. First, the parties' formal documents, such as internal and
   programme guides and secondly, first-hand data obtained by means of
   interviewing the political elites or leaders of these three Islamist
   parties.},

Abstract = {We conceptualize and measure right-wing populism (RWP) as a
   three-dimensional concept, explicitly and implicitly, based on online
   surveys and implicit association tests (IATs) in Germany and
   Switzerland. Confirmatory factor analyses show that explicit populism,
   nativism, and authoritarianism establish the latent RWP-construct and
   that they are each related to their respective implicit counterpart.
   However, RWP ideology does not exist as an equally robust construct in
   the implicit realm as it does in the explicit realm. Resulting
   implicit-explicit incongruence is psychologically meaningful in that it
   is moderated by willingness to comply with perceived social norms: For
   participants who perceive that their own political views differ from
   their social environment and who conceal their diverging opinions,
   implicit attitudes differ more strongly from explicit attitudes. This
   supports our rationale that explicit expression of RWP-ideology is
   subject to social-compatibility concerns. Hence, corresponding implicit
   attitudes are useful to fully assess the RWP potential within society.},

   authoritarian regimes? Missing from the existing scholarship, which
   focuses mostly on regimes generating political budget cycles and
   manipulating electoral rules, is an exploration of how non-fiscal and
   non-electoral policies may impact incumbent support. We examine this
   issue with electoral and census data from one of the world's most
   prominent authoritarian regimes - Russia - to evaluate the regime's 2017
   change to the policy governing native language instruction, which
   curtailed minority students' ability to learn their native languages and
   faced opposition in some ethnic regions. Examining panel data on
   presidential elections using fixed effects models, our results reveal
   that the regime's support decreased in titular minority areas in 2018.
   The results also indicate that some of these patterns emerged in
   previous national legislative elections and thus cannot be solely
   attributed to the policy change.},

Abstract = {Does ``shaming{''} work in NATO? More precisely, does publicly using
   negative language criticizing allies' defense spending improve
   burden-sharing, or is it counterproductive, leading to lower spending?
   We evaluate the effectiveness of public shaming language; specifically,
   whether it increases allies' defense spending or whether other
   considerations like external threat, domestic budgets, economic growth,
   or unemployment rates are better predictors of contributions. Using an
   original dataset of presidential statements and NATO defense spending
   data disaggregated across the four categories tracked by the alliance,
   we conclude that negative language toward allies' spending is at best
   ineffective and may even adversely affect burden-sharing in the long
   run. These findings have important implications for the political
   economy of alliances and both theories and policies on the use of
   rhetorical pressure to elicit compliance in asymmetric power
   relationships.},

Abstract = {Defense policy makers have become increasingly concerned about conflict
   in the ``gray zone{''} between peace and war. Such conflicts are often
   interpreted as cases of deterrence failures, as new technologies or
   tactics-from cyber operations to ``little green men{''}-seem to increase
   the effectiveness of low-intensity aggression. However, gray zone
   conflict could also be a case of deterrence success, where challengers
   adopt a constrained form of aggression in response to a credible
   escalation threat. We develop a model that formalizes both scenarios and
   identifies distinct empirical patterns across the two cases. We use the
   model's findings to empirically analyze Russian gray zone activity since
   the 1990s, finding that Russian activity appears, in part, to be
   restrained by NATO's deterrent threat. Our model also shows that
   developing gray zone conflict capabilities can lead to more peace but
   could also backfire and provoke a challenger to escalate to war.},

Abstract = {This essay approaches the neoliberal tradition of thought through the
   lens of liberal imperialism. Seeking to bring scholarship on the history
   of neoliberal ideas together with research on liberal defences of
   empire, I show that the neoliberal tradition of thought contains a
   number of formal, explicit, and systematic defences of (European)
   colonialism. In the first section of the essay, I contextualise
   neoliberal imperialism by showing that many prominent early neoliberals
   had close ties to the British Colonial Office. I then offer a close
   reading of two highly influential instances of the neoliberal defence of
   empire. The first was articulated between the 1930s and 1940s by Herbert
   Frankel, who saw colonisation as a form of civilisational improvement
   that places a heavy ethical and political burden on the coloniser. The
   second was articulated by Lewis Gann and Peter Duignan between the 1960s
   and 1970s. In contrast to Frankel's civilisational justification of
   colonialism, Gann and Duignan articulated a more dispassionate
   cost-benefit argument, claiming that colonialism's advantages outweigh
   its disadvantages. The article concludes by reflecting on the
   implications of this shift from a civilisational to a consequentialist
   frame both for the neoliberal tradition and for liberal imperialist
   discourse at large.},

Abstract = {This article examines recent international financial institution and
   national government policy in North Africa intended to address the
   climate emergency. It focuses on the role of the World Bank and general
   policy trends since the 1970s. These policy trends fail to understand
   the continuing centrality of small-scale family farming to social
   reproduction and food production. The article stresses the significance
   of historical patterns of underdevelopment, and the uneven incorporation
   of North Africa into global capitalism. An understanding of the longue
   duree is crucial in understanding why, and how, agrarian transformations
   have taken the form that they have, and why national sovereign projects
   and popular struggles offer an alternative strategy to counter
   imperialism and neo-colonialism. International financial institutions'
   preoccupation with policies of mitigation and adaptation to climate
   change fails to address how poverty is generated and reproduced.
   Cet article examine les recentes politiques des institutions financieres
   internationales et des gouvernements nationaux en Afrique du Nord visant
   a repondre a l'urgence climatique. Il se concentre sur le role de la
   Banque mondiale et sur les tendances politiques depuis les annees 1970.
   Il s'agit d'une politique qui ne comprend pas le role central que
   continue de jouer l'agriculture familiale a petite echelle dans la
   reproduction sociale et la production alimentaire. L'article souligne
   l'importance des tendances historiques de sous-developpement et
   l'integration inegale de l'Afrique du Nord dans le capitalisme mondial.
   Une comprehension de la longue duree est cruciale pour comprendre
   pourquoi et comment les transformations agraires ont pris la forme
   qu'elles ont prise et pourquoi les projets souverains nationaux et les
   luttes populaires offrent une strategie alternative pour contrer
   l'imperialisme et le neocolonialisme. La preoccupation des institutions
   financieres internationales pour les politiques d'attenuation et
   d'adaptation au changement climatique ne tient pas compte de la maniere
   dont la pauvrete est generee et reproduite.},

Abstract = {Employing a perceptual approach to EU foreign policy studies, we argue
   that extensive changes following the full-scale Russian invasion of
   Ukraine in February 2022 have created important opportunities for
   diminishing many of the perceptual gaps that existed between the EU and
   Ukraine following the annexation of Crimea. We distinguish between
   changes in Ukraine's and the EU's attitudes towards each other,
   contextual changes as a result of the war and changes in EU policy on
   the candidacy of Ukraine - shifts that open up new avenues for closing
   existing perceptual gaps but also create challenges for EU diplomacy. We
   apply this theorisation to understand one aspect of Europe's
   transformation in the context of Russia's war against Ukraine - the
   transformation of the EU's public diplomacy. We venture that the
   opportunities for perceptual changes that have occurred may only be
   realized if the EU commits to a `new' public diplomacy.},

Abstract = {The Russian aggression against Ukraine brought energy security to the
   top of the European policy agenda. Existing literature suggests that the
   prioritization of energy security would come at the expense of climate
   policy. We argue that the EU's response to the Russian invasion of
   Ukraine may constitute a departure from this pattern. Our assessment
   shows a higher level of coherence of objectives and instruments between
   energy security and climate objectives than the EU's energy policy
   responses to previous crises with Russia, notably the gas supply crisis
   of 2009 and the annexation of Crimea in 2014. While some uncertainty
   about final outcomes remains, we argue that change in several contextual
   conditions helps explain coherent policy outputs and make coherent
   outcomes more likely on the occasion of the present crisis.},

Abstract = {When the detention programme at the U.S. naval base at Guant \&
   aacute;namo Bay (GTMO) started in 2002, the Bush administration
   described it as an essential front in the War on Terror. A few years
   later, the programme was widely seen as a liability. As political
   discourse about GTMO grew more critical, how did the detention
   programme's official discourse evolve? What does this discourse tell us
   about the endurance of states of exception? Scholarship on GTMO
   emphasizes the exceptional status of the site, but often overlooks the
   broader military system of which the base is one part, as well as the
   ways GTMO has changed over time. To examine changes in the official
   discourse of the detention programme, this article undertakes visual and
   discourse analysis of 438 issues of The Wire, the official newspaper of
   the programme. The analysis identifies various changes, most notably
   that the newspaper switched format in late 2006, from military bulletin
   to lifestyle magazine. The Wire shifted from situating GTMO on the front
   lines of the War on Terror, to characterizing the base as a site of
   recreation. The Wire also changed from emphasizing the exceptional
   events of the War on Terror, to situating the detention programme within
   a longer history of unending conflict. These changes revitalized the
   exception of indefinite detention and perpetual warfare. This study
   shows that systems of exceptional violence are perpetuated not just
   through banal, normalizing processes, but also through discourses of
   leisure, therapy, and personal achievement.},

Abstract = {Can transparency enhance the legitimacy of international institutions?
   As transparency has become a widely applied procedural standard in
   international politics, a range of institutions have implemented
   transparency reforms under the presumption that increased transparency
   can elicit support among relevant audiences. This article evaluates
   whether increased transparency in the UN Security Council leads to
   enhanced legitimacy perceptions among UN member-states. The article
   first traces the history of Security Council reform since 1990 and draws
   on interviews with diplomats and observers to describe a transparency
   reform the Council enacted in 2006. Next, the article uses longitudinal
   content analysis to empirically probe the legitimation effects of that
   transparency reform. The empirical analysis is based on an original
   dataset of 4,303 legitimacy statements made by UN member-states in
   annual UN General Assembly debates over the periods 1990-2006 and
   2006-18. The findings cast doubt over the potential of transparency
   reform to improve the Council's legitimacy; instead they suggest that
   increasing the direct participation of the wider UN membership may be a
   more viable legitimation strategy. This article contributes to existing
   international legitimacy literature by providing empirical evidence on
   the relationship between transparency and legitimacy, and by
   demonstrating which institutional features that affect the perceived
   legitimacy of the Security Council.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the Federal Reserve has emerged as a global lender of
   last resort. In this article, we investigate whether the prospect of
   unwanted migration has driven lawmakers' support for the Fed's increased
   international role. During an economic crisis, declines in investor
   confidence and capital flight to developed economies often cause
   economic hardship in the developing world, thus encouraging increased
   migration into advanced industrial economies. Concerned about voter
   opposition to increased immigration, immigration-averse policymakers of
   migrant-receiving states will seek ways to reduce the economic distress
   of migrant-sending states. To corroborate our argument, we analyze
   congressional voting on the ``Audit the Fed{''} bills in the US House of
   Representatives from 2012 to 2015. Using the district-level foreign-born
   population as an indicator of migration pressure, our evidence suggests
   that anti-immigrant lawmakers are more likely to support the Federal
   Reserve's international initiatives when their districts face a
   disproportionately high level of migrant pressure.},

Abstract = {The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been increasing its permeation of
   the social sphere through party-building in non-governmental
   organizations (NGOs) in recent years. In this study, we explore the
   impact of this party-building on NGOs' access to government funding
   using a party-state-society framework. From the analysis of a dataset
   drawn from the China Foundation Annual Report from 2019 to 2020, we
   found that the establishment of party branches in NGOs significantly
   increased their levels of government funding. Among NGOs that had
   already established party branches, the number of party-building
   activities was not associated with increased government funding. A
   further cross-regional comparative analysis found that party-building
   had a greater effect on NGOs' access to government funding in
   non-eastern regions of China than in the eastern region of the country.
   Our findings point to an implementation paradox of the current
   party-building campaign in China's third sector: the CCP has increased
   the presence of party branches, but it is unclear whether this
   party-building campaign has actually strengthened the Party's control
   over the sector.},

Abstract = {Why and how do policymakers initially sceptical of policy innovations
   from abroad eventually transfer them to their own countries? Focusing on
   Chile's reforms to combat business cartels in 2009 and 2016, this
   article answers that question. Policy diffusion and transfer literatures
   maintain that coercion, competition, learning or emulation could account
   for foreign inspirations in policymaking. However, these literatures
   overplay the role of coercion and emulation in policy transfer to
   countries in the global south, and have difficulty distinguishing
   between different mechanisms in empirical studies. To address these
   limitations, I suggest analysing three intermediate causal steps in
   policy transfer: first, policymakers' motivations in initiating policy
   reforms, second, their reflections on how the foreign-inspired model
   responds to the policy problem at hand, and third, their reflections on
   the fit between the foreign model and domestic conditions. Through
   process-tracing of two anti-cartel reforms in Chile, I find that
   policymakers introduced foreign-inspired policy measures to combat
   business cartels through a process of learning from other countries and
   international organisations, rather than coercion or emulation. Learning
   was evident in three ways. First, in the initiation of the reform, as
   policymakers responded to a clearly identified policy problem; second,
   in policymakers' careful reflection on how the foreign-inspired model
   responded to these problems; and third, in the adjustments made to fit
   the foreign model to domestic conditions. The analysis demonstrates the
   utility of analysing intermediate causal steps in policy transfer, and
   of paying more attention to local actors and political processes.},

Abstract = {Multilevel climate governance (MCG) makes room for multiple non-state
   actors, including subnational governments, to engage actively in
   international activities that are conceptualised as paradiplomacy. As
   climate urgency increases, subnational climate actions have expanded
   through transnational networks and have attracted ample studies,
   primarily on such practices in Europe and North America. This study, as
   a response, aims to expand knowledge of city diplomacy in less-studied
   developing countries and uses Brazil as one example. It examines climate
   policies in Brazilian cities, particularly in four cases (Belo
   Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, and Sao Paulo) to understand their
   roles in global climate governance and how their paradiplomatic
   activities through transnational municipal networks (TMNs) affect the
   municipal and national agendas. Our research demonstrates that even
   though Brazil's federative model has fallen short of adequately
   integrating cities into the national climate agenda, national and
   transnational municipal networks have been essential to building
   capacities, disseminating good practices and influencing climate policy
   at the national level. It further reflects on how to improve the
   dialogue with the federal level in the context of developing countries
   and to obtain support for climate-related urban initiatives while
   contributing to implementing international climate commitments.},

Abstract = {The report of UN Secretary General titled Our Common Agenda argues that
   growing tensions between states and accumulation of global problems is a
   wake-up call for international society. The choice now is either to
   follow the beaten track of dealing with global issues and risk a
   perpetual crisis or to undertake the effort to achieve a more solidary
   international system. One of the main protagonists of the new UN
   blueprint for securing multilateralism are cities and local and regional
   governments. The aim of the article is to examine how the EU, as a
   complex system of multilevel governance, supports sub-national actors in
   their efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and whether
   this support is sufficient. I will also concentrate on Voluntary Local
   Reviews, which are a new extra-state tools of foreign activities of
   subnational actors and try to explain why the intra-EU channel needs to
   adapt to this challenge. The results show that the EU institutions
   facilitated subnational actors in monitoring the SDGs by providing
   methodological assistance. However, local and regional governments face
   structural problems that may hinder the process of localizing SDGs.
   Therefore, they need specific capacity-building competencies. This is a
   challenge for the EU in the future.},

Abstract = {Many African governments have embraced centralised spatial planning and
   the construction of large-scale connective infrastructure as a means to
   synergise industrialisation and functional urban development. This
   article examines the tensions between these economic and urban
   development objectives in Ghana and Kenya. Infrastructure-led
   development in both cases has fuelled extended and unplanned
   urbanisation and the production of new frontiers for real estate
   investment. However, the evidence indicates that it has failed to
   contribute to processes of structural transformation. This argument
   advances debates about the tensions between supply chain and rentier
   capitalism and problematises the assumed relationship between
   infrastructure-led development and industrialisation.},

Abstract = {Divestment is a prominent strategy championed by activists to induce
   positive social change. For example, the current fossil fuel divestment
   movement includes over 1,500 institutions that control \$40 trillion in
   assets. A primary pathway through which divestment is theorized to be
   effective is by influencing public beliefs and policy preferences, thus
   pressuring policymakers to take action. However, prior research only
   tests this argument via qualitative case studies. We assess the impact
   of exposure to information about fossil fuel divestment on public
   opinion through the use of national survey experiments in three major
   greenhouse gas emitters: the U.S., India, and South Africa. We find
   surprisingly little evidence that exposure to information about the
   fossil fuel divestment movement can increase public support for policies
   that address climate change. Our findings suggest that divestment
   movements may be less effective at changing beliefs and policy
   preferences than previously realized.},

Abstract = {Green industries and companies provide crucial political support for
   ambitious environmental policy. In this article, I examine through which
   mechanisms green business interests influence international
   environmental negotiations. I theorize technology-based arguing as an
   influence mechanism that builds on combined technological and discursive
   power and can outstrip relational and structural business power rooted
   in material resources. I probe these propositions in a process-tracing
   case study of new wastewater regulations for ships in the Baltic Sea
   negotiated in the Helsinki Commission and International Maritime
   Organization. I find that green business built, expanded, and sustained
   state support for ambitious nutrient removal standards by persuasively
   arguing that advanced treatment was feasible. Provision of tangible
   evidence of technology development, availability, and uptake undermined
   the influence of reluctant and materially superior business interests. I
   conclude that even small green business actors can facilitate ambitious
   environmental policy when communication channels between innovators and
   policymakers are strong.},

Abstract = {Despite being found guilty of atrocity crimes, 54 of the 90 perpetrators
   sentenced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
   Yugoslavia (ICTY) were granted unconditional early release (UER) between
   1998 and 2018. As such, they were free to return, often to be greeted as
   heroes by welcoming crowds. Some high-profile figures rejected the
   ICTY's verdict, such as Biljana Plavsic, asserting that she had done
   ``nothing wrong.{''} This article sets out how the Tribunal thwarted an
   expressive value it had purported to achieve through trying and
   sentencing some of the most egregious crimes known to humankind when
   they granted UER. This expressive value was an authoritative
   stigmatization of the perpetrators and their crimes. This perceived
   destigmatization had, in turn, the capacity to be manipulated by
   political elites, in an ethnically divided, postconflict society, to
   challenge the historical record of the atrocities in the former
   Yugoslavia between 1991 and 2001. This article analyzes the societal
   ramifications of UER, as it examines local reactions to UER that emerged
   from 51 interviews conducted in BiH. In January 2019, this practice
   changed and conditions were attached to early release. Nevertheless, the
   negative repercussions caused by UER over 18 years provide an important
   lesson for other ICTs.},

Abstract = {The Regulatory Security State (RSS) has far-reaching political
   consequences for the world beyond the EU, for EU priorities and its
   ability to realize them. We show this point through an analysis of how
   the extension of the RSS into the digital played into a constellation of
   factors that skewed politics towards the 2018 election of Jair Bolsonaro
   in Brazil. We trace the connections from the General Data Protection
   Regulation through shifts in Facebook's self-regulation to the Brazilian
   elections with the help of three conceptual tools: `infrastructures',
   `regulatory design' and `ripples': the GDPR generated a regulatory
   redesign of infrastructures sending ripples travelling from the EU to
   Brazil, back and beyond. We contribute theoretically by developing
   concepts for contextualizing the RSS and empirically by demonstrating
   the political stakes of contextualizing the RSS. Both contributions have
   a bearing for analyzes of the RSS beyond the case we focus on.},

Abstract = {This article examines the interplay between nonviolent movements' use of
   polarizing issues for mobilization and pro-regime countermobilization.
   Thailand has been chosen as an explanatory case study because it has a
   history of political polarization and pro-regime mass mobilization. I
   focus on polarizing frames that were incorporated into the 2020
   nonviolent resistance campaigns, which addressed a taboo subject in the
   country: the monarchy. In response, the regime applied various forms of
   repression, including the mobilization of royalists. But the assumption
   that the regime single-handedly mobilized countermovements is only half
   of the story. Autonomous elements within countermovements also joined
   forces when there were sufficient social conditions. By juxtaposing
   protest event data with an analysis of mobilizing frames (through
   movements' Twitter hashtags), I shed light on a two-pronged process that
   underpins the nexus between framing choice and countermobilization: (a)
   how a movement's choice for polarizing frames sustains existing
   ideological and identity-based cleavages, antagonizing segments of
   society that perceive their collective identity to be under siege and;
   (b) how these ideological and identity-based cleavages also provide
   social sources for countermobilization. I conclude by addressing some
   implications of this framing choice-countermobilization nexus on
   repression dynamics and suggest how we can rethink the relationship
   between strategic framing and nonviolent resistance campaigns in divided
   societies.},

Abstract = {The Internet has become central to economic exchange and political
   communication, placing regulatory initiatives high on European policy
   agendas. What cleavages shape the political conflicts surrounding
   Internet policy? I argue that proposals to regulate the Internet
   frequently affect not only economic interests but also the civil
   liberties of citizens in the online environment. Political parties must
   therefore balance their stance on market regulation and their
   socio-cultural preferences on the `liberal-authoritarian' dimension of
   political contestation. To explore party competition on Internet policy
   in the European Union, I analyse all Internet policy roll-call votes in
   the European Parliament from 1999 to 2014. Ideal point estimation shows
   that political competition in this policy field is best explained by the
   `liberal-authoritarian' dimension. Reinforcing this finding, two case
   studies illustrate how civil liberty concerns motivate left-wing parties
   and the liberal party group to form voting coalitions despite diverging
   economic preferences.},

Abstract = {The paper explores the politics of scale associated with the top-down
   planning of large hydraulic infrastructures in the Tigris-Euphrates
   basin. Against the backdrop of a worsening water crisis and the lack of
   cooperation between riparian countries, dams and reservoirs across the
   transboundary river system are sites of contestation between competing
   claims over dwindling and disputed resources. Drawing on
   post-structuralist insights from human geography on the politics of
   scale and the literature on megaprojects, it is argued here that
   hydraulic infrastructures are materially and discursively implicated in
   the construction of waterscapes at different scales to sustain broader
   political imaginaries. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and with a focus
   on the autonomous Region of Kurdistan in Iraq, the analysis juxtaposes
   the narratives deployed by state- and non-state actors to support or
   counter the development of additional dams. While, on the one hand, the
   Kurdistan Regional Government portrays hydraulic infrastructures as a
   vital source of security and well-being within the overarching
   nationalist narrative of Kurdish self-determination, on the other hand,
   transnational civil society groups under the umbrella of the Save the
   Tigris and Iraqi Marshes Campaign have mobilized against the adverse
   impact of megaprojects and appealed to the common Mesopotamian heritage
   in order to de-escalate political tensions within the transboundary
   river basin. In both cases, hydraulic infrastructures provide a
   framework for political action to secure recognition of rights and
   assert the appropriate scale of governance. Furthermore, bottom-up
   resistance is accompanied by the promotion of a participatory and
   inclusive approach to shared waters. From this perspective, the spatial
   politics of megaprojects intersect with issues of identity, equity, and
   sustainability.},

Title = {Discontinuities in Greece's Middle Eastern foreign policy practice},

Abstract = {Does the Greek foreign policy fail to capitalise on extant weaknesses of
   an existential threat and if so, why? The study highlights the role of
   the `Eastern threat' as key foreign policy concern in the Greek foreign
   policy agenda. It demonstrates why the Greek Middle Eastern foreign
   policy practise, developed in a context of ambiguity, is marked by
   discontinuities to maintain consistent policies and patterns of
   relationships compared with its (Middle Eastern discourse). The result
   of these persistent discontinuities for almost five decades is an ad hoc
   Greek foreign policy practise. The paper addresses this puzzle by
   triangulating novel data from recent interviews with Greek foreign
   policy officials with public announcements and speeches as well as with
   secondary sources and official documents. It reveals that key causes
   include the neglect of other types of ``actorness{''}, and the
   structures (epitomised in the ideational kind here) as these are
   portrayed through the role of the leadership in the failure to develop a
   holistic foreign policy approach. Collaboration between states and
   non-state actors is a well-established strategy in Middle Eastern
   international relations. The consideration of both structures and
   actors, in void of the prioritisation of states over non-state actors,
   in the examination of the foreign policy practice reflects the
   theoretical value of this case study. The work is perceived through the
   lens of the IR and informs theories of foreign policy-making as well as
   the recent scholarship on new regionalism focused on the role played by
   non-state agents.},

Abstract = {Digital technologies are transforming security governance, bringing new
   risks and opportunities. The resulting uncertainty creates
   interpretative contests about what these new challenges are and who can
   - and should - address them. We argue that private actors use their
   ideational business power - and specifically solutionist arguments - to
   influence how public actors perceive digital security problems; whether
   they view private actors as necessary and/or effective in solving them;
   and whether they view public and private goals as compatible. In doing
   so, they influence how public actors navigate competence-control
   trade-offs. We substantiate this argument in two qualitative case
   studies on the involvement of Palantir in EU law enforcement and on the
   prominent role of (foreign) tech companies in the European cloud project
   Gaia-X. Drawing on and contributing to the literatures on (critical)
   security governance, competence-control theory, and ideational business
   power, we shed light on the ideational underpinnings of Europe's
   regulatory security state.},

   exports to conflict zones},
Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},

Abstract = {This article examines why US-made and US-supplied weapons consistently
   appear in conflicts around the world, despite the United States having
   what is commonly lauded as the `gold standard' of national arms export
   control systems. On paper, US law and policy discourage arms transfers
   to areas engaged in or at risk of conflict. US arms export controls also
   informed the creation of the UN Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which provides
   legally binding conventional arms export criteria. Yet in the recent
   Yemen, Syria and Libya conflicts, among many others, the United States
   has directly supplied or indirectly facilitated the supply of weapons to
   conflict parties. This article highlights two factors that help to
   account for this apparent policy failure: the flexible design of US law
   and policy and the inherent challenges of ensuring that weapons in
   conflict zones-especially small arms-go to and stay with their intended
   recipients. These findings have important implications for US foreign
   policy, ATT implementation and the human costs of conflict around the
   world.},

Title = {Participatory governance in megaprojects: the Lyon-Turin high-speed
   railway among structure, agency, and democratic participation},

Abstract = {Megaprojects are increasingly common across countries and attract
   substantial political attention from a variety of actors. Recent studies
   have highlighted the need to move from an understanding of megaprojects
   as linear and rational processes towards a more nuanced approach that
   accounts for non-linear and conflictual aspects. Participatory
   governance is often proposed as a valuable resource in this regard. In
   this paper, we investigate the setting and design of two participatory
   venues operating in the context of the implementation of the Lyon-Turin
   high-speed railway megaproject: the Italian Observatory for the
   Turin-Lyon Railway and the French Public Inquiry. Empirical evidence
   shows that the Italian case featured substantial structural barriers to
   effective democratic participation. As for the French case, while better
   designed and implanted in its context, it featured important agentic
   limitations that undermined its democratic potential. On the basis of
   our case study, we therefore argue that both the Observatory for the
   Turin-Lyon Railway and Public Inquiry failed to promote democratic
   participation. We thus propose a deliberative approach to (the study of)
   of megaprojects. Whereas deliberative democratic ideas command growing
   interest across disciplines, these have found only limited application
   in the study of megaprojects. We contend that a deliberative democratic
   approach holds promise to improve the democratic and epistemic qualities
   of decision making on megaprojects.},

Abstract = {Since Reform and Opening Up, the Chinese government has been under
   pressure regarding policy on the residence of foreign migrants to the
   country. In response, the Chinese government released a document
   entitled the Regulations of the PRC on the Administration of Permanent
   Residence of Foreigners in February 2020, which has roused fierce social
   opposition, as reflected in Chinese netizens' attitudes towards foreign
   immigrants and citizenship identity. Based on online discussions in the
   Zhihu community, in this paper, we investigated the exclusive and
   inclusive boundaries of Chinese netizens' citizenship identity through
   quantitative and thematic textual analyses. The exclusive boundary
   includes racial and historical discourses that raise insurmountable
   walls between Chinese people and foreign immigrants, while the inclusive
   boundary is reflected in citizenship rights and access criteria. The
   issues of `super-national treatment' (privileges enjoyed by foreign
   nationals with permanent Chinese residency) and `low access criteria'
   (the relative ease with which foreign immigrants can obtain permanent
   residence in China) for foreign immigrants have weakened the openness of
   the inclusive boundary, causing netizens who were once willing to accept
   foreign immigrants to oppose the presence of non-native groups in the
   country. This study deepens our understanding of Chinese netizens'
   citizenship identity and contributes to citizenship identity theory.},

Abstract = {The free movement of goods is widely believed to be a prime example of
   the negative integration paradigm. Its defining characteristic is a
   strong judicial process, fuelled by - and fuelling - litigation, which
   eclipses the weak(er) political process. The article argues that this
   dominant narrative is no longer accurate. Based on a new dataset of all
   Article 34 TFEU cases decided by the CJEU between 1961 and 2020, it
   shows that goods litigation has been disappearing from the Court's
   docket since the mid-1980s. The reasons for this, it is argued, lie in
   changing incentive structures for both litigants and national courts,
   which have reduced the appeal of bringing goods cases, as well as a rise
   in EU legislation. The consequence is a demise of negative and a turn
   towards positive integration.},

Abstract = {In this article, we investigate what kind of institutions affect bank
   ownership transformations in a post-transition economy. We use
   statistical data concerning mergers and acquisitions in the Polish
   banking sector over the thirty years since the political transformation.
   Our results indicate the significant role of political and cultural
   institutional dimensions in stimulating ownership transformation. The
   importance and current deficits in explaining Polish banking ownership
   transformations are evaluated through institutional analysis,
   emphasising the path dependence role and the critical junctures that
   influence the development of institutions. Identifying which
   institutions matter the most is crucial for post-reform economies when
   selecting the most effective policies.Classification codes G21, G32, G34},

Abstract = {Islamist groups, based on their philosophical and associational
   genealogy, are considered to be Salafist in outlook and hostile to or,
   at best, ignorant of traditionalist Muslim teachings and customs. In
   contrast to this common understanding of Islamists, support for the
   Prosperous Justice Party in Indonesia's traditionalist Muslim
   constituencies has grown. This article investigates the conditions that
   favour the broad alignment between Islamist and traditionalist Muslims,
   focusing on the Islamist party's approaches toward traditionalist Muslim
   constituencies based on an examination of the party's internal documents
   and interviews with key individuals. Particularly in regions where
   traditionalist Muslim associations predominate yet have weak ties to
   political parties, the newly emerging Islamist party has a bigger chance
   to rise. Moreover, in successful cases, Islamist activists have
   individually built grassroots networks and expanded the voices of
   traditionalist Muslims. By showing the changes in the social anchoring
   of Islamists in Indonesia, this article reverses the dichotomy between
   Islamists and traditionalists and asserts the Islamists' indigenization.},

Abstract = {In contemporary international politics, states face numerous challenges
   to their sovereignty, especially in the realm of human rights. We argue
   that rather than simply fight back when sovereignty is challenged,
   states sometimes instrumentalize sovereignty challenges in pursuit of
   their own domestic and international political agendas. We identify two
   key ways that governments frame sovereignty challenges to use in these
   pursuits, what we call negotiation and legitimation strategies, and
   outline the conditions under which states may choose to employ these
   strategies. In order to evaluate our argument, we present a case study
   of Colombia's interactions with the International Criminal Court over
   the course of the ICC's seventeen-year preliminary examination. Drawing
   on evidence gathered from ICC records and media archives from the
   Colombian executive, we show first that the ICC continually challenged
   Colombian sovereignty by threatening to intervene, especially during the
   peace negotiations with the FARC. Rather than fight back against the
   sovereignty challenge or instrumentalize the Court to punish enemies, we
   also show that three successive Colombian administrations used this
   challenge to frame debates around contentious domestic human rights
   policies.},

Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},

Volume = {81},
Number = {3},
Pages = {324-355},
Abstract = {Against the backdrop of a new debate about a possible free trade
   agreement replacing Norway's EEA membership, this article studies the
   impact of the EEA agreement on Norway's services trade. Using the
   structural gravity model, it first analyses the impact of EEA on total
   services trade. Norway's total services exports is estimated to be about
   35 percent higher within EEA than with a hypothetical free trade
   agreement. The article next focuses on financial services and
   communications services. Compared to the hypothetical free trade
   agreement the EEA agreement has raised trade by about 50 percent in both
   sectors. Furthermore, providing the essential infrastructure for trade,
   the internal market for telecommunications and finance has boosted trade
   in all services sectors. Brexit does not change these estimates much.},

Abstract = {Alongside efforts to improve evidence use in policy, grassroots demands
   and governance-driven democratisation are informing an ever-increasing
   range of public engagement processes in UK policy. This article explores
   how these simultaneous efforts intersect within three policy
   organisations working at different levels of UK policy: local (Sheffield
   City Council), regional (Greater Manchester Combined Authority) and
   national (devolved) (Scottish Government). Employing documentary
   analysis and 51 interviews with individuals working in these
   organisations, we argue that there are organisational similarities in
   approaches to evidence and engagement, including: conceiving of both
   `data' (statistics tracked by internal analysts) and `evidence'
   (external analysis) in primarily quantified terms; and a tendency to
   limit the authority of publics to advising and consulting on predefined
   issues. Yet, we also find growing interest in more in-depth
   understandings of publics (for example, via `lived experiences') but
   uncertainty about how to use these qualitative insights in settings that
   have institutionalised quantitative approaches to evidence. We identify
   four distinct responses: (1) prioritising public engagement; (2)
   strategically using public engagement and evidence to support policy
   proposals; (3) prioritising quantified evidence and data; and (4)
   attempting to integrate these distinct knowledge types. Surprisingly
   (given the organisational importance afforded to metrics), we
   categorised most interviewees in Cluster 4. Finally, we explore how
   interviewees described trying to do this kind of integration work,
   before reflecting on the promise and limitations of the various
   mechanisms that interviewees identified.},

Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},

Volume = {66},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This article seeks to highlight the key role of the blue economy in
   fostering regional integration of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)
   based on the 2030 Agenda. By proposing a ``beyond the boxes{''}
   approach, SDG 14 is not the only driver that stands out. Hence, we
   propose a regionalism beyond the state-centric and land borders, which
   will require reflecting on and rethinking theories, policies, and
   practices related to the foundations of regional integration, IR, and
   the 2030 Agenda itself. The methodology combines UN reports and data
   from ECLAC, WRI, FAO, UNEP-WCMC, UNESCO-MAB, WWF, UN-DESA, and NOAA.},

Abstract = {This paper delves into the nuanced motivations underpinning Russia's
   2014 invasion of Ukraine, centered on preserving stability for Putin's

   concerns, the invasion emerged as a pivotal strategy to bolster domestic
   support and reinforce Russian leadership. Post-2012, Putin, in
   consolidating power through internal policies and external
   assertiveness, responded to catalysts - opposition protests in 2012 and
   Ukraine's ``Revolution of Dignity{''} in 2014. State-controlled media
   played a crucial role in shaping narratives, framing the invasion as a
   defense against alleged Western ``imperialist{''} threats. The paper
   scrutinises Putin's strategic evolution, highlighting the convergence of
   historical events, opposition dynamics, and media narratives in shaping
   the rationale behind Russia's impactful incursion into Ukraine.},

   Ambitious},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},

Abstract = {The article discusses Norway's climate policy in light of the country's
   non-membership status in the European Union (EU). Despite claims that
   Norway, staying outside the EU, may have greater autonomy in shaping
   climate policy, the study shows that this does not necessarily lead to
   more ambitious climate targets. Since 2009, Norway has chosen to align
   itself with the EU, cooperate on climate issues and update its targets
   in line with European ones. Through a comparison with Sweden, an EU
   member, the article examines how EU membership has not limited Sweden's
   ability to pursue an ambitious climate policy nationally and
   internationally. The article also reveals the challenges Norway faces as
   a result of its outsider status, particularly in the energy sector,
   where dependence on hydropower and the oil and gas industry causes
   problems for climate policy. Despite Norway's international initiatives
   in climate finance and forest conservation, the article argues that EU
   membership would not necessarily limit Norway's role as a global climate
   leader. Finally, the study points to the challenges of remaining outside
   the EU and emphasizes the need for a thorough assessment of the
   potential benefits and limitations of such a position.},

Abstract = {PurposeDespite the prevalence of uncivil behaviors across families and
   past studies attributing work stressors to suicidal ideation (SI), there
   is no conclusive evidence of the interactive effect of family incivility
   (FI) aggravating SI. Hence, the purpose of this study is to explore the
   association between FI and SI through emotional exhaustion (EE) in the
   workplace and regulation of emotion.Design/methodology/approachA time
   lag (T1 and T2) study is applied for primary data collection using a
   survey questionnaire. The partial least squares-structural equational
   modeling algorithm tests reliability, validity and
   hypotheses.FindingsExperiencing FI exacerbates SI, while the regulation
   of emotion and EE mediate the association between FI and SI.Practical
   implicationsProfessionals are advised to adopt regulation of emotion
   that fosters desirable behavior and shields targets from FI and EE,
   minimizing the intensity of SI.Originality/valueThis study significantly
   adds to how FI and EE aggravate SI and contribute to the body of
   knowledge on the regulation of emotion in stress and coping mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Most academic definitions of terrorism emphasize the communicative
   function of terrorism. The aim of terrorist violence is widely held to
   be to gain publication for a political or religious cause. Despite this
   emphasis on communication, terrorists rarely seek attention by claiming
   responsibility for attacks. According to the Global Terrorism Database,
   claims of responsibility are only issued for approximately every sixth
   attack. This raises the question: Why do terrorists abstain from the
   easy ``win{''} of claiming their attacks? Previous research has
   theorized that factors like state sponsorship, principal-agent problems,
   casualty levels, and inter-group competition are important factors in
   explaining variation in terrorist credit-taking propensities. In this
   paper, we diverge from the tried and trusted deductive approach and
   instead utilize an inductive approach. We apply machine learning
   techniques using Random Forests to predict claims of responsibility. Our
   initial results indicate that geographical factors, like country of
   attack, are the strongest predictors of claims-something largely
   overlooked by existing research. In our analysis, the predictive power
   of geographical factors thus exceeds that of explanations from the
   literature based on characteristics of the target of the attack, e.g.
   number of fatalities and wounded.},

Title = {Management of crisis or crisis of management? The Thai government's
   ``policy as discourse{''} handling of the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The complexity of crisis management in the context of COVID-19, which
   ranges from the global to the national, reveals a wide variety of means
   and ends, particularly at the national level. This triggered scholarly
   interest and raised questions regarding how central (authoritarian)
   governments handle the COVID-19 pandemic within state borders. The paper
   evaluates the Thai government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic from
   the beginning of 2020 to the middle of 2022, when the pandemic was
   declared over. We employ critical discourse analysis to explain
   Thailand's crisis management by engaging discursively with different
   population groups in the country. The findings indicate that the
   discursive policies and measures implemented by the government to
   deviate from and halt public pressure resulting from his mismanagement
   of vaccine policy are based on narratives related to national traditions
   as a means of resolving dilemmas rather than on the social needs of
   vulnerable individual citizens. We witnessed how discursive policies and
   measures can lead to other problems and ineffective responses,
   specifically regarding vaccine distribution. The article contributes to
   a better understanding of how, why, and to what extent discursive
   policies and measures were instrumentalized by an authoritarian
   government for COVID-19 crisis management, which can likely be inferred
   in similar cases in developing nations.},

Abstract = {This article empirically studies the Catalan Digital Republic, that is
   the set of practises, narratives, institutions, and infrastructures
   mobilised by a stateless nation to reposition itself in the
   international arena. The article has a two-sided objective. First, to
   analyse how nation branding and nation building strategies intersect
   with digital technologies and technopolitical narratives. Second, to
   examine how stateless nations are making use of such technologies and
   strategies in order to find their way in the international arena. To
   satisfy these objectives we have empirically studied the case of
   Catalonia, a stateless nation which in the last years has developed an
   ambitious technopolitical strategy rebranding itself as the southern
   European technological hub. To do so we have relied on a triangular
   methodological strategy combining (1) critical discourse analysis; (2)
   in-depth interviews with high-profile actors coming from the political,
   academic, and civil society landscape, and (3) a thorough documentary
   analysis. The first part of the article explores the concept of digital
   nation and its relationship with the notion of nation branding. In the
   second part of the text, we present the methodology and the objectives.
   We continue the paper by outlining the results of the interviewing
   process and the critical analysis of the findings. The article concludes
   with a critical recapitulation of the research results.},

Abstract = {Sexual violence is a prevalent feature of war with severe physical,
   psychological, and social consequences for survivors. Yet we have a
   limited understanding of how survivors relate to their political
   environment after the conflict ends. We analyze individual-level survey
   data on postwar Sri Lanka to assess whether wartime sexual victimization
   relates to political activism. Connecting unobtrusive measures from a
   list experiment to individual survivors' political action, we show that
   personal experience of sexual violence increases political
   participation. This effect is substantial in size, holds for
   institutionalized and non-institutionalized forms of political action,
   and is robust to unobserved confounding or sample selection bias. Causal
   mediation analyses suggest that survivors of wartime sexual violence
   mobilize politically through their involvement in civic networks. The
   findings stress the relevance of survivors' agency and contribute to a
   better understanding of wartime sexual violence, the role of civil
   society in post-conflict politics, and of humanitarian policy.},

Abstract = {The rise of populist parties is a defining feature of political change
   in the advanced capitalist countries. Whereas a large body of research
   explores populist parties in domestic politics, we know little about how
   populist parties of right and left have responded to the transformation
   of the transnational Eurozone regime. In this paper, we show how the
   diverse exposure to the costs and benefits of EMU can explain their
   EU-level economic policy positions and thereby create opportunities for
   populist alliances across the left-right divide. In the debtor countries
   of Southern Europe, populist parties of both right and left have
   resisted demands for neoliberal reform during the Euro crisis while
   supporting fiscal risk-sharing arrangements during the COVID-19
   pandemic, making populist left-right coalitions possible. In the
   creditor countries of Northern Europe, by contrast, populist right and
   left parties have been fundamentally divided throughout. Based on case
   study analyses of Germany and Italy, the most prominent creditor and
   debtor countries, our findings suggest that populist parties may only
   find common ground when `Brussels' interferes in domestic policy-making
   autonomy by imposing neoliberal reform.},

Abstract = {How citizens in authoritarian regimes evaluate the practice of democracy
   in both new and established democracies has important implications on
   the prospect of democratisation in their own country. As an
   authoritarian country with the largest population around the world,
   China has resisted waves of democratisation and maintains the one-party
   rule. This study examined the Chinese case and explored how Chinese
   citizens evaluated democracy in the United States, India and Taiwan. It
   theorised that the tendency towards ingroup favouritism and attitudes
   towards democracy are the factors that primarily influence citizens'
   evaluations of democracy in other countries. The results show that
   Chinese citizens perceive the democratic level of China as being as high
   as that of the United States and Taiwan, whereas they gave lower
   evaluations in the case of India's democracy. The effects of the
   aforementioned factors varied between the three countries. After
   presenting the findings, the theoretical implications are also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {While the disproportionate power of corporate and state fossil fuel
   interests to influence energy and climate policy is now well known,
   questions remain about the groups that enthusiastically consume such
   narratives, with far-reaching political consequences. Fossil fuel
   workers are one such group. Their positions within these debates are
   highly relevant to policy outcomes, yet their political positions are
   often assumed to oppose decarbonizing the economy to the detriment of
   otherwise well-intended interventions. We offer a more nuanced
   understanding of the sentiments of fossil fuel workers invoked through
   their public and political engagements. We use the Twitter profiles of
   160 self-identified oil and gas workers to explore the nature of oil
   workers' masculinity and its implication in climate obstruction and
   far-right politics. We advocate for engaging workers in the energy
   transition through meaningful collaboration with workers to build trust
   and investment in a shared future narrative.},

Abstract = {`Sustainable Development' can be understood as a widely used discourse
   that has become even more prominent since the publication of the UN
   Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development in 2015. In this paper we
   analyze the way sustainable development discourse unfolds within the
   context of development aid in Germany by undertaking a discourse
   analysis of reports on development policy published 1973-2017 by the
   German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. Our
   analysis reveals that the sustainable development discourse is
   characterized by distinct components and storylines that change over
   time. We detect, in general, a shift away from a focus on environmental
   protection toward an emphasis on the role of the private sector in
   leading sustainable development. We argue, therefore, that although
   development is now only legitimate if it is `sustainable', the discourse
   apparently facilitates the uneven allocation of development aid. The
   concern that arises here is that although Agenda 2030 pledges to take
   ``bold and transformative steps' to secure the planet and to leave `no
   one behind{''} the least developed states who cannot provide `private
   sector opportunities' or fulfil `national self-responsibilities' for
   sustainable development are indeed being `left behind'.},

Abstract = {Multilateralism is regarded as a constitutive feature of the
   contemporary liberal international order and is associated with liberal
   values. However, for twenty-five years, authoritarian states have
   advocated the expansion of multilateral governance modalities for
   cybersecurity issues while major consolidated democracies have often
   opposed them. We explain this puzzle by distinguishing an overlooked
   variant of authoritarian multilateralism from the better-understood
   liberal variant. A Russo-Chinese coalition has employed various
   strategies within and beyond the United Nations to facilitate the
   adoption of this authoritarian variant for key cyber-governance
   processes, to achieve both specific cybersecurity goals and broader aims
   in contesting the liberal international order. Liberal democracies
   oppose instantiating authoritarian multilateralism, but they have also
   altered their understanding of multilateralism to encompass more space
   for private and multistakeholder governance alongside it, leading to a
   double transformation of the practice of multilateralism. The article
   concludes by discussing the implications of our analysis for
   multilateralism.},

Abstract = {We evaluate the conditions and consequences of union strategies in three
   industrial transitions in California, all driven by its globally
   influential climate policies: in construction (solar power plants),
   electricity (nuclear power retirement), and manufacturing (electric
   vehicles). Building on recent, global frameworks in environmental labor
   studies, we grow the field's attention towards unions with workers
   transitioning between `sunset' industries like fossil energy and
   `sunrise' sectors like clean energy. Using original ethnographic and
   archival data, we analyze the conditions that shaped union strategies in
   transitions, and how these in turn impacted union power and coalitions.
   We argue that union strategies embraced climate transitions when they
   organized leverage to define a shift on their members' terms,
   independently from employers, often by turning environmental regulation
   to the advantage of labor and its allies.},

Abstract = {Analysing the peace processes of Nepal and Myanmar, this article argues
   that the changing landscape of peacebuilding support to
   conflict-affected states(CAS) marked by multiple international actors is
   increasing the bargaining leverage of elites in CAS to shape
   post-conflict institutions in their favour. It highlights that multiple
   and competing forms of international engagement allow elites in CAS not
   only to `co-opt' international support as widely discussed in peace
   studies but also undertake multiple strategies categorised cumulatively
   as `hedging'- to harness distinct benefits from varied international
   actors, exploit the differences between multiple international
   institutional prescripts, and offset dependency on one by aligning with
   another. These strategies enhance the agency of elites to resist Western
   pressures to adapt liberal reforms and instead shape post-conflict
   institutional outcomes in their favour. Such resistance fosters
   `illiberal' institutions where elites renege on critical pledges of the
   peace process on inclusion and security sector reform to protect their
   interests.},

Abstract = {Decentralization reform has both advantages and risks. Bringing service
   delivery ``closer to the people{''} can improve information flows and
   strengthen accountability, but it may also leave systems vulnerable to
   elite capture and corruption by municipal government officials. While
   past research has acknowledged the possibility of corruption under
   decentralization, relatively little work has connected those risks to
   features of these reforms or specific local institutional arrangements.
   To explore the conditions that can help mitigate the risks of corruption
   under decentralization, we study the case of health sector reform in
   Honduras where municipal governments, associations, and NGOs each serve
   as intermediary-managing organizations under a common decentralized
   health service delivery model. We argue that three types of
   institutional arrangements reflecting local accountability practices
   serve as checks on the authority granted through decentralization and
   can help guard against corruption: external supervision, civil society
   engagement, and public participation. Empirically, we draw on data from
   more than 600 street-level bureaucrats, valuable but under-utilized
   informants about municipal corruption, across a matched sample of 65
   municipalities with contrasting forms of administration. We find that
   reported corruption is highest under decentralization led by municipal
   governments, as compared to association- or NGO-led varieties. Both
   external supervision and civil society engagement help attenuate the
   positive association between decentralization and corruption, but public
   participation does not. Overall, this research highlights the importance
   of considering reform features and local conditions when designing
   policies to help manage risks and support effective social sector
   decentralization.},

Title = {Does increasing auditors' independence lead to more forceful public
   auditing? A study of a Canadian internal audit reform},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {102},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1045-1068},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The value of auditing as an instrument of accountability depends upon
   the independence of auditors. However, the extent to which auditors feel
   free to review the operation, compliance, and performance of public
   programs and objectively communicate findings to stakeholders has rarely
   been assessed. A Canadian public service reform in 2006 introduced
   institutional safeguards to bolster the independence of departmental
   internal auditors, but left legislative auditors working for the Auditor
   General's Office (i.e., Canada's Supreme Audit Institution) unaffected.
   We analyze and compare 2677 audit reports written by internal and
   legislative auditors before and after the reform. After the reform, the
   language used by internal auditors became more assertive and evaluative,
   but not more critical. This suggests that the safeguards had a
   meaningful impact on how auditors perform their accountability function
   but that factors other than independence may be driving their
   willingness to be more adversarial and critical when communicating audit
   findings.
   La valeur des verificateurs comme agents d'imputabilite depend de leur
   independance. Toutefois, la mesure dans laquelle les verificateurs se
   sentent libres d'examiner le bon fonctionnement, la conformite et la
   performance des programmes publics et de communiquer objectivement le
   resultat de leur travail a rarement ete evaluee. Une reforme de la
   fonction publique canadienne en 2006 a introduit des mesures de
   protection institutionnelles pour renforcer l'independance des
   verificateurs internes, mais n'a pas affectee les verificateurs
   legislatifs travaillant pour le Bureau du verificateur general (c.-a-d.
   l'Institution supreme de verification du Canada). Nous analysons et
   comparons 2677 rapports de verification rediges par des verificateurs
   internes et legislatifs avant et apres la reforme. Apres la reforme, le
   langage utilise par les verificateurs internes est devenu plus assure et
   evaluatif, mais pas plus critique. Ces resultats donnent a penser que
   les mesures institutionnelles assurant l'independance des verificateurs
   peuvent avoir une incidence significative sur la facon dont ils
   s'acquittent de leur fonction, mais que l'independance n'est pas le seul
   facteur influant sur leur volonte d'etre plus negatifs et critiques
   lorsqu'ils communiquent leur avis sur les programmes verifies.},

Abstract = {This article looks at some of the major implications for theory and
   policy that follow from the Berggruen Governance Index (BGI). After
   discussing the BGI's quality as an indicator in more general terms, the
   article explores two types of implications. The first are conceptual
   implications that relate to an improved understanding of governance,
   democracy and economic development. They illustrate the highly
   contingent patterns that emerge from the Governance Triangle-the basis
   of the BGI's conceptual framework-for high-, middle- and low-income
   countries as well as political regimes, and caution against any notions
   of simple causalities in how countries develop. Second, we address
   policy implications in terms of managing the tensions inherent in the
   Governance Triangle in view of longer-term sustainability and resilience
   based on insights that can be gained with the help of the BGI.},

Abstract = {At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the large democracies of
   Western Europe experienced some of the most prosperous and peaceful
   decades in human history. Specifically, the United Kingdom, France,
   Italy and Germany experienced high and stable quality of life,
   democratic accountability and state capacity between 2000 and 2019,
   according to the 2022 Berggruen Governance Index. While all four of
   these countries are among the top performers in the Index, substantial
   problems lurk beneath the surface. Notably, each failed to capitalise on
   the low interest rate environment in the decade following the global
   financial crisis of 2007-2009-albeit in different ways and for different
   reasons in each country. In particular, low investment in infrastructure
   and key technologies, the persistence of stubborn regional inequalities,
   and resulting sluggish GDP growth have prevented the `Big Four' in
   Western Europe from improving further and future-proofing their existing
   gains.},

Abstract = {References to the Terminator films are central to Western imaginaries of
   Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS). The puzzle of whether
   references to the Terminator franchise have featured in the United
   States' international regulatory discourse on these technologies
   nevertheless remains underexplored. Bringing the growing study of AI
   narratives into a greater dialogue with the International Relations
   literature on popular culture and world politics, this article unpacks
   the repository of different stories told about intelligent machines in
   the first two Terminator films. Through an interpretivist analysis of
   this material, we examine whether these AI narratives have featured in
   the US written contributions to the international regulatory debates on
   LAWS at the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in
   the period between 2014 and 2022. Our analysis highlights how hopeful
   stories about what we coin `machine guardians' have been mirrored in
   these statements: LAWS development has been presented as a means of
   protecting humans from physical harm, enacting the commands of human
   decision makers and using force with superhuman levels of accuracy. This
   suggests that, contrary to existing interpretations, the various stories
   told about intelligent machines in the Terminator franchise can be
   mobilised to both support and oppose the possible regulation of these
   technologies.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to introduce the concept of
   workplace camaraderie and to investigate the mechanism through which
   workplace camaraderie influences incivility at the workplace. The study
   is explained by taking the sequential mediation of personal biases
   leading to cronyism and favoritism. Social identity theory is used as
   the underpinning theory to explain the framework
   adopted.Design/methodology/approachPositivism research philosophy
   followed by the deductive approach is followed to meet the objectives of
   the current study. In total, 171 employees working in public sector
   organizations were taken as the respondents to the study. A purposive
   sampling technique was used to collect the data through
   self-administrated questionnaires. Path model is used through Mplus to
   generate the results and test hypotheses.FindingsThe results suggested
   that workplace camaraderie significantly affects incivility at a
   workplace with the sequential mediation of personal biases leading to
   cronyism and favoritism.Originality/valueAlthough several researchers
   have studied the link between camaraderie and other employees' related
   attitudinal and behavioral outcomes, few have explored the roles of
   personal biases, cronyism and favoritism in the relationship to
   incivility. This study thus posits a novel sequential mediation
   mechanism, based on the social identity theory, through which
   camaraderie is translated into civil behavior. Moreover, this study adds
   value by investigating this model in the public sector, where
   camaraderie can come up with important consequences.},

Abstract = {This article examines the Philippines' policy of critical neutrality in
   the face of the Ukraine-Russia War. This policy is characterized by the
   refusal to take any side in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia,
   occasional criticism of Russia's handling of the war, and efforts to
   offer the U.S. military facilities in the Philippines if the war spreads
   and spills over to the East Asia. In conclusion, the article argues that
   the Philippines is taking advantage of the best of two worlds, namely
   (a) taking the moral high ground in criticizing Russia's war against
   Ukraine and (b) enhancing its alliance with the U.S. as a hedge to the
   possibility that China might take a page from Russia's playbook in
   Ukraine by pursuing its irredentist goals in the Taiwan Straits and the
   South China Sea.},

Title = {Oiling the War Machine? The Fuel Dilemma and Warfighting Capability},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},

Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {Oil is a double-edged sword in modern warfare for its usage enables
   greater firepower and mobility in combats while imposing tremendous
   operational and strategic burden to run and defend Wartime Fuel Network.
   The tension between the two generates a fuel dilemma, a consequential
   trade-off between fuel-powered capability and fuel sustainability.
   States facing the dilemma address it with three fuel management
   practices: minimalism, control, and gamble. I describe promises and
   pitfalls of each measure with three illustrative case studies-the
   Japanese ``gamble{''} during WWII, Chinese ``control{''} in the Korean
   War, and Vietnamese ``minimalism{''} during the Vietnam War. The theory
   and evidence have important implications for future research on military
   logistics, warfighting capability, and the study of conventional
   warfare.
   El petroleo representa un arma de doble filo dentro de la guerra
   moderna, ya que, por un lado, su uso permite un mayor potencial
   destructivo y una mayor movilidad en los combates, al tiempo que, por
   otro lado, supone una tremenda carga, tanto a nivel operativo como
   estrategico, a la hora de dirigir y defender la red de combustible en
   tiempos de guerra. La tension entre estos dos extremos genera un dilema
   con respecto a los combustibles: la necesidad de un equilibrio
   consecuente entre las capacidades del combustible y la sostenibilidad
   del combustible. Los Estados que se enfrentan a este dilema lo abordan
   mediante tres practicas de gestion del combustible: el minimalismo, el
   control y la apuesta. Describimos las oportunidades y las amenazas que
   supone cada medida a traves de tres estudios de caso ilustrativos: la <<
   apuesta >> japonesa durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el << control >>
   chino durante la Guerra de Corea y el << minimalismo >> vietnamita
   durante la Guerra de Vietnam. Tanto la teoria como las pruebas derivadas
   de este articulo tienen implicaciones importantes para futuras
   investigaciones en materia de logistica militar, capacidad de combate y
   estudio de la guerra convencional.
   Le petrole est une arme a double tranchant dans les guerres modernes,
   car son utilisation augmente la puissance de feu et la mobilite dans les
   combats, mais elle impose aussi un fardeau operationnel et strategique
   considerable quand il s'agit de faire fonctionner et defendre le reseau
   de carburant en temps de guerre. La tension entre les deux genere un
   dilemme relatif aux carburants, un compromis important entre la capacite
   alimentee par des carburants et leur durabilite. Les etats confrontes a
   ce dilemme y repondent par le biais de trois pratiques de gestion des
   carburants : le minimalisme, le controle et le pari. Je decris les
   promesses et ecueils de chaque mesure a l'aide de trois etudes de cas
   d'illustration : le << pari >> japonais pendant la Seconde Guerre
   mondiale, le << controle >> chinois pendant la guerre de Coree et le <<
   minimalisme >> vietnamien pendant la guerre du Vietnam. La theorie et
   les elements probants s'accompagnent d'importantes implications pour les
   recherches futures sur la logistique militaire, la capacite militaire et
   l'etude des guerres conventionnelles.},

Title = {Policy issue salience and legislative output of populist governments:
   evidence from immigration policies},

Abstract = {Research on political representation suggests that legislative activity
   is influenced by governing parties' policy emphases in their election
   campaigns. We argue that populist governments are an exception as they
   may find it difficult to draft and implement laws on an issue even if it
   is salient to them. The anti-elitism, people-centrism, and
   Manichean-discourse nature of populist party platforms significantly
   alters their ability to legislate on their campaign issues. We test this
   claim using data on the saliency of governments' immigration policies in
   their election campaigns and subsequent legislation on immigration. The
   empirical analysis is based on 14 democratic states from 1998 to 2013.
   The results support the theory that populist governments will exhibit a
   relatively weak relationship between their issue emphases in election
   campaigns and the number of policies they enact on immigration. This
   research has important implications for our understanding of populism,
   political representation, and immigration policy.},

Abstract = {After violence ends, former conflict parties and their civilian
   supporters often disagree about the origins and causes of the conflict.
   Post-conflict states vary in how they deal with these competing accounts
   of the past, ranging from selective remembering to state-backed
   forgetting. However, conflict narratives that are excluded from the
   public sphere are not necessarily forgotten and may be passed on between
   generations within families, social networks, and communities. These
   unofficial and often biased accounts can threaten the stability of
   post-conflict societies when appropriated by political actors who seek
   to challenge hegemonic memory practices and/or the legitimacy of the
   state-a process that we define as memory mobilization. In this paper, we
   argue that memory mobilization is particularly likely to occur when (1)
   unofficial conflict narratives persist among certain groups and sections
   of society, and are transferred from one generation to the next; and (2)
   regime opponents and/or other political actors have sufficient political
   and public space for contestation. To evaluate our argument, we examine
   these issues in the context of post-conflict Cote d'Ivoire. Based on 905
   secondary school student essays, we show that competing accounts are
   reproduced among young Ivoirians and that these could potentially
   threaten the country's future stability, if misappropriated.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the relationship between recent repression of
   protest and the duration of future protests. A rich scholarship examines
   how repression impacts dissent, highlighting dissent dimensions such as
   the number of future events and violent escalation. Less examined is
   another dimension of dissent - protest duration. We hypothesize that
   recent repression of protests is pivotal for longer duration of future
   protest events. Our expectation stems from a participant type mechanism.
   Recent repression of protest may generate more societal grievances but
   also increase protesting risks. A simultaneous jump in grievances and
   risks may increase the number of people protesting who are also
   risk-acceptant and willing to protest for longer durations. The Armed
   Conflict Location \& Event Data Project data and hierarchal negative
   binomial models are used to estimate the association between recent
   repression of protest and subsequent protest duration. Compared to
   having none of the most recent three protests repressed, a protest in a
   location where the last three protests were repressed has a
   substantively longer duration. The results are consistent with the
   participant type mechanism and existing literature on repression's
   heterogeneous effects on individuals.},

Abstract = {Is democracy a realistic political ideal? This article historically
   recovers and normatively assesses Machiavelli's intuition that
   democratic institutions are realistically desirable in virtue of their
   resilience. The article takes inspiration from Machiavelli's work in two
   ways. Methodologically, it argues that there is a distinctive realist
   normativity based on political virtues, that is, those skills that are
   instrumentally required to thrive in politics. Substantively, it probes
   Machiavelli's idea that the most important political virtue, for both
   individuals and institutions, is resilience: the ability to continuously
   adapt to new circumstances. Machiavelli observes that democratic regimes
   are very resilient because, while individuals cannot change their
   character to adapt to new circumstances, democracies can just change the
   individual in charge. The article then refines Machiavelli's intuition
   by building on the contemporary distinction between stability and
   resilience. It claims that authoritarian regimes are more stable, and
   yet less resilient. Democracies are instead characterised by a
   continuous flux of political outputs, which makes them seemingly
   wavering, and yet better equipped to experiment with unconventional
   adaptations. The two different literatures thus complement each other.
   The debate on resilience usefully clarifies and systematises
   Machiavelli's intuition. Conversely, Machiavelli's work reveals the
   salience of resilience in politics, and shows why it counts as a realist
   political value.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of the article is to provide further evidence for the
   work environment hypothesis. According to the work environment
   hypothesis and as documented by empirical evidence, organizational
   factors play a crucial role in the development of workplace bullying.
   However, to better understand and prevent bullying at work and establish
   sustainable, responsible and ethical workplaces, it is crucial to
   understand which organizational factors are particularly important in
   the development of bullying and how these factors, independently and
   combined, act as precursors to bullying over time. One prominent theory
   that explains how organizational and individual factors interact is the
   affective events theory (AET). Design/methodology/approachIn a two-wave,
   time-lagged study (N = 364), the authors apply AET to test and explain
   the interplay of organizational factors in the development of bullying
   at work. FindingsThe results revealed that supportive and fair
   leadership moderates the relationship between role stress and exposure
   to workplace bullying. Practical implicationsKnowledge of the buffering
   role of supportive and fair leadership practices is important when
   implementing organizational interventions aimed at preventing bullying
   at work. Originality/valueAlthough previous studies have shown the
   general protecting effects of supportive leadership on exposure to
   bullying, the current study indicates that high level of supportive and
   fair leadership practices decreases the level of exposure to bullying,
   even when role ambiguity and role conflict are relatively high.},

Abstract = {How can autocrats boost public support for wars? Previous studies have
   suggested that in democracies, the public changes its war attitude
   either through rational cost-benefit calculations or simply by following
   cues from political elites. This article argues that autocrats can
   follow a similar logic to manipulate public support for war via
   nationalist propaganda. Based on two online survey experiments with
   textual and musical propaganda materials in mainland China, this article
   finds that nationalist propaganda bolsters public support for war,
   regarding a potential military conflict across the Taiwan Strait.
   Evidence shows that propaganda increases respondents' expected return on
   winning wars, arousing national pride, and reducing respondents'
   sensitivity to war costs. However, people's confidence in winning a
   given war remains unchanged. These findings suggest that nationalist
   propaganda can boost support for war by increasing the perceived
   benefits of the war and reducing their sensitivity toward war costs
   without changing their perceived probability of winning. It also
   demonstrates that nationalist propaganda does not need to be explicit
   about war in order to boost war support in autocracies. This study also
   reveals the changing dynamic of public opinions in China regarding war
   for unification over the Taiwan Strait, which has significant
   implications for security and geopolitics in East Asia.},

Abstract = {The current research explores refugee integration through the analysis
   of active constructions of everyday life in Greek cities. It draws from
   critical social and political psychology literature that explores
   spatial aspects of intergroup relations and developments in citizenship
   and migration studies. For the purposes of the study, 25 walking
   interviews with refugees from Afghanistan, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Ivory
   Coast, Pakistan, Palestine, Somalia, and Syria were conducted in the
   cities of Athens and Thessaloniki. Interviews were analyzed with tools
   and concepts of critical discursive social psychology. Analysis
   indicated three main repertoires related to corresponding space nuclei:
   ``city squares and surrounding areas as minorities' spatial nuclei,{''}
   ``political spaces as urban enclaves of belonging,{''} and
   ``neighborhoods as un/familiar places.{''} Each of these broader
   compounds represented different people-place dynamics and presupposed
   different citizenship constructions and claims. These constructions
   entailed different ways of positioning oneself and others and
   constituted the ground for redefining integration based on local
   experiences and multilevel connections with urban networks. Drawing on
   these findings, the article proposes to reconsider integration through
   the concept of urban citizenship to explore everyday politics of
   intergroup relations in contexts of migration.},

Abstract = {Within diasporas and conflict studies, little research has so far looked
   at the content and dynamics of online conflict transportation.
   Addressing this gap, this study investigates how the Turkish-Kurdish
   conflict is reflected in the online mobilisation of Kurdish and Turkish
   diasporas in Denmark. Through an online ethnography of associations on
   Facebook, the study finds that while conflict transportation occurs in
   online spaces, it is shaped and influenced by the country of residence,
   transnational networks and other diasporic communities and actors. This
   suggests a plurality of consciousness rather than the duality of
   `homeland'-'host-country' attachments often attributed to diasporas.},

Abstract = {The literature on congressional decision-making has largely ignored the
   influence of the minority party in the legislative process. This follows
   from the widely held belief that the majority party dominates the
   agenda-setting process. Though the minority party rarely achieves major
   policy success in Congress, we argue that the minority has significantly
   more influence over the legislative agenda than is commonly believed. We
   posit that, under some conditions, the minority has enough bargaining
   leverage to get floor votes on their proposals, in the form of both
   amendments and bills. We test our theoretical expectations with a novel
   design utilizing whip count data from the House and show that when a
   whip count on a bill occurs, the likelihood of a minority amendment
   disappointment and a majority amendment roll increases, respectively.
   This suggests that the more leverage the minority party has, the more we
   see their legislative proposals on the floor.},

Journal = {PHILIPPINE POLITICAL SCIENCE JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {180-203},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The article explored intergroup perspectives among Bangsamoro and
   Christian group members to determine their impact on forgiveness-based
   peace initiatives and conflict resolution. It adopts a qualitative
   approach by analyzing thematically four (4) focus group discussions.
   Bangsamoro participants' themes on Intergroup Forgiveness as a Process
   of Negotiation and Pride as Key Factor in the Process of Intergroup
   Forgiveness stress socio-religious and political leaders' roles
   including that of cultural values such as maratabat (honor) and sabar
   (silent forbearance). Christian participants' Intergroup Forgiveness as
   an Outcome through Discussion/Communication theme emphasizes
   understanding and pride's impact on the forgiveness process. These
   findings bring to awareness the complexity of integrating intergroup
   forgiveness in current peacebuilding interventions.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the Mapping Attitudes, Perceptions and Support
   (MAPS) dataset, which provides rich survey data from more than 12,000
   respondents in Colombia. Our panel survey - carried out in two separate
   waves in 2019 and 2021 - is representative at the level of each `Program
   for Development with a Territorial Focus' (PDET, for its acronym in
   Spanish), the most war-affected regions and those targeted for peace
   agreement implementation. We describe the sample and compare support for
   the peace agreement in MAPS to other recent surveys in Colombia, showing
   how MAPS reveals regional variation obscured in nationally
   representative surveys. Regression analyses illustrate how the panel
   data allow us to explore how and why people's perceptions of the
   agreement shift over time. The MAPS data will enable scholars to gain
   insights into the microfoundations of peacebuilding over time and across
   space.},

Abstract = {Latin America faces a twin crisis. The spread of COVID-19 has become a
   health catastrophe and sent regional economies into recession, while
   governments' increasing reliance on extractive development as a health
   and economic ``cure{''} has compounded existing socio-environmental
   conflicts across the continent. An emergent ``extractive savior{''}
   discourse aligns with political economic interests that have
   instrumentalized the pandemic to propel a new strain of disaster
   capitalism-disaster extractivism. Any socio-environmentally just
   response to COVID-19 must eschew the extractivist logic that underlies
   the pandemic and mainstream responses to it. America Latina enfrenta una
   doble crisis. La propagacion de COVID-19 se ha convertido en una
   catastrofe sanitaria y ha llevado a las economias regionales a la
   recesion, mientras que la creciente dependencia de los gobiernos del
   desarrollo extractivo como una ``cura{''} sanitaria y economica ha
   agravado los conflictos socioambientales existentes en todo el
   continente. Un discurso emergente de ``salvacion extractiva{''} se
   alinea con los intereses economicos politicos que han instrumentalizado
   la pandemia para impulsar una nueva cepa del capitalismo desastroso: el
   extractivismo desastroso. Cualquier respuesta socioambientalmente justa
   al COVID-19 debe evitar la logica extractivista que subyace a la
   pandemia y las respuestas generales a esta.},

Abstract = {Through a behavioral approach, citizen evaluations of government
   performance have been an area of study in public administration.
   Research has explored how different factors influence citizens'
   perceptions of public organizations, such as public sector bias and
   reference points. Understudied in this literature is how citizens
   evaluate government based on their use of financial management
   strategies. The Pandemic and other economic challenges have forced
   governments to engage in cutback management strategies to balance the
   budget. How do citizens evaluate governments based on their cutback
   strategies? To answer this theoretical question, we employ a survey
   experiment design with over 1600 respondents from the U.S. to explore
   how four cutback management strategies can influence citizen evaluations
   of government. Our findings suggest that cutback management strategies
   do influence citizens' evaluation of government in trust, satisfaction,
   performance, and fairness. Citizens are more favorable to infrastructure
   or materials and contractor cuts than increasing taxes or reducing
   personnel. Further analysis by respondent partisanship indicates
   Democrats are more accepting of tax increases. Republicans rate
   governments lower when they cut capital and infrastructure and rate
   governments higher when they decrease personnel expenditures.},

Abstract = {What IR scholars refer to as ``the international{''} gets constructed
   and performed to specific ends, depending on time and place. This
   results in a plurality of claims to the international, subject to
   historical variation. To bring such variation into view, this article
   shows how nineteenth-century claims to internationality were tied to
   particular conceptions of legitimacy. The article explores this
   legitimation-by-experts through a case study of the 1855-56 Suez Canal
   Commission. Based on original archival research, the article shows that
   expert advice played an important role in claiming the internationality
   of the Suez Canal by limiting contestation to technical aspects. The
   central argument is that expertise and claims to the international can
   get co-constituted in arrangements that are intended to produce
   legitimacy. These arrangements narrow the terms of contestation in
   self-serving ways. A technocratic claim to the international was tightly
   linked to the mobilization and making of the Suez Canal experts, on two
   fronts. One, expertise and internationality were repeatedly articulated
   in conjunction, so they would signify each other. Two, the article shows
   that expert involvement was driven by legitimation concerns more than by
   epistemic optimization purposes. In sum, the article proposes a new way
   of historicizing internationality claims and sheds light on the
   distinctiveness of international expertise.},

   Neoliberal Resilience},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {The resilience of neoliberal ideology despite its repeated failings is a
   problem that continues to generate significant scholarly controversy. To
   theorize the enduring appeal of neoliberalism, this article uses Jacques
   Lacan's psychoanalytic concept of fantasy. For Lacan, a fantasy is a
   narrative that structures our experience of reality, organizing our
   pursuit of desire. I argue historical neoliberal thinkers constructed a
   fantasy narrative in which the ``free market{''} functions as the
   crucial object of desire. The fantasy determines a priori that all
   historical and material progress is a result of the free market, and
   that any failings can be blamed on its binary opposite, the
   transgressive state. Hence, the fantasy prepares in advance for its own
   failures, as each fresh crisis can be constructed as a failure of the
   state, and as evidence of the need to intensify the pursuit of the free
   market. To illustrate the role of fantasy in preserving and reanimating
   neoliberalism, I examine neoliberal fantasy logic at the G20 leader's
   summits organized in response to the Global Financial Crisis. Across the
   G20 meetings, the dominant narrative of the crisis was reconstructed to
   fit the neoliberal fantasy, ultimately absolving the free market and
   instead focusing blame on the state.},

Abstract = {Estonian nationalism has undergone a transformation from `state-seeking'
   to `state-led' since acquiring independence, which has affected the
   Estonian national identity. Estonia is commonly labelled as an `ethnic
   democracy'; however, we propose a dichotomy between open and closed
   ethnic democracies. The process of national state-building in Estonia is
   still going on, with the concept of `Estonianness' consisting of the
   `Finno-Ugric,' `Nordic/Scandinavian,' and `European' identity
   structures. These form the basis for an inclusive, or open ethnic
   democracy. Though Estonianness is primarily defined in cultural and
   linguistic terms, a newcomer may ascribe oneself to it and become a
   member of the ethno-civic nation.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {62},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {318-335},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Rebel judicial systems are often portrayed as an attempt to usurp the
   legitimacy of the state in their ability to make and enforce the rules
   under which civilians live. Yet, not all groups that seek to violently
   challenge state rule are effective at these legitimacy-seeking aims.
   This paper examines variation in the structure of rebel courts in order
   to better understand the potential for these courts to develop
   legitimacy and challenge the state through procedural fairness,
   deliberation, and effectiveness. The measurement of these three
   components of legitimacy is examined through the cases of the
   CPN-Maoists in Nepal and the PIRA in Northern Ireland. Through the study
   of the legitimating potential of rebel courts, we are better able to
   understand the process of legitimation through rebel governance and the
   concept of legitimacy more broadly.},

Abstract = {Transitions away from fossil fuels need to be governed, financed,
   regulated and coordinated, patterns of production and innovation need to
   be steered and shaped by rulemaking bodies at all levels of authority.
   For this to happen across a highly uneven international system, global
   institutions have a vital role to play in supporting and implementing
   just transitions (JTs) that align with principles addressing the
   procedural, distributional, intergenerational and recognition-based
   aspects of justice and which help to address the temporal and spatial
   aspects of transitions. In this paper, we review the ways in which
   global institutions are involved in the governance of JTs. We illustrate
   the roles these institutions are playing through three key areas vital
   to JTs: the (i) governance of finance (ii) labour protection and (iii)
   mobilising alternatives. To make sense of the diverse and uneven nature
   of these engagements and their implications, we explore in turn four key
   gaps in the way global institutions are approaching the issue of JTs.},

Abstract = {Due to the growing threat of global warming, low carbon governance has
   become a worldwide challenge. However, there is great variation in low
   carbon performance across countries, which can seriously affect the
   achievement of global low carbon governance targets. To address this
   issue, this study analyzes the distinctions in climate stances and low
   carbon governance systems among Germany, the United States, and China.
   Then, a comparative analysis of these countries is presented, paying
   attention to their climate stances, their vertical governmental
   structure, and the interaction of government, market, and society. We
   find that it is no single factor but rather the combination of critical
   distinctions in climate stances and governance systems that creates the
   heterogeneity of national climate actions and performances. Finally, we
   put forward suggestions on how to further promote global climate
   governance.},

Abstract = {To address the long-lasting consequences of the atomic bombings in
   Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in 1994, the Japanese government implemented the
   current in-force Atomic Bomb Survivors Support Law. This substantial
   policy offers medical, health and welfare measures and even incorporates
   some reparations-like aspects. Nevertheless, atomic bomb survivors'
   organisations have severely criticised the government for failing to
   adequately address the entirety and inhumanity of the atomic bomb damage
   by refusing to enact the law on a clearly stated principle of `state
   compensation'. As such, we attempt to clarify empirically what aspects
   of survivors' suffering are most closely associated with their demands
   for `state compensation'. Based on statistical model-based analysis,
   survivors who deem that `state compensation' should be enacted
   experience frequent flashbacks of the bombings, disadvantaged life
   opportunities and economic concerns, among others. We conclude the study
   by considering the difficulty in addressing the consequences of nuclear
   weapons use and testing through programmes that approximate, but fail to
   establish, clear reparations-based measures, such as the current Atomic
   Bomb Survivors Support Law.},

Title = {Populist Democrats? Unpacking the Relationship Between Populist and
   Democratic Attitudes at the Citizen Level},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {72},

Abstract = {It is widely feared that the onset of populism poses a threat to
   democracy, as citizens' support for democracy is essential for its
   legitimacy and stability. Yet, the relationship between populism and
   democratic support at the citizen level remains poorly understood,
   particularly with respect to support for liberal democracy. Data
   measuring citizens' populist attitudes in conjunction with a
   comprehensive range of measures of democratic support have been lacking.
   Using unique data from the Netherlands, we study the relationship
   between individuals' populist attitudes and their attitudes towards
   democracy in three studies. We examine the association between populism
   and support for democracy and satisfaction with democracy (Study 1),
   populism and support for liberal democracy (Study 2), and populism and
   support for majoritarian conceptions of democracy (Study 3). We find
   that while citizens with stronger populist attitudes are dissatisfied
   with how democracy works, they are no less supportive of the principle
   of democracy. Contrary to most theorizing, we find that citizens with
   higher populist attitudes not less supportive of key institutions of
   liberal democracy, but reject mediated representation through political
   parties. At the same time, individuals with stronger populist attitudes
   are highly supportive of forms of unconstrained majoritarian rule. These
   findings suggest that the relationship between populism and support for
   (liberal) democracy is more complicated than commonly assumed.},

Abstract = {Research suggests that creating communities of learning (academic and
   social) leads to a better Higher Education (HE) experience for students,
   which, in turn, makes it more likely that they will persist in their
   studies. The concept of `student community' in HE has become more
   prominent of late, partly due to the UK Government's emphasis on
   retention. One way in which student community can be engendered is by
   working with `students as partners' in their learning: students work
   with academics and each other to create and extend their learning,
   which, in turn, has a positive impact on student community and
   retention. This article discusses the opportunities and challenges of
   working with `students as partners' within a Politics HE disciplinary
   context. In particular, it summarises an Open University Politics
   student engagement project, part of the University's partnership with UK
   Parliament. In doing so, the article has implications for Politics HE
   practice generally, and online Politics HE practice in particular, and
   makes recommendations for working with Politics `students as partners'
   within the current UK HE policy environment.},

Title = {Exploring the role of policy actors in the implementation of social

Abstract = {PurposeAt the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the absence of
   pharmaceutical agents meant that policy institutions had to intervene by
   providing nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). To satisfy this need,
   the World Health Organization (WHO) issued policy guidelines, such as
   NPIs, and the government of Pakistan released its own policy document
   that included social distancing (SD) as a containment measure. This
   study explores the policy actors and their role in implementing SD as an
   NPI in the context of the COVID-19
   pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThe study adopted the constructs of
   Normalization Process Theory (NPT) to explore the implementation of SD
   as a complex and novel healthcare intervention under a qualitative study
   design. Data were collected through document analysis and interviews,
   and analysed under framework analysis protocols.FindingsThe intervention
   actors (IAs), including healthcare providers, district management
   agents, and staff from other departments, were active in implementation
   in the local context. It was observed that healthcare providers
   integrated SD into their professional lives through a higher level of
   collective action and reflexive monitoring. However, the results suggest
   that more coherence and cognitive participation are required for
   integration.Originality/valueThis novel research offers original and
   exclusive scenario narratives that satisfy the recent calls of the
   neo-implementation paradigm, and provides suggestions for managing the
   implementation impediments during the pandemic. The paper fills the
   implementation literature gap by exploring the normalisation process and
   designing a contextual framework for developing countries to implement
   guidelines for pandemics and healthcare crises.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe paper examines the `Intention to Receive the COVID-19
   Vaccines' or IRV from three perspectives: the health belief model,
   behavioural economics, and institutional
   quality.Design/methodology/approachThis study provides quantitative
   analysis by applying Chi-squared test of contingencies, paired sample
   t-tests, exploratory factor analysis, and multiple linear regression
   (stepwise method) on the data collected from 591 respondents mainly from
   Malaysia.FindingsThe results show that Perceived Benefits, Perceived
   Barriers, Perceived Susceptibility, Herding, and Institutional Quality
   play roles as predictors of IRV. Perceived Benefits play the most
   crucial role among the predictors and Perceived Barriers is the least
   important predictor. People have the herding mentality after being
   exposed to information encouraging such behaviour.Originality/valueThis
   study reveals that the respondents changed their behaviour in different
   circumstances when exposed to information that incorporates the effect
   of herding. Herding mentality, the effectiveness of government
   authorities, and regulatory quality have become important factors in
   enriching public health policies and the effectiveness of interventions.},

Abstract = {Drawing on ethnographic research among peace workers and their local
   partners, this article traces the politics of civil society
   peacebuilding for Kashmir at a time when both state violence in Kashmir
   and local and transnational resistance and activism for Kashmiris' right
   to political self-determination have intensified. It uses `civility' as
   an analytical lens focusing on the ambivalence of claims about taking a
   restrained and `non-political' stance in the violent conflicts over
   territorial sovereignty in Kashmir. While `non-political' peacebuilding
   brings people together across social and political divides and makes it
   possible to imagine alternatives for Kashmir's future beyond territorial
   sovereignty, it is also deeply entrenched in conflictual processes of
   exclusion. The claims to civility draw moral and political boundaries
   that incite violence and radical disagreement among people and groups -
   as civil society and political activists or militants.},

Abstract = {Does migration pose a threat to welfare state legitimacy? We address
   this prominent question with a multilevel analysis of novel survey data,
   the `Inequality Barometer', which includes individual and local-level
   context data in Germany (6208 individuals, up to 401 local districts).
   Our results suggest that the public is more reluctant to support welfare
   where the proportion of migrants at the local level is larger. This
   effect even persists when welfare is directed at groups that are
   perceived as more deserving of welfare support (like children, sick or
   older individuals) and when we examine the levels of employed migrants
   (that pay into the welfare state). We also find that these effects are
   moderated by economic risk. Particularly, we find that individuals
   facing higher economic risk support welfare less than their counterparts
   when exposed to migration. Future research should expand the local-level
   approach and investigate the causal mechanisms that the
   welfare-migration nexus is based on in more detail.},

Abstract = {Notice and consent approaches, being the most prevalent legal
   frameworks, have in recent years come under fire. I suggest they fail
   because they rest on a historical approach to privacy justice, whereby
   the justice of a particular state of affairs is a function of whether
   each transaction on the way was just. Instead, I make use of a
   background justice framing. Even where consent is present it is
   inadequate to secure the values at stake. When we only assess the
   fairness or freedom of individual information transactions, we fail to
   see the way many can undercut the very values we seek to secure by
   requiring consent for disclosures in the first place. I propose a
   patterned principle to regulate the distribution of individual control
   over privacy, and to set the background against which individual notice
   and consent can still play a role, albeit a limited one.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how events of political violence in the distant
   past affect the outbreak of terrorism in the present. Civil wars leave a
   legacy of distrust that can persist through generations, paving the way
   to violent responses to perceived threats. We claim that part of the
   explanation for the counterintuitive terrorism phenomenon in a
   prosperous and relatively egalitarian region such as the Basque Country
   (and, potentially, other cases of terrorism) lies in the legacies of
   political violence in the distant past. Those communities where support
   for Carlism, one of the warring factions in nineteenth-century civil
   wars, was strong, were more likely to support terrorism a century later.
   The article also shows that the transmission of these legacies was
   robust in communities that have remained largely isolated in the century
   that separates the civil war from the terrorism of the 1970s.},

Abstract = {Previous research has highlighted the prominent behavior of lone wolf
   terrorists to produce and share a manifesto publicly, outlining their
   frustrations and motivations for their eventual terrorist attack. This
   article aims to explore this phenomenon, focusing on the timelapse
   between when a terrorist manifesto is posted online and when the
   eventual attack occurs, discussing the time difference between the two
   events for 12 cases of lone wolf terrorism. The results revealed that
   the average time lapse between when a manifesto was posted online and
   when the terrorist attack occurs is one hour, 43 min. Limitations and
   implications are discussed in detail.},

Title = {The role of governance models in the development of transport

   Reseau express metropolitain},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {This article focuses on mobility issues in Montreal, whose metropolitan
   transportation policies are presented as one of the major ambitions of
   large North American metropolitan areas. Empirically, we are interested
   in a recent transportation megaproject: the Reseau express metropolitain
   (REM) in Montreal, an electric light-rail transit network spanning 67
   kilometers in the Greater Metropolitan Area. These types of megaprojects
   involve significant governance challenges and certain criticisms due to
   the involvement of several actors from different backgrounds and
   defending different interests, which places. This is why we believe that
   it is important to address this issue from the point of view of
   metropolitan governance through the agenda-setting of urban
   megaprojects. The originality of this article is that it demonstrates
   how presenting the REM project as a public-public partnership, between
   the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec (CDPQ) and the Government of
   Quebec, opened the door to favoritism for the Caisse which influenced
   the choice of a political solution in Greater Montreal. By mobilizing
   Kingdon's model, we conclude that windows of opportunity cannot open
   without choosing a governance model during the agenda-setting phase.},

Abstract = {Since the fall of Islamic State's so-called caliphate in March 2019, the
   United States and other international actors have repeatedly urged
   states to repatriate their citizens. Analyses of this issue too often
   focus on citizens of Western countries despite the fact that they
   constitute only a small fraction of the group's members and affiliates.
   Focusing on Middle East and North African (MENA) countries, we contend
   that citizenship law and family law play a central role in determining
   an individual's prospects for repatriation by forming the basis of a
   state's articulation of who belongs to the nation and who the state is
   responsible for. We identify important sub-regional patterns that shape
   the repatriation of Islamic State affiliates through the differential
   treatment of women in MENA citizenship and nationality law and family
   law. In addition, we find that the distinction between custodian and
   guardian in MENA family law provides a useful basis for the related
   challenge of reintegrating female-headed family units as well as
   orphaned children.},

Abstract = {Through examination of elite-level discourse between 2014 and 2015, this
   paper argues that the exaggeration of Iranian involvement with the
   Houthis served to justify the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.
   Ironically, this had the effect of benefiting Iran, as Riyadh moved
   their attention away from Iranian priorities in Syria, undermined their
   own international credibility and spent billions of dollars on this
   unwinnable conflict. Iran, Saudi Arabia (KSA) and some Western actors
   pushed the narrative that the Houthis were deeply connected with the
   Islamic Republic. While Iranian support was negligible during this
   period, Iran sought to increase Saudi insecurity through rhetorical
   support for the Houthis. Riyadh, keen to protect their interests in
   Yemen, over-exaggerated this connection to justify their airstrikes and
   blockades, which began with Operation Decisive Storm (ODS) on March 25,
   2015. Certain Western actors, sharing similar regional geopolitical
   priorities, adopted this narrative. This validated their support for the
   Saudi-led intervention. This, in turn, has had devastating consequences
   for the people of Yemen. With these dynamics in mind, the paper asks
   three research questions: Was the Saudi-led over-exaggeration of Iranian
   involvement successful in securitising ODS to international audiences?
   Was `Iranian involvement' over-exaggerated? Who ultimately benefited
   from this narrative?},

Abstract = {The postbellum rise of voluntary, federated associations set the stage
   for modern pressure politics in the American states, yet the connection
   between associations and lobbying in this era is grossly understudied.
   Relying on associations' own records and a new dataset of state
   lobbyists, we explore this relationship more deeply, documenting how
   federated associations gained membership, created political agendas, and
   lobbied state legislators for reform. To understand better the processes
   linking group strength with direct lobbying, we present descriptive case
   studies of the Grange (agriculture), the ``Big Four{''} railroad
   brotherhoods (skilled labor), and the American Bankers' Association
   (finance). Our findings reveal how group strength, measured by
   association membership or local organizing, was not always related to
   the choice to lobby legislatures directly. These findings suggest
   pathways for future research comparing Progressive Era associations to
   one another, as well as showing how their actions parallel those of
   modern pressure groups. This analysis also paves the way for a more
   robust temporal understanding of lobbying in the American states.},

Abstract = {The war in Ukraine in 2022 resulted in the rapid, large-scale migration
   of Ukrainians both inside Ukraine and to the European Union (EU). In
   response, the European Commission and Council activated the `Temporary
   Protection Directive' (TPD, 2001) which had been dormant for two
   decades. This granted Ukrainians fleeing to the EU residence permits,
   access to the labor market, accommodation, medical care, education for
   minors, and social and welfare assistance. We analyzed how war-fleeing
   Ukrainians were received in the EU at three territorial-administrative
   levels. Through discourse analysis at the supranational (EC and CE),
   national (Estonian) and subnational (local Estonian) levels and a survey
   on how 500 temporary protected Ukrainians in Estonia were covered by the
   TPD, we highlight the hierarchic implementation of the TPD. This case
   shows the potential and pitfalls of participatory multilevel governance
   (MLG) for a more sustainable presence and future for the Ukrainian
   (temporary) diaspora in the EU.},

Title = {Civilizationism and the Ideological Contestation of the Liberal
   International Order},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Discourses and practices reproducing a world where a plurality of
   distinct civilizations clash or dialogue, rise or fall, color multiple
   facets of global politics today. How should we interpret this unexpected
   surge in civilizational politics, especially notable in the United
   States, Europe, the Middle East, China, and Russia? This paper argues
   that the growing turn to civilizations or, better, civilizationism
   should be understood as a counter-hegemonic ideological reaction to the
   globalization of the liberal international order. It theorizes the
   deepening and widening of the liberal international order in the
   aftermath of the Cold War as enabled by powerful constitutive
   ideological forces, which congeal into a distinctively modern, informal,
   universal standard of civilization. This liberal civilizational standard
   can be experienced by a particular category of non (fully) liberal
   actors within and beyond the West as ideologically entrapping
   them-through processes of socialization or stigmatization-in a state of
   symbolic disempowerment. The paper shows how civilizationism provides an
   ideological path for resisting and contesting the liberal standard of
   civilization by articulating a distinct and valued (essentialized) sense
   of collective belonging, and an alternative (generally illiberal)
   normative system and (broadly multipolar) vision of international order.
   Along with theorizing and exploring in original ways the drivers of
   civilizational politics in the current historical juncture, the paper
   makes two further contributions. It highlights and unpacks the key role
   of ideological dynamics in the making and contestation of international
   orders in general and the liberal one in particular. It suggests and
   shows why civilizations are best approached as ideological constructs
   rather than cultures, identities, or discourses.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic influence on mortality and
   public health and generated much speculation on potential impacts on
   international politics. Fast-moving crises such as the COVID pandemic
   and 2008 financial crises entail many challenges for scholarship; events
   evolve rapidly, our prior knowledge base is limited, it is unclear
   whether existing theories or analogies apply, and new research findings
   emerge quickly but also erratically. Researchers face demands to engage
   with policy and general audiences when normal standards of scholarship
   may be difficult to apply. Crises can also have a dramatic impact on how
   we conduct research and interact with other scholars. The forum
   introduction outlines how crises pose challenges for scholarship and
   policy and the value of approaching crises such as COVID-19 in
   comparative perspective. Milner highlights the important differences
   between the immediately observable short-term impact of crises and the
   more difficult to evaluate long-run impacts. Kneuer examines how crises
   can impact political change, detailing how COVID countermeasures can
   serve as a pretext for autocratization and the safeguards afforded by
   institutions. Solingen examines the impact of serial crises on global
   value chains and the difficulties in tracing impacts when crises are
   compounded. De Alba-Ulloa documents how scholars in the Global South and
   North face similar challenges during the COVID pandemic, but differences
   in resources to mitigate can exacerbate inequalities. Davies highlights
   the difficulties in studying public opinion during COVID and need for
   behavioral data to understand global health emergencies. Ghosn examines
   dilemmas in interacting with severely affected communities during crises
   and offers advice on better practices.},

Abstract = {Remote Warfare is a product of the bellicose twenty-first century in
   which we live. Promises of a century, that would shun violence, revere
   international law, and outshine the darkness of the Cold War, have long
   since fallen by the wayside. Instead, the tragic events of 9/11, 2001,
   led the USA and its allies down the path to war and to the unforeseen
   consequences that transpired. As Sir Michael Howard argued back in 2006,
   `President Bush's declaration of a ``War Against Terror{''} was a war
   for which the United States claimed a hunter's licence to use force
   anywhere in the world and the right to dispense with all the restraints
   of international law that they had done so much to create' (Howard,
   2006). This special issue analyses the legacies and emerging
   international implications of this `hunter's licence' and the remote
   military technologies/remote practices of Western warfare that were
   pioneered to fulfil it.},

Abstract = {Using the context of the 26 Swiss subnational governments, this paper
   aims to empirically identify factors driving-or not-the use of
   accounting and reporting standards aimed to increase financial
   faithfulness. Because the 26 entities had a certain autonomy, as they
   jointly implemented two major successive accounting reforms over the
   past forty years, policy outcomes were heterogeneous. Findings suggest
   that both citizen demand and government supply-side factors contribute
   to explaining the extent to which each entity's policy led to a faithful
   reporting. This paper thus highlights some of the challenges in
   implementing supranational (e.g., IPSAS, EPSAS) or national accounting
   standards at lower tiers, when governments have some leeway over the
   process, while yet facing strong democratic scrutiny.},

   strategy, e-municipality practices are being expanded in local
   governments. One of the critical developments in the field of public
   administration in Turkey recently is e-government applications and
   e-municipality, which is its reflection on local governments. E
   -municipality applications are used as a local government strategy to
   quickly meet the citizens' municipal needs and reduce service costs. In
   this study, e-municipality services of metropolitan municipalities in
   Turkey; It is intended to be analyzed in terms of accessibility,
   performance, Searches Engine Optimization, and Best Practice indicators.
   The research findings show that the e-municipal services of metropolitan
   municipalities in Turkey should be improved significantly, given the

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to reveal the mechanism of peer
   abusive supervision on bystander behavior based on the perspective of
   bystander from two different paths of bystander empathy and bystander
   hostility toward supervisor. At the same time, it discusses the
   moderation effect of bystander traditionality on the two paths.
   Design/methodology/approachThis study conducted a three-wave
   longitudinal survey. The data were collected from 454 employees and
   their coworkers in several Chinese enterprises. The authors used Mplus
   7.4 and adopted a bootstrapping technique in the data analysis.
   FindingsPeer abusive supervision leads bystanders to empathize with the
   abused colleague and thus exhibit more organizational citizenship
   behaviors, and peer abusive supervision also induces bystanders to
   develop hostility toward the abusive supervisor and thus produce more
   workplace negative gossip behaviors. In addition, it is found that
   bystander traditionality has a moderation effect in the process by which
   peer perceptions of abusive supervision influence bystander empathy and
   bystander hostility. Originality/valueBased on Affective Events Theory,
   this study explores the mechanism of colleague perception of abusive
   supervision on bystander behavior from a bystander perspective. The
   results of this study not only provide a more comprehensive expansion of
   the weighting factors in the influence mechanism of abusive supervision
   but also provide new ideas for organizations to reduce the negative
   effects of workplace abusive behaviors.},

Title = {Praxis makes perfect: rebel governance, repression, and democratization},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 21},
Abstract = {Rebel governance remains a curious phenomenon. Some have argued that
   certain manifestations of this curious behavior may even facilitate
   postwar democratization. Using Weibull models and a variety of measures
   of democracy and interpretations thereof, this paper tests three
   potential relationships between rebel governance and the timing of
   democratic transition. The first rests on the role that consultation can
   play in raising expectations among civilians of the same after the war's
   end. The second posits that policing and juridical functions allow rebel
   rulers to more easily repress dissent, making democratization more
   remote. The third is a replication of Huang's thesis which posits that
   rebels' need of civilian material inputs gives civilians leverage in
   making claims of their rebel rulers. The analysis finds that
   consultation accelerates postwar democratization and civil mobilization
   accelerates partial democratization, but while policing and juridical
   functions appear to slow these transitions, the models are uncertain
   regarding this relationship.},

Abstract = {This briefing revisits the dynamics of post-civil-war agitation for a
   separate state arising from Nigerian state repression in Africa's
   largest democracy. It analyses uncertainties among many Nigerians in the
   south-east of the country and focuses on the recent experience of the
   Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a group agitating for a republic of
   Biafra. It argues for a more democratic order that legitimises equality
   and social justice as organising principles of democracy.},

   behaviour in the Russian republics},

Abstract = {According to many studies, ethnic republics demonstrate a higher level
   of electoral loyalty compared to the national average. Recently,
   however, in some ethnic republics a decrease in electoral support for
   the Russian president among the titular ethnic groups was recorded. At
   the same time, this trend was not found in other republics. In this
   article I propose a theoretical explanation for this variation. My main
   thesis is that the decrease in the electoral support of the incumbents
   occurs only when the regional electorate addresses the responsibility
   for unpopular reforms to two levels of power simultaneously: national
   and sub-national.},

Abstract = {This article provides a Weberian ideal-type framework to capture elite
   strategies for managing hard Euroscepticism and their consequences for
   EU disintegration. It does so by drawing on policy evolution theory to
   conceptualise two ideal types representing contrasting strategies:
   taming Euroscepticism by technocratic adaptation or embracing it. This
   framework is used to analyse empirical examples that match these two
   ideal-type approaches respectively: France and the UK between 2004 and
   17. The use of this framework is a novel way of explaining the evolution
   and differences between elite French and UK responses to hard
   Euroscepticism by showing how and why French EU policy remained
   intra-paradigmatic as compared to the paradigm shift of Brexit. This
   approach allows for a better understanding of the process and
   probability of EU disintegration by linking the latter to strategic
   policy choices. In a UK context, it also offers a way to anticipate the
   signals leading to a reversal of disintegration.},

Abstract = {In order to promote the development of the Third World in the context of
   the Cold War, the United Nations promoted the creation of technical
   assistance programmes. The International Labour Organization (ILO) is
   distinguished by its desire to link economic development and social
   progress. While Western experts are sent to Asia, South America and
   Africa to promote economic growth, young professionals from the
   countries visited receive scholarships to study in Europe. This article
   aims to reconstruct the movements of Africans who received ILO
   scholarships in the 1950s and 1960s and were sent to France to explore
   the functioning of the welfare state. Technical assistance, while
   increasing the mobility of young Africans towards Europe and
   participating in the regionalisation of African social security
   policies, reinforced France's dominant position in its former empire.},

Title = {The politics of patrolling `safety guards' in Sweden: outsourcing,
   depoliticization, and immunization},

Abstract = {The contracting of private guards to patrol public spaces has rapidly
   become a widespread approach to increase public safety and prevent crime
   in Swedish municipalities. Drawing on interviews and policy materials
   from three municipalities, this paper examines how private patrolling
   guards has become a solution to (un)safety in Sweden, and the political
   implications of this development. The governmentality analysis shows how
   the rendering of (un)safety as technical and governable depoliticizes
   safety by detaching it from its social and political connotations. At
   the same time, in the process of demarcating the space to be `guarded,'
   safety is problematized as a matter of order and sameness in public
   space, which (re)produces racialized boundaries between those to be made
   safe and those considered threatening safety. The study further
   demonstrates how the outsourcing of responsibility for public safety to
   the security industry is bringing about a shift in democratic
   legitimacy, accountability, and the monopoly on the use of force,
   largely without political contestation in the studied municipalities.
   The paper concludes by discussing the underlying rationale of this
   practice of governing (un)safety as informed by a biopolitical logic of
   immunization: safeguarding and immunizing some, at the expense of those
   marked as risky `others'.},

Abstract = {Since the Taliban's seizure of Kabul in August 2021, there has been
   significant attention to and debate over China's ties with the Taliban.
   This article traces the development of China-Taliban relations from the
   Afghan Civil War in the 1990's to the present day. We find that China
   has consistently respected the Taliban as legitimate long-term political
   actors. We also find that the Taliban have found China to be a valuable
   source of economic and political support for its regime. We conclude
   with a discussion of the future trajectory of China-Taliban relations
   and the implications of this relationship for the balance of power in
   South Asia.},

Title = {The regulatory security state as a risk state},

Abstract = {This paper places the arguments about the rise of the regulatory
   security state in a broader perspective of regulatory governance and
   regulatory state literatures. It suggests that the regulatory security
   state is one morph of the regulatory state. It does not replace any
   other morph and indeed it is only partly new. I clarify the terminology
   around the `old' and new' regulatory (security) state and suggests how
   to think about the concept of the RSS from a perspective of the state as
   a risk manager. The first part clarifies the idea of the `regulatory
   state' and its origins. The second part distinguishes between the old
   regulatory state and the new regulatory state, and therefore also
   distinguishes between the old and the new RSS. The third part suggests
   that the regulatory state can be a positive, liberal or illiberal state.
   The fourth part theorizes the RSS as a risk state. Together these
   clarifications allow a more theoretically rich framework for the study
   of security governance from a regulatory governance perspective.},

Abstract = {The national environmental quality has maintained a momentum of
   improvement, while the tension between the performance evaluation system
   and local officials' behavior has been a significant concern. Based on
   panel data from 224 prefecture-level cities in China from 2003 to 2018,
   this paper examined the impact of the characteristics of officials on
   environmental pollution governance using a fixed-effect model. The
   empirical results demonstrate an incentive for officials to reduce
   pollution emissions and improve environmental protection when their
   native place coincides with the province where they work. The reverse
   incentive occurs when their native place coincides with the
   prefecture-level city where they work. Given the fact that eco-policy is
   the transmission mechanism, a more reasonable assessment system should
   pay more attention to officials' characteristics, such as younger female
   officials are more likely to implement environmental policies, party
   school education may not be helpful for pollution governance, education
   level, professional background and working experience has little
   correlation with environment. Besides, a significant mediating effect
   shows that officials with hometown identity are encouraged to do more in
   environmental protection. An official incentive framework on `working
   effort' should be employed to enhance the effectiveness of environmental
   governance.},

Abstract = {Gendered relations of power contribute to the signification inherent in
   political parties. The formal rules and informal processes through which
   hegemonic gender regimes are reproduced and contested in the Communist
   Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) are subjected to Feminist
   Institutionalist analysis here. In addition, the institutional belonging
   and political self-making of women party members are also assessed in
   the state of West Bengal. The experiential concepts of institutional
   belonging and self-making can enhance Feminist institutionalist research
   by identifying the processes that shape gendered behaviour of actors in
   institutions. The idealised revolutionary communist subjectivity that
   represents the institutional standard of appropriateness of gendered
   behaviour in the CPI(M) is explored. The co-constitutive relationship
   between institutions and political subjectivities is elaborated. The
   paper argues that the institutional belonging and political self-making
   of women in the CPI(M) are characterised by a politics of
   boundary-creation from as well as horizontal solidarities with fellow
   women colleagues.},

Abstract = {After assuming the presidency in January 2019, Bolsonaro used the
   machinery of government to wage culture warfare. Public universities,
   sites of cultivation of a new moral radicalism of the left over recent
   decades, became primary cultural battlegrounds. With its attacks on
   public universities (demonization, unconstitutional government
   interference, budget cuts, and political persecution), Bolsonaro's
   government nurtured the reactionary imagination of Brazil's new right
   and challenged the cultural hegemony of the left and thus undermined a
   biopolitical pact that once tied public universities to the defense of a
   right to life. Depois de assumir a presidencia em Janeiro 2019,
   Bolsonaro utilizou a maquina do governo para fazer uma guerra cultural.
   As universidades publicas, viveiros pela formacao de um novo radicalismo
   moral da esquerda durante as ultimas decadas, se convertiram em
   importantes campos de batalha culturais nessa guerra. Com sua ofensiva
   contra as universidades publicas (demonizacao, interferencia do governo
   inconstitucional, cortes orcamentais e persecucoes politicas), o governo
   Bolsonaro fomentou um imaginario reacionario na direita brasileira que
   desafiou a hegemonia cultural da esquerda e, por conseguinte, minou um
   pacto biopolitico que anteriormente vinculava as universidades publicas
   a defesa do direito a vida.},

Title = {Political trust in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: a

Abstract = {Trust in political actors and institutions has long been seen as
   essential for effective democratic governance. During the COVID-19
   pandemic, trust was widely identified as key for mitigation of the
   crisis through its influence on compliance with public policy,
   vaccination and many other social attitudes and behaviours. We study
   whether trust did indeed predict these outcomes through a meta-analysis
   of 67 studies and 426 individual effect sizes derived from nearly 1.5
   million observations worldwide. Political trust as an explanatory
   variable has small to moderate correlations with outcomes such as
   vaccine uptake, belief in conspiracy theories, and compliance. These
   correlations are heterogenous, and we show that trust in health
   authorities is more strongly related to vaccination than trust in the
   government; but compliance is more strongly related to the government
   than other institutions. Moreover, the unique case of the United States
   indicates that trust in President Trump had negative effects across all
   observed outcomes, except in increasing conspiracy beliefs. Our analysis
   also shows that research design features (such as response scales) and
   publication bias do not importantly change the results. These results
   indicate that trust was important for the management of the pandemic and
   supports existing work highlighting the importance of political trust.},

Abstract = {This paper employs the policy capacity framework to develop a
   multidimensional and nested policy analysis that is able to examine how
   different types of capacity-analytical, organizational, and political
   from different related levels of the health system-have contributed to
   both policy success and failure during the implementation of a
   politically significant national community health worker (CHW) program
   in India. Directed toward rural and urban marginalized populations in
   India, this CHW has become the world's largest CHW program. Launched in
   2006, it has targeted communitization, strengthening of the primary
   health-care system, and universal health-care coverage, ultimately
   receiving an international award in 2022. We argue that, in a context of
   capacity deficits and tensions between different capacity domains, the
   individual political capacity has been more critical to policy success
   and strengthening. The analysis not only clarifies the ways in which the
   government took some initiatives to build up capacity but also
   highlights capacity deficits along different competency dimensions. This
   approach demonstrates the value of understanding and creating awareness
   concerning complex poor-resource settings and low organizational
   capacity while concomitantly building up the capacities needed to foster
   (workforce and leadership) strengthening.},

Abstract = {Citizen distrust towards the rival country is a defining feature of
   protracted international rivalries, undermining meaningful cooperation
   that can lead to mutual benefits. How might governments establish a
   public opinion base that is more supportive of cooperation with the
   rival country? We argue that information about ongoing environmental
   cooperation with the rival country makes citizens more supportive of
   non-environmental cooperation by changing their beliefs about the
   rival's trustworthiness and facilitating extrinsic reciprocity. We
   investigate this potential micro-level cooperation spillover in the
   context of the longstanding rivalry between Japan and South Korea. Our
   survey-based experiment finds that information about cooperation on
   marine plastic pollution shapes the public's willingness to cooperate in
   terms of the economy and security. Importantly, however, we find
   asymmetric results in Japan and Korea. While Koreans are more receptive
   to our positive cooperation treatment, which increases their willingness
   to cooperate in other domains, Japanese respondents react more strongly
   to the negative non-cooperation treatment, which reduces their
   willingness to cooperate in other domains. We offer explanations for
   these divergent reactions based on prior interactions between the two
   countries. Our findings have important policy implications for
   conflict-ridden areas of the world beyond East Asia that increasingly
   face common environmental challenges.},

Title = {Free Riding, Network Effects, and Burden Sharing in Defense Cooperation
   Networks},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {405-439},
Abstract = {How do states distribute the burdens of collective defense? This paper
   develops a network theory of burden sharing. We focus on bilateral
   defense cooperation agreements (DCAs), which promote cooperation in a
   variety of defense, military, and security issue areas. Using a
   computational model, we show that DCA partners' defense spending depends
   on the network structure of their agreements. In bilateral terms, DCAs
   increase defense spending by committing states to defense activities and
   allowing partners to reciprocally punish free riding. However, as a
   state's local network of defense partnerships grows more densely
   connected, with many transitive ``friend of a friend{''} relations, DCAs
   have the countervailing effect of reducing defense spending. The more
   deeply integrated states are in bilateral defense networks, the less
   they spend on defense. We distinguish two potential mechanisms behind
   this effect-one based on efficiency improvements, the other on free
   riding. An empirical analysis using multilevel inferential network
   models points more to efficiency than to free riding. Defense networks
   reduce defense spending, and they do so by allowing countries to produce
   security more efficiently.},

Abstract = {This study seeks to uncover how Malaysia's Islamists responded to the
   August 2021 re-assumption of the reins of government in Afghanistan by
   the Taliban. Utilizing semi-structured interviews held with Malaysian
   stakeholders of the country's Afghanistan-related policies, this article
   finds that, despite forebodings swirling around the policy-making
   community regarding a possible hike of violent extremism following the
   rapid collapse of Afghanistan's American-supported government, the
   impact of Taliban's ascendancy on the growth of Islamist extremism in
   Malaysia has so far been negligible. However, taking into account past
   close linkages between jihadist networks of Malaysia and Afghanistan
   during the latter's occupation by the Soviet Union, this research urges
   all stakeholders to not under-estimate the plausibility of violent
   offshoots emerging from non-violent manifestations of Islamist extremism
   in Malaysia. While conceding that non-violent extremism is the more
   prevalent form of Islamist radicalism to be threatening peace in
   Malaysia, evidence of the recent willingness of young Malay-Muslim
   zealots to fight alongside Muslim terrorists in Iraq, Syria and the
   Philippines should be enough to ring alarm bells to the Malaysian
   authorities. This study's novelty lies in having derived input from
   Malaysian informants who have had first-hand experience in dealing with
   Taliban and other interested parties in Afghanistan.},

Abstract = {This article examines one of the causal concepts in the second advocacy
   coalition framework (ACF) policy change hypothesis: the notion that
   major policy change will not occur as long as the advocacy coalition
   that instated the policy status quo remains `in power' in a
   jurisdiction. It examines the role of this causal concept in ACF theory.
   It then reviews existing scholarship on the causal concept, identifying
   relevant empirical evidence and critically examining how the concept has
   been operationalised. A standard operationalisation is proposed,
   defining status quo advocacy coalitions as `in power' if they control a
   veto player in a jurisdiction's policy process. Changes in Canadian
   firearms policy between 1976 and 2012 are used to illustrate the
   operationalisation and explore its potential.},

Pages = {99-126},
Abstract = {The Russian invasion of Ukraine has implemented legitimate fears of a
   global crisis and further and inevitably aggravating existing
   food-security challenges. The international community is being called
   upon to take targeted action to address the rapidly- evolving, resultant
   scenarios, making it essential to go beyond immediate interim measures
   and to re-examine the agricultural and energy policies that underpin our
   global economy. This article, without any claim to exhaustiveness,
   examines the inevitable link between war and the dynamics related to
   food security. In the first instance, a theoretical-interpretative key
   of the logics of violent conflicts that generate a relevant impact on
   global food supplies and food (in)security is provided, within the
   broader framework of the dynamics related to the instability of
   international relations which hinder the supply of energy resources and
   determine the volatility of general price levels. In the concluding
   section, there is reflection crossed reference to the ongoing
   Russia/Ukraine conflict as well as the devastating consequences on
   global food systems, already put under stress by the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Sereide (H) governed Norwegian
   Israel-Palestine policy according to a classical Norwegian model in the
   period 2017-2021. The two core principles of this Norwegian policy are
   to main-tain a close relationship with the USA and to work for the
   establishment of a two-state solution. During her tenure the two pillars
   of this policy became contradictory as President Trump (R) destroyed the
   two-state option. At times Sereide expressed strong criticism of
   American, as well as Israeli and Palestinian politics, but she never
   changed course. Sereide's main accom-plishment as Foreign Minister was
   to secure Norway's diplomatic position by leading the international
   donor group (AHLC) through a turbulent period, gain a temporary seat at
   the UN Security Council and through the appoint-ment of Norwegian
   diplomats to leading international positions in dealing with the
   conflict. In practice this meant that Norway was a very well place
   witness to the demise of the two-state solution. By securing continued
   aid to the Palestinians Norway eased the pain of the end of this
   political solution.},

Abstract = {The article describes how Kenya, through its security forces, responded
   to significant terrorist attacks carried out by terrorist organization
   Al-Shabaab on the territory of Kenya alongside how those attacks
   contributed to the development of counter-terrorism measures. The
   measures are analyzed from a legislative, technical and security point
   of view. The article is based on a conceptual analysis of P.C.
   Sederberg, combined with the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism
   Strategy and argues that three significant terrorist attacks on Westgate
   in 2013, Garissa in 2015 and Dusit D2 in 2019 were key factors of the
   development and adoption of complex counter-terrorism measures. Those
   measures were based on the adoption of appropriate laws, development of
   the institutional structure and implementation of military and police
   counter-terrorism measures. However, changes were gradual, reactive
   instead of proactive. The country has learned to build the state's
   capacity to combat terrorism but struggled with conflict prevention and
   respect for the rule of law. It succeeded with a build-up of
   counter-terrorism security forces able to respond effectively and on
   time. But, finding and eliminating the causes of the conflict, they were
   far behind. All three significant terrorist attacks showed the need for
   an appropriate combination of counter-terrorism measures. They cannot be
   put in use separately, otherwise, it can lead to unintended results.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Abstract = {Police officers worldwide have encountered significant challenges during
   the COVID-19 pandemic, including a lack of protective equipment,
   overwork, and the legality of emergency policing. This study explores
   how police officers in China have responded to public emergencies during
   the pandemic, using a comprehensive and multi-channel method of data
   collection and analysis. The primary and secondary data were obtained
   from question-naires (N=713), semi-structured interviews (N=30), and
   official reports. The ``Fengqiao Experience{''} demonstrates how China
   relieves pressure on police officers during the pandemic in both the
   short and long run. The experi-mental practices of Fengqiao, including
   material support and training mechanisms, non-contact law enforce-ment,
   intelligent analysis combined with big data, grid-based governance, and
   joint defense mechanisms, prove to be effective. Fighting the COVID-19
   pandemic is not only a test for the national governance system and its
   capabilities but also an opportunity to promote its modernization.},

Title = {The UN Track in Norwegian Foreign Policy},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Number = {2},
Pages = {265-275},
Abstract = {The first part of the article discusses how two representations of the
   UN have traditionally vied with one another in Norwegian public debate.
   One is pragmatic and accentuates the UN's role as a consensus-creating
   and legitimating force in Norwegian foreign policy. The other is
   ideological and accentuates the UN as an alternative focus to NATO.
   Since the Iraq War of 2003, the concept of a ``UN track{''} in Norwegian
   foreign policy has lent itself to both usages. While the ideological
   representation was quite widespread in Norwegian public debate on the
   left of the Labour Party and further leftwards, it is now only to be
   found at the very left of the political spectrum. As demonstrated in the
   second part of the article, in Norwegian diplomatic discourse, the UN is
   represented in pragmatic terms only. The third part of the article is a
   normative celebration of the waning of the ideological representation of
   the UN. Two reasons are given. Firstly, and on principle, a pragmatic
   approach to foreign policy making is superior to an ideological approach
   in that it increases room for manoeuvre. Secondly, and related to the
   conjuncture of present-day international relations, which is seeing a
   resurgence of great-power rivalry, a small power like Norway has a
   vested interest in maintaining as much multilateral ism as possible. The
   interest in multilateralism as a general phenomenon takes precedence
   over what particular form multilateralism takes.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explain the use of soft power by the People's
   Republic of China (PRC) by taking the so-called ``panda diplomacy{''}
   and glob-al health diplomacy as examples. Using the deductive method and
   the sup-port of a theoretical apparatus based on the analysis of soft
   power by Chinese scholars, the authors discuss the strategies Beijing
   uses to ``win the minds and hearts{''} of the international community
   and mitigate the perception of the ``Chinese threat{''} generated by
   multiple factors, including the current pan-demic caused by sARs-Cov-2.
   The article concludes that through panda diplo-macy and global health
   diplomacy, the PRC has succeeded in these goals and is likely to
   continue to use its soft power to position itself as a great power in
   the 21st century.},

Title = {The EU Eastern Enlargement Policy Under the Pressure of Geopolitics. The
   Bulgarian Case (Russia's Little Brother)},
Journal = {STUDIA EUROPEJSKIE-STUDIES IN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-79},
Abstract = {The Bulgarian case is symptomatic of the susceptibility of the EU
   enlargement policy under geopolitical pressure. The aim of this text is
   to add arguments to the statement that the dynamic of Bulgaria's
   accession to the EU has been strongly influenced by external factors -
   mainly Yugoslavia's disintegration and the subsequential Kososvo crisis.
   This crisis brought up the issue of the huge Russian influence over
   Bulgarian politics and societies and, as a result, predetermined the
   perception of Bulgaria as a high security risk for EU. In this
   situation, Bulgaria was an object of de-securitisation by the EU's
   enlargement policy, but at the same time its main instrument, namely,
   the conditionality policy, was neglected. From this point of view, the
   Bulgarian case is important because: it illustrates the effects of this
   discrepancy to date; it is instructive in the context of EU enlargement
   policy towards the Western Balkans with huge Russian influence; and also
   in the context of the acceleration of the EU's eastern enlargement
   policy toward Ukraine and Moldova because of the pressure of the ongoing
   Russian military invasion. The opportunity for accelerating the
   pre-accession process under the influence of unpredicted external events
   created prerequisites for politicising the whole process, including the
   political use of the conditionality and the consequently unfinished
   preaccession preparation of the newcomers. The research task is
   fulfilled by a synthesis of primary and secondary sources organised
   around three main questions - Which external circumstances? Why? and,
   How? The results of a discourse analysis of interviews with key
   participants in Bulgaria's EU integration process are used as a starting
   point.},

Title = {Challenging the insider outsider approach to advocacy: how collaboration
   networks and belief similarities shape strategy choices},

Abstract = {Advocacy strategies are a key success factor for public, private and
   third sector actors who participate in and seek to influence policy
   choices. Despite this, research on policy networks has paid little
   attention to the forms of advocacy studied by interest groups scholars.
   The interest groups' literature differentiates insider from outsider
   strategies and assumes that interest groups with strong access to
   policymakers opt for insider strategies, while those with weak access
   are constrained to the use of outsider strategies. This literature has
   not considered how the full set of actors that constitute a policy
   network use advocacy strategies. Furthermore, the insider/outsider
   dichotomy oversimplifies and neglects the possibility that actors'
   choices are interdependent. Using climate change policy network data
   from four countries that vary by interest group system, we investigate
   if policy actors' choices of advocacy strategies are similar to those in
   their collaboration network and to those with similar policy beliefs as
   their own. Results show that, irrespective of the context, actors are
   likely to use the same advocacy strategies as their collaboration
   partners and those whose policy beliefs are like their own. This
   research demonstrates the value of using a policy network approach to
   move beyond the insider/outsider dichotomy on interest groups' use of
   advocacy strategies. It makes a clear contribution to this scholarship
   by advancing the debate on strategies that policy actors employ to
   influence policymaking through evidencing interdependencies between the
   strategies used by policy actors due to belief similarity and a
   `networking effect'.},

Abstract = {Social media, as an important resource of information for many
   contentious topics, has great affective potential in terms of anger and
   fear. We investigated how exposure to news about refugees on social
   media is related to negative attitudes toward refugees as well as
   attitudinal differentiation with respect to Muslims and terrorists. A
   two-wave panel survey (NT2 = 524) showed that social media use about
   refugees was not directly related to negative attitudes and attitudinal
   differentiation. However, we found that anger served as the affective
   nexus between the refugee topic and the terrorism topic: Social media
   use about refugees led to more anger about terrorism over time, which in
   turn led to more negative attitudes toward refugees. Fear with respect
   to terrorism did not play a role in this process. Overall, our findings
   underline the key role of anger, but not fear, when trying to understand
   negative reactions toward refugees.},

Abstract = {This article explores the distinctiveness of French and francophone
   approaches to environmental justice. While off to a slow start,
   environmental justice research has received increased attention in
   France in the last 15 years. But there has been little to no attention
   to the French debates and movements in the English-language academic
   literature, with both bodies of knowledge largely evolving in parallel,
   conceptually and politically. This article attends to this gap by first
   taking stock of the empirical evidence of environmental injustices and
   inequalities in France. We then introduce some of the theoretical
   origins and discuss some of the main insights from the French literature
   in light of contemporary environmental justice scholarship. In so doing,
   our aim with this paper is to contribute to current scholarly efforts on
   diversifying the meanings and understandings of environmental justice in
   different academic and political contexts.},

Abstract = {The paper analyses the foreign policy preference of Czech political
   parties in the context of the 2021 elections and the war in Ukraine. The
   authors question whether the war in Ukraine functioned as a critical
   juncture in reshaping the parties' positions. The authors show that
   although the European and international profile of Czech foreign policy
   prevails, some competing visions have emerged since 2013, which applied
   to the elections in 2021, too. The outbreak of the war did not create a
   critical juncture reshaping the foreign policy stances of the Czech
   political parties. Long-term ideological motivations have remained the
   essential factor.},

Abstract = {The `asymmetry thesis', articulated by Fritz Scharpf, holds that EU
   governance is characterised by an asymmetry between positive and
   negative integration. The EU has well-developed capacities for negative
   integration but only limited capacities for positive integration. The
   present paper challenges the orthodoxy that this thesis has become in EU
   law and political science scholarship. It argues that the asymmetry
   thesis no longer accurately depicts European integration, revisiting its
   key legal and institutional assumptions. Taking the internal market as
   the most likely case to test the thesis, we show that negative
   integration has become weaker, positive integration has gained in
   strength, and both developments have had an impact on the substance of
   EU law and policymaking, which is promoting non-economic concerns and
   market-correcting policies to a greater extent than it used to. These
   shifts, so we contend, could be even more pronounced in other areas of
   European integration.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the use of apocalyptic frames by jihadist groups and
   how they have been developing after the fall of IS. It contextualizes
   these developments in the history of Muslim apocalyptic though and
   literature. After describing the apocalyptic narrative in the hadith
   literature and in the Quran, as well as the differences between
   classical and modern apocalyptic literature, the study analyzes
   differences in how jihadist groups have used apocalyptic framing of
   their fight. Finally, using interview data, the study analyzes how the
   Salafi-jihadist environment in Sweden has started to reframe the
   apocalyptic narrative after the military defeat of IS.},

Abstract = {How and when can religious times become focal points for communal
   violence? In the context of Hindu-Muslim riots in India, I argue that
   incompatible ritual holidays where one religion's rituals are at odds
   with another (e.g., sacrificing cows or engaging in processions with
   idolatry) help explain the positive effect of sacred time on religious
   rioting. Holidays with incompatible rituals provide doctrinal
   differences that make riots more likely. These types of holidays can be
   used by riot entrepreneurs to incite violence or can independently raise
   an individual's willingness to engage in violence. I provide support for
   this argument by analyzing data on Hindu-Muslim riots across 100 years.
   I investigate the mechanisms through additional analysis and examining
   historical and present-day cases of riots that occurred on holidays. By
   focusing on the content of religion, this paper demonstrates how
   particular religious holidays can provide the underlying conditions that
   elites use to incite religious violence.},

Abstract = {The consequences of job uncertainty on well-being are widely known. Yet
   not all types of job separation might be equally detrimental: the level
   of expectedness and voluntariness of job ends may shape the consequences
   on workers and their partners. This article explores the associations of
   four types of job termination with well-being in a couple's perspective.
   Combining two British longitudinal surveys (1991-2021) (N similar to
   13,000 couples), the analyses apply fixed-effects models to estimate
   deviations of the well-being for workers and partners. Also, the
   patterns of anticipation and habituation of each episode of job
   termination are investigated. The results show that events such as
   dismissals and redundancies-more unanticipated and involuntary-are
   associated with larger drops in well-being than other more preventable
   and voluntary causes of job separation. The responses differ between
   workers and their partners and by gender. Further, anticipation and
   habituation patterns vary across the types of job separation.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of policy advice in labour reforms in
   Italy and tests two hypotheses: the politicisation of policy advice and
   the key role of external consultants. To this end, our research focuses
   on: the << who >>, i.e. the profile of the advisor; the selection of
   advisors (the << how >>); and, finally, the content and influence of the
   advice (the << what >>) in three exemplary reform processes: the
   so-called << Biagi reform >>, the << Fornero reform >> and the << Jobs
   Act >>. The dense empirical reconstruction provides evidence of the key
   role played by external consultants selected directly by policymak-ers.
   The activity of these advisors proves to be a loose form of
   politicisation, where the direct control of policymakers is limited and
   shaped by contingent (often accidental) factors.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {1501-1530},

Abstract = {Utilizing the geographical polarization of American politics, we examine
   how state politics shape the implementation of downsizing. Combining
   power resources theory and the political-embeddedness approach in
   organizational studies, we propose that labor power resources at the
   state level, namely Democratic control of state government and
   state-level union membership, limit firms' ability to implement drastic
   job cuts within the state. Based on data on the 697 largest, publicly
   traded US firms between 1981 and 2005, combined with their
   establishment-level employment data from EEO-1 reports, our analysis
   shows that post-downsizing reductions in employment were less severe in
   states with a worker-friendly political environment. But the limited
   effectiveness of labor's power resources in right-to-work states and the
   American South suggests that there is considerable regional variation.
   Our findings provide strong evidence of the political embeddedness of
   firms, by demonstrating the growing salience of political considerations
   in corporate decision-making.},

Title = {Dish the dirt! Dual effects of workplace gossip patterns in linking
   coworker friendship with incivility in the restaurant context},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {591-610},
Month = {APR 17},
Abstract = {PurposePeople are more likely to participate in work-related events that
   might cause positive and negative affective reactions. Prior research
   linked coworker friendship with incivility; however, few studies
   investigated negative workplace gossip. Simultaneously, linking coworker
   friendship with incivility through positive/negative affective responses
   is lacking. As such, this paper aims to examine this relationship via
   the dual mediation effect of positive and negative workplace
   gossip.Design/methodology/approachA total of 398 subordinates at family
   restaurants in Greater Cairo were surveyed, and data was analyzed using
   SmartPLS4.FindingsCoworker friendship significantly influences coworker
   incivility via positive and negative workplace gossip and other
   underlying mechanisms.Research limitations/implicationsManagers should
   take the initiative to decrease gossip by sharing information promptly
   and thoroughly and establishing effective channels for information
   exchange. In the case of an informal plan, restaurant managers may seek
   to create a welcoming and motivating corporate atmosphere and cultivate
   social ties among subordinates to prevent the creation of negative
   gossip. Restaurant managers should give victims of negative gossip
   timely psychological counseling.Originality/valueThis paper contributes
   to the restaurant literature on affective emotional responses to
   coworkers' judgment-driven behavior from new perspectives.},

Abstract = {Research on policy learning has shown that actors can learn in
   inadequate modes. To better understand policy learning failures and
   possible remedies, we ask how and why inadequate learning environments
   occur and how they can be changed. Building on the varieties of learning
   approach, we distinguish between perceived and functional actor
   certification and problem tractability. On this basis, we introduce a
   typology of learning mode misfits and indicative adjustments and revisit
   previous case studies from this perspective. We then apply the concept
   to a case of policy learning in a socio-technical transition, arguing
   that learning environments in socio-technical transitions tend to
   overvalue actor certification and problem tractability and require
   recalibration towards reflexivity. Assessing the effects of
   participatory co-creation interventions on technology development in
   precision grassland farming in two living labs in Germany, we provide
   evidence that decentral arenas and participatory experimentation
   facilitate learning by coequal actors scrutinising problems.},

Abstract = {PurposeBased on the theory of trust and cost-benefit perspective, this
   paper examines the relationship between citizens' trust and their
   digital attitudes by considering the mediating effects of performance
   expectancy and perceived risk, as well as the moderating effect of media
   use.Design/methodology/approachThe city digital transformation in
   Shanghai is chosen as the case in this study. 466 questionnaires were
   collected through a survey, with Structural Equation Modeling to test
   the hypotheses in AMOS.FindingsCitizens' trust of government and trust
   of technology has no significant direct effect on their digital
   attitudes. However, performance expectancy mediates between the trust of
   government and digital attitudes, and perceived risk mediates the effect
   of trust of technology on attitudes. The use of social media
   significantly moderates the association between trust of technology and
   citizens' attitudes.Originality/valueExploring why citizens shape
   supportive attitudes toward digitalization is critical to achieving
   digital governance goals in developing countries, especially large
   cities where digital transformation is accelerating. The originality
   lies in using cost-benefit analysis as a perspective and media use as a
   moderator to examine the mechanisms of citizens' trust and digital
   attitudes.},

Abstract = {The study of Russia's evolving (c)overt aggression against Ukraine has
   received vast scholarly attention, with multivariate accounts offered on
   what the conflict is actually about, what are its root causes, its legal
   and political nature as well as what the future may hold for its
   evolution and resolution. Thereby, a number of contending
   conceptualizations of the Russia-Ukraine conflict(s), including the
   hyperinflated `Ukraine crisis' term, vividly showed that there is a
   clash of (factual and fictional) narratives in both media, politics, and
   academia, a good share of which (un)intentionally contribute to the
   distortion, rather than production, of knowledge. With a critical
   introspection into the academic debate on the matter, this article seeks
   to uncover the dominant framings of the evolving Russia-Ukraine war and
   modalities of both unintentional, intentional and collateral knowledge
   distortion, as well as to stimulate overdue discussion on the conceptual
   distinction between `crisis', `conflict' and `war' paradigms in the
   conflict-sensitive context.},

Title = {Measuring the stasis: Punctuated equilibrium theory and partisan
   polarization},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-46},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The American policy process is characterized by a pattern known as
   ``Punctuated Equilibrium,{''} manifesting as periods of stasis
   interspersed with large periods of change. Punctuated equilibrium
   suggests that friction in the policy process and uneven information
   processing result in a policy process that over- and underreacts to
   problems. Increasingly, American political institutions are also
   characterized by high levels of partisanship, which are rising steadily
   and represent one of many sources of institutional friction. We argue
   that with increased polarization, the policy process has become longer,
   exaggerating patterns of stasis and punctuation-the periods of stasis
   being more prolonged and punctuations less frequent. In sum, increased
   partisan polarization in Congress amplifies patterns of punctuated
   equilibrium. We test this theory using data from the Comparative Agendas
   Project on the federal budget and public laws, using kurtosis scores to
   measure the relative force of punctuations versus statis. We find
   increasingly leptokurtic distributions of budget changes from 1948 to
   2020, but a decreasingly leptokurtic distribution of public law passage
   across the same time. These findings indicate that polarization has
   resulted in exaggerated patterns of punctuated equilibrium in the
   legislative process, and a tendency toward fewer, higher-stakes public
   laws.},

Abstract = {This paper critiques a core premise of Global IR: the association of
   knowledge with geography, which we term geo-epistemology. It argues that
   `American' and Global IR share a Eurocentric spatial imaginary, one that
   was a product of Western expansion and empire. Through its
   geo-epistemology, Global IR enables a conservative appropriation of the
   critique of Eurocentrism in IR. Globality becomes a matter of assembling
   sufficient geographic representation rather than an analysis of the
   discipline's political, historical, and spatial assumptions.
   Anglo-American policymakers and intellectuals invented the
   national/international world to replace the world of empires and races
   that came apart in the era of the world wars. This UN world of sovereign
   nation-states and their regional groupings was the foundational move of
   both what Stanley Hoffman called `the American social science' - IR -
   and the American-centred world order. The paper uses the reception and
   legacy of Hoffman's classic essay to show how culture replaced power and
   history in the study of the discipline, obfuscating the Eurocentrism of
   Global IR.},

Abstract = {International Relations (IR) scholars have taken China's presumed
   hegemony in pre-modern East Asia as an ideal case to `undermine' the
   field's Eurocentrism. If Eurocentric IR is guilty of `getting Asia
   wrong', do students of historical Asia `get Asia right'? Analysts should
   avoid exotifying differences between the West and the East and
   `exchanging Eurocentrism for Sinocentrism'. This article tries to `get
   Asia {[}more] right' by `disaggregating' and then `reassembling'
   taken-for-granted concepts by time, space, and relationality. When
   `Confucianism' is understood to justify both war and peace in
   competition with other thoughts, it does not dictate peace among East
   Asian states or conflicts across the Confucian-nomadic divide. When
   `China' is unpacked, it does not sit on top of an Asian hierarchy. When
   Korea's, Vietnam's, and Japan's views of their relations with China are
   examined rather than presumed, cultural legitimacy is thinned out. When
   `Asia' is broadened to cover webs of relations beyond East Asia to
   Central Asia, Confucianism recedes in centrality and pan-Asian phenomena
   including Buddhism and the steppe tradition come to the fore. The
   article concludes that a better challenge to Eurocentrism is not to
   search for cultural differences but to locate Eurasian similarities that
   erase European superiority.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Pages = {768-775},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Critiquing Paul Kelly's unsophisticated grouping of political thinkers
   into two broad camps of a pre-state and (post-)state era, this article
   attempts to use the paradigm of technology as an alternative narrative
   to examine the phenomena of war, conflict and revolution. Drawing on
   Heidegger and Stiegler, the technology in war is regarded as a way of
   not only revealing our being in the world, but unconcealing the way we
   interact and construct intersubjectivity. Five paradigms of technology
   in war can be discerned, namely the first paradigm of primitive tools
   (from classical times to 1500 A.D.), the second one of early sciences
   and machines (1500-1830), the third one of interconnected systems
   (1830-1945), the fourth one of instruments of automation (1945-2000),
   and the current fifth one of artificial intelligence. These paradigms
   offer us a logical (while not necessarily linear) way to (re)examine the
   history of political thoughts.},

   effect of humble leadership - from the perspective of low-status

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to reveal the mechanism of humble
   leadership inducing abusive supervision from the low-status compensation
   perspective, examining the mediation role of leader perceived thread to
   status. Besides, the moderation effect of regulatory focus on the
   mediation path is discussed.Design/methodology/approachThis study
   conducted a three-wave longitudinal survey. The data was collected from
   438 leaders and their employees in five Chinese enterprises. This study
   used Mplus 7.4 and adopted a bootstrapping technique for data
   analysis.FindingsHumble leadership has a positive effect on leader
   perceived threat to status. Leader perceived threat to status plays a
   mediation role between humble leadership and leader abusive supervision.
   Leader regulatory focus is the ``gate valve{''} that humble leadership
   fosters leader abusive supervision. That is, when the leader promotion
   focus is high, leader perceived threat to status bred by humble
   leadership is low, resulting in less abusive supervision. When the
   leader prevention focus is high, humble leadership brings relatively
   more abusive supervision through perceived threat to
   status.Originality/valueThis study explores why humble leadership breeds
   abusive supervision behaviors and reveals the mechanism behind the
   negative effect of humble leadership based on low-status compensation
   theory. This study not only promotes the continuous development of the
   field of humble leadership research through empirical research but also
   provides guidance for effectively suppressing the negative effects of
   humble leadership, promoting strengths and avoiding weaknesses and
   suppressing inappropriate management behaviors in management practice.},

Abstract = {According to the Global Terrorism Database, the use of firearms in
   terrorist attacks has been on the rise, and firearms-based attacks are
   the most lethal. In the aftermath of mass-casualty attacks perpetrated
   with firearms, policymakers across the world advocate tightened gun
   control to restrict terrorists' access to both licit and illicit guns.
   However, academic research on the linkages between firearms
   availability, gun control legislation, and terrorism is scarce. This
   study fills this research gap by conducting a systematic cross-sectional
   analysis of the linkage between gun control, licit and illicit stocks of
   firearms, and terrorist attacks in 2015-2019, based on a novel dataset
   incorporating the Global Terrorism Database and the Small Arms Survey.
   Our estimation using OLS regression shows a strong relationship between
   the availability of firearms and the incidence of gun-based terrorism,
   especially for lone wolf attacks. Furthermore, terrorists in stable,
   democratic countries are comparatively more likely to select firearms as
   their weapon of choice. Conversely, strict gun control only slightly
   alleviates the overall risk of terrorism in stable countries but does
   not impact weapon selection. In unstable countries in the grip of
   intrastate conflict, gun control significantly reduces lone wolf-style
   attacks, while organized multi-perpetrator attacks are not deterred.},

Abstract = {Who makes policy change happen, and how? Public policy scholars now take
   more seriously the role of agency in the policy process, and in
   particular the role of policy entrepreneurship, a contested term built
   mostly from classical, economic conceptions of entrepreneurship from the
   mid-20th century. In this study, we introduce policy scholars to modern
   theories of entrepreneurship from sociology and management scholarship,
   including cultural entrepreneurship, effectuation, bricolage, and
   entrepreneurial assembly. We show that theories connect more easily with
   major theories of the policy process more easily than classical theories
   do and argue policy scholars should make room for multiple policy
   entrepreneurship archetypes. We also give three examples-organizational
   imprinting, the small firm effect, and survivorship bias-of the
   readymade research agenda modern entrepreneurship theories offer to
   policy entrepreneurship scholars. Finally, we show how these theories
   help policy scholars build bridges to other political science subfields.},

Abstract = {The present research examined the psychological processes underlying
   engagement in non-normative forms of resistance and the role of
   repression. We conducted two studies in the contexts of two distinct
   social movements, both characterized by high levels of repression- the
   Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement in Hong Kong and the
   ``Chilean Spring{''} protests of 2019-2020. First, we tested whether
   non-normative resistance was motivated by (1) moralization of
   non-normative actions (moralization hypothesis), (2) perceived low
   efficacy of normative actions and lack of hope (nothing-to-lose
   hypothesis), or (3) perceived efficacy of non-normative actions in
   achieving movement goals (strategic choice hypothesis). Our results
   provided converging evidence for the moralization and strategic choice
   hypotheses, but not the nothing-to-lose hypothesis. Furthermore, we
   proposed and provided evidence for a model of movement escalation,
   whereby experiences of police violence predicted stronger willingness to
   engage in future non-normative actions via heightened motivations for
   non-normative resistance and increased risk perceptions. Taken together,
   these findings illuminate that repression in the form of coercive police
   violence may be ineffective in quelling social unrest. Rather, it can
   contribute to the radicalization of protesters. Potential boundary
   conditions and cross-contextual generalizability of the current results
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of metadata analytics in the target
   selection process to show how such analytics undermines the fundamental
   principle of international humanitarian law, that is, the principle of
   distinction between combatants and civilians. The central part of the
   article is divided into three sections. The first section provides a
   brief overview of how international humanitarian law draws the line
   between civilians and legitimate military targets (e.g. members of armed
   forces, paramilitary groups, organized armed groups, and civilians
   directly participating in hostilities) in both international and
   non-international armed conflicts. The second section explores the use
   of metadata analytics in the target selection process by focusing on two
   programs, the Real Time - Real Gateway (RT-RG) and SKYNET, developed by
   the United States to detect deviant `terrorist' behaviour. The third
   section provides new insights into how metadata analytics creates the
   circumstances for violations of the principle of distinction. This
   section focuses on four characteristics of metadata analysis that
   undermine the principle of distinction (e.g. the inability to make
   qualitative distinctions between potential targets, the uncertainty of
   results, the incorporated margin of error, and the unpredictability of
   target determinations).},

Abstract = {Objective/context: This introductory article to the dossier on
   Legislative and Presidential Elections 2022 of Colombia Internacional
   seeks to describe important features of the 2022 electoral campaign, as
   well as present the configuration of the party system based on the
   results of both legislative and presidential elections. The goal is to
   provide a general context of national elections, complementing the
   specific contributions and findings of the articles that make up this
   issue. Methodology: This article proposes a reading of the 2022 election
   results based on both some electoral data and indices as well as a
   qualitative look at what happened in those elections and how it may
   relate to the local elections of 2023. Conclusions: Some reflections are
   offered on both the possible impact of the composition of forces in
   national elections on local elections, and on executive-legislative
   relations resulting from the new configuration of the party system and
   the implementation of the Opposition Statute. Originality: This issue
   presents readings of elections that emphasize citizens' political
   behavior and move away from traditional emphasis on political parties.},

Abstract = {While the contribution of military defections to the success of
   non-violent struggles has received significant attention in Non-violent
   Resistance (NVR) literature, little has been said about the ethical
   challenges involved in promoting defection through non-violent tactics.
   Looking into the incidents of the Syrian uprising, this article examines
   the practical and ethical aspects of the tactics that NVR activists
   adopt to promote defections and argues that some of these tactics might
   raise challenges that undermine their contribution to NVR. The costs for
   defectors might undercut protesters' ability to encourage defections,
   and the probability that defectors will resort to an armed revolt
   undermines the chances of success of NVR campaigns. This article
   suggests that promoting defections is more likely to be effective when
   NVR actionists mitigate the costs for defectors by protecting them and
   their families after they defect. In doing so, activists could reduce
   the chances of defectors turning to violence and improve NVR's chances
   of success.},

Abstract = {How do actors react to the politicisation of trade policy? This special
   issue aims to tackle this question, considering a broad set of actors
   including members of parliament, political parties, regional and
   national governments, interest groups, and the European Commission. To
   set the stage for the contributions to the special issue, in this
   introduction, we first conceptualise politicisation as the combination
   of high salience and high contestation. We then present existing
   research on the politicisation of trade policy, highlighting the
   relative scarcity of work on reactions to politicisation. The
   introduction also offers a typology of strategies available to actors in
   response to politicisation, which distinguishes between dodging, free
   riding, confronting, and bandwagoning. These strategies differ with
   respect to the position taken by actors relative to contestation and by
   their level of activity. Finally, we summarise the main lessons learned
   from the special issue.},

Abstract = {Few predicted the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine and especially
   its brutality. Similarly, Ukraine's capable and determined resistance
   came as a surprise to many. Ukraine, viewed through the Russian lenses,
   was erroneously characterized as ``weak{''} and ``fragmented.{''} In
   turn, Russia was seen as a modern power seeking a ``sphere of
   influence{''} through attraction and occasional meddling in neighbors'
   affairs. The Ukraine-Russia relations were misconstrued as
   ``brotherly.{''} I argue that Russia should be understood as a colonial
   power whose aggression aims to re-establish supremacy over the Ukrainian
   nation. This desire arose from Ukrainians' increased acceptance in
   Europe, which Russians perceived as a transgression of hierarchies. The
   brutality of the invasion was aggravated by the Russian forces'
   realization that Ukrainians not only rejected their ``rescue mission{''}
   but did not need one in the first place. Misconceptions about the
   Russian invasion can be addressed through interdisciplinarity,
   engagement with postcolonial scholarship, and attention to facts.},

Abstract = {Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, governments are increasingly
   concerned about the way in which citizens' personal data are collected,
   processed and used during election campaigns To develop the appropriate
   tools for monitoring and controlling this new mode of ``data-driven
   campaigning{''} (DDC) regulators require a clear understanding of the
   practices involved. This paper provides a first step toward that goal by
   proposing a new organizational and process-centred operational
   definition of DDC from which we derive a set of empirical indicators.
   The indicators are applied to the policy environment of a leading
   government in this domain - the European Union (EU) - to generate a
   descriptive ``heat map{''} of current regulatory activity toward DDC.
   Based on the results of this exercise, we argue that regulation is
   likely to intensify on existing practices and extend to cover current
   ``cold spots{''}. Drawing on models of internet governance, we argue
   that this expansion is likely to occur in one of two ways. A
   ``kaleidoscopic{''} approach, in which current legislation extends to
   absorb DDC practices and a more ``designed{''} approach that involves
   more active intervention by elites, and ultimately the generation of a
   new regulatory regime.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the theoretical and empirical challenges of
   assessing performance of the EU's Eastern Partnership policy with a
   special focus on the future of the policy amidst Russia's war against
   Ukraine. Based on the contributions to the respective Special Issue the
   concluding article discusses contemporary developments at the crossroads
   between EU Studies and the studies of performance, the multi- and
   interdisciplinary approaches to performance assessment in European
   Studies, as well as state-of-the-art of the EU's performance in six
   Eastern Partnership countries. It also dedicates much attention to the
   implications the policy's performance so far and available evidence
   about it will have for the reinvention of the Eastern Partnership in the
   new geopolitical constellations, shaped by Russia's war against Ukraine
   and the EU's response thereto.},

Abstract = {When Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24,
   2022, Ukrainians did not crumble under the unprecedented attack but
   showed steely resolve to fight for independence and the right to decide
   their own fate. In the Western media and scholarly analysis, the
   Ukrainian resilience is often associated with the leadership of the
   state, in particular President Zelensky. This article offers a different
   take on the issue of resilience in war and looks at the value
   foundations of Ukrainian identity, the decentralized nature of Ukrainian
   society and the vision of a better future as part of the Euro-Atlantic
   community to better understand Ukraine's agency in response to Russia's
   invasion. It draws on the original data, collected from interviews of
   three categories of Ukrainians, affected by the war: refugees,
   internally displaced people, and those living close to the frontlines.},

Abstract = {Academia is increasingly populated but remains saturated with problems
   of exclusion, inequality, and injustice. However, policies aimed to
   govern the sector are criticized for corrupting the core of the academic
   practice, overlooking complexities, and perpetuating old and
   constructing new forms of inequalities. We thus need more empowering
   ways to design policies which can productively transform academia into
   good spaces to inhabit. To this end, we take a novel approach by viewing
   higher education policies as world-making spaces. Through `social
   world/arena mapping' of the Norwegian research and higher education
   policy, we find that the policy articulates diverse worlds with
   different logics and purposes for academics to inhabit. However, the
   actors in these worlds remain passive, and seemingly `universal' actors,
   able to simultaneously inhabit all the different policy worlds, while
   systemic inequalities which permeate the sector are largely overlooked.
   We argue that acknowledging this shortcoming is pivotal to finding new
   ways to (re)create sustainable spaces in research and higher education
   that ensure inclusive environments and function as democratic
   institutions.},

Abstract = {This article discusses Indonesia's pragmatic reaction to the war by
   adopting an equidistant foreign policy with both Russia and with
   Ukraine. It contends that three factors have shaped Indonesia's
   response, namely Indonesian leaders' perceptions and priorities
   regarding the country's economic interests and its position as the
   President of the G-20; strategic ties with Russia; and bottom-up
   societal inclinations that favour Russia more than Ukraine. The article
   finds that the invasion of Ukraine affects Indonesia's standing as the
   natural leader of ASEAN by undermining its cohesion and the
   organisation's effectiveness and credibility for the leadership role it
   sought to play in the Indo-Pacific region. Furthermore, the war in
   Ukraine may have an impact on intensifying geopolitical rivalry in the
   region which may prompt the USA's security partners in the region to
   fill the strategic void caused by Washington's preoccupation with
   Eastern Europe contingencies.},

Abstract = {It is commonplace to say that international organizations (IOs) face a
   legitimacy crisis because they are perceived as undemocratic,
   unaccountable, and inefficient. Plausible as it may seem, this still
   must count as a conjecture. In this article, I review the rapidly
   growing literature that has explored this connection empirically. I
   follow three strands of research that approach the legitimacy of IOs
   from different angles. The first strand explores individual beliefs
   through observational and experimental surveys. The second strand
   analyzes public discourses, mapping arguments deployed to
   (de-)legitimize IOs. The third strand studies political action related
   to legitimacy, such as protest voting, street demonstrations, and
   withdrawal of member states from IOs. The empirical evidence shows that
   citizens expect fair procedures and balanced outcomes also in
   international politics; that legitimation discourses revolve around
   democratic standards and not only performance; and that institutions
   respond to protests. It is less clear, however, how the three dimensions
   of (de-)legitimation interact. I argue that we need to triangulate them
   more systematically to see the connections between beliefs, arguments,
   and political action at work. I suggest in-depth case studies, sensitive
   to the context and content of legitimation debates, that cover these
   three dimensions and their interactions simultaneously.},

Title = {Brexit and `Global Britain': role adaptation and contestation in trade
   policy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 14},
Abstract = {Brexit has led to major changes in UK trade policy after decades of
   collective trade agreements and regulatory alignment with the European
   Union. Following the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership, the idea of
   `Global Britain' was touted as the central goal in securing policy
   autonomy and regulatory independence with respect to trade, rooted in a
   strong sense of liberalization unencumbered by the perceived constraints
   of European membership. This article suggests that the UK's role
   conception as a global trading (and finance) state has been revived by
   Brexit. Yet the performance of this role has been mixed. Role adaptation
   is far from complete, and evidence from the postreferendum period
   suggests that the post-Brexit economy has failed to fulfil the
   optimistic expectations of the those who favoured Brexit. In trade, the
   UK has been buffeted by the post-Brexit relationship with the EU and the
   changing demands of the global political economy.},

Abstract = {Repressive and economic threats drive much of the popular mobilization
   in Central America, but those conditions need to be articulated to
   publics in a manner that emphasizes the need for collective action to
   ameliorate worsening harms. Examination of protest songs in both periods
   of heightened state repression (1970-1990) and heightened economic
   threats (1990-present) in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
   and Nicaragua demonstrates that musicians and cultural producers
   actively construct lyrics and musical styles that resonate with
   subaltern populations and encourage social movement participation in the
   face of state repression and neoliberal policy implementation.},

Title = {When the Rich Get Richer: Class, Globalization, and the Sociotropic
   Determinants of Populism},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {Globalization is frequently linked to populism in advanced industrial
   societies, yet scholars have found little evidence for a direct
   connection between citizens' personal economic fortunes and populist
   beliefs. We draw on the sociotropic tradition to argue that beliefs
   about how the global economy differently affects groups in society link
   globalization to populism and its component elements-anti-elitism,
   people-centrism, and demand for popular sovereignty. Data from an
   original survey of US residents support our argument that beliefs about
   whether wealthy Americans have gained from globalization-the rich
   getting richer-correlate with populist attitudes. This pattern holds
   while adjusting for a broad range of pocketbook measures and the
   nativist attitudes associated with right-wing populism. Results from a
   pre-registered experiment further show that exposure to an article about
   globalization enriching Davos billionaires increases two of three
   populist beliefs, lending causal leverage to our empirical tests. Our
   results emphasize the class dynamics created by outside financial
   forces, rather than the effects on the country as a whole, suggesting
   that international relations (IR) scholars gain important insights by
   accounting for globalization's uneven effects. Perceptions about
   globalization inform attitudes about politics in general, a layer deeper
   than foreign economic policy preferences.
   Con frecuencia, se tiende a vincular la globalizacion con el populismo
   en las sociedades industriales avanzadas. Sin embargo, los academicos
   han encontrado pocas evidencias de que exista una conexion directa entre
   las fortunas economicas personales de los ciudadanos y las creencias
   populistas. Partimos de la tradicion sociotropica con el fin de
   argumentar que las creencias acerca de como la economia global afecta a
   los grupos de la sociedad establecen un vinculo diferente entre la
   globalizacion con el populismo y con los elementos que lo componen:
   antielitismo, pueblo-centrismo y demanda de soberania popular. Los datos
   obtenidos de una encuesta original llevada a cabo entre residentes en
   los EE. UU. respaldan nuestro argumento de que las creencias de que los
   estadounidenses ricos se han beneficiado de la globalizacion (es decir,
   que los ricos se han hecho mas ricos) se correlacionan con actitudes
   populistas. Este patron se mantiene cuando se llevan a cabo ajustes en
   forma de una amplia gama de medidas que afectan a los bolsillos y las
   actitudes nativistas asociadas con el populismo de derecha. Los
   resultados obtenidos de un experimento pre-registrado muestran, ademas,
   que la exposicion a un articulo que muestra que la globalizacion
   enriquece a los multimillonarios de Davos provoca un aumento en dos de
   las tres creencias populistas, creando una influencia causal para
   nuestras pruebas empiricas. Nuestros resultados enfatizan las dinamicas
   de clase creadas por fuerzas financieras externas, en lugar de enfatizar
   los efectos sobre el pais en su conjunto, lo que sugiere que los
   academicos en el campo de las RRII obtendrian informacion importante al
   tener en cuenta los efectos desiguales de la globalizacion. Las
   percepciones sobre la globalizacion proporcionan informacion relativa a
   las actitudes sobre la politica en general, que es un nivel mas profundo
   que las preferencias en materia de politica economica exterior.
   Bien que la mondialisation soit souvent mise en relation avec le
   populisme dans les societes industrielles avancees, les chercheurs n'ont
   trouve que peu d'elements pour venir etayer une relation directe entre
   la fortune economique personnelle des citoyens et leurs croyances
   populistes. Nous nous basons sur la tradition sociotropique pour
   affirmer que les croyances quant aux effets de l'economie mondiale sur
   les groupes d'une societe relient differemment la mondialisation au
   populisme et a ses composantes (anti-elitisme, populo-centrisme et
   demande de souverainete populaire). Des donnees d'un sondage original
   aupres de residents des etats-Unis viennent etayer notre argument, a
   savoir que les croyances concernant les riches Americains qui profitent
   de la mondialisation (les riches qui s'enrichissent) ou non sont liees
   aux attitudes populistes. Ce schema reste pertinent quand on prend en
   compte un large eventail de mesures de portefeuille et les attitudes
   nativistes associees au populisme de droite. Les resultats d'une
   experience prealable montrent en outre que l'exposition a un article
   concernant la mondialisation qui enrichit les milliardaires de Davos
   accentue deux croyances populistes sur trois, ce qui vient renforcer le
   poids causal de nos tests empiriques. Nos resultats soulignent la
   dynamique de classe creee par les forces financieres externes, plutot
   que les effets sur le pays au sens large, et donc suggerent que les
   chercheurs en RI obtiennent d'importants renseignements en prenant en
   compte les effets inegaux de la mondialisation. Les points de vue sur la
   mondialisation renseignent les attitudes concernant la politique de
   maniere generale, a un degre plus eleve que les preferences en matiere
   de politique economique etrangere.},

Abstract = {Administrative burdens appear to influence citizens' perceptions of
   welfare policies and attitudes toward beneficiaries. However, empirical
   evidence that has disentangled different state actions' effects on
   policy perceptions is scarce. We applied a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial survey
   experiment and manipulated the conceptually distinct state actions
   implemented in German unemployment benefits. We investigated whether and
   how exposure to learning demands, compliance demands, and sanctions
   affected citizens' prejudices against beneficiaries, policy support, and
   perceived legitimacy. The results from a sample of 1602 German citizens
   indicate that those confronted with program sanctions exhibit less
   policy support and expect higher policy spending. Similarly, sanctions
   decreased the Federal Employment Agency's perceived legitimacy. These
   results have implications for administrative burden and policy feedback
   research. Distinguishing different state actions provides nuances to
   assess policy feedback effects. Practitioners should consider whether
   program sanctions are necessary because they evoke unintended policy
   feedback effects.},

Abstract = {Political parties use participatory practices to connect with their
   members and with the broader electorate. While substantial research
   indicates how people get involved, very little is known about why
   political parties use participatory practices. The present article
   addresses this gap in the literature and seeks to identify the reasons
   parties do so. We elaborate an analytical framework that includes three
   main categories of explanations: party characteristics, internal
   dynamics, and external dynamics. Our analysis focuses on Hungary,
   explores party statutes and manifestos, and relies on 26 semi-structured
   interviews with party elites from ten political parties. The findings
   indicate that parties have several purposes in mind, which vary across
   parties, that are often linked to broader concerns about citizen
   engagement and to attempts to give members a voice in internal and
   external decision-making processes.},

Abstract = {When European nationals left to join Islamic State, the media
   extensively reported on many of these individuals. Women's news coverage
   had a recurrent narrative-the ``jihadi bride.{''} Academic research has
   strived to analyse the nature of this coverage, effectively critiquing
   the narrative. Male jihadists have received limited attention in
   research on the roles of gender and media. This article seeks to
   contribute to a gap in knowledge concerning the comparative aspects of
   gendered representations by evaluating the differences between male and
   female news media coverage of two high-profile cases: the British woman
   Shamima Begum and the German man Denis Cuspert. Key findings show that
   Begum is primarily framed as a reject of British society and a ``doubly
   deviant{''} woman. Cuspert is portrayed as radical, charismatic, active,
   and influential over youth. While aligning with previous research on
   gendered media tropes, this study advances knowledge by demonstrating
   how each individual's framing does not merely emphasise gendered
   personality traits but also connects to broader societal and political
   factors in domestic contemporary cultural settings.},

Abstract = {This briefing explores the strategies deployed by informal workers in
   Harare during Zimbabwe's Covid-19 lockdown period. It argues that
   informal workers responded to the lockdown regulations by embracing
   survival and accumulation strategies which had broader implications for
   the African continent by ultimately shaping patterns of public health,
   inequality, authoritarianism and corruption. The briefing provides an
   example of the consequences when African states unthinkingly imposed
   unsolicited Covid-19 restrictions that had the unintended effect of
   devastating a vital part of their economy and with it, the livelihoods
   of the poorest majority.},

Title = {When the digits don't add up: Research strategies for post-digital
   peacebuilding},
Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Pages = {425-446},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article develops a post-digital perspective for the study of
   international peacebuilding and elaborates its merits. Contrary to
   narratives in policy and practice that tend to fetishize the digital,
   digital peacebuilding cannot be meaningfully separated from
   peacebuilding before digitalization. Resisting the call for a ``digital
   turn,{''} a post-digital lens helps to research, rewrite, and rework the
   digital while simultaneously staying with and moving beyond
   digitalization. It aims to demystify the role of digital technologies
   while enabling critical scrutiny of their impact on contemporary and
   future peacebuilding. More specifically, the post-digital helps us to
   (1) establish a critical distance to narratives of fast-paced innovation
   and progress that fetishize the digital, (2) scrutinize how
   digitalization compounds contemporary approaches and constellations of
   peacebuilding, (3) engage with the uneven temporalities of digital
   peacebuilding and its diverse global manifestations, (4) shed light on
   its real, embodied, and tangible effects on conflict-affected
   populations, (5) hold digitalization accountable by unearthing
   disillusionments and failures, (6) re-adjust our focus on human agency
   in the development and use of the socio-technical systems that
   constitute digital peacebuilding, (7) and finally, take a rhizomatic
   view that is concerned with how power relations make and break
   digitalized peacebuilding networks.},

Abstract = {Extending previous works on major changes in policy advisory systems
   (PASs), such as externalization (locus) and politicization (government
   control), this study examines whether and how democratization
   (citizensourcing) of PASs works based on the case of the Kwanghwamun
   Citizensourcing Policy Platform, which operated for 4 years under the
   Moon Jae-in administration in South Korea. Analyzing more than 11,000
   policy suggestions proposed by ordinary citizens on the digital policy
   platform, this study investigates how citizensourced policy ideas are
   discussed, incubated, and finally adopted through interactions among
   ordinary citizens, policy experts, and government agencies. Based on the
   belief that the operation of PASs becomes increasingly complicated and
   often dysfunctional as societies face more ``wicked{''}, cross-cutting,
   and volatile policy problems than ever, this study argues that
   citizensourcing policymaking is critical to ensuring policy legitimacy
   and receptivity. This study suggests that both the quality and features
   of citizensourced policy ideas are important for advancing policymaking
   processes. This study also finds that political cycle and active citizen
   policy entrepreneurs are also critical factors, while it shows
   noteworthy limits on the quality and features of citizensourced policy
   ideas, which, in fact, lead to a frustratingly low policy adoption rate.
   This study suggests that governments need to actively capitalize on the
   power of ordinary citizens as citizen experts, while the shortcomings
   and risks of citizensourcing PASs also need to be carefully addressed.},

Abstract = {Questioning mechanisms such as Prime Minister's Questions in the United
   Kingdom and Question Time in Australia are notoriously adversarial. Much
   less is known about whether and how questioning facilitates conflict in
   other legislatures. This question is particularly important given the
   criticism that excessive adversarialism may hinder the performance of
   accountability, and hence may be detrimental to the work of
   legislatures. Building on legislative studies literature, this article
   presents the first comparative study of conflict in oral parliamentary
   questions; in so doing, it explores patterns of conflictual remarks in
   questions addressed to prime ministers in Canada, Australia, the United
   Kingdom and Ireland. It posits that institutional culture, party
   discipline, government and opposition status and the authority of the
   Speaker are key factors in explaining the performance of conflict, and
   that rules of procedure alone are not enough to curb the manifestation
   of conflict in legislatures where questioning is a known opportunity for
   criticism.},

Title = {Sourcing and Bias in the Study of Coups: Lessons from the Middle East},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {The last two decades have seen an increased focus on reporting bias in
   large-N datasets. Research on coups d'etat has similarly increased given
   the availability of coup datasets. This essay argues that while the
   availability of such data has pushed scholarship forward, the data
   collection process behind these efforts remains plagued with limitations
   common to event datasets. Rather than building on what previous projects
   have accomplished, researchers have invariably developed ``new{''}
   datasets that suffer from the same problems as earlier efforts.
   Specifically, we point to reliance on international news sources such as
   The New York Time and Keesing's Record of World Events - without the
   adequate consultation of regional sources and expertise - as a source of
   concern. We explore this issue by assessing the coverage of coup events
   from three country cases from the post-colonial Middle East: Syria,
   Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. Our findings show that while existing data on
   successful and failed coups are largely adequate, scholars interested in
   coup plots and rumors will require a wider breadth of source material to
   identify such cases.},

Abstract = {Neighborhood governance has been the center of attention in urban
   politics and public policy for many decades. Although wide-ranging
   literature explores the favorable effects of public participation on
   neighborhood governance, it is only relatively recently that attention
   has been directed to the manner in which effective participation
   develops and the consequent implications for participatory democracy.
   This article examines how local states encourage public participation in
   neighborhood governance using social networks in contemporary China.
   Based on a case study of the Minor Facts program, our findings
   demonstrate that even when participation mechanisms are introduced by
   the Party, horizontal networks also play a role in participation.
   Moreover, we present two forms of social networks and their mechanisms
   to illustrate how local states strategically mobilize them. These social
   networks also increase the social status and moral authority of Party
   members and political elites in ways they find useful for strengthening
   local government capacity to ensure political compliance. This article
   provides an important qualitative insight into network-related
   activators of participatory behaviors in the community.},

Abstract = {Several studies have found restrictions on minority faith-based
   communities to be related to the onset of violent religious hostilities.
   Absent from this work, though, is a consideration of the fact that
   minority religious discrimination can take different forms, and,
   consequently, may encourage violence in different ways. This paper seeks
   to fill this void by examining different forms of minority religious
   restrictions and their relationship to religious violence. Specifically,
   we analyze the comparative strength of three basic types of religious
   discrimination-restrictions on minority religious practices,
   restrictions on minority religious institutions, and restrictions on
   conversion and proselytizing-on violence carried out by both religious
   majority groups and religious minority groups. Interestingly, our
   analysis shows all three forms of restrictions encourage violence from
   religious majorities, but not from minorities. We supplement the
   statistical analysis with a case study of faith-based discrimination and
   violent religious hostilities in India.},

Abstract = {The paper begins with praise of Watson's historical work and goes on to
   criticize it for downplaying the agency of agents other than European
   great powers and the USA. The key point here is that entrants from
   Europe's periphery and beyond were not only `expanded upon' by a growing
   international system but came to it with their own experiences of having
   been part of other systems. The historic memories of life before entry
   were kept alive by mnemonic techniques that also changed as a result of
   interaction with other members of the system. What ensued was not an
   effortless expansion of the international system, but a meeting of
   cultures that may be conceptualized as the intertwining of different
   narrative sociabilities emanating from different memories. This matters
   today, for entrants like China and Russia preserve memories of previous
   experiences, and these memories inform how these states read ongoing
   political developments.},

   Design/methodology/approachFour machine learning techniques (Naive
   Bayes, decision tree, logistic regression and ensemble learning) were
   used to develop a prediction model for NVWB of employees. Also, 10-fold
   cross-validation method was used to validate the NVWB prediction models.
   The confusion matrix is used to derive various performance matrices to
   express the predictive capability of NVWB models quantitatively.
   FindingsThe model developed using random forest technique was identified
   as best NVWB prediction model, as it resulted in highest true positive
   rate and true negative rate, thereby resulting in the highest geometric
   mean, balance and area under receiver operator characteristics curve.
   Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of
   the pioneer studies that used machine learning techniques to develop a
   predictive model of NVBW.},

Abstract = {Canadian charities have a history of advocating for social and policy
   change. With the 1985 Income Tax Act, charities became restricted to
   using up to 10\% of their resources toward nonpartisan political
   activities. They subsequently underwent an audit initiated by Prime
   Minister Stephen Harper in 2012. The legal climate changed again when
   the 10\% rule was dropped in 2018, enabling charities to pursue
   political activities with no predefined limit. In this article, we
   examine grey literature on the political advocacy `situation' of
   charities between 1983 and 2021, guided by Adele Clarke's situational
   analysis methodology (2005). Our findings and discussion center around
   the prevalent discursive positions taken and not taken in the situation
   and the assumptions and rationalities that inform them. We explore what
   turns out to be a non-linear situation influenced by an assemblage of
   rationalities and practices that primarily foster distrust in the
   charitable sector and call for enhanced discipline-oriented regulation.
   Particular attention is paid to the neoliberal logics that underlie
   these positions. Alternative conceptualizations of charitable sector
   advocacy are also offered through appeals to democratic participation
   and freedom of expression.},

Abstract = {From the October 2018 mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in
   Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to the April 2022 bombing of the Sufi Khalifa
   Sahib mosque in Kabul, Afghanistan, religious minority sacred spaces are
   a conspicuous target of societal violence. While the potency of these
   attacks as instruments of symbolic and physical intimidation against
   vulnerable communities is well-recognized, comparatively little research
   has examined the larger societal and political forces that motivate
   them, particularly outside conflict zones. Employing data on individual
   religious minorities in 162 states from 1991-2014, we conduct
   quantitative analyses demonstrating that severe violence against
   religious minority sacred spaces is significantly correlated with
   increasing regime instability, particularly in more democratic states
   that strongly support religious institutions. Our findings suggest that
   the most violent outcomes tend to be diversionary, redirecting public
   anger toward internal `enemy' others, rather than reactionary or
   retaliatory behavior toward already persecuted or genuinely threatening
   out-groups.},

Abstract = {Party member mobilization is part of a modern election campaign, just
   like social media are. This article enhances prior research on the
   strategic inclusion of grassroots campaigning from a top down
   perspective by adding insights from the individual perspective of the
   rank-and-file party members. Evidence is built from a party member panel
   survey conducted among four German parties: CDU, SPD, Bundnis 90/Die
   Grunen and Die Linke. Based on quantitative data analyses, first, the
   article scrutinizes the share of online campaigners among members and
   the importance of digital campaigning for the toolbox of electioneering.
   Social media are essential campaign tools even if only about half of
   campaigners actively participates in such activities. Still, only a
   small group of campaigners categorically rules out engaging via social
   platforms. Secondly, the article analyzes which groups of members are
   more likely to participate in social media campaigning, showing that
   higher age, being male and holding a university degree is associated
   with a lower probability to participate in such activities.
   Additionally, these newer forms of campaigning are rather used by highly
   engaged members who are familiar with party routines. Hence, social
   media campaigning requires skills and resources, despite its flexibility
   and accessibility.},

Abstract = {So far, interest in policy and political sciences has mostly centered
   around the varieties of policy advisory systems (PASs) and knowledge
   regimes in consolidated democracies rather than in consolidated
   autocracies, which largely remain as black boxes. Drawing on a hybrid
   literature review, this article aims to fill this gap. It reviews
   selected articles published between 1992 and February 2023 in the
   Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge Social Science Citation Index database
   to not only to reveal the current state of empirical and theoretical
   knowledge and persistent knowledge gaps but also to offer an integration
   of the literature that leads to a preliminary conceptual framework in
   this emerging topic. In doing so, it contributes to the body of
   knowledge on this topic in three main ways. First, it provides a
   comprehensive review of PASs in consolidated autocracies to identify the
   central features of policy knowledge production within and across
   autocracies. Second, it proposes ``the vicious circle of authoritarian
   PAS and knowledge regime{''} as a conceptual approach. In doing so, it
   takes a modest step toward a holistic conceptualization and synthesis of
   this literature to date. Third, it establishes connections between
   fragmented literature studies; identifies theoretical, conceptual,
   empirical, and methodological gaps; and proposes suggestions concerning
   promising paths for future research.},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of Russian officials, servicemen,
   veterans, and paramilitary organisations in coordinating patriotic
   education programmes in the Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples' Republics
   (DNR/LNR) since 2014. Three complementary objectives underpin these
   programmes: first, indoctrinating youth to a worldview which promotes
   cultural assimilation into Russian society and denigrates Ukrainian
   statehood and identity; second, shoring up de facto authorities'
   legitimacy by glorifying the DNR/LNR as fully-fledged states requiring
   protection from Ukraine and destined to be `reunited' with Russia;
   third, building a training and recruitment mechanism to fill the ranks
   of `republican' but also Russian military and security structures.},

Abstract = {How do national role conceptions (NRCs) of domestic institutional actors
   change in response to external and internal shocks? Using role theory in
   foreign policy analysis, this article explores how bureaucratic agencies
   and political parties in Georgia respond to shocks, such as the 2008
   Russo-Georgian War and changes in political leadership. Content analysis
   of 18 hand-coded documents, including all security, military, and
   foreign policy strategies as well as ten party manifestos of three
   ruling parties of Georgia, shows that NRCs are modified in response to
   shocks. While bureaucracies are more stable, party responses have varied
   between radicalisation and compensation strategies.},

Abstract = {This article studies the positions of political parties around the rule
   of law crisis in the European Union (EU). What factors explain their
   position in this crisis? The theoretical expectations focus on populism
   and government status as the drivers of party positions towards a Member
   State violating the rule of law. This article assesses these
   expectations through a comparative case study of the actions of
   different EU political parties during the first term of the Law and
   Justice government in Poland (2015-2019). The article examines the
   relevant documents such as debates and resolutions of parliaments within
   the EU. It concludes that populist parties are more likely to support
   the Law and Justice party than mainstream parties, and that parties in
   government are less likely to challenge Law and Justice than opposition
   parties. These findings provide important insights into the dynamics of
   parties' positioning on the rule of law crisis.},

Abstract = {Why do some states allocate more resources to their military than
   others? Governments are likely to perceive acute threats to their
   authority and legitimacy when they face insurgencies in which rebel
   groups earn significant revenues from the exploitation of natural
   resources. In response, governments allocate greater amounts to their
   military budgets. Using data on the exploitation of natural resources by
   rebel groups and defense spending for states around the world, I find
   that states where rebel groups profit from natural resources allocate
   more to their defense budgets than other states. This finding holds even
   after controlling for the presence of civil conflict itself. The study
   suggests that rebel exploitation of resources may have an indirect
   impact on interstate relations: If states indeed face a security
   dilemma, then increased spending resulting from these internal dynamics
   is likely to exacerbate the problem.},

Title = {Aiding War: Foreign Aid and the Intensity of Violent Armed Conflict},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Does foreign aid reduce violence during ongoing wars? In the policy
   community, there has been growing optimism about the prospect for aid to
   improve conflict-affected and fragile areas. We investigate whether
   foreign aid decreases, or even increases, violence during ongoing armed
   conflict. We advance a theoretical argument that concentrated foreign
   assistance allocated during ongoing armed conflicts increases military
   fatalities but decreases civilian fatalities. Using geographically coded
   data on all sub-Saharan African countries in conflict between 1989 and
   2008, within a matching frontier design and supplemented by instrumental
   variable analysis, we find strong substantive and statistical support
   for our expectations about military conflict intensity though less
   support for the expectations about civilian fatalities. The paper
   provides novel insights about the effects of concentrated aid on
   military versus civilian conflict intensity, characterizes the effects
   at a sub-national level, and expands the spatial-temporal period of the
   analysis. We also probe the plausibility of the causal mechanism using
   interview evidence drawn from ex-commanders of the Lord's Resistance
   Army and generals of the Ugandan People's Defence Forces in northern
   Uganda. The paper offers both academic and policy insights, including
   that foreign aid allocated during ongoing wars may be more problematic
   than it is helpful.},

Abstract = {The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was intended to reduce inequalities in
   access to healthcare resources. However, a 2012 Supreme Court decision
   allowed states to opt out of a key component of the policy, leading to
   even greater variation in Medicaid's implementation. Using this
   variation, we estimate the effect of the ACA Medicaid expansion and
   racial dynamics on federal Medicaid-CHIP transfers received by states at
   the county level. To do so, we use a difference-in-differences
   specification and allow the expansion effect to vary across counties
   with different population shares of Black Americans. We find that
   Medicaid expansion increases the funds that are sent to counties, but
   additional analyses show that the racial demographics of a county also
   serve to influence how federal resources are apportioned. Specifically,
   the analyses reveal a curvilinear relationship between the proportion of
   Black residents and the dispersal of funds.},

Abstract = {Stakeholder theory has been widely studied and used in private companies
   because of its potential to achieve satisfactory organizational outcomes
   and create sustainable value among different stakeholder groups.
   However, the stakeholder theory principles still need to be consolidated
   in the public administration field. To advance this discussion, this
   study undertook a bibliometric analysis to collect, analyze, and
   synthesize the research that had already been developed in this regard.
   We analyzed 1805 articles published between 1982 and 2021. Our findings
   show that even though some ideas of stakeholder theory seem to be
   associated with important topics in the public administration field,
   such as participation and governance, some of the central principles of
   stakeholder theory have still not been explored in depth in studies of
   the public sector. A proposed research agenda indicates the need for
   stakeholder management theories and their interaction with public value,
   performance, sustainability and innovation.},

Abstract = {There can be no doubt that the intensification and expansion of Russian
   military operations on Ukrainian territory, with the assistance of
   Belarus, since February 24, 2022, constitute a flagrant violation of the
   United Nations Charter, Article 2 4 of which prohibits States from
   resorting to the threat or use of force in their international
   relations. It may seem particularly worrying to see the principles of
   international law disregarded in this way, especially when such
   fundamental principles as the prohibition on the use of force by States
   and its corollary, the prohibition on the acquisition of territory by
   force, are involved. While it is undeniable that international law has
   been flouted, it is not so obvious that this is a sign of its weakening
   or loss of authority.},

Title = {Implementers' work autonomy preferences under pay-for-performance

Journal = {GLOBAL PUBLIC POLICY AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {137-159},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite the highlighted positive effects of work autonomy, little is
   known about what drives street-level bureaucrats' (SLBs') work autonomy
   preferences. We propose a combined framework that applies insights from
   Pay-for-Performance and Prospect Theory to examine whether incentive
   type (monetary sanctions vs. bonus) and framing of sanctions (negative
   vs. positive) influence SLBs' job autonomy preferences. We use data from
   a survey experiment of 208 healthcare SLBs. Bureaucrats were told their
   employers were required to monthly post their performance information,
   and then bureaucrats were assigned to one of four possible treatment
   groups in which we manipulated: (1) incentive type to boost performance
   (monetary sanction vs. financial bonus), and (2) the framing of monetary
   sanctions (positive vs. negative). Results report no framing effects and
   general preference for partial work autonomy. However, the larger the
   potential monetary bonus, the more likely SLBs opt for preferring full
   work autonomy. Findings offer practical implications for managers'
   approach to encourage bureaucratic behavior.},

Title = {Blaming it on NATO? Framing the role of NATO in the full-scale Russian
   invasion of Ukraine on Twitter},

Abstract = {IntroductionSince social media has become a significant tool for
   conflict communication amid the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine,
   researchers have grown more interested in the digital content citizens
   are exposed to. MethodsTo further investigate the role of social media
   in the ongoing invasion, we conducted a manual content analysis to
   examine tweets in English, Russian, and German that explicitly mentioned
   NATO in the context of the full-scale invasion during February to May
   2022. Our analysis explored how these language-specific Twitter
   communities framed NATO's role in the conflict. ResultsWe found that
   English-speaking tweeters were more likely to hold NATO responsible for
   finding a solution and least likely to blame NATO for the war compared
   to German and Russian speakers. We also observed that the
   Russian-speaking Twitter community exhibits a comparatively lower
   tendency to hold NATO accountable for the ongoing war as compared to
   their German-speaking counterparts, and they are also notably the least
   likely to expect NATO to bring an end to the war. Finally,
   English-speaking Twitter users who attribute blame to NATO for the
   ongoing war tend to adhere to a preconceived notion, rather than
   arriving at an interpretation based on the situation at hand. This is in
   contrast to the Russian-speaking community, where the opposite is true.
   German-speaking users fall somewhere in between these two perspectives.
   DiscussionOur research contributes to the literature by providing a
   novel integration of conceptual and methodological perspectives on the
   framing and stance-taking of social media users during wartime,
   addressing known research gaps in the comparative analysis of these
   discussions, i.e., adding ``non-English{''} perspectives. It also
   highlights the importance of cultural and linguistic sensitivity when
   addressing responsibility in armed conflicts and the need to consider
   the diverse perspectives derived from divergent problem definitions and
   evaluative standards.},

Abstract = {This paper first introduces a theoretical formalization connecting a
   polity's income level to terrorism. Our framework can accommodate
   different underlying assumptions about individual- and society-level
   grievances, yielding competing hypotheses. We then construct a panel
   database to study terrorism for 1527 subnational regions in 75 countries
   between 1970 and 2014. Results consistently imply an inverted U-shape
   that remains robust to incorporating a comprehensive set of region-level
   covariates, region- and time-fixed effects, as well as estimating an
   array of alternative specifications. The threat of terrorism
   systematically rises as low-income polities become richer, peaking at
   GDP/capita levels of approximate to US\$12,800 (in constant 2005 PPP
   US\$), but then falls consistently above that level. This pattern
   emerges for domestic and transnational terrorism alike. While peaks
   differ by perpetrator ideology, the inverted U shape also prevails
   across ideology-specific subsamples. In sum, alleviating poverty may
   first exacerbate terrorism, contrary to much of the proposed recipes
   advocated since 9/11.},

Abstract = {There is a large and growing literature on the potential use of policy
   instruments for stimulating the adoption of Climate-Smart Agriculture
   (CSA) practices amongst smallholders. The objective of this article is
   to review and understand how the array of potential policy incentives
   can serve as mechanisms for enhancing adoption and upscaling of
   potential CSA practices by small-scale farmers in low-income countries.
   The review follows a matrix approach capturing where specific CSA
   practices (rows) are supported by typical policy instruments (columns)
   for enhancing widespread adoption. We first identify six key CSA
   practices, namely water management, soil and nutrient management, crop
   tolerance to stress, agroforestry and intercropping, crop rotation and
   mixed systems, and pest and disease management. Then we discuss the
   impact of those typical policy instruments, namely market prices, taxes
   and subsidies, land rights, rural finance, training and information, and
   certification and labeling. The review finds that most studies on this
   subject have a rather narrow focus on functional properties of a
   specific policy instrument and a particular CSA practice, thereby
   ignoring substitution, complementary or conditional effects between
   policy measures and CSA practices. Consequently, previous studies
   identify few incentives, particularly effective on their own. Wider
   perspectives on impact pathways point to the importance of sequencing
   and scaling for enhancing farmers' CSA adoption. We therefore advocate
   for more integrated approaches that also consider indirect effects of
   policy instruments on CSA adoption and pursue their systematic anchoring
   through successful policies that enhance widespread adoption.},

Abstract = {Ireland's emergence as a European hub for ICT and pharmaceutical
   multinationals highlights the growing tension between spatially
   dispersed economic activity and the nation-centered measures used to
   monitor it. While `big tech' and `big pharma' are often praised as
   powerful growth engines, their real contribution to the Irish economy
   remains unclear, as corporate tax avoidance artificially inflates
   statistics. By moving around intellectual property assets or engaging in
   factoryless manufacturing, firms go out of their way to book their
   profits in low-tax jurisdictions. Their products show up in Irish GDP
   and export figures, often without employing any Irish labour or capital
   in the production process. This article uses a novel empirical approach
   to distinguish job-sustaining economic activity from accounting fiction.
   By contrasting traditional measures of economic growth on a sectoral
   level with the growth of employment and earnings, it identifies sectors
   with sudden discrepancies that are indicative signs of fictitious
   activity. Discrepancies cluster in the industries dominated by US-based
   multinationals.},

Abstract = {In spring 2023, Germany presented its first National Security Strategy.
   A remarkably clear document by German standards, it reflects the fact
   that the Zeitenwende (turning point) precipitated by the Russian
   invasion of Ukraine has already taken place in the minds of German
   policymakers and the German people, and signals a militarily stronger
   and politically more realistic Germany in the future. The protection of
   Germany and its allies tops the list of security-policy interests. Next
   comes strengthening European Union and NATO partnerships, as well as
   bilateral ones with France and the United States. Russia is seen as an
   imminent threat, and the West's rivalry with China is considered a major
   challenge. The Bundeswehr is framed as the core security-policy
   instrument for countering threats and as the guarantor of Germany's
   deterrence and defence capabilities. The document also explicitly
   enshrines the 2\%-of-GDP target for defence spending.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {37-66},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {For almost a century, enemies have tended to see the United States as a
   `paper tiger' that is materially strong but also beatable in war because
   Americans have no stomach for the fight. Adversaries recognise US
   industrial and technological might but conclude that because the
   American public is casualty averse and US soldiers have weak morale,
   they can overcome the Americans with a long-war strategy. Four factors
   are likely to play a role in encouraging states to view the US in this
   way: rhetoric, rationalism, psychology and ideology. The paper-tiger
   image is significant because it can influence both the enemy's decision
   to fight and its strategy, and offers insights into emerging threats,
   including that from China.},

Abstract = {Contemporary governments face dwindling resources and populations who
   feel disconnected from political systems. In response, both governments
   and scholars increasingly explore more participative governance
   approaches. Such efforts have coalesced around `co-creation', a way of
   governing through collaboration between public and private actors, often
   including citizens. Increasingly, scholars emphasise `co-creation
   platforms': devices that use reconfigurable structures and resources to
   facilitate multiple instances of co-creation. By creating platforms,
   advocates claim, governments can facilitate widespread co-creation
   without unfeasible costs. Some even encourage governments to adopt
   platform-creation as their way of governing - so-called `generative
   governance'. Yet, with governments being time-and cash-poor, they cannot
   participate in every such co-creation initiative themselves. To realise
   the promise of generative governance, platforms must enable governments
   to facilitate co-creation initiatives at arm's length. While, however,
   research suggests that governments can be successful platform-users, we
   know little about how successfully they can forge platforms to encourage
   co-creation among others. Consequently, we conducted a nested case study
   of the creation and use of one novel platform: London Borough of
   Culture. Theorised through literatures on platforms, and co-creation's
   drivers and inhibitors, our findings affirm that platforms can
   facilitate co-creation. However, they also uncover how platforms
   fashioned by politically-led organisations become entangled in political
   dynamics that inhibit co-creation. Two contributions follow: first,
   platforms made by politically-led bodies enable, but simultaneously
   constrain, others' co-creation; second, drivers and inhibitors of
   co-creation can be strategically shaped by interventions (for example,
   platforms) to maximise the chances of that co-creation succeeding.},

Abstract = {Do seniors have different public spending preferences than younger
   people? The literature on this topic has been limited so far to a few
   policies or to short periods of time, which makes it difficult to
   provide a comprehensive answer to this question. Using data from
   Canadian surveys conducted between 1987 and 2019 and covering fifteen
   policies, this paper shows that seniors, as compared to younger adults,
   are slightly more favourable to the status quo when it comes to
   government spending. Results also show that support for education
   spending decreases extensively over the life cycle, while support for
   environment spending decreases until middle age, then stabilizes. In
   contrast, support for transportation spending is more widespread in
   older age, while support for elderly services takes an inverted U-shape
   over the life cycle. These findings broaden our understanding of the
   influence of age on government spending preferences and allow us to
   reflect on the consequences of a growing senior electorate on government
   budgets.},

Abstract = {Networks are increasingly seen as promising generic solutions to complex
   public problems. This article analyzes network-building in action within
   a specific regional setting as an attempt to cope with increasing and
   varied demands for older person care, studying everyday organizational
   and policy activities of actors. Drawing on a qualitative in-depth case
   study of a regional network in Zeeland-the most aging region in the
   Netherlands-our findings illuminate how this network is created,
   nurtured, and sustained, and the particularities and complexities this
   involves. Our practice-based approach demonstrates that network-building
   requires the ongoing work of many agents within organizational contexts,
   as well as the outside interference of stakeholders to make the network
   ``work{''} within the wider population of networks, institutional
   context, and geographical place. This highlights to network literature
   the importance of place-based interventions that characterize how a
   network develops and pursues opportunities to come up with suitable
   responses to local needs.},

Abstract = {Crowdfunding and micro-donations for funding political campaigns have
   been extensively studied, especially in the US. However, digital
   participatory financing in Europe, with a different regulatory context
   and relevant public funding, has been investigated less. This article
   analyses the effects of an innovative and digital-native electoral
   campaign financing tool: the microcredit. Microcredits consist of small
   ``civil loans{''} that a political party requests from sympathizers to
   finance the party's electoral campaign. Based on the case study of the
   Spanish party Podemos - the first one to implement it - for the period
   of 2015-2021, we use official data and party documents to explore the
   consequences of microcredit. We argue, first, that microcredits (and
   party financing) should be considered another way to differentiate
   challenger parties from traditional ones. Second, there is a link
   between the number and amount of microcredits and the political context,
   not limited to good electoral expectations but also to the polarized
   political context. Third, microcredits change the structure of campaign
   funding. Finally, we point out a regulation problem that may deter other
   parties from adopting this mechanism and present different legal
   problems (monitoring, data protection, or potential corruption), showing
   the regulatory issues for adapting to the digitalization of politics.},

Abstract = {This article explores how rebels use a combination of physical control
   and legal claims to ownership in governing natural resources. Most
   scholars focus on plunder, how rebels physically acquire resource. But
   rebel governance of resources involves more than just force and fraud.
   Claims to ownership constrain rebels' ability to convey resources into
   global markets and strengthen rebels' assertions of legitimacy. Still,
   not every group possessing resources claims to own them and not every
   rebel group claiming ownership possesses resources. Belligerents
   leverage de facto control over resources to bolster their claim to
   sovereignty and use legal standing to gain control over resource-rich
   territories. The paper typologizes four distinctive forms of rebel
   resource governance: disorganized crime; organized crime; shadow
   resource governance; and rebelocratic resource governance. Case studies
   illustrate each subtype. The typology suggests new hypotheses about the
   origins of rebel governance and the impact of these forms on conflict
   dynamics.},

Abstract = {Prior to COVID-19, migrant journeys through the Mediterranean were often
   described with reference to the barriers posed within `fortress Europe'
   or through registers which centre migrant's adeptness at navigating
   draconian immigration regimes. Between these two contexts, this paper
   explores how a public authority lens can assist in understanding the
   implications of COVID-19 and associated vaccine bureaucracies. We draw
   on ethnographic research on the Italian-French Alpine border and chart
   how `vaccine populism'-perpetuated in nationalist political discourse as
   well as in the counter-commentaries of resistance offered by solidarity
   networks-has specific implications for migrants' access to vaccines and
   health information. We argue that analyses attentive to the subtle
   nuances of state and local politics provide an important entry point to
   map multi-scalar power dynamics which accompany universal health
   policies. Through considering the complex realities relating to Alpine
   crossings, we advocate from less categorising approaches to vaccinating
   migrants.},

Abstract = {This article argues that to better understand the evolution of EU-Africa
   relations it is necessary to decentre the EU's external action and
   concurrently recentre Africa's international agency, while also
   interrogating the rise of new powers in Africa. Decentring Europe and
   recentring Africa means challenging the assumptions that Africa needs
   Europe more than Europe needs Africa and that African states should
   align with the EU in international settings in defence of the existing
   global order. By provincializing the EU and engaging extensively with
   African voices, this article uses the Russo-Ukrainian conflict to unpack
   key divides between the EU and Africa on whether and how to isolate
   Russia, explore its consequences for food security in Africa, and expose
   some contradictions in the EU's energy policy. It concludes that
   reconstruction in EU-Africa relations means that the EU should make
   grounded efforts to treat Africa as a true partner, not an afterthought.},

Abstract = {Kidnapping is a common tactic used by insurgent groups. However, why
   insurgents commit kidnappings remains insufficiently understood. Based
   on 1,386 group-year observations of 140 insurgents between 1998 and
   2012, we analyze conditions driving the within-group temporal changes in
   their involvement (1 vs 0) versus event-frequency in kidnappings. We
   find that changes in specific quasi-state activities (i.e., extraction
   and provision of public services), which may rely on kidnappings for
   coercive enforcement and social control, predict kidnapping
   ``involvement{''} only. Meanwhile, general resource and capacity
   conditions (i.e., territory-control, criminal networks and
   combat-lethality) influence changes in both kidnapping involvement and
   event-frequency.},

Abstract = {The freedom of religion or belief is internationally recognized.
   However, studies demonstrate that the implementation of the right to
   apostasy, an essential aspect of this freedom, encounters difficulties
   in state practices. Doctrinal and historical research is conducted
   regarding the UN legal documents and the drafting history in order to
   demonstrate that the phrasing of the freedom to change religion in the
   provisions has been gradually altered since the legal establishment in
   1948. Within the UN, member states have succeeded in changing the
   provisions, resulting in conceptual ambiguity regarding the right to
   apostasy. It is a matter of concern that there is little recognition,
   within the UN and in academia, of the fact that the explicit right to
   apostasy has been disregarded, resulting in diminishing the normative
   force of the religious freedom provision.},

Abstract = {Global governance has been widely embraced as an object of anal-ysis and
   as a way of ``seeing{''} world politics. Yet we still know little about
   how publishing has evolved. This article presents the first systematic
   exploration of these patterns. It uses an original dataset of global
   governance research to answer three first-order questions: How has
   publishing varied over time? What issues have scholars focused on? And
   who has been publishing in the field? The authors found that research
   has grown and become increasingly diverse -but selectively so. Some
   marginalized issues feature more prominently than in the rest of
   international relations, but there are blind spots too. Further, while
   research is less American and women have been comparatively more active
   relative to other areas, geographical diversity remains extremely
   limited. Scholars based in the Global South have been the first authors
   of less than 14\% of all publications. To conclude, the article reflects
   on implications for the field.},

Abstract = {Renewable energy activities have increasingly become the central
   component of China's proposed green Belt and Road Initiative. Yet,
   scaling up these activities requires significant institutional changes
   of the current Chinese state and financial-industrial complex. Informed
   by a conceptual framework that builds on multi-level institutional
   analysis, we assess the institutional challenges constraining the
   scalability of Chinese renewable energy projects in South Africa and
   Ethiopia. Our study reveals that the institutional fragmentation and
   vacuum in China have led to the lack of a clear engagement strategy with
   African markets. In addition, the development of wind and solar energy
   projects in Africa is often taking place amid the ongoing and
   fast-changing energy sector governance, which is not yet appreciated by
   the key Chinese actors. We argue that promoting Chinese-backed renewable
   energy projects in Africa requires new institutional arrangements that
   can adapt to competitive and divergent local market conditions and
   regulatory changes.},

Abstract = {Recent micro-level research on government institutional reform
   emphasizes the importance of taking charge behavior in the context of
   institutional reform. This study constructs a structural equation model
   from survey data of 823 civil servants in Longgang, China, based on the
   theory of planned behavior, to examine the impact of workload and
   non-economic rewards on civil servants' taking charge behaviors in the
   context of institutional reform. Results confirm the difference paths of
   workload and non-economic rewards on taking charge behavior and the
   embeddedness of community mechanisms in government internal governance.
   The findings of this study are theoretically and practically relevant as
   they offer new perspectives into the triggers of continuous reform and
   the psychological mechanisms underlying the effects of workload and
   non-economic rewards on taking charge behavior in the context of
   institutional reform.},

Title = {Five Things We Need to Learn About Incel Extremism: Issues, Challenges
   and Avenues for Fresh Research},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 24},
Abstract = {In recent years research on the involuntarily celibate or ``Incel{''}
   community has contributed a small but significant stock of knowledge
   about toxic varieties of extreme misogyny being shared on lightly
   regulated online communication boards. Simultaneously, we have witnessed
   the potential for Incel ideas to find expression in disturbing outbursts
   of extremist violence. This paper uses existing research to consider
   what we know and what we need to find out about this milieu if we are to
   further our knowledge and understanding. Ultimately, we highlight five
   key questions that need to be investigated more thoroughly and call for
   a wider range of methodological approaches in this endeavor. In
   particular, we argue that there is a need to build stronger connections
   with members of the Incel community in order to pursue a better-crafted
   body of research. While this is challenging, it is necessary if we are
   to gain a sense of how much support there is in Incel communities for
   violence, the role of pornography within the community, the key
   dimensions of Femcel ideology, the connections between Incel ideology
   and extreme right-wing thinking, and the measures that might aid
   deradicalization once an individual has adopted ideas related to
   extremist misogyny. Ultimately, we argue that while certain pieces of
   research are leading the way in contributing fresh thinking and
   innovative methodological approaches, there is much work to be done to
   develop our understanding in these areas of enquiry.},

Title = {Intergenerational transmission of left-right ideology: A question of
   gender and parenting style?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {``Left{''} and ``right{''} are common concepts when it comes to
   describing both political attitudes of citizens and politicians or to
   classifying, for example, parties on the political spectrum. But how do
   political ideological attitudes emerge? One central factor is political
   socialization, in which the family is a key socialization agent.
   However, existing research focuses largely on partisan preferences and
   how they emerge through family political socialization. Nevertheless,
   due to multiparty systems, this concept is less suitable in the European
   context. This paper therefore contributes to filling this research gap
   by looking at the role of the family as a political socialization agent
   in the emergence of political ideological attitudes. Hereby the focus is
   on two key research questions: what difference does the cross-gender
   transmission of left-right ideology make? How does the parenting style
   affect intergenerational transmission? These questions are examined
   using the Cultural Pathways to Economic Self-Sufficiency and
   Entrepreneurship (CUPESSE) dataset, whose structure allows for several
   advances on existing studies. First, it contains a high number of cases
   with more than 4,000 parent-child dyads, which come from a total of 11
   European countries and thus allow a view beyond existing single country
   studies. Furthermore, it contains the classification of the parenting
   style by the children and thus enables analyses based on the perception
   of the recipients of the parenting rather than the parent
   self-assessment. The results of the analysis indicate that existing
   differences in political ideology between parents and children vary for
   cross-gender transmission processes. It also shows that the similarity
   of political ideology between parents and children is influenced by the
   parenting style, such as whether children experienced warmth from their
   parents, support in the pursuit of autonomy, or strong controlling
   behavior.},

Abstract = {Despite claims of a paradigmatic shift toward the increased role of
   networks and partnerships as a form of governance-driven and enabled by
   digital technologies-the relation of ``Networked Governance{''} with the
   pre-existing paradigms of ``Traditional Weberian Public
   Administration{''} and ``New Public Management{''} remains relatively
   unexplored. This research aims at collecting systematic evidence on the
   dominant paradigms in digitalization reforms in Europe by comparing the
   doctrines employed in the initial and most recent digitalization
   strategies across eight European countries: Estonia, France, Germany,
   Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom. We
   challenge the claim that Networked Governance is emerging as the
   dominant paradigm in the context of the digitalization of the public
   sector. The findings confirm earlier studies indicating that information
   and communication technologies tend to reinforce some traditional
   features of administration and the recentralization of power.
   Furthermore, we find evidence of the continued importance of key
   features of ``New Public Management{''} in the digital era.},

Abstract = {Sanctions are among the most frequently used foreign policy tools to
   address human rights violations, but they can be highly politicized.
   Since the early 2000s, human rights sanctions have been increasingly
   triggered by standardized rankings of states' performances. While
   research on economic statecraft suggests that coercive measures based on
   cross-national assessments may be less influenced by strategic
   considerations, scholarship on rankings highlights how standardized
   performance indicators can also be political. This paper investigates
   whether sanctions based on standardized human rights assessments are
   also influenced by senders' strategic political and economic interests.
   Empirically, we examine the case of United States human trafficking
   sanctions that combines universal rankings in the first stage and
   country-specific sanctions waivers in the second. The analysis leverages
   novel data on all Trafficking in Persons (TIP) rankings by the US State
   Department and presidential sanctions waivers from 2003 to 2018. Despite
   the TIP report's reputation as a reliable indicator, we find that both
   stages in the process of imposing human trafficking sanctions are driven
   by strategic attempts to minimize the economic and political costs of
   sanctions for the US. These findings have broader implications for the
   reputation and effectiveness of other human rights rankings by the US.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Extant research links forced marriage and sexual violence in rebel
   groups with their respective political projects, social control, and
   group cohesion. However, forced marriage and sexual violence are rare in
   many rebel groups, including the Maoists in Nepal who claimed to have a
   ``progressive,{''} ``scientific,{''} and ``modern{''} framework for
   governing marriage and sexuality. In the light of this puzzle, I ask,
   what does a noncoercive/nonviolent rebel governance of marriage and
   sexuality mean for a rebel group's political project of social control
   and power? What is the gendered impact of such governance? Importantly,
   how does it impact female combatants at the intersection of multiple
   oppressions? Using abductive analysis of extensive interviews with
   female ex-combatants and their leaders, I build a theoretical
   explanation about the noncoercive/nonviolent governance of marriage and
   sexuality that is not just linked to the formation, consolidation, and
   legitimation of political agendas, but also enabled social control and
   political power for the Maoists. However, this further marginalized
   those female combatants who were already disadvantaged. I employ a
   feminist intersectional framework while critically reflecting on my own
   positionality. The implications of these findings extend beyond Nepal,
   illuminating dynamics of rebel governance and the complexity of war and
   postwar social organization.},

Abstract = {The coining of the concept of `European sovereignty' by French President
   Emmanuel Macron in 2017 has prompted a heated debate, reviving disputes
   over supranationality, the nation-state and democracy that have
   resonated since the inception of the European project. Macron's
   intervention came at a time when a flurry of crises compelled the
   European Union to move from its ambition of being a `normative power' to
   living through its `Machiavellian moment', against the backdrop of the
   rise of new global powers and existential threats for the security of
   the Union and its member states. But the term `European sovereignty' is
   a misnomer. The real issue is one of power, not of sovereignty. Power
   proceeds from command, hardly an attribute of the complex shared
   decision-making process of the EU, leaving the objective of becoming a
   fully-fledged power out of reach for the European polity.},

Pages = {7-22},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Attrition has been both Ukraine's and Russia's primary approach at the
   tactical level. Ukraine's preferred way of war centres on the use of
   artillery fire to facilitate decisive attritional effects on the
   opposing force, which it then exploits with manoeuvre. This is not
   unexpected, as most major conventional wars feature attrition as well as
   manoeuvre and reconstitution. Western assistance has brought Ukraine to
   an impressive point, but may not yield a fires advantage for Ukraine
   sufficient to ensure further operational breakthroughs or strategic
   gains. Advanced Western weapons, such as the US-supplied High Mobility
   Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), have not allowed Ukraine to avoid
   attritional combat, particularly in its counter-offensive in Kherson.
   Even with more effective wide-scale combined-arms training and precision
   strikes, as contemplated, future Ukrainian gains are likely to be
   incremental and costly unless the Russian military significantly
   misspends combat power in its own offensive operations.},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {This study employs hierarchical Bayesian analysis of terrorist attacks
   to provide a retrospective analysis of the war in Afghanistan between
   2002 and 2018. We examine the relationship between U.S. troop levels,
   target type, and the severity of attacks in terms of the number killed
   or wounded. We find that although some targets might have become better
   fortified after enduring attacks (such as police departments),
   terrorists would subsequently succeed in either attacking other targets
   (such as educational institutions) or even those same targets in
   subsequent years. Our analysis also finds that increases in U.S. troop
   levels throughout much of the conflict did not seem to quell violence,
   although explanations of this phenomenon are considerably more nuanced
   after taking expert opinion into account. We hope our analysis provides
   a useful retrospective analysis of the U.S. War in Afghanistan for
   policymakers to assess how or if security measures in the country could
   have been improved over the course of the conflict. Our modeling
   framework, however, is easily generalizable to other conflicts worldwide
   and thus provides a useful statistical tool for analyzing terrorism in
   many other settings as well.},

Volume = {5},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {From voting fraud to Russian interference, electoral conspiracy theories
   have circulated on social media since the 2016 United States
   presidential election with alarming magnitude. Previous conspiracy
   studies have primarily focused on psychological causes that contribute
   to the conspiracy mentality, and the discussion on political antecedents
   of conspiracy endorsement remains lacking. This study selects popular
   conspiracies reflecting various political ideologies and conducts
   multiple survey rounds (n = 500) to compare and contrast the effect of
   partisan affiliations on conspiracy endorsement. Drawing from the extant
   literature from psychology, communication, and political science and
   using two-way and three-way interaction models, this study examines
   three political antecedents-political ideology, knowledge, and
   participation-and their interactive effects on conspiracy endorsement.
   The results indicate that individuals with higher levels of political
   affiliation and knowledge illustrate stronger conspiracy endorsement,
   and this effect is stronger for conservatives than liberals.
   Additionally, increased political participation reduces the endorsement
   of conservative conspiracies and heightens the endorsement of liberal
   ones among both conservatives and liberals.},

Abstract = {This article attempts to explore three illiberal discursive practices
   (metaphysical state, right post-colonialism, and Orthodox pan-Slavism)
   that structure Putin's ideological course and help to understand why
   justifications of Russia's invasion of Ukraine sound logical in Russian
   discourse. It argues that throughout the 1990s illiberal grassroots
   organizations popularized these discursive practices of the Soviet
   right-wing intelligentsia, engaged large masses in their projects,
   recruited members of Putin's elites as followers, and were partially
   absorbed by the administration. My interviews with the representatives
   of the illiberal civic movement and Putin's administration indicate that
   grassroots organizations successfully delivered their ideological modus
   operandi to the post-Yeltsin ruling class. Hence, an acute resemblance
   of the illiberal grassroots movement's discursive practices with those
   of the Kremlin is hardly likely to be accidental. Putin and his allies
   engaged with this preexisting illiberal civil society and ultimately
   drew on its ideas and tapped into its networks for support.},

Abstract = {Articulating the research priorities of government is one mechanism for
   promoting the production of relevant research to inform policy. This
   study focuses on the Areas of Research Interest (ARIs) produced and
   published by government departments in the UK. Through a qualitative
   study consisting of interviews with 25 researchers, civil servants,
   intermediaries and research funders, the authors explored the role of
   ARIs. Using the concept of boundary objects, the paper considers the
   ways in which ARIs are used and how they are supported by boundary
   practices and boundary workers, including through engagement
   opportunities. The paper addresses the following questions: What
   boundaries do ARIs cross, intended and otherwise? What characteristics
   of ARIs enable or hinder this boundary-crossing? and What resources,
   skills, work or conditions are required for this boundary -crossing to
   work well? We see the ARIs being used as a boundary object across
   multiple boundaries, with implications for the ways in which the ARIs
   are crafted and shared. In the application of ARIs in the UK policy
   context, we see a constant interplay between boundary objects, practices
   and people all operating within the confines of existing systems and
   processes. For example, understanding what was meant by a particular ARI
   sometimes involved `decoding' work as part of the academic-policy
   engagement process. While ARIs have an important role to play they are
   no magic bullet. Nor do they tell the whole story of governmental
   research interests. Optimizing the use of research in policy making
   requires the galvanisation of a range of mechanisms, including ARIs.},

Abstract = {This paper compares the practice of holding prime ministers to account
   in four case studies: Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United
   Kingdom. Using text analysis, as well as research on prime ministerial
   responsibilities, it investigates oral questions asked in parliamentary
   procedures where prime ministers are questioned together with ministers
   (Question Period in Canada and Question Time in Australia) versus
   procedures where they are questioned individually (PMQs in the United
   Kingdom and Oral Questions to the Taoiseach in Ireland), and explores
   the degree to which they are questioned for matters that are within
   their remit. It argues that the practice of prime ministerial
   accountability is decisively shaped by procedural features such as
   whether written notice is required for questions, as well as by the
   broader role of the questioning mechanism in the political system, and
   less by the collective or individualised nature of questioning.},

Abstract = {Despite inherent political tensions, supranational institutions are
   increasingly involved in national security. EU institutions not only
   guide but also mobilize national resources or directly produce
   collective security. To make sense of those variations, the article
   conceptualizes ideal types of `supranational security states' and
   develops a typological theory for understanding the emergence of the
   studied states. Based on policy documents and secondary sources, the
   article conducts a case-centric process-tracing analysis of three
   decades of EU reforms in (1) export control over dual-use technologies,
   (2) network and information security and (3) border security. Three
   types of supranational security states emerge, driven by their
   path-dependency logics and response to crises. Findings suggest a more
   nuanced understanding of security policy instruments and the dynamics of
   political authority in shared security spaces, contributing to debates
   on the positive and regulatory European security state,
   technology-driven security governance, and the coherence of the EU as a
   security actor.},

Abstract = {Despite the widely held notion that processes of radicalization tend to
   happen in relation to others, systematic evidence on the social context
   in which actors meet and form ties is scarce. This is problematic, as
   without a more thorough understanding of the relational dimension of
   radicalization, any strategy to intervene may turn out less effective
   than perhaps hoped for. Based on our access to detailed police
   information on eleven Dutch Salafi-Jihadi networks (2001-2014; 273
   actors), this article presents a descriptive analysis of the social
   context in which actors meet and form ties. In most networks, we observe
   pre-existing family and friendship ties, actors to frequent Salafi
   mosques and radicalizing settings, and committed actors engaged in
   functional roles. We also find indications for these elements to
   facilitate actors to form ties. It is important to note however that we
   also observe exceptions, both in terms of prevalence and impact of the
   relational factors we study. In the article, we describe our detailed
   empirical findings and reflect on the (differential) social context is
   which actors participating in Dutch Salafi-Jihadi networks meet and form
   ties.},

Abstract = {A traditional great power stereotype of small states is that of helpless
   pawns in world politics. After Panama severed its longstanding
   diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 2017, small state diplomacy once again
   came under the spotlight. By tracing Panama's convoluted diplomatic
   relations over the Taiwan Strait since 1949, we argue that, rather than
   great power competition alone, it is Panama's state capacity and its
   strategic calculations about external threats that account for the
   shifts in its relations with Taiwan and Mainland China. We further
   identify five strategies adopted by Panama: bandwagoning,
   status-seeking, issue linkages, two-sided bargaining, and diplomatic
   recognition. By bringing agency back into the agent-structure debate,
   this article shows how, as an agent, Panama has maximised its action
   space and sheds light on Taiwan administration's shrinking international
   recognition against the backdrop of the rising global influence of the
   People's Republic of China.},

Title = {Introducing the parliamentary deployment votes database},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Abstract = {The Parliamentary Deployment Votes Database provides data on the voting
   behaviour of 301 political parties in 1,022 parliamentary votes on
   military missions between 1990 and 2019 in 21 countries of the Global
   North. This special data feature introduces the database and presents
   descriptive statistics and basic patterns on some of its key variables:
   general, political, and regional characteristics of missions and votes
   themselves; the level of agreement; and party-political contestation.
   The number of deployment votes has increased over the course of the
   1990s and then fluctuated around a stable annual average of 40 to 50
   votes. At the same time, legislative-executive relations in security and
   defence policy and, as a consequence, the number of deployment votes,
   continue to differ substantially between countries. Whereas support for
   military missions has increased over time, the degree of contestation,
   as measured by an agreement index, differs considerably across the
   countries under study. Whether a political party supports a military
   mission depends not only on it being part of a governing coalition or in
   opposition but also on its political ideology: support is lowest among
   parties of the Radical Left, increases among green and social-democratic
   parties and peaks among liberal, conservative and Christian-democratic
   parties. Radical-right parties are less supportive than centrist parties
   but more supportive than radical-left parties. Regional peculiarities
   notwithstanding, this pattern can be found in Western and Eastern
   Europe, East Asia and North America. The database will be interesting
   for scholars of the democratic politics of military missions and
   particularly legislative-executive relations and political parties in
   security and defence policy, providing the foundations for a comparative
   analysis of different missions, the ideological foundations of
   contestation, government-opposition dynamics and legislative-executive
   relations in security and defence policy.},

Abstract = {While the standard conceptualization of differentiation in the European
   Union (EU) focuses on differentiated integration, scholars devote less
   attention to differentiated cooperation. This article argues, on the
   contrary, that member states' engagement in differentiated efforts in EU
   foreign policy manifest themselves both in the form of differentiated
   integration and cooperation. It elaborates an original conceptual
   framework for exploring differentiated cooperation as a mode of
   governance. Drawing on the articles in this special issue, this
   introduction maps empirical manifestations of differentiated cooperation
   in various areas and dimensions of EU foreign policy. The results of the
   special issue show that differentiated cooperation has mostly manifested
   itself in informal patterns of cooperation, with the treaty-based
   mechanisms being limited. As such, the special issue reflects the
   differentiation and informalization processes occurring not only in the
   EU, but also in global governance more broadly.},

Abstract = {This article explores how Norway managed its relations with the United
   States as Ine Eriksen Sereide served as Foreign Minister between 2017
   and 2021. We outline some characteristics of the period's international
   context and high-light crucial features of the bilateral cooperation.
   Despite recurrent turbu-lence, Norway conducted itself as an unwavering
   and patient alliance partner. Without doubt, the Norwegian security
   policy towards the United States con-curred with Norway's foreign policy
   tradition. Yet, the tenets of Norway's tran-satlantic conduct still had
   a particular slant: The way in which the dilemmas of the period were
   solved suggests that narrowly defined, but fundamentally important,
   security interests held sway.},

Abstract = {For over 30 years of Ukraine's independence, the `course to the West' in
   foreign and security policy has experienced several changes, moving from
   `virtual Europeanization' through `multi-vector' policy to inscribing
   full membership in the EU and NATO in the Ukrainian Constitution. Such
   lack of consistency in the policy of affiliation with the West is a
   consequence of both internal and international factors. The obstacles on
   Ukraine's way to the West are both resistance within the country itself
   and processes in the international arena, especially between the West
   and Russia, which currently resulted in the war that began on February
   24, 2022. Despite this, Ukraine's attempts to move closer to the West
   are slowly bearing fruit. In this chapter, the author aims to analyze
   external and internal determinants of Ukraine's foreign policy toward
   the widely understood West, applying the perspective of neoclassical
   realism.},

Abstract = {Human rights activists, international organizations, and certain
   governments have championed prosecutions as a strategy to prevent
   conflict-related sexual violence, and the International Criminal Court
   (ICC) has focused extensively on prosecuting sexual violence crimes
   during its first two decades of operations. However, even as a growing
   body of empirical evidence suggests that the ICC contributes to improved
   human rights practices and the prevention of other atrocity crimes, such
   as violence against civilians, claims concerning the preventive effects
   of prosecutions on sexual violence remain largely untested. The purpose
   of this article is to test these claims. To this end, we analyzed the
   effects of ICC jurisdiction, interventions, and cross-case actions on
   sexual violence by government forces in intrastate conflicts from 1989
   to 2018, using the Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict (SVAC) dataset.
   Contrary to the optimistic claims of proponents of prosecutions, we
   found that ICC jurisdiction and cross-case actions have negligible
   effects for this category of actors. We also found that ICC
   interventions are associated with increased sexual violence by
   government forces in intrastate conflicts. These findings suggest that
   prevention might require alternative-and, in some cases, potentially
   costlier-interventions.},

Title = {The Paradigmatic Limitations of the Concept of Hegemony: China and the
   Global South},
Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {85-111},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Objective/Context: China's rise has generated a profound debate on the
   impact of its growing presence on the international scene. There is a
   broad discussion on whether China will become a new hegemon or whether
   it will establish a post-hegemonic scenario. However, these approaches
   assume that hegemony is an objective and universal concept. This article
   presents a critique of the concept of hegemony that has sought to
   explain China's rise. It considers the paradigmatic limitations of this
   concept and highlights the importance of abandoning our mental models to
   seek new ways of conceptualizing China's changing role in the Global
   South. Based on a post-structuralist theoretical approach, the article
   analyzes the severe conceptual limitations in understanding China's rise
   because the dominant concepts for understanding this process come from a
   Eurocentric view of the discipline of international relations.
   Methodology: Different approaches to the concept of hegemony are
   contrasted from a critical perspective. Conclusions: The article
   emphasizes how the historical experience of the West has shaped key
   mental models of the discipline, as is the case with how the concept of
   hegemony is traditionally understood. Originality: This study
   contributes to a better understanding of China's rise by broadening the
   paradigmatic range from which to approach this phenomenon.},

Abstract = {In principle, aid from donor organizations to developing countries
   should be based on need and the likelihood of positive impact, but
   political biases may intrude into deci-sions about aid allocations. This
   article elaborates a theory about why a particular form of bias, one
   based on partisan affiliations, can affect where aid goes and whether
   the goals of aid are met. Party networks can facilitate coordination of
   decisions and leverage bureau-cratic capacity, but they can also ensure
   that resources, such as aid, stay in the control of copartisans to boost
   reelection goals. The empirical analysis evaluates whether partisan bias
   is evident in the locations and impact of World Bank agricultural aid to
   India. The authors analyze georeferenced data on aid projects, election
   results, and cropland coverage at the levels of state parliamentary
   electoral constituencies and administrative districts from 1995 to 2008.
   They find that alignment between local legislators and the political
   parties that govern state and national governments is associated with a
   greater number of new aid projects and with anomalous changes in
   cropland coverage. The evi-dence is consistent with arguments that
   partisan bias works primarily through patronage to achieve strategic
   party goals.},

Abstract = {Business elites' ability to act collectively is influenced by the scope
   of their political orga-nization. Within Latin America, large
   cross-national differences exist on this variable. Some countries have
   strong encompassing associations that can speak authoritatively for the
   private sector as a whole, but others do not. This article examines the
   causes of these differences through a comparative historical analysis of
   Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. The existing scholarship offers three
   explanations of variance in business organizational scope in the region,
   focusing on threats, state encouragement, and the mode of transi-tion to
   neoliberalism, respectively. This article argues that the explanations
   involving state encouragement and neoliberal transition are
   unconvincing. Although the focus on threat is more satisfying, the
   existing perspective on threat should be refined in two important ways.
   One is by emphasizing the centrality of threats to private property.
   Threats of oth-er types may induce temporary cooperation, but what
   distinguishes cases of strong and enduring encompassing organization is
   the occurrence of major property threats. The second refinement is to
   specify that ideas about the state provide the causal mechanism linking
   threat to organization. Property threats engender encompassing
   organization by institutionalizing, within the business community, views
   that underscore the dangers of state economic intervention.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {2250-2286},

Abstract = {Despite the allure of `European digital sovereignty' as an official
   European Union (EU) strategic objective, it remains unclear whether this
   discourse has driven concrete changes to EU external action policies,
   particularly those leveraging cyber instruments. This question is
   explored vis-a-vis three policies which have enabled the EU to pursue
   its digital sovereignty objectives in practice: the Cyber Diplomacy
   Toolbox, external capacity building (CCB) assistance initiatives, and
   the 5G Toolbox. Drawing upon extensive archival research and elite
   interviews, the paper finds that, while European digital sovereignty
   discourse influenced comprehensive changes for the 5G Toolbox process,
   it failed to drive policy changes to the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and
   external CCB assistance initiatives. To explore this variation, the
   paper considers institutional and ideational factors particular to EU
   external action over the 2017-2022 period. Overall, the study
   contributes both to contemporary debates about European digital
   sovereignty and its relationship to EU cyber instruments and
   longstanding work on EU foreign policymaking.},

Abstract = {``Loyalty trials{''} are common to a range of conflict settings, with
   consequences that range from harassment to imprisonment, torture, or
   death. Yet, they have received little if any attention as a general
   phenomenon in studies of state repression, civil war, or rebel
   governance, which focus on particular behaviors that authorities use to
   put people on trial, such as dissent, defection, and resistance. Using a
   computational model and data on the German Democratic Republic and the
   Occupied Palestinian Territories, we focus on the dynamics of ``loyalty
   trials{''} held to identify enemy collaborators-the interaction between
   expectations, perceptions, and behavior. We use our framework to explore
   the conditions under which trials result in widespread defection, as in
   the German Democratic Republic, or in conformity as illustrated by our
   study of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The polarizing nature of
   loyalty trials and the propensity to over- or under-identify threats to
   political order have notable implications for democratic and
   non-democratic societies alike.},

Abstract = {Despite the proliferation of studies on interest group influence, there
   has been limited research on the conditions that facilitate their
   ability to impact policy agendas. This study investigates the role of
   supportive alignments in enhancing interest groups' agenda-setting
   influence, with a specific focus on the European Union. We argue that
   organisations aligning closely with institutional and societal actors
   are better positioned to push their `dream' issues on the policy agenda
   while keeping `nightmare' issues off. To assess this argument, we rely
   on a novel dataset comprising 301 mobilised interest groups on 56
   specific issues. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of
   institutional alignments in gaining agenda-setting influence. Moreover,
   aligning with the public and other interest groups increases the chances
   of preference attainment. However, it does not lead to a higher
   likelihood of being perceived as an influential agenda-setter. Overall,
   our study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of interest
   group influence, extending insights beyond legislative politics.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 20},
Abstract = {In October 2021, the American Jewish Committee released a survey that
   indicated that one out of four American Jews was victimized by
   antisemitism that year. Similarly, the Anti-Defamation League reported
   in 2022 that the number of antisemitic incidents in the U.S. reached its
   highest level since the organization began tracking antisemitism in
   1979. The current research investigates the link between local social
   factors and the proliferation of antisemitic violence in the U.S., and
   more broadly expands the theoretical and conceptual understanding of the
   causes of biased violence. Using the University of Massachusetts Lowell
   Far-Right Incident Database, 2968 antisemitic incidents were identified
   between 2015 and 2021. Using a negative binomial regression clustered by
   county and state and piecewise slope analyses for antisemitic incidents
   in 2021, we find evidence that escalating tensions between Israel and
   Palestine and local political, social, and economic conditions play a
   role in the risk of antisemitic incidents.},

Abstract = {The relationship between war and crime is complex and multifaceted.
   Still, insurgents, armed rebels, and paramilitary groups and the
   violence they perpetrate are often understood within either a framework
   of war or of crime. Based on repeat interviews with former members of
   Colombian paramilitary groups, we describe the role of economic
   motivations, security concerns, social relations, as well as identity
   and feelings of power in motivating people's involvement in these
   groups. A life-course analysis demonstrates the many possible
   confluences of war and crime leading to involvement in paramilitary
   groups and emphasizes how these change over time.},

Abstract = {The field of international security studies drastically evolved over the
   last few decades. Critical security studies emerged as one trend,
   seeking to make explicit statist orientations of traditional security
   studies, the Paris School being one such branch, highlighting the role
   of security professionals and the importance of studying repetitive
   regimes of practices. Other security trends tilted toward the creation
   of ontological security studies (OSS), placing importance on the concept
   of autobiographical narratives, routines, and anxiety-bringing
   importance to the unconscious drivers of actor behavior in IR. Given the
   shared focus on regimes of practices, it is surprising that these two
   schools of thought have not paired together to address questions of
   security. In this article, I will critically interrogate the literature
   on OSS and the Paris school, drawing out key debates and questions from
   both schools of thought. I suggest that although these two areas have
   previously been treated as separate, there is much potential for
   synthesizing this literature that opens up new spaces for inquiry.},

Abstract = {Public support for ambitious climate policies and carbon prices that
   have direct costs for voters may depend on policy sequencing. Policy
   sequencing theory suggests that the strategic ordering of policies into
   sequences that initially create benefits can subsequently increase
   support for higher carbon prices. However, systematic quantitative
   evidence about the effects of sequencing on public support is lacking.
   We provide novel theoretical and empirical insights on the mechanisms
   through which strategic policy sequencing affects public support for
   climate policies. We generated these insights using geospatial data and
   a representative conjoint experiment with Swiss voters conducted just
   before the popular vote on an amendment to the Federal Act on the
   Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in June 2021. Our evidence shows
   that the perceived effectiveness of prior policy-induced benefits is
   related to more public support for higher carbon prices across sectors.
   Moreover, we find that more opportunity structures for low-emission
   alternatives-like higher EV charging station density-are associated with
   increased public support for carbon prices in the sector where the
   former material benefits occur. Our results also imply that positive
   policy perceptions of prior climate policies are related to increased
   support, particularly among conservative voters and those who do not
   regard climate change as a salient issue. Thus, strategic policy
   sequencing could be an effective strategy for broadening public support
   for ambitious climate policies.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to examine how organizational practices such as
   climate for conflict management (CCM) and high involvement work
   practices (HIWPs) reduce the negative consequences of workplace bullying
   (WPB) on work-related depression (WRD).Design/methodology/approachData
   were collected from 468 full-time employees working in the financial
   sector in Turkiye by applying a student-recruited sampling strategy. The
   aforesaid relationships were assessed using SPSS AMOS 29.FindingsThe
   results indicated that WPB leads to WRD; however, this effect is
   alleviated by employee perceptions of strong CCM and the administration
   of HIWPs in workplace settings.Research
   limitations/implicationsCollecting data from a single source poses the
   risks of self-report data bias; however, in the future, data may be
   collected from multiple sources to lessen this potential threat. The
   study was a cross-sectional study, which makes it hard to make casual
   inferences; longitudinal data would be more beneficial to establish
   casual associations.Practical implicationsBusiness owners and managers
   can draw from the study results to create a work environment perceived
   by employees to be fair when dealing with conflicts and the negative
   vices of bullying in workplaces. Also, organizations may administer
   practices that empower employees' confidence and competence to deal with
   negative persecution in organizations.Originality/valueFew studies, if
   any, have focused on examining the moderating effect of CCM and HIWPs in
   the association between WPB and WRD. Drawing upon conservation of
   resources theory, the study stands out as it tests the moderating effect
   of CCM and HIWPs in the connection between WPB and WRD. The findings
   contribute to the few available studies tackling organizational factors
   relevant to alleviating the negative consequences of WPB in
   organizations.},

Abstract = {Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has led to a shift of public
   opinion in Germany on collective defense: reluctance towards the defense
   of NATO's eastern flank has given way to majority support for military
   efforts to reassure NATO's eastern members in the face of Russian
   aggression. Against the background of the war, which factors are driving
   this shift in peoples' alliance solidarity? An in-depth analysis of
   representative population surveys from 2021 and 2022 shows that the
   perception of Russia as a security threat is the key factor, yet it is
   only part of a more complex explanation involving peoples' strategic
   postures and issue-specific knowledge as well. Contrary to common
   belief, a free-riding mentality turns out to be irrelevant. The
   empirical findings shine light on Germany's reaction to Russia's war
   against Ukraine and add to our understanding of the societal foundations
   of alliance solidarity in Germany and other NATO countries.},

Abstract = {The successes and failures of political leaders and their rise and fall
   from power are well analysed by academic studies. The roles played by
   former leaders however are more obscure, particularly if they continue
   to maintain an institutional presence. This article explores the
   backbench behaviour of 12 former UK prime ministers following their
   departure from Downing Street. We find that contemporary former prime
   ministers display more diverse backbench behaviour in the House of
   Commons, are more focused on performing constituency representation in
   the chamber and engage in a form of statecraft focused on real time
   assessments of their successors. This is significant as it suggests that
   our traditional assumptions of post leadership careers may need
   reinterpreting. It also demonstrates an ongoing democratic benefit to
   the presence of former leaders within legislatures.},

Abstract = {The implications of the dilemma attributed to Mair between the
   responsiveness of political actors and their responsibility is
   considered from the perspective of citizens. The article analyses
   citizens' understandings of political actors' responsiveness and
   responsibility in their discourses on the SEGEU. We provide an in-depth
   abductive secondary analysis of three qualitative datasets collected in
   Belgium and France between 2005 and 2019. Most participants frame
   responsibility and responsiveness in terms that are close to Mair's
   definitions. However, some challenge the principle of responsibility and
   elaborate an alternative understanding directed towards achieving the
   common good. Nevertheless, as participants agree that political actors
   are not responsive to them, but rather to market actors, there is no
   evident dilemma. Our analysis shows that political actors' capacity for
   agency and choice, frames participants' understandings of responsiveness
   and responsibility. This result becomes the basis for a
   reconceptualisation of the notion of responsiveness and representation
   from a citizen perspective.},

Abstract = {Despite increasing awareness, there are gaps in implementers' policy
   initiatives and ability to effectively deploy programs that incorporate
   gender mainstreaming in refugee contexts. Challenges impacting the
   design and implementation of gender sensitive livelihoods programming
   are identified based on forty-eight interviews with UN and (I)NGO staff
   in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI).
   Problems include a lack of gender expertise, internalized gender
   stereotypes, lack of donor commitment to gender goals, not being able to
   measure outcomes, and/or time constraints. We highlight best practices
   that make programs that help women refugees obtain work more successful.
   At the same time, interviewees raised important questions concerning the
   appropriate metrics for measuring the success of `livelihoods'
   initiatives, arguing that social integration, increasing women's soft
   skills and self-confidence were just as or more important than economic
   objectives of many initiatives being rolled out.},

Abstract = {While the EU Recovery Strategy is centered on the so-called twin
   transitions (ecological and digital), both reforms and investments are
   also concentrated on social policy. This is particularly the case of the
   Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) that largely finance the Italian
   RRP (Recovery and Resilience Plan) that lists measures in different
   areas: labour market; social inclusion, LTC and healthcare. The present
   article sheds light on the RRF through the integration of two analytical
   approaches: the one on governance effectiveness; and the one on policy
   design. Italy is proposed as a hard test for the effectiveness of the
   RRF. Evidence from the field of childcare shows both opportunities and
   risks for the possible turn towards the social investment approach of
   the Italian welfare.},

Abstract = {This article explores the link between migration governance and politics
   in small and medium-sized localities (SMsLs), asking: what modes of
   immigrant integration governance emerge in SMsLs?; how are these modes
   of governance shaped by political factors such as local governments'
   (LGs) political affiliation, the presence/absence of radical right
   parties (RPPs) in local councils and the political affiliation of
   governments at higher levels? To answer these questions, we selected 26
   European SMsLs across seven EU countries and applied a mixed-method
   design combining social network analysis and qualitative content
   analysis. We find that political dynamics decisively shape integration
   governance in SMsLs. Centre-left LGs have more frequent and
   collaborative relations with nonpublic actors, especially when RRPs hold
   seat in local councils and support regional/national governments.
   Centre-right LGs usually disengage from integration governance or, when
   facing strong RRPs, develop strategies to maintain control on issues
   perceived as highly salient. Vertical relations are either conflictual
   or absent in all SMsLs.},

Abstract = {Most scholarly literature explores the relationship between regime type
   and terrorism, while little attention has been paid to the influence of
   regime on terrorist groups' decision to engage in civil war. This paper
   argues that the onset of civil war involving terrorist organizations is
   conditioned by regime type. Democratic regimes create conditions that
   prevent the onset of civil war involving terrorist organizations,
   although similar regimes might provide the opportunities for such groups
   to emerge in the first place. The pacifying effect of democracy on
   terrorist organizations' decision-making calculus is, however, mediated
   through a set of democratic institutions. Empirical tests on a global
   dataset of terrorist organizations show that democratic institutions
   such as political rights, repression (lack of), rule of law, civil
   liberties and high state capacity indeed mediate the effects of a
   democratic regime in lowering the likelihood of civil war onset
   involving terrorist organizations.},

   aparentemente cuestiona la postura nacionalista del gobierno de
   Bolsonaro y ha provocado debates academicos en torno a sus razones

   populistas y el conservatismo detras de dicho nacionalismo, no hay
   contradiccion entre estas y la politica economica de Bolsonaro.},

Abstract = {This article provides political analysis of the extent to which new
   state strategies of involvement in climate technologies have shaped the
   green markets in both China and the United States. Using rational choice
   institutionalism and comparative case studies, this article analyzes
   state involvement in novel governance techniques and green industrial
   policy competition related to climate technologies in the United States
   and China. The guiding research question asks to what extent green
   industrial policy and its related incentives are useful for
   understanding the transition to green energy in the two countries. This
   study further explores the ways in which both countries enhance the
   competitiveness of national industries for science and technology in
   alternative energy. The rivalry between China and the US has
   accelerated, to some extent, the process of strengthening regulatory
   intervention in knowledge creation, public financing for climate
   technologies, and other domestic economic interests, while the emergence
   of green industrial policy has become part of the win-win rhetoric and
   practices to facilitate a green economy. This research contributes to
   the comparative understanding of the proliferation of mission-oriented
   innovation initiatives, as well as the challenges in reorganizing them
   with new green industrial policy concepts.},

Abstract = {Voters are affected by cues from their immediate social environment. One
   of these cues consists of the political opinions available and accepted
   in people's neighbourhoods, which are theoretically expected to affect
   vote choices through direct or indirect forms of communication. We test
   this assertion by employing a longitudinal design combining fine-grained
   geo-coded panel data with election results on a uniquely local level in
   the Netherlands. We assess the effect of the level of support for
   parties in a neighbourhood (consisting of just 624 households on
   average) on the vote choices of individuals 5 years later, while
   controlling for their previous vote choice. We find that the political
   preferences of neighbours indeed affect respondents' subsequent vote
   choice, but only for those voters who feel strongly embedded in the
   local community. We conclude that, even in the highly fragmented Dutch
   context, the political choices of citizens can be influenced by
   neighbourhood effects.},

Pages = {440-460},

Abstract = {This article develops the concept of epistemic security as a form of
   ontological security. Epistemic security denotes a sense of redemptive
   hegemony that derives from participation in ritualised schemes of
   epistemic authority. Such schemes are strategically identified and
   cultivated by experts turned guardian experts who ritualise knowledge
   production to generate collective empowerment. Epistemic security
   troubles the notion of modern expertise and reflexive agency in
   ontological security studies. Guardian experts embed knowledge formation
   in tradition rather than methodological scepticism and disavow epistemic
   violence of their interpretative frameworks. I develop the argument in
   engagement with `magical realism'-a ritualised script of the realist
   International Relations theory in the pro-regime Russian academic
   discourse. Through ritual mastery, the guardian experts of magical
   realism perform `magic slippage' from scientific to sacred frames to
   render Russia's war on Ukraine hegemonically redemptive, as a
   scientifically derived, historically preordained, and politically
   prudent act of a great power.},

Abstract = {Ayse Zarakol's Before the West: The Rise and Fall of Eastern World
   Orders successfully delivers what it promises: it challenges
   Eurocentrism in international relations theory by providing a better
   alternative. The alternative is the Chinggisid sovereignty model that
   yoked Eurasia into successive world orders from the thirteenth to the
   sixteenth centuries. The Chinggissid model undercuts another strand of
   ethnocentrism: Sinocentrism. The book does not set out to examine where
   the Chinggissid model came from, or what happened BEFORE `Before the
   West' in prior millennia. A more longue duree perspective suggests that
   elements of the Chinggissid model had Chinese precedents, which were
   themselves Eurasian-Chinese hybrids. The breadth and depth of Chinggisid
   elements suggest that they fell but did not disappear AFTER `Before the
   West'. They may, indeed, have risen again in today's world.},

Abstract = {What factors contribute to the differences in foreign direct investment
   (FDI) levels in environments characterized as high risk? While research
   shows that armed conflict influences foreign investment decisions, it
   remains unclear how conflict dynamics, specifically the relative power
   capabilities of warring parties, affect FDI. This study explores the
   effects of rebel strength relative to government forces on FDI. We argue
   that there is a reduction in foreign investments in civil conflict
   countries as rebels gain a military advantage relative to the
   government. Stronger insurgents send a signal that the government is
   losing its strength in the conflict, creating uncertainty regarding
   conflict outcomes and posing economic and security risks for investors.
   To avoid facing economic and property losses due to increasing rebel
   strength, investors are incentivized to decrease their investment in the
   conflict state. Using data on insurgent troop size relative to
   government forces and FDI, our findings show that higher military
   capabilities of rebel forces relative to the government are associated
   with less FDI inflows in conflict-affected countries.},

Abstract = {Income comparisons imply that individuals care not only about the
   absolute value of their income but also about its relative value. Such
   comparisons likely have significant societal consequences while also
   challenging standard neoclassical economic theory. I argue that a better
   understanding of income comparisons requires a more systematic,
   theoretical engagement with three problems: (1) the problem of reference
   group selection, (2) the problem of orientation, and (3) the problem of
   functional form. Income comparisons are commonly attributed to
   interdependent preferences, in particular to envy. I propose an
   alternative theoretical approach in which comparisons are a rational
   means for individuals to improve upon imperfect information about their
   current earning potential. I test the empirical implications of both
   approaches for reference group selection, orientation, and functional
   form using individual-level data from the Netherlands. The evidence
   suggests that imperfect information drives comparisons, but
   interdependent preferences also play a role.},

Abstract = {This study examines the formative years of Iran's so-called `jihadi
   field diplomacy' toward Azerbaijan during and after the First
   Nagorno-Karabakh War. To accomplish this, I adopt a novel version of
   neoclassical realism, which considers the socially constructed nature of
   variables. The application of constructivist neoclassical realism
   facilitates a deeper comprehension of the reasons and mechanisms behind
   Iran's embrace of unconventional interventionist policies in Azerbaijan.
   I argue that Iran's jihadi field diplomacy is characterized by two main
   features: the use of military tools to achieve foreign policy goals and
   a distinct leadership structure that operates independently of the
   government. Then I analyze three turning points that shaped Iran's
   jihadi field diplomacy toward Azerbaijan. Firstly, after a failed
   diplomatic mediation between Yerevan and Baku in May 1992, Iran
   intensified its military and ideological efforts in Azerbaijan.
   Secondly, during the June 1993 coup, Iran supported pro-Russian coup
   leader Colonel Huseynov and sought to persuade him to collaborate with
   ex-Communist Aliyev against nationalist President Elchibey. Aliyev later
   perceived this initial cooperation as a serious ideological and military
   challenge. Lastly, the perceived threat and Iran's Quds Force
   connections to the leaders of the subsequent military uprisings
   adversely affected bilateral relations between Iran and Azerbaijan.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of sociocultural
   context in the process of government communication, but few studies have
   elaborated on the underlying mechanisms. By comparing government
   communication strategies under diverse sociocultural factors, this study
   aims to explore the role of local culture as a contextual factor in the
   design of government communication. Drawing on evidence from China's
   government communication on nuclear power projects, we explore how the
   central government constructed communication strategies based on
   different local cultures to enhance public acceptance of nuclear power
   projects. A comparison of this case in two cities reveals that the
   government can design communication strategies based on their
   understanding of local citizens - using local culture as the basis of
   audience segmentation to create different communication strategies for
   different citizens.},

Abstract = {The Battle of Mosul (2016-2017) was one of the most grueling urban
   warfare campaigns in recent memory. The fighting quickly concentrated in
   West Mosul, where civilians prevented by the Islamic State from leaving
   their homes experienced airstrikes and indiscriminate shelling by
   government forces. Utilizing the as-if-randomness of severe damage or
   destruction of people's homes, this paper examines the impact of war
   exposure on the endorsement of moral foundations among a large and
   diverse sample of Mosul residents (N = 1027). Home damage increased
   binding morality but had a larger impact on individualizing morality,
   heightening concerns about fairness and protection from harm. A survey
   experiment in which the sectarian identity of the target was randomly
   assigned further revealed a strong association between individualizing
   morality and parochial altruism. Challenging conventional wisdom, both
   individualizing and binding morality reinforce group cohesion in ways
   that are functionally adaptive and responsive to the damage wrought by
   war.},

Abstract = {Despite decades of rigorous research on the use of government-sponsored
   violence in armed conflicts, there remains significant uncertainty as to
   when and where leaders choose to target civilians in war. We argue that
   the variation in the use of state repression is explained in part by how
   soldiers perceive battlefield gains by rebel forces. Specifically, while
   strong opposition forces are often a necessary condition for elites
   convincing agents to engage in state-sponsored brutality, this is
   modified by the soldiers' beliefs surrounding the outcome of the war. If
   government soldiers believe that rebels are likely to win the war, we
   posit that they will likely shirk orders to target civilians, fearing
   post-war accountability. We test this argument by examining subnational
   variation in battlefield dynamics and the use of government one-sided
   violence from 1992 to 2010.
   A pesar de que, desde hace varias decadas, existe una investigacion
   rigurosa sobre el uso de la violencia patrocinada por el gobierno en los
   conflictos armados, persiste una incertidumbre significativa con
   relacion a cuando y donde los gobernantes eligen atacar a civiles
   durante la guerra. Argumentamos que la variacion en el uso de la
   represion estatal se explica en parte por la forma en que los soldados
   perciben las victorias por parte de las fuerzas rebeldes en el campo de
   batalla. Podemos concretar diciendo que, aunque la existencia de fuertes
   fuerzas de oposicion es, a menudo, una condicion necesaria para que las
   elites convenzan a los agentes para participar en la brutalidad
   patrocinada por el Estado, esto se ve modificado por las creencias de
   los soldados en torno al resultado de la guerra. Postulamos que, si los
   soldados del Gobierno creen que es probable que los rebeldes ganen la
   guerra, es probable que eludan las ordenes de atacar a civiles, debido
   al miedo a represalias durante la posguerra. Probamos este argumento
   examinando la variacion subnacional en la dinamica del campo de batalla
   y en el uso de la violencia unilateral del gobierno entre 1992 y 2010.
   Malgre des dizaines d'annees de recherche rigoureuse sur l'usage de la
   violence encourage par les gouvernements, nous en savons encore peu sur
   le moment et le lieu ou les dirigeants choisissent de cibler les civils
   lors d'une guerre. Nous affirmons que les variations observees dans
   l'usage de la repression etatique s'expliquent en partie par la facon
   dont les soldats envisagent les gains remportes par les forces rebelles
   sur le champ de bataille. Plus precisement, bien qu'une forte opposition
   armee permette souvent aux elites de convaincre les agents de perpetrer
   des actes de brutalite encourages par l'etat, l'opinion des soldats sur
   le resultat d'une guerre joue aussi. Si les soldats du gouvernement
   pensent que les rebelles ont des chances de gagner la guerre, nous
   postulons qu'ils n'obeiront certainement pas aux ordres de cibler les
   civils, par crainte des represailles a l'issue du conflit. Nous
   verifions notre hypothese en analysant la variation sous-nationale des
   dynamiques de champ de bataille et l'utilisation de la violence
   unilaterale par les gouvernements de 1992 a 2010.},

Abstract = {British parties have pioneered the use of `one-member, one-vote' ballots
   to select their leaders. However, the elections of Jeremy Corbyn
   (Labour) and Liz Truss (Conservative) prompted calls to return
   leadership selection to parliamentarians. Critics claim that party
   members are non-centrist and liable to impose unsuitable leaders on MPs.
   This weakens the cohesion of parliamentary parties, undermining the
   functioning of Britain's majoritarian democracy. This article assesses
   the major parties' leader-selection systems. It goes beyond existing
   research by identifying and applying four evaluative criteria for
   selection institutions: legitimacy, parliamentary acceptability,
   leader-eviction and timeliness. It shows that most criticisms of
   one-member, one-vote are overstated because the latter is heavily
   mediated by ex-ante and/or ex-post parliamentary controls, for example,
   nomination thresholds and confidence votes. One-member, one-vote
   generally produces leaders acceptable to MPs; `unsuitable' ones
   typically arise when the parliamentary controls fail. However, key
   institutional weaknesses are identified: legitimacy in the
   Conservatives' system and leader-eviction in Labour's.},

Abstract = {Studies in medicine, bioscience, psychology, sociology, and public
   health have provided various contextual, individual, and
   vaccine-specific explanations for vaccine uptake. However, one
   significant yet often ignored fact is that vaccination could be viewed
   as a site of citizen-state interaction in implementing public
   vaccination policy. This begs the questions: What barriers create
   administrative burdens in vaccination? How do the experiences of
   administrative burdens (i.e., the learning, psychological, and
   compliance costs in citizen-state interactions) shape the public's
   willingness to vaccinate? According to theoretical insights drawn from
   the extant literature on administrative burden and vaccine uptake, this
   study uses a conjoint experiment design based on a representative sample
   of China to reveal the role of administrative burdens in shaping the
   public's willingness to vaccinate against the monkeypox outbreak, a
   `Public Health Emergency of International Concern' from July 2022 to May
   2023. The experimental results suggest that multiple salient barriers
   have distinct effects on the respondents' learning, psychological, and
   compliance costs, thus significantly influencing their vaccine uptake.
   These findings have important implications for both future research and
   efforts to promote mass immunization programs.},

Abstract = {What are the effects of religious participation on collective action
   such as protests? Until recently, conflict scholars have focused on the
   macro-level characteristics of religion, while assuming, but rarely
   analyzing, individual-level mechanisms. I fill in this gap by
   incorporating insights from the field of American Politics, which has
   long emphasized the roles of individual-level mechanisms such as
   attendance at religious gatherings. I hypothesize that attendance at
   religious gatherings can address problems of collective action and thus
   lead to protests. I test these hypotheses by exploiting exogenous
   variation in the attendance at Islamic religious gatherings: rain on the
   day of Friday Prayer. I apply the design both to macro-level event data
   and an individual-level survey. The analyses indicate that rainy Fridays
   decrease the frequency of Muslim religious attendance and lower the
   likelihood of Muslim protests in Africa. These results imply a core role
   of communal gatherings in religious mobilization.},

Abstract = {Military AI optimists predict future AI assisting or making command
   decisions. We instead argue that, at a fundamental level, these
   predictions are dangerously wrong. The nature of war demands decisions
   based on abductive logic, whilst machine learning (or `narrow AI')
   relies on inductive logic. The two forms of logic are not
   interchangeable, and therefore AI's limited utility in command - both
   tactical and strategic - is not something that can be solved by more
   data or more computing power. Many defence and government leaders are
   therefore proceeding with a false view of the nature of AI and of war
   itself.},

   Human Rights Laws and Norms},
Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {487+},

Abstract = {Focusing on conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV), we posit that
   behavioral expectations in the form of norms and laws have a visible
   impact on government militaries. Using data from over 2,000
   actor-incidents between 1989 and 2015, we find a robust negative
   relationship between physical integrity norms and CRSV. CRSV is often a
   gendered act, but its prevention is not. Our analysis suggests that CRSV
   prevention rests with the imperative to respect physical integrity
   rights. This inherent respect restrains government actors even when
   elements of formal military control are absent or only inconsistently

Abstract = {Sweden has long been regarded as a `model' for societal development.
   Recently, with the rise of an anti-immigrant party and negative news
   coverage of crime, the image of a progressive Sweden has frayed.
   Positive models for societal development have existed in the past and
   included the United States during the heyday of modernization theory.
   This paper argues that positive models are useful, partly to crystallize
   options among the much-debated varieties of capitalism, and partly as
   ideals which can be held up by social thinkers and publics as
   aspirations for the good society. This paper reviews the evolution of
   the Swedish model from a `middle way' between Soviet communism and
   American capitalism to a welfare state under strain. It also examines
   how the Swedish model has been reinforced by its high international
   standing. The perceptions of Sweden abroad and domestically have changed
   in recent years. While these perceptions have correctly identified
   challenges not just for Sweden but also for other countries with similar
   problems, Sweden's government and civil society may be able to address
   them. The paper explores the lessons that can be learned from the
   current shortcomings and potential renewal of the strengths of the
   Swedish model, including its wider influence.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is transforming the human and political geography of
   Africa. While a growing body of research explores the urban dimensions
   of clientelism, contentious action, and social mobilization, there has
   been less attention given to the ways in which this demographic
   megatrend is influencing political change more broadly. We argue that
   the political implications of African urbanization are contingent on
   local conditions and experiences; there are no deterministic
   associations between urbanization and political change. To better
   understand the mechanisms linking urbanization to politics, we argue
   that a place-based approach is needed. We illustrate this by reviewing
   and highlighting how urbanization may affect (i) the nature and balance
   of citizen preferences; (ii) the composition, interests, and influence
   of elite actors; (iii) forms of political mobilization; (iv) shifting
   gender roles; (v) the role of civil society in political processes; and
   (vi) the likelihood and manifestations of contentious collective action.
   We conclude with a discussion of directions for further research.},

Abstract = {While the `emotion turn' has emerged as an influential analytical lens
   in International Relations (IR), there is not yet a well-developed
   understanding of the role that emotions play in facilitating or
   inhibiting peace. This special issue of Cooperation and Conflict engages
   with the analytical potential of emotions and the promise this
   perspective holds for innovative analyses of peace processes and
   peacebuilding. To demonstrate the political significance of emotions to
   peace, the contributors explore how emotions shape the bounds and
   boundaries of actors and alliances committed to fostering peaceful
   societies. This introductory article offers possible avenues to leverage
   the analytical potential of IR's emotions agenda to engage with peace
   and peacebuilding. First, we discuss how the emotions agenda contributes
   to the conversation about what peace is and should look like. Second, we
   argue that emotions can help us to articulate peace as an embodied
   knowledge of complex socio-political relations and power dynamics. To
   visualize `peace' without the permanent contrast of violence, we
   mobilize this perspective to illuminate actors' practices and the
   constraints they face in the pursuit of a peaceful political order.
   Third, we discuss what an emotions agenda for peace might entail for
   critical and constructive peacebuilding studies.},

Abstract = {Contemporary research on so-called Nordic branding has provided crucial
   insights into the social power of states and how various actors use and
   circulate `progressive' nation brand tropes for political and commercial
   goals. Hitherto, the literature on Nordic branding has focused on a wide
   range of substantive issues, among other things, human rights, gender
   equality, social welfare and foreign aid, but considerably less
   attention has been paid to the topic of security. The present article
   adds to a small but established literature on how the security sphere is
   increasingly entangled with nation branding. In the Nordic region, we
   argue, the latter is particularly evident in the case of Sweden - one of
   the world's largest per-capita arms exporters in the post-Cold War era
   but also a country known and often revered for its peaceful and
   progressive image. Focusing on the case of Sweden, the article
   contributes to knowledge of how defence industry-related actors (both
   public and private) draw on and frame nation branding tropes to sell and
   legitimise their products and services to both insiders (domestic
   constituents) and outsiders (the global security market).},

Title = {Symbolic Conflict in the Public Sphere: The Catholic Church Against the
   State in Post-Communist Poland},

Abstract = {This article explains the public engagement of the Catholic Church in
   Poland in the post-communist period (from 1989 to approximately 2015) as
   a symbolic challenge to the state. It draws on Simon Harrison's theory
   of symbolic conflicts-conflicts over symbolic capital-applied to power
   struggles involving religious actors in contemporary political systems.
   The Polish Church engaged in a valuation contest against the state in
   which it tried to champion its own religious interpretation of several
   key elements of Polish statehood and national identity using items from
   its own symbolic arsenal, including the notion of Pole-Catholic and an
   emphasis on the Christian origins of Poland. Similarly, by solemnizing
   state ceremonies with religious symbolism and politicizing the cult of
   religious figures, the Church sought to sacralize the public sphere.
   Although these challenges to the symbolic inventory of the state have
   not led to its total replacement by a competing set of religious
   symbols, the series of low-intensity conflicts generated a considerable
   amount of symbolic capital for the Church and contributed to maintaining
   its authority as a value-based public actor. This, ultimately, helped in
   sustaining the Church's political leverage throughout most of the
   post-1989 period, well into the second decade of the twenty-first
   century. It is only in the last few years that the Church's support for
   a more stringent abortion law, the scandals connected with sexual abuse
   by the clergy and its concealment by the hierarchy, and questions over
   Pope John Paul II's moral integrity have considerably harmed its public
   image.},

Title = {Neoclassical Realism as a Theory for Correcting Mistakes: What State X
   Should Do Next Tuesday},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Neoclassical realism has carved a unique niche by offering a
   theoretically derived and empirically rich foreign policy analysis
   framework. Over the years, it has branched out as a theory of mistakes
   (Type I), a theory of foreign policy (Type II), and a theory of
   international politics (Type III). This article proposes another
   challenge to consolidate its offer of a progressive research agenda to
   position it as a theory for correcting mistakes. The theory of mistakes
   version differentiates ideal from actual foreign policy. The ideal
   corresponds to foreign policy that follows the pressures and incentives
   of the international system; structural realism, the basis for this
   optimal baseline, is here viewed as a normative theory. If there is a
   gap between the ideal baseline and the actual outcome, then foreign
   policy is sub-optimal and therefore costly. According to neoclassical
   realists, this is the result of the intervention of domestic political
   processes hijacking foreign policy. It follows that pointing out how to
   reduce the distorting impact of these domestic variables should help
   steer foreign policy toward optimality. By identifying the negative
   consequences that follow from a sub-optimal foreign policy, a theory for
   correcting mistakes also opens the door to developing prescriptions to
   manage the inevitable fallout.},
