Title = {`Can I Be Gay in the Army?': British Army recruitment advertising to
   LGBTQ youth in 2017-18 and belonging in the queer military home},

Abstract = {In 2017, the British Army opened its `This is Belonging' recruitment
   campaign, aimed at groups of young people who were considered
   traditionally less likely to join the Army, with marketing at Pride in
   London aimed at LGBTQ youth. The campaign's next phase, in 2018,
   consisted of live-action and animated YouTube videos targeting specific
   groups including young women, religiously observant youth, emotionally
   sensitive young men, youth with average fitness levels, and, in the
   animations, LGBTQ youth again. While every other theme appeared in both
   sets of videos, the live-action set contained a video depicting
   homosocial male bonding instead of any LGBTQ theme. The Army's
   acknowledgement of LGBTQ identities during recruitment in 2017-18
   suggested certain advances from the 2000s position where LGBTQ personnel
   were expected to keep their sexuality private. A close audiovisual
   analysis of the LGBTQ-themed video, `Can I be Gay in the Army?', and its
   intertextual relationship with the other videos nevertheless reveals
   hesitancy over how to represent a legibly gay male soldier that hints at
   limits to the institution's inclusion of sexual difference. Drawing on
   both `LGBT' and `Queer' scholarship, the paper illustrates how concepts
   of domesticity and futurity can contribute to critical understandings of
   LGBTQ military inclusion.},

Abstract = {The red or `Flanders' poppy has become the ubiquitous emblem of British
   war commemorations, yet it is also becoming more hegemonic and
   militaristic: the poppy's meaning has always been contested, but its
   dominant interpretation has become increasingly intolerant. Building on
   literature on the poppy and war commemorations, on pacifist approaches
   to security studies and on militarism, this article sketches a pacifist
   critique of the poppy's increasingly hegemonic militarism. It starts by
   sketching out a history of the poppy's contested meaning. A first-order
   critique then reflects on the hegemonic poppy narrative's internal
   dissonances, on the selective memory which it reveals, and on the
   blinkered horizon of compassion and identification which it promotes. A
   second-order critique exposes the broader political and ethical
   consequences including for the military-industrial-entertainment
   complex, for liberal institutionalist projects, and for veterans. The
   final section reflects on the resulting unease that can be triggered by
   the poppy's hegemonizing function in British civil religion and calls
   for poppy commemorations to better accommodate deeper reflections on the
   causes of war, militarism, and the potentially complicit role played by
   war commemorations.},

Abstract = {In line with the growing popularity of the concept of global governance,
   critiques have been voiced of its lack of concreteness and clarity,
   since it takes on different meanings depending on the context,
   interpretations, and understandings of those who use it. To navigate
   this polysemic swamp, eleven different ideas related to global
   governance are analyzed in the light of the problems they address, the
   variables they correlate, and the nonstate actors they consider. It also
   identifies three attributes of the concept that underpin its function as
   an analytical category in the understanding of global phenomena, as well
   as being the germ of a methodology of analysis.},

Abstract = {Environmental non-governmental organisations stood out during the 2016
   European Union referendum campaign. Despite clear reputational and
   regulatory risks, they participated in this fraught political debate in
   sharp contrast to other civil society sectors. This challenges common
   assumptions that material concerns, and ultimately survival, prevail in
   campaigning choices. We argue that campaigning choices reflect
   commitments to values that underpin these organisations' raison d'etre.
   Drawing on a pragmatist view of organisations, we analyse how external
   (media, regulatory) and internal (competence, governance processes)
   pressures shaped the campaigning choices of nine UK environmental
   organisations. We find that most environmental non-governmental
   organisations chose to engage, some even officially registering for
   Remain. Those active at the European Union level were most likely to
   engage - but also most open to criticism. Overall, environmental
   non-governmental organisations struggled to adapt their usual
   expertise-based, elite-focused campaigning style to the referendum which
   raises questions for civil society's ability to speak for Europe, and
   contribute to controversial democratic debates, beyond the United
   Kingdom.},

Abstract = {Whilst both the level and the make-up of public debt are high salience
   issues, the management of public debt seldom commands public attention.
   This study examines the quiet politics of public debt management in
   advanced capitalist societies, comparing debt management reforms and the
   everyday practice of debt management in Germany and the UK. We present
   evidence of two factors contributing to the political quietude around
   public debt management: a persistent absence of partisan contestation
   and conflict; and the dominance of `market discipline' as an
   interpretative frame, which prevents changes in interest rates and debt
   servicing costs to be seen as the product of faulty debt management. We
   also find that this quietude creates a space for the coordination and
   cooperation between contemporary capitalist states and large dealer
   banks, whose capacities effectively to act within their respective
   domains depend on each other.},

Abstract = {The scale of the difficulties encountered by the Russian military in
   Ukraine since 2022 has taken international experts by surprise. They
   reflect its unpreparedness for a high-intensity war that had not been
   prioritized by the General Staff, as well as the flaws in the ``new look
   reforms{''} carried out since 2008 in both the armed forces and the arms
   industry in a relatively unstable context. The fragmentation of the use
   of force on behalf of the Russian state between the regular army and
   other players -including the Wagner group- is just one sign of the
   corrosion caused by this ill-conceived and ill-calibrated military
   adventure. The Ukraine war, which has shaken the balance of the Putin
   regime, has also had an impact on the relationship between the
   government and the military, the latter benefiting from the distant
   support of a Russian population which has grown accustomed to thinking
   of itself as being attacked by the ``collective West{''}.},

Volume = {3},

Abstract = {The causal relationship between trust and corruption has sparked heated
   scholarly debates. This study holistically explores the impacts of three
   typical forms of trust, namely, general, particular, and institutional
   trust, on the level of corruption across countries. Furthermore, it
   advances the extant literature by examining how the three types of trust
   moderate the impacts of formal institutions on corruption. This study
   draws on a cross-national dataset and uses the two-stage least-squares
   (2SLS) method to address endogeneity bias in the causal relationship
   between trust and corruption. As shown by the results, the impacts of
   the three forms of trust on corruption level are conditional on the
   efficiency of rules, and the function of rules is also dependent on
   trust. Specifically, general and institutional trust reinforce the
   positive effects of rule efficiency on corruption containment, while
   particular trust undermines the positive effects.},

Abstract = {After a decade of reforming and stabilising the Economic and Monetary
   Union (EMU), it has been put to a triple test: the COVID-19 pandemic,
   the war in Ukraine, and the return of inflation have posed serious
   challenges to the eurozone that call for policy responses. Against the
   background of recent advances in European integration theory, we assess
   whether and how these challenges have led to a change in the EMU policy
   of the eurozone's most powerful member, Germany. We conceptualise three
   ideal-typical policy options for Germany to deal with EMU's challenges
   and we search for traces of policy learning from past eurozone crisis
   management. On the basis of semi-structured interviews with German
   political elites, we cannot identify any significant change in Germany's
   EMU policy. We conclude that the unwavering continuity of Germany's euro
   policy makes further substantial integration in EMU unlikely.},

Abstract = {A substantial literature in political psychology has emphasized the
   importance of personality traits for understanding differences in
   political participation. One such trait is extraversion. However, the
   causal status of this relationship is complicated by a number of issues,
   not least genetic confounding stemming from the heritability of both
   personality traits and political participation. This study confirms the
   well-established naive relationship between extraversion and
   participation, but goes on with (a) a discordant MZ twin design and (b)
   a new approach using measured genetic variation, or a polygenic index,
   in the given trait (extraversion) to assess the causal nature of this
   relationship. First, utilizing variation in extraversion and
   participation within identical twin pairs shows that twins with higher
   extraversion do not participate more. Second, random variation within
   fraternal twin pairs in a polygenic index of extraversion does predict
   trait extraversion, but does not predict political participation. In
   summary, previously identified associations between extraversion and
   political participation are not likely to be causal, but instead reflect
   common underlying familial factors.},

Abstract = {2019 has been the most violent year on record for health workers in the
   Democratic Republic of the Congo. Attacks on healthcare coincided with
   the first-ever Ebola outbreak in an active conflict zone. Many of the
   attacks on the Ebola response were perpetrated by civilians who intended
   to disrupt the response, which in turn contributed to the spread of the
   virus. Why would communities attack the very people trying to protect
   them from disease? This mixed-method study examines the case of violence
   against Ebola responders during the Democratic Republic of the Congo's
   tenth Ebola outbreak from 2018 to 2020. First, an `explaining-outcome'
   process tracing reconstructs key events that led to the violent
   resistance of the population. I find that - contrary to popular belief -
   distrust alone was not the main driver. Rather, I argue that the
   politicization of the response provoked violent popular resistance.
   Second, an interrupted time-series model shows that the exclusion of
   three regions from the presidential election due to Ebola led to a
   significant increase in attacks on Ebola responders. The analysis
   demonstrates that the behavior of healthcare responders has limited
   ability to build trust when other political dynamics are at work. The
   article illustrates how combining process tracing with quantitative
   causal inference methods enables the simultaneous inquiry of cause,
   mechanism, and effect.},

Abstract = {Despite increasingly programmatic politics and competitive elections,
   political clientelism remains an enduring feature of African politics.
   More so, while politicians rarely deliver on political promises,
   citizens continue to demand and participate in patron-client relations.
   While moral economy and instrumentalist accounts offer insight into the
   puzzling persistence of political clientelism, we offer an additional
   framework based on demands for social recognition. Beyond expectations
   of materialist exchange or the performance of cultural norms, citizens
   expect their political leaders to recognize them as dignified human
   beings and members of an identity group. Drawing on evidence from three
   diverse African contexts-urban Ghana, rural Senegal, and coastal
   Kenya-we argue that citizens engage in political clientelism as a
   vehicle for demanding three dimensions of social recognition: (i) To be
   seen and heard by leaders, (ii) to be respected as agents in the
   political process, and (iii) to be politically included and protected
   from harm. By providing new insights into the enduring logics of
   clientelism, citizen strategies amidst unequal power relationships, and
   the role of emotions in democratic politics, we aim to reconcile
   existing approaches and bring them into a more unified framework.},

Abstract = {Research has identified several factors that impact the sustainability
   of post-conflict territorial autonomy arrangements (TAA), including
   previous levels of violence, economic development in a given territory,
   or the strategic importance thereof. We argue that a hitherto neglected
   variable lies in the legal form of the autonomy agreement-that is, the
   degree to which it has been `legalized' by the language and processes
   prescribed in the agreement. Based on a qualitative evaluation, we
   assess the legalization degree of 236 TAA signed between 1990 and 2019.
   Survival analyses and Cox regression models show that a higher degree of
   legalization has a positive and significant effect on peace durability.},

Abstract = {Despite the growing prevalence of the China threat discourse, its
   extensive historical complexity is seldom fully explored in existing
   academic literature. The article unitizes the enormous data of Google
   Ngram Viewer to track the evolution of the China threat discourse among
   American elites over the last seven decades. This article argues that
   understanding the China threat discourse requires a dynamic perspective
   that considers historical context and demonstrates that American elites'
   perception of China has shifted from ideological and military hostility
   to concerns over China's rising economic power and challenges that
   China's political system might pose. The article suggests that the
   drivers underlying the China threat discourse are historically
   contingent and evolve alongside changes in China's national strength and
   the perception of China's politics, highlighting the significance of
   both material and ideational drivers in shaping the China threat
   discourse.},

Abstract = {Several men committed mass violence in the past decade because they
   believed women were denying them the sex they felt they deserved. In the
   wake of their attacks, investigators found references to an online
   community known as Incels in their manifestoes and social media posts.
   Members of this community typically adhere to misogynistic beliefs that
   deny women their autonomy, deride sexually active men, and condone
   violence against both. Using Hamm and Spaaij's lone-wolf radicalization
   model, this article argues that the most violent members of the Incel
   community engaged in lone-wolf terrorism based upon their grievances
   with women. Furthermore, this article suggests that the influential
   impact of misogyny as a political element can contribute to lone-wolf
   terrorism. Accounting for these aspects will require modifications to
   the radicalization model that include factors such as domestic violence
   and misogyny.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the candidate selection process for realistic
   list positions with regard to multiple-office holding and personal
   characteristics in flexible-list proportional representation (PR)
   systems within the Czech context. More specifically, this issue is
   explored in the 2006-2017 elections to the Czech Chamber of Deputies.
   Results of binary logistic regression analysis with observations
   clustered by party or constituency indicate that incumbents (with or
   without multiple office holding) stand a significantly higher
   probability of being selected as a realistic candidate. This probability
   increases only if the incumbent also has the regional mandate. The
   results also show that candidates with a PhD degree or higher, with a
   higher public office position, at the age of forty-one to fifty years,
   or with residence in a regional capital or in Prague have a significant
   probability of being selected as a realistic candidate. A specific
   gender bias was also found.},

Abstract = {As non-majoritarian institutions are deliberately insulated from
   electoral pressure and ministerial hierarchy, they face an
   accountability deficit. This deficit can be reduced by embedding the
   organizations in a wider accountability landscape with multiple forums.
   Of particular relevance in this landscape are the news media, who may
   not only serve as account-holders, but can also reinforce other forms of
   accountability. Yet, we know little about the conditions under which the
   media cover non-majoritarian governance, and the existence of
   ``reinforced accountability{''}. Focusing empirically on news articles
   about the Bank of England (1997-2020), we trace coverage levels back to
   the announcement of key policy decisions and, to some extent, policy
   outcomes. We also find evidence of reinforced accountability, both in
   relation to parliamentary oversight and the Bank's own, voluntary
   account-giving. These results provide reason for cautious optimism about
   non-majoritarian accountability, at least in the case of a salient
   organization.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of ideations in the de-problematization
   process of the governance of ``migration crises{''}. Ideations, for
   example, in the form of frames often simplify social reality and do not
   allow us to understand the nature of a problem policy-makers are dealing
   with. To show this, I use the example of the ``European Migrant
   Crisis,{''} to illustrate that it is, in fact, a wicked problem. The
   ``wicked problem{''} concept describes a complex and contingent problem
   and, in essence, a set of ``un-owned{''} processes. It further dissolves
   local and global distinctions and forces to connect micro and macro
   processes at all times. In this article, I show that this ``migration
   crisis{''} (and also many others) consists of much more than just a
   humanitarian or security crisis but is also constituted by geopolitical
   crises and crises of political institutions. A relational approach seems
   most pertinent to be able to grasp all these aspects and helps us to
   stop de-problematizing it and instead problematize it adequately. It
   also advocates for the circumvention of ideations as they are a main
   source for the de-problematization of wicked problems.},

Abstract = {In Mexico City, son jarocho is a traditional music and dance form widely
   associated with nonviolent political activism. During the massive
   protests in response to the abduction of 43 students in 2014, the
   Jaranero Contingent for Ayotzinapa, a collective of son jarocho
   practitioners, presented the public with a counterhegemonic performance
   of history by ``tuning{''} its traditional repertoire to frame
   contemporary struggles. By mobilizing its improvisatory discipline, it
   constructed a dialogue with the march itself-harnessing the sonic
   potential of the streets to reframe sites of collective memory.},

Abstract = {In multiparty governments, policymaking is a collaborative effort among
   the different incumbent parties. Often hidden by public debates about
   broader government policy, the necessary coordination routinely happens
   at the ministerial level, where ministries of different parties jointly
   devise viable and equitable policy solutions. However, since
   coordination involves substantial transaction costs, governments must
   carefully gauge the potential benefits. We study the political
   rationales that motivate governments to make this investment. We argue
   that coordination during the process of ministerial policy design hinges
   on both a conducive ministerial structure and sufficient authority. Once
   these conditions are met, cross-party coordination is more likely in
   policy areas where the implementation of government policy cannot be
   taken for granted. We investigate these claims, drawing on two new
   datasets. The first contains information about ministerial
   collaborations on all legislative projects sponsored by German
   governments, while the second maps the distribution of policy
   responsibilities among German ministries from 1976 until 2013, based on
   data about the policy briefs of all individual working units within the
   top-level federal executive. Given that ministries imprint their own
   perspective on legislation, our results are beyond administrative
   pedantries, but have substantial implications for the type and content
   of policies coalition governments formulate.},

Abstract = {How do armed actors affect the outcome of elections? Recent scholarship
   on electoral violence shows that armed groups use violence against
   voters to coerce them to abstain or vote for the group's allies. Yet
   this strategy is risky: coercion can alienate civilians and trigger
   state repression. I argue that armed actors have another option. A wide
   range of armed groups create governance institutions to forge ties of
   political authority with civilian communities, incorporating local
   populations into armed groups' political projects and increasing the
   credibility of their messaging. The popular support, political
   mobilization, and social control enabled by governance offer a means to
   sway voters' political behavior without resorting to election violence.
   I assess this argument in the context of the Peruvian civil war, in
   which Shining Path insurgents leveraged wealth redistribution and
   political propaganda to influence voting behavior. Archival evidence,
   time series analysis of micro-level violent event data, and a synthetic
   control study provide support for these claims. These results have
   implications for theories of electoral violence, governance by non-state
   actors, and political behavior in war-torn societies.},

Abstract = {This critical analysis explores the contradictions between the European
   Union's (EU) democracy promotion rhetoric and the underlying motivations
   behind these efforts, specifically in the context of the 2006
   Palestinian elections. Contrary to the traditional perception that EU
   democracy promotion aims to establish and strengthen democratic
   institutions and practices, this review argues that the primary goal is
   often to enforce stability under the expansive settler-colonial
   structure. The Palestinian elections of 2006 serve as a pertinent case
   study to illustrate this paradox. The EU's response to the victory of
   Hamas was marked by inconsistencies and contradictions, revealing the
   tension between its democracy promotion rhetoric and the prioritization
   of a kind of stability based on Israeli terms.},

Title = {Systemism and International Relations: How a Graphic Method Can Enhance
   Communication},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {This article brings a broad array of works, which pertain to different
   research areas of international relations (IR), into contact with each
   other via a graphic method, systemism, to obtain insights that otherwise
   might prove elusive. Completion of these tasks is anticipated to
   exemplify how the systemist approach can enhance communication
   throughout IR. Systemism is introduced as a graphic technique for
   communicating arguments. Systemist graphics are used to convey the
   contents of (a) two studies that focus on theory per se and (b) a range
   of topics-foreign policy analysis, forecasting, and conflict processes.
   Systematic synthesis focusing on the two works about theory and
   bricolagic bridging that is based on all five studies reveal the
   contributions of a systemist approach, respectively, to the logics of
   confirmation and discovery. Value added from the systemist approach is
   confirmed for both IR research and pedagogy.},

Abstract = {In the past four decades, Islamists have emerged as important actors in
   the politics of the Middle East and North Africa, seizing power in some
   cases. In response, scholars of MENA have been investigating Islamists'
   behavior and policies relating to a wide range of issues. And yet,
   despite its real-world and academic salience, empirical research on the
   relationship between contemporary Islamist rulers and minorities has
   been sparse. The paper investigates ruling Islamists' minority treatment
   in Sudan and Turkey. Observing a variation in treatment, the paper
   demonstrates that religious affiliation and religious-ideological
   motivations have little explanatory power in the cases. The paper argues
   that in effort to secure their power, Islamists will engage in alliance
   building with or against minority groups. Alliance building itself is
   affected by the strategic interactions between Islamists, minority
   groups and other key political actors as well as the regional and
   international environments.},

Abstract = {Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 shattered any remaining
   illusions that closer economic integration with Europe would lead
   Russia, over time, towards democracy at home and peaceful coexistence
   with its neighbors abroad. It reinvigorated the North Atlantic Treaty
   Organization (NATO) and jolted the European Union (EU) into cutting off
   trade and energy ties with Russia, while welcoming a massive flow of
   refugees from war-torn Ukraine. It empowered Central and East European
   states in the EU, reignited enlargement debates, and shifted NATO and
   Europe's borders to the north and east. Introducing a special issue,
   this article argues that the EU's peace through integration strategy has
   always existed side by side with NATO's peace through strength approach,
   in a broader European project with blurred boundaries. This war may
   force the EU to solidify its borders between an internal zone of
   integration and an external zone of strength projection and geopolitics.},

Title = {The deadly protection trap: the `instrumentalisation' of fundamental
   human right norms by state actors in the Mexican Drug War},
Journal = {CRITICAL MILITARY STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {236-258},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Despite a proclaimed strengthening of international human rights norms
   on an international level, the fundamental human `right to life' is not
   always able to act as a barrier against state violence and
   militarization on national levels. As illustrated by Operation Michoac
   \& aacute;n, which in retrospective marked the start of the Mexican
   `war' on drugs, the right to life has been interpreted and implemented
   by domestic state actors in ambiguous and often very counterproductive
   ways. Specifically, the argument to protect innocent citizens' lives
   against drug criminality served as a major justification for the use of
   lethal force by the military in Mexico. While norm compliance and
   so-called norm `localisation' processes have already received
   considerable scholarly attention, the possibility that state authorities
   evoke fundamental human rights norms for legitimizing their own violent
   practices (= norm instrumentalisation) has so far not formed part of the
   academic debate. This paper bridges this gap by conducting an in-depth
   discourse analysis of key state actor's statements surrounding the start
   of Operation Michoac \& aacute;n.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the development of legislative
   reforms for local self-self-government in Albania in order to identify
   the problems and challenges faced by a society that is developing the
   capacity for the functioning of local self-government whilst lacking
   historical experience and is under the influence of the effects of the
   trauma caused by the communist regime. The analysis of this legislative
   process and the perceptions of citizens highlights the challenges faced
   by the organization and functioning of local selfgovernment in
   developing democracies and the need for interventions to be made in
   legislation for the effective functioning of representative and direct
   democracy at the level of local.},

Abstract = {Employing loyal external appointees has been identified as a key
   strategy used by incumbents to gain control over the state bureaucracy.
   This phenomenon is known as politicization and has been associated with
   democratic backsliding. Frequently, career civil servants perceive these
   appointees as illegitimate outsiders, leaders whose main objective is to
   ensure political compliance rather than advance the organization's
   mission. In this study, we explore how civil servants interpret the
   presence of outside leaders in their organizations in the context of
   politicization and how this influences their job attitudes and
   behaviors. We use a mixed methods exploratory sequential design to
   examine a recent case of politicization in environmental agencies in
   Brazil. First, we interviewed 25 civil servants who reported an
   environment of abuse, fear, disengagement, and alienation due to the
   actions of outside leaders. We identified silence (both defensive and
   acquiescent) as a key outcome of this process. We extended and confirmed
   these findings with a quantitative study using a new sample of 255 civil
   servants. This second study allowed us to test the relationship between
   the variables identified in the qualitative analysis. Our combined
   findings indicate that politicization may reduce the effectiveness and
   capability of public agencies not only because some external appointees
   lack competence or a commitment the organization's mission (as suggested
   by previous studies), but also because their behaviors and decisions can
   have a significant negative impact on civil servants' job attitudes and
   behaviors.},

Abstract = {The Russian aggression against Ukraine has unleashed new fears of a
   nuclear war and also due to direct and indirect threats by the Russian
   side. As a consequence, it seems appropriate to re-open the debate about
   the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons, a debate led to
   somewhat inconclusive results by the ICJ Opinion of 1996 on the
   `Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons'. If some elements of
   rationality are left in this war, nuclear weapons will not be employed
   in Ukraine. The major casualty of this rhetoric could, however, be the
   far-reaching de-legitimisation of nuclear warfare achieved in the past.
   Therefore, the time has come to re-examine the ICJ assessments of 1996
   and to take a clearer stance in this regard which should be more
   appropriate as to the exigencies of modern international society. It is
   argued here that now the ICJ would come to different conclusions if
   seized again with the same questions as in 1996.},

Abstract = {This article examines James Mason's publication Siege, perhaps the most
   important text for neo-Nazis worldwide today. Taking a deep dive into
   the contents and various editions of this text, Johnson and Feldman
   treat Siege thematically, moving from vehement antisemitism and
   anti-black racism to Mason's revolutionary doctrines and advocacy of
   terroristic violence. The form taken by the latter is self-directed (or
   `lone wolf') terrorism, which Mason was the earliest to champion on
   amongst neo-Nazi militants. Some of Mason's violent legacies are then
   traced to the plethora of neo-Nazi cells and movements to have emerged
   in recent years, demonstrating how Siege has been a catalyst for
   attempts to overthrow the `System' of democracy in favor or a neo-Nazi
   ethno-state.},

Abstract = {We present the first large-scale comparative field experiment on
   appearance-based racial discrimination in hiring conducted in Europe.
   Using a harmonized methodology, we sent fictitious resumes to real
   vacancies in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, randomly varying
   applicants' ethnic ancestry (signaled foremost by name) and applicants'
   racial appearance (signaled by photographs). Applicants are young-adult
   country nationals born to parents from over 40 different countries of
   ancestry (N = 12 783). We examine average differences in callback across
   four phenotypic groups and four regions of ancestry and present the
   first cross-country comparable estimates of appearance-based racial
   discrimination reported in the field-experimental literature. We find
   that applicants' phenotype has a significant and independent effect on
   employers' responses in Germany and the Netherlands, whereas in Spain we
   only find evidence of hiring discrimination for particular combinations
   of phenotype and ancestry, which suggests a less direct and more complex
   effect of phenotype in this country. Implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article explores the use of populism by comparatively privileged
   groups, a specific type of populism we call the `populism of the
   privileged'. Our argument is not merely that `populisms of the
   privileged' are also forms of populism, but that they warrant a specific
   label. We first identify intersections between populism and privilege on
   the levels of populist actors, support for populism and beneficiaries of
   populism, which we call populism by, with and for the privileged. We
   then present a discursive conceptualization of `populism of the
   privileged'. Building on this we develop analytical strategies for the
   study the `populism of the privileged', zooming in on how `the people'
   and `the elite' are constructed in such populisms, their sociological
   directionality, the layeredness of privilege and un(der)privilege, the
   discursive construction of `crisis' and `unmet demands' and the role of
   discourses about populism in reproducing the claims of populisms of the
   privileged.},

Abstract = {Whether transparency policies are an effective tool for fighting
   corruption is still under debate. Some scholars have argued that making
   information available is insufficient for effective transparency. This
   effectiveness is moderated by the citizens' motivation to use the
   information and how public officers generate and store information. The
   latter suggests certain practices could undermine the value of
   information, but we still do not know enough about those. We argue that
   practices generating opacity are a way to undermine the value of
   information. To investigate this, we used a qualitative approach to
   explore the conditions or practices causing opacity in Mexican municipal
   governments. We found four tactics public officers use to generate
   opacity and three institutional conditions that allow it. These findings
   provide further insights into how the processing and use of information
   affect the effectiveness of transparency.},

Abstract = {Quantitative research into the effectiveness of the UN human rights
   treaty bodies (UNTBs) in eliciting remedial responses from states is
   impeded by a lack of usable data on how states respond to their
   decisions. The new Treaty Body Views Dataset (TBVD) aims to fill this
   gap. It comprises details on all published decisions in individual
   complaints cases issued by the UNTBs between 1979 and 2019 and matches
   these with information on their state of compliance. The TBVD can be
   used for research on the activities of the treaty bodies, the nature of
   the decisions themselves, or state behavior following a decision. An
   empirical application illustrates how the TBVD can advance knowledge
   about the factors that correlate with compliance with adverse UNTB
   decisions. Results show that the likelihood of implementation hinges
   critically on decision-level characteristics, and reveal differences and
   similarities between compliance with UNTB decisions and regional human
   rights court judgments.},

Abstract = {Digital election campaigning has undergone increased levels of scrutiny
   in recent years, with numerous calls for improved transparency. One key
   innovation has been the creation of online advertising archives offered
   by social media platforms such as Facebook, Google, and Snapchat. In
   this article, we compare what we know about digital campaigning in the
   United Kingdom from official election returns and Facebook and Google's
   online advertising archives. We analyse whether both transparency
   sources provide agreed standards of completeness, consistency, accuracy,
   and accessibility. We find that - despite the United Kingdom having an
   effectively world-leading transparency regime - this is not the case. We
   therefore consider a number of potential reforms to increase knowledge
   of the workings of campaigns at the national level.},

Abstract = {The study of multinational military interventions highlights the
   importance of four major factors to account for combat participation in
   US-led coalitions: threat perceptions, alliance considerations, domestic
   politics, and strategic culture. The latter, however, has been
   overlooked or uncorroborated by major cross-national accounts of
   coalition warfare. Building on the fourth generation of scholars working
   on strategic culture as well as legislative studies scholarship, we
   propose and put to empirical test a conceptualization of strategic
   culture that focuses on force conceptions, foreign policy roles, and
   domestic contestation of self-representations. Through a longitudinal
   and systematic qualitative content analysis of parliamentary debates
   that took place in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia from August
   2014 to December 2017, the article finds that force conception and
   domestic contestation are best associated with variation in allied
   participation in US-led combat operations. In contrast, foreign policy
   roles are not found to shed light on allied military participation. We
   conclude that more cross-national and within-case analyses of strategic
   culture hold the potential to contribute to our understanding of the
   peculiarities of coalition operations.},

Abstract = {Open public data portals have become one of the main technologies of
   public administrations for the exercise of transparency, accountability,
   citizen participation and co-production of public services. Few
   empirical studies have analyzed on a large scale the use of these
   platforms considering their multidimensional nature. This research
   offers an empirical analysis of how these technological artifacts are
   being used at the Spanish local level An observation of 66 open public
   data web portals enabled by Spanish municipalities with more than 50,000
   inhabitants has been carried out through a framework of indicators and
   dimensions based on previous literature. The results, derived from a
   descriptive statistical analysis of the state of evolution of the
   portals observed, show a certain preference for a technical development
   linked to transparency, as opposed to a social and reuse dimension. The
   implications of this study highlight an incipient transformation of
   local public administration, whereas the paradigm of smart public
   management -more participative and collaborative- has not yet fully
   accomplished. Also, this study provides a basis for the development of
   future research that requires further study of the dimensions of citizen
   participation and co-production by the advent of open public data.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to contribute to the discussion on designing
   alternative economic development indices by measuring economic progress
   in the face of the discontinuity of globalisation. To this end, we use
   different evaluation criteria for the `old' (1960-1990) and the `new'
   (1990-2019) globalisation. First, the historical context that has shaped
   the contemporary globalisation processes is outlined, which makes it
   possible to identify the 1990s and the subsequent change in the
   structure of the world industrial production and the world GDP as the
   most important tipping point. Based on the observation that none of the
   existing indices sufficiently cover all the issues, a new pilot measure
   of economic progress is proposed, which takes into account two time
   periods: the old (1960-1990) and the new (1990-2019) globalisation. The
   analysis of the data sample of 18 countries (G6, I6 and selected LDCs)
   using this measure makes it possible to assign their economies to four
   categories, depending on the results they have achieved; the `winners',
   the `losers', the `late-bloomers' and the `inmates of industry'.
   Furthermore, possible directions for the future research on the subject
   are indicated. The data set supporting this study has been made publicly
   available to help in its continuation.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to understand how cultural variables -
   collectivism and face concerns - influence perceived and ideal
   organizational conflict cultures in two multicultural societies.
   Design/methodology/approachIndividuals studying in Singapore (N = 162)
   and the USA (N = 216) completed an online survey. Hierarchical
   regression analyses tested the hypotheses. FindingsRegardless of
   cultural background, individuals prefer agreeable conflict cultures,
   with over 95\% scoring above the scale mid-point. Ideal passiveness
   varied; highly collective and mutual face concerned individuals were
   more likely to idealize active conflict cultures. Collectivism overall
   was associated with perceiving and idealizing active and agreeable
   conflict cultures, though some relationships were only significant for
   one sample. Self-face concerned individuals were more likely to perceive
   passive conflict cultures. Research limitations/implicationsCulture
   influences organizational conflict cultures, but not necessarily in
   stereotypical ways. Despite cultural and geographical differences, the
   data provide evidence for a universal preference for agreeable conflict
   cultures. This finding is encouraging, given the increase in workplace
   diversity and desire to be responsive to needs of equity and inclusion.
   Therefore, leaders and managers should strive to establish agreeable
   conflict norms, even in the most culturally diverse organizations. The
   young, college student sample may not represent all working people,
   although the authors only recruited students with jobs who worked 28 h
   per week on average. Originality/valueThis research demonstrates the
   value of considering multiple levels of influence on conflict, advances
   the theory and measurement of organizational conflict cultures and
   identifies powerful similarities among diverse employees.},

Abstract = {Viewing platforms as a new kind of factory and playground, scholars have
   investigated how the platform economy transforms work and entertainment.
   As dominant platforms continue to encroach on new markets and sectors,
   including the non-profit sector, few have examined the ramifications
   when they serve as a plaza for civic action. Despite the civic
   orientation of these platform activities, platforms can reconfigure the
   charity event and mediate civic interaction through the permissive power
   they possess to extract surplus value from users' online interactions
   invisibly. Drawing from the ethnographic fieldwork of the two
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) participating in a crowdfunding
   event in China, I show how the platform company creates a
   competition-based civic event to mobilize thousands of NGOs to crowdfund
   on their social media platform. In particular, the platform induced NGO
   workers working for those organizations to mobilize their networks for
   fundraising. Performing relational labor to persuade friends, families
   and acquaintances to give donations as a job responsibility deviated
   from the norms of reciprocity, which incurred workers' emotional, social
   and even financial costs. Invisibly, the platform extracts social
   capital from workers' relational labor.},

Abstract = {In the relationship between Brazil and the United States during the
   Bolsonaro and Trump administrations (2019 and 2020), Brazil advanced a
   demanding agenda that met with limited reciprocity. John Kingdon's
   concept of the policy window is useful for explaining that the two
   presidents, having similar worldviews, saw the possibility of moving
   forward with this agenda, but Brazil's subservient position ended up
   compromising its bargaining position. In the case of the commercial
   aspects of the Alcantara technological safeguards agreement, Brazil's
   unilateral concessions failed to generate concrete results before this
   window was closed and even set the country on the path toward becoming
   an international pariah. O governo brasileiro promoveu uma agenda
   ambiciosa que facilitou pouca reciprocidade na relacao entre o Brasil e
   os Estados Unidos durante os governos Bolsonaro e Trump (2019 e 2020). O
   conceito de John Kingdon do policy window e util para explicar o fato
   que ambos os presidentes, alem de partilhar visoes semelhantes do mundo,
   viram a possibilidade de avancarem esta agenda. Contudo, a posicao
   submissa do Brasil acabou em comprometer sua posicao negocial. No caso
   dos aspectos comerciais do acordo das salvagardas tecnologicas da
   Alcantara, o Brasil deixou passar essa oportunidade porque as concessoes
   unilaterais do governo brasileiro falharam em produzir resultados
   concretos e, ademais, colocou o pais no caminho de se tornar um paria
   internacional.},

Abstract = {This study proposes an organizational mechanism that links ideology to
   the use of terrorism in mass dissident campaigns. Ideology affects the
   level of competition among factions within mass dissident campaigns by
   shaping whether actors see their interactions as a positive- or zero-sum
   game. We identify ideological diversity within a campaign and the degree
   to which ideologies embrace the principle of pluralism as key factors
   affecting the intensity of factional competition and, consequently, the
   occurrence of terrorism. We introduce new data on the ideologies of
   campaigns from the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes 2.0
   dataset and use causal mediation analysis to test our proposed
   mechanism. We find that greater ideological diversity within a campaign
   increases the likelihood of terrorism by increasing factional
   competition. We also find that the presence of a pluralist ideology is
   associated with a lower likelihood of terrorism by the lowering of
   factional competition. By shedding light on the mechanisms that link
   ideology to terrorism, this study helps advance our understanding of why
   dissident groups might decide to use terrorism tactics within the
   context of a campaign of mass resistance.},

Abstract = {Traditionally perceived as a historical enemy, Turkey was `rediscovered'
   in Armenia after it actively supported Azerbaijan in the 2020
   Armenian-Azerbaijani war over Nagorno-Karabakh. This article traces some
   of the cultural-ideational reverberations of Turkey's `return' within
   Armenian society. It argues that the war was a (re-)formative moment
   since it simultaneously resulted in the emergence of new meanings and
   the revival of traditional ones. It brought the `distant' neighbour into
   Armenians' geographical/geopolitical imaginations, reshaping the meaning
   of Turkey and of the larger region for them. But it also reinforced
   long-established complex semantics of the ethnonym `Turk', setting the
   stage for its instrumentalisation in internal politics.},

Abstract = {An agency's self-portrayal can help to protect its jurisdictional turf
   and strengthen its reputational uniqueness. While prior reputational
   studies have shown that agencies are attentive to the media and
   political principals, they have not assessed how inter-agency dynamics
   might shape their public outreach and message. This paper argues that if
   multiple public agencies are confronted with a shared salient issue,
   such as the Covid-19 pandemic, they engage in `issue segmentation':
   mindful of each other's distinct jurisdictional and reputational
   profiles, their communication centers around sub-issues that do not
   overlap with core missions of other agencies. We assess this expectation
   via a study of Twitter communication of 38 European Union agencies
   related to Covid-19. Using an automated thematic analysis of tweets, we
   show that agencies engage in issue segmentation and focus on unique
   sub-issues. The findings contribute to a better understanding of public
   outreach of agencies in times of crisis.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the politics of on-demand food delivery
   using insights from the theory of social construction and policy design.
   On-demand food delivery is a service built on algorithm-based technology
   known for its precarity and physical risks for couriers. We compare how
   the on-demand food delivery sector is regulated and its observable
   effects in two Asia-Pacific cities with contrasting food courier
   profiles: Melbourne, Australia (international students), and Singapore
   (citizens, permanent residents). We show how the social construction of
   food couriers in other policy subsystems (migration, higher education,
   citizenship) affects debates of their fair treatment in the on-demand
   food delivery sector. By interrogating the politics of digitally enabled
   versions of reality, we argue for embracing a design perspective to
   identify how reforms could be introduced in change-resistant sectors.},

Abstract = {The complex relationship between local climate action and reducing
   global emissions is often difficult to grasp and cities might scale back
   their ambitions if they realize that the way is hard and rocky. We
   analyze local climate change narratives through the lens of the
   narrative policy framework (NPF). Following the NPF, policy actors use
   narratives to communicate information to change an existing system in
   order to achieve a specific goal. For our study, this implies that local
   climate action can be improved by using narratives to communicate
   information to achieve climate neutrality. We focus on the position and
   interplay of the most important and dominant actors and concepts in the
   plot of the narratives. To better analyze the main actors and content of
   the NPF plot in a systematic and comparable way, we offer the
   ``narrative rate index{''} to dynamically trace the narratives. To
   include the dynamics and effects of global significant developments in
   the plots of the NPF narratives, we selected three phases between
   January 2018 and June 2021. What are the main characters and dominant
   actors in the plot of the narratives in the two cases? Are the
   narratives different depending on the context of the city, and are there
   general observable patterns? Our findings identify the central actors in
   the narratives of both cities: the science institute in Karlsruhe and
   the City Administration in Mannheim. Karlsruhe, a climate change
   pioneer, has slowed down its climate change activities somewhat, while
   Mannheim is a latecomer with high ambitions.},

Abstract = {There is an extensive body of literature examining how rebel groups
   recruit civilians. Much of this scholarly work focuses on the role of
   material and ideological appeals in mobilizing recruits. However,
   despite expectations about the importance of recruitment processes,
   there is currently a lack of data on the persuasive recruitment
   practices of a large cross-section of groups, making it difficult to
   test a variety of implications stemming from theories about armed group
   recruitment. To remedy this, I developed original data-the Rebel Appeals
   and Incentives Dataset (RAID)-which contains information on 232 militant
   groups for the period 1989 to 2011. RAID details not only the specific
   types of recruitment appeals groups make, but the degree to which they
   rely on ideological appeals, relative to material incentives, for
   recruitment. To demonstrate the value of the dataset, I employ RAID to
   test two hypotheses about rebel recruitment and wartime rape derived
   from existing literature.},

Title = {Debunking the myth of the ``robust control regime{''}: UK arms export
   controls during war and armed conflict},

Abstract = {The UK's commitments to conflict prevention and the protection of human
   rights and international humanitarian law in its arms export controls
   are now over 20 years old. However, the outbreak of war or conflict has
   had little or no restraining effect on UK arms exports. This article
   explores the function of the UK's arms export control regime given that
   its primary effect is not to restrict arms transfers. I argue that the
   mantra that the UK has one of the most robust control regimes in the
   world is not a plausible description of the realities of UK export
   policy - rather, it is a myth that needs to be debunked. Export controls
   are primarily mobilised by the state to manage controversy once
   criticism emerges from civil society and Parliament and thus primarily
   serve a legitimating function. I illustrate this argument with examples
   of arms exports in relation to the conflicts in Kashmir, Sri Lanka, the
   Occupied Palestinian Territory and Yemen, demonstrating three ways in
   which UK export controls are missing in action: the routine misuse of
   UK-supplied weapons; the narrow interpretation of risk in licensing
   policy; and self-serving reviews to manage reputation once controversy
   breaks out.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that violent protests alienate the public. But
   violence could also create tactical disagreement among protesters and
   weaken their unity. So, to what extent does protesters' use of violence
   erode intra-movement cohesion? This article argues that protesters can
   preserve cohesion by falsifying their private moral preferences and
   restraining themselves from public denunciation, an act which I
   characterize as `tolerant solidarity'. Based on a survey experiment on
   participants of Hong Kong's 2019 protests, I examine how their private
   and public preferences toward violence change in response to three
   divisive conditions: protesters taking the initiative, violence causing
   physical harm, and violence targeting counter-protesters. Results show
   while these divisive conditions make respondents more likely to morally
   disapprove violence, the effects are weaker in their support for public
   denunciation, an indication that their private preferences are partially
   concealed. Findings contribute to the study of contentious politics by
   advancing a more complex understanding of movement cohesion when
   protester violence is involved.},

Abstract = {The perceived disconnect between policymaking elites and citizens has
   intensified demands for citizen engagement in democracies, but we know
   little about policymakers' attitudes towards increased citizen
   involvement. This study presents an in-depth, mixed-methods analysis of
   participatory views of politicians, public officials, and interest group
   representatives in Finland. We first utilize a unique survey battery
   presented to representative samples of policymakers (n = 675) and
   ordinary citizens (n = 1701). We then perform a qualitative content
   analysis for 24 in-depth interviews of high-ranking policymakers to
   explore reasons for the observed attitudes. We find that while citizens
   strongly support participatory attitudes, policymakers are more
   skeptical, especially when participation threatens their control of the
   policy process. Elite skepticism stems mainly from low trust in
   citizens' capacity to deal with complexity, and to relieve the pressure
   to engage citizens more elites support learning-based methods. The broad
   citizen-elite attitude gap may require re-negotiating representative
   mandates in the future.},

Abstract = {The proposal of the article is to advance on the concept of Hybrid World
   War and to relate it to the conflict between the United States and China
   in the present historical-spatial transition of the world system. The
   concept of Hybrid World War is developed in contrast to that of the New
   Cold War, and in relation to the characteristics acquired by the world
   capitalist system from 1970 to 1980 as a transnational system of
   production, trade, and finance, the dynamics of strategic competition in
   the crisis of the unipolar globalist order, and the characteristics of
   the rise of China and its significance, different from that of the USSR.
   From this conceptual framework, the United States-China rivalry is
   observed, analyzing: the systemic tension between unipolarism and
   multipolarism, the central dispute in Asia Pacific, and the development
   of a war on all fronts or unrestricted.},

Abstract = {A crackdown on the activities of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
   has recently swept the globe. When faced with increased restrictions,
   how do NGOs respond? We argue there is a curvilinear relationship
   between increases in NGO repression and the conflict-to-cooperative
   nature of NGO interactions with a government. On one end of the
   spectrum, when civil society repression is limited or nonexistent, NGOs
   have many reasons to be cooperative with the government. As NGO
   repression increases, we should see NGOs take more of a conflictual
   stance, publicly voicing their displeasure and bringing attention to the
   abuses and deficiencies they see within the regime. As NGO repression
   continues to increase, however, there will be a tipping point at which
   the NGOs that remain in the country will once again take a more
   cooperative tack with the government. We use a quantitative event data
   approach to examine the implications of our arguments.},

Abstract = {Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) principles have emerged as the
   template for e-waste policies, centered on establishing regulated
   collection and recycling channels. Originating in the global North,
   these policies are increasingly adopted in the global South where
   e-waste is primarily `managed' by the informal sector, centered in
   spatially defined hubs. These formal systems fail to achieve collection
   quotas, while further marginalizing informal recyclers by delegitimizing
   their access to e-waste. We suggest an alternative hub-centered approach
   to e-waste reform based on eight years of research and advocacy within
   the Israel-West Bank e-waste system. We offer several converging
   rationales for centralizing hubs in e-waste policies and a case study
   demonstrating an integrated hub-driven package of business, enforcement,
   and cleanup measures. While the unique complexities of the
   Israeli-Palestinian case offer an exceptional window into the dynamics
   of a hub-driven approach, similar packages might shape e-waste policy
   reform throughout the global South.},

Abstract = {Social capital is generally believed to facilitate protest mobilization.
   We examine, however, whether and how it might reduce an individual's
   tendency to join a protest. Analyzing survey data of a migrant
   population in Beijing, China's capital, we find that social capital
   operating as better embeddedness in local social networks lowers the
   likelihood of protest participation. We reason that, structurally,
   embeddedness in local networks provides access to support and
   assistance, reducing the attractiveness of disruptive means of
   problem-solving. Psychologically, such embeddedness mitigates the
   feeling of relative deprivation, reducing the possibility of such
   feelings accumulating and eventually translating into protesting
   actions. Regressions and structural equation models confirm our
   hypotheses, and we are also able to check the robustness of our findings
   with a different, much larger, cross-national dataset.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates specific challenges of Covid for balancing
   economic growth and financial stability as they apply to paradigms,
   programmes and policies of bank regulation and supervision at the
   European Commission and European Central Bank. It finds that dominant
   paradigms of risk reduction and control remained intact, despite a
   temporary programme of regulatory relaxation to spur credit growth. The
   ECB and the Commission were united on state aid, regulatory loosening
   and promoting credit creation. However, while the Commission sought
   credit for businesses, much of the credit went into the European housing
   sector, with ECB support.},

   through the eyes of the RAF veteran},
Journal = {CRITICAL MILITARY STUDIES},

Abstract = {Framed by the author's status as a former Royal Air Force (RAF)
   service-person and subsequently as a critical sociologist, this article
   considers the performative role of pride in both exceptionalizing and
   legitimizing military actors and the RAF, respectively. In so doing,
   auto-ethnographic material is included to reveal the mundane and
   unremarkable, yet illustrative experiences of the RAF clerk whose
   lifeworld as a military actor in a support role differs sharply from how
   he or she might be imagined by the wider public. In order to demonstrate
   this disparity in perception, attention is paid to the relative ease of
   RAF basic training, tensions between the assumed hardships of active
   service in a war zone and its reality, and the role of racism and
   individual agency in the RAF. Rather than pride, these reflections
   invoke a mix of authorial guilt and shame, the latter of which is rooted
   in the political role played by an institution whose violence is
   normalized and its members eulogized. The wider, normative aim of the
   article is animated by my own modest attempt to demilitarize through
   revealing the work pride does in canonizing an institution revered by
   the public.},

Title = {English Greenland mineral and petroleum exploration history in
   international political perspective},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Number = {1},
Pages = {142-157},
Abstract = {Greenland has a long mining and mineral exploration history. Despite
   sig-nificant political interest and investments, only few projects have
   been economically successful. Petroleum exploration has been more
   sporadic with hectic activity in the 1970'ties and in the new Millenium.
   Costs for explo-ration are in the same order for minerals and petroleum
   exploration but with large differences in the involved industry, the
   national companies and the effect on Greenland society and politics.
   Throughout history there has always been strong political focus on
   resources in Greenland, both in periods with Danish authority before
   1979, in the period with joint competence, and after Greenland took over
   full legislation and administration in 2009. Possible income from
   resource exploitation has always been a central part of the
   inde-pendence policy in Greenland but focus is changing towards foreign
   policy. In some periods other countries have shown interest for
   strategically important raw materials, especially cryolite and uranium
   during and after World War II, and in later years Rare Earth Elements.
   Greenland resources are part of a complicated geopolitical game between
   the US, EU, and China, and where Greenland is challenging the foreign
   policy of the Kingdom of Denmark and prepares for independence.},

   the ideas of humanism in a context of reflections upon Slavic cultural
   and literary reciprocity. In many cases, Gluchman agrees with Masaryk,
   although on the other hand he states that much of what Masaryk viewed as
   Kollar's shortcomings presented in the abovementioned book are at least
   partially answered in Kollar's two-volume sermons.},

Abstract = {Evaluation of investment projects is a crucial part of the investment
   decision-making process. Although dynamic evaluation techniques are
   precise and theoretically correct, they can still lead to the wrong
   investment decision. The main goal of this study was to identify the key
   drivers of investment projects' profitability from the point of view of
   the company, municipality and society. Data on 26 investment projects
   were gathered and analyzed. The results of the principal component
   analysis (PCA) showed that the net present value, when compared to the
   internal rate of return and discounted payback period, represents the
   key indicator of the profitability of investment projects. Also, PCA
   showed that the total sales and total costs, when compared to the
   initial investment and discount rate, represent the key factors that
   affect the profitability of investment projects. Regression analysis
   (OLS) confirmed these results since the total sales and total costs have
   the highest and statistically significant effect on the net present
   value of investment projects.},

Abstract = {Social distancing policies have been practiced in different regions
   around the world to minimize the number of cases of COVID-19. After an
   outbreak in mid-July 2020, the Hong Kong government adopted a series of
   adminis-trative measures and strongly encouraged residents to stay at
   home. This lockdown period provided an oppor-tunity to study variations
   in levels of aggression when people spend more time than usual in an
   overcrowded liv-ing environment. A total of 185 Hong Kong residents were
   recruited for this study. Their perceptions of the crowdedness of their
   living space, aggression level (measured using the BPAQ-SF), proneness
   to boredom (meas-ured by the BFS-SF), and perceptions of risk regarding
   COVID-19 were collected via online questionnaires. Per-ceived
   crowdedness, proneness to boredom, and perceptions of susceptibility to
   COVID-19 were found to signi-ficantly predict the variance of different
   types of aggression in a regression model. In a mediation analysis,
   anger acted as a mediator of the relationship between proneness to
   boredom and different types of aggression. Parti-cipants' perceptions of
   their susceptibility to COVID-19 suggested an underlying worry about the
   contagious-ness of the virus, which was in turn associated with feelings
   of uncertainty and a rise in aggression level.},

Abstract = {This study of the relationship between internet use and international
   trade finds that in many low and middle income countries, firms are more
   likely to engage in exports or imports if they use the internet as a
   communication tool. The effects are large: probit regressions indicate
   that trade participation is approximately 50\% greater for firms that
   use the internet as a means of communication compared with those that do
   not. This holds true for exports as well as for imports. Our findings
   further suggest that the association between trade participation and the
   use of the internet is particularly important for large firms and for
   firms with foreign owners. Our findings have important implications. In
   a globalized economy, firms' ability to engage in international trade is
   crucial for success or failure. Countries' policies to support
   development of the internet are therefore potentially very important for
   their development prospects.},

Title = {Do Exchange Rates Influence Voting? Evidence from Elections and Survey
   Experiments in Democracies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {77},
Number = {4},
Pages = {789-823},
Abstract = {Intense debate surrounds the effects of trade on voting, yet less
   attention has been paid to how fluctuations in the real exchange rate
   may influence elections. A moderately overvalued currency enhances
   consumers' purchasing power, yet extreme overvaluation threatens exports
   and economic growth. We therefore expect exchange rates to have a
   conditional effect on elections: when a currency is undervalued, voters
   will punish incumbents for further depreciations; yet when it is highly
   overvalued, they may reward incumbents for depreciation. We empirically
   explore our argument in three steps. First, we examine up to 412
   elections in up to 59 democratic countries and show that voters
   generally punish depreciation in the real exchange rate when the
   currency is undervalued. We also find that at extremely high levels of
   currency overvaluation, voters sometimes reward incumbents for
   depreciation. A currency peg, especially in the eurozone, appears to
   insulate incumbents from these effects. In a second step, we explore the
   microfoundations of the election results through survey experiments in
   three advanced industrialized and two emerging market nations with
   different monetary and exchange rate policies and institutions.
   Respondents in countries with undervalued to mildly overvalued
   currencies disapprove of currency depreciations, whereas those facing a
   very highly overvalued currency favor depreciation. Third, we examine
   the mechanism of political competition in exchange rate policymaking and
   demonstrate that sustained undervaluation is rare in countries with
   strong political competition. Democratic governments have electoral
   incentives to avoid using undervalued currencies as a means of shielding
   workers from import competition.},

Title = {Memory Entrepreneurship: Armenian Genocide Recognition in Europe},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {Scholars have analyzed how political actors appropriate
   Holocaust-related memory laws to whitewash the past and undermine
   democratic traditions in various European countries. However, political
   actors in Europe have debated several other memory laws, which far-right
   MPs appropriate to serve their own purposes. The recognition of the
   Armenian Genocide is an understudied example of this phenomenon. Drawing
   from data collected in four countries-Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,
   Latvia, and Sweden-this analysis introduces the rhetorical strategies of
   memory justification and memory extrapolation to examine how far-right
   MPs, in very distinct geopolitical contexts, appropriate and
   instrumentalize Armenian Genocide memory to attack pluralism and promote
   their own versions of Europe. Through an analysis of the
   instrumentalization of the Armenian Genocide, this article examines a
   growing crisis at the center of contemporary European politics. This
   crisis, which involves actors promoting very different goals and values,
   increasingly threatens the socio-political cohesion of Europe.
   Los academicos han analizado como los agentes politicos se han ido
   apropiando de las leyes de memoria relacionadas con el Holocausto con el
   fin de blanquear el pasado y socavar las tradiciones democraticas en
   varios paises europeos. Sin embargo, los agentes politicos europeos han
   debatido algunas otras leyes en materia de memoria, de las que se
   apropian los diputados de extrema derecha con el fin servir a sus
   propios fines. El reconocimiento del genocidio armenio es un ejemplo
   poco estudiado de este fenomeno. Este analisis presenta, a partir de
   datos recopilados en cuatro paises diferentes (Bulgaria, Republica
   Checa, Letonia y Suecia), las estrategias retoricas en materia de
   justificacion de la memoria y de extrapolacion de la memoria con el fin
   de desentranar como los diputados de extrema derecha, en contextos
   geopoliticos muy distintos, se apropian e instrumentalizan el
   reconocimiento del Genocidio Armenio con el fin de atacar el pluralismo
   y promover sus propias versiones de Europa. Este articulo estudia, a
   traves de un analisis de la instrumentalizacion del Genocidio Armenio,
   una creciente crisis existente en el centro de la politica europea
   contemporanea. Esta crisis, en la que participan agentes que promueven
   objetivos y valores muy diferentes, amenaza cada vez mas la cohesion
   sociopolitica de Europa.
   Les chercheurs ont analyse comment les acteurs politiques s'approprient
   les lois relatives au souvenir de l'Holocauste pour etouffer le passe et
   remettre en cause les traditions democratiques dans differents pays
   europeens. Or, les acteurs politiques europeens ont debattu de plusieurs
   autres lois sur le souvenir, que les deputes d'extreme droite
   s'approprient pour servir leurs propres interets. La reconnaissance du
   genocide armenien est un exemple sous-etudie de ce phenomene. En se
   fondant sur des donnees collectees dans quatre pays (Bulgarie,
   Republique tcheque, Lettonie et Suede), cette analyse presente les
   strategies rhetoriques de justification du souvenir et de
   l'extrapolation du souvenir pour decomposer comment les deputes
   d'extreme droite, dans des contextes geopolitiques tres differents,
   s'approprient et instrumentalisent la reconnaissance du genocide
   armenien pour s'attaquer au pluralisme et promouvoir leur propre version
   de l'Europe. Par le biais d'une analyse de l'instrumentalisation du
   genocide armenien, cet article s'interesse a la crise croissante au c oe
   ur de la politique europeenne contemporaine. Cette crise, qui implique
   des acteurs qui defendent des objectifs et valeurs tres differents,
   menace de plus en plus la cohesion sociopolitique de l'Europe.},

Title = {Super-Networks Shaping International Agreements: Comparing the Climate
   Change and Nuclear Weapons Arenas},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {While research on transnational advocacy networks (TANs) is well
   established in international relations, knowledge gaps remain concerning
   TAN collaboration across policy fields. To address this gap, this
   article highlights how super-networks (networks above individual TANs)
   emerge across issue areas and explores the tactics utilized to achieve
   their objectives and shape international agreements. We develop an
   analytical framework that emphasizes the important interplay between
   political opportunity structures, mobilizing structures, and tactics in
   understanding how super-networks operate. We apply this framework via a
   comparative case study approach, analyzing the Inter-Constituency
   Alliance, whose advocacy brought about the inclusion of human rights
   language in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, and the International
   Campaign for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons, whose activities based on
   humanitarian principles resulted in the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition
   of Nuclear Weapons. Contributing new knowledge to TANs research, we
   identify that super-networks utilize multilevel advocacy activities that
   draw upon a package approach tactic. Via the package approach,
   super-networks synthesize multiple voices from different issue areas
   into one key message grounded in humanitarian framing, thereby enhancing
   their moral leverage and legitimacy, making it more difficult for states
   to neglect their concerns.
   Podemos afirmar que, si bien la investigacion en materia de Redes
   Transnacionales de defensa (TAN, por sus siglas en ingles) esta bien
   establecida en el campo las Relaciones Internacionales, aun siguen
   existiendo lagunas de conocimiento en lo que respecta a la colaboracion
   con las TAN en todos los ambitos politicos. Este articulo subraya, con
   el fin de abordar esta brecha, como emergen las superredes (aquellas
   redes que estan por encima de las TAN individuales) en todas las areas
   tematicas y estudia las tacticas que utilizan para lograr sus objetivos
   y para dar forma a los acuerdos internacionales. Desarrollamos un marco
   analitico que enfatiza la importante interaccion que existe entre las
   estructuras de oportunidad politicas, las estructuras de movilizacion y
   las tacticas con el fin de comprender como operan las superredes.
   Aplicamos este marco a traves de un enfoque de estudio de caso
   comparativo que analiza la alianza entre diferentes grupos y organismos,
   cuya defensa dio lugar a la inclusion del lenguaje de derechos humanos
   en el Acuerdo Climatico de Paris de 2015, y la Campana Internacional
   para la Abolicion de las Armas Nucleares, cuya campana basada en
   principios humanitarios dio lugar al Tratado sobre la Prohibicion de las
   Armas Nucleares de 2017. Identificamos, al aportar nuevos conocimientos
   a la investigacion de las TAN, que las superredes utilizan actividades
   de promocion multinivel que se basan en una tactica de enfoque conjunto.
   A traves de este enfoque conjunto, las superredes sintetizan multiples
   voces procedentes de diferentes areas tematicas en un mensaje clave
   basado en el marco humanitario, lo que mejora su influencia moral y su
   legitimidad, y, en consecuencia, hace que sea mas dificil para los
   Estados descuidar sus preocupaciones.
   Bien que la recherche sur les reseaux transnationaux de defense des
   droits (RTDD) soit bien etablie en relations internationales, des
   lacunes persistent quant a nos connaissances sur la collaboration des
   RTDD dans les differents domaines politiques. Pour y remedier, cet
   article souligne comment les super-reseaux (les reseaux au-dessus des
   RTDD) emergent dans les domaines problematiques et s'interesse aux
   tactiques employees pour parvenir a leurs objectifs et faconner les
   accords internationaux. Nous developpons un cadre analytique qui
   souligne l'importance des interactions entre les structures
   d'opportunites politiques, en mobilisant les structures et les tactiques
   pour comprendre le fonctionnement des super-reseaux. Nous appliquons ce
   cadre par le biais d'une approche d'etude de cas comparative qui analyse
   l'Alliance entre les groupes d'interets (Inter-Constituency Alliance),
   dont le travail a permis l'inclusion de references aux droits de l'Homme
   dans l'Accord de Paris sur le climat de 2015, et la Campagne
   internationale pour l'abolition des armes nucleaires qui, en se basant
   sur des principes humanitaires, a debouche sur le traite sur
   l'interdiction des armes nucleaires de 2017. En apportant de nouvelles
   connaissances a la recherche sur les RTDD, nous identifions que les
   super-reseaux utilisent des activites de promotion a differentes
   echelles, qui se fondent sur une tactique d'approche << par paquet >>.
   Grace a cette approche, les super-reseaux synthetisent plusieurs voix
   emanant de differents domaines problematiques en un seul message cle
   ancre dans un cadre humanitaire. Ainsi, ils accroissent leur legitimite
   et leur influence morale, et deviennent plus compliques a ignorer pour
   les etats.},

Abstract = {Research often finds that immigrants tend to have a different profile
   from locals regarding confidence in the government. Both the origin's
   and destination's institutional features can influence immigrants'
   confidence. Scholars have relied on three major models-the
   cultural-persistence model, the performance model, and the
   dual-reference model-to explain the possible mechanisms behind this
   difference. Our research builds on previous studies by expanding the
   country coverage to explore the heterogeneity in immigrants' confidence.
   Specifically, we focus on how the level of democracy as an institutional
   factor is associated with immigrants' confidence. Using integrated
   datasets from the World Value Survey (WVS, 2017-21) and the European
   Value Study (EVS, 2017-20) and employing a multilevel model, we confirm
   that immigrants, on average, tend to have a higher level of confidence
   in the government. However, their confidence is contingent on
   institutional performance. In countries with high levels of democracy,
   the disparity in confidence between immigrants and locals becomes more
   pronounced. Moreover, the institutional performance in the origin
   country also influences immigrants' confidence in the government of the
   destination country. Immigrants constantly compare the institutional
   performance between the two places. Compared to immigrants from
   countries with a high level of democracy, immigrants from countries with
   a lower level of democracy tend to have higher confidence in the
   destination government. Our results provide support for all three major
   theoretical models.},

Abstract = {Do voters view cooperation between mainstream and radical parties
   differently when it occurs at the European as opposed to national level,
   and if so, why? Using an original survey experiment with over 8000
   respondents from Germany and Italy, this paper explores how voters react
   to cooperation with radical political parties at the national and EU
   levels once they are made aware that such cooperation is occurring. Our
   results show that voters react negatively to cooperation with radical
   political parties. We find that when voters are aware of such
   cooperation, they express similar levels of disapproval regardless of
   whether it occurs domestically or in the EU. These results have
   implications for our understanding of domestic and EU political
   processes, and point to the role of information as a fundamental factor
   enabling accountability at the European level.},

Abstract = {As the practice of revolution has evolved, so too have theories of
   revolution. Much of the current literature on revolutions focuses on
   contentious processes. But a need exists to take a more holistic
   approach-one that better incorporates history, thinks across divides in
   the literature, contemplates what precedes and follows revolution, and
   places revolutionary processes and the structural factors that underpin
   them into dialogue with one another.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the cases of Croatia and Serbia to demonstrate
   how the heteronormative model of family and the constructs of
   ``protection of family and children{''}-which are central to anti-gender
   mobilizations-can be traced to the 1990s heteronationalist discourses of
   family in both countries. The authors argue that the crucial link
   between these two discourses is that they both increasingly problematize
   diverse family forms and imbue ``traditional family{''} with special
   value as the structure that is ``best for children{''} and therefore
   merits special legal and policy protection with a view to its
   restoration as society's unquestionable cornerstone. The analysis of
   narrative content in parliamentary and public debates about
   family-related laws and policies in Serbia and Croatia between the 1990s
   and the 2020s is guided by the following questions: What are the
   continuities in the legal framework and narratives on the family in
   post-socialist Croatia and Serbia compared with the period of socialist
   Yugoslavia? Who are the actors who create narratives of return to a
   traditional family in post-socialist Croatia and Serbia, and how do
   these actors define family and care for the family? The article calls
   attention to how what is ``old{''}-narratives of return to the
   traditional family-forms the backbone of religious-conservative
   oppositions to gender and sexuality rights, including the most recent
   wave of anti-gender mobilizations.},

Abstract = {Research on the impact of COVID-19 on mobilization focuses extensively
   on the role of social media, conspiracy theories, and divisive
   narratives. However, individual perceptions remain insufficiently
   researched. This article argues that fantasmatic narratives are central
   to mobilization and aims to analyze changes in discourse during the
   pandemic as outcomes of shifts in fantasmatic logics. It applies the
   logics approach to the Lithuanian case to identify the main changes in
   fantasmatic logics of discourse that became apparent in response to
   government action. The article analyzes data from social media posts,
   gathered over a period of two months (June-August 2021), the period
   centered around the announcement of the ``quarantine of the
   unvaccinated.{''} The analysis revealed significant changes in
   fantasmatic logics of discourse-the Other was no longer seen as corrupt
   for their own gain by the protesters, but as purely evil, which in turn
   led to openness to various conspiracy theories.},

Title = {Blame avoidance and credit-claiming dynamics in government policy
   communications: evidence from leadership tweets in four OECD countries
   during the 2020-2022 COVID-19 pandemic},

Abstract = {Government information activities are often thought to be motivated by a
   classic calculus of blame minimization and credit maximization. However,
   the precise interactions of ``blame{''} and ``credit{''} communication
   activities in government are not well understood, and questions abound
   about how they are deployed in practice. This paper uses Natural
   Language Processing (NLP) machine-learning sentiment analysis of a
   unique dataset composed of several thousand tweets of high-level
   political leaders in four OECD countries-namely the Prime Ministers of
   the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and Canada-during 2020-2022 to
   examine the relationships existing between ``blame{''} and ``credit{''}
   communication strategies and their relation to the changing severity of
   the COVID-19 pandemic, both in an objective and subjective sense. In
   general, the study suggests that during this high-impact, long-lasting,
   and waxing and waning crisis, political leaders acted in accordance with
   theoretical expectations when it came to communicating credit seeking
   messages during the periods when the COVID situation was thought to be
   improving, but they did not exclusively rely upon communicating blame or
   scapegoating when the situation was considered to be deteriorating. The
   consequences of this finding for blame and credit-based theories of
   government communication are then discussed.},

Abstract = {Despite reports of longterm cognitive and emotional difficulties after
   exiting right-wing extremist groups, the latter stages of the extremist
   group member's trajectory have been given little attention.1 This paper
   argues that clinical psychological theory has been underutilised in
   terrorism and extremism research in general, and, more specifically,
   that it can make a significant contribution to the understanding of the
   development and maintenance of unhelpful thinking that can hamper and
   prolong the reintegration process. The empirical data presented consists
   of sixteen life-history interviews and one group interview with three
   men who were former members of white supremacist groups. By applying
   codebook thematic analysis, five automatic cognitive distortions that
   developed during group membership and persisted after leaving were
   identified. These distortions offer a clinical explanation for the
   unwanted negative and automatic group-related cognitions and concomitant
   emotions that continue long after leaving. It is argued that CVE
   interventions should be informed by a recognition of the ways in which
   cognitive distortions can negatively affect the exit process.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to examine the role of stakeholders and their
   interconnected relationships based on power and interests in realising
   sustainable development in coastal areas using the Maritime Village
   program in Tambaklorok, Semarang City, Indonesia as a case
   study.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from in-depth
   interviews and focus group discussions (FGD) with stakeholders,
   observations, as well as online news, and official government reports,
   followed by taxonomic analysis.FindingsThe results showed the four
   categories of stakeholders, namely players, context setters, subjects,
   and crowd. The Ministry of Public Works and Housing (PUPR), Regional
   Development Planning Agency (BAPPEDA) of Semarang City, Spatial Planning
   Agency (DISTARU) of Semarang City, and the Fisheries Office of Semarang
   City were found to be key players with a role in the success of the
   program. PT Pelindo (Indonesia Port Corporations) was identified as a
   context setter with low interests but high power, acting as an
   accelerator in the development program.Originality/valueThe originality
   of this study lied in its examination of the power and interests of
   stakeholders involved in government projects. It was recommended to
   strengthen coordination among the stakeholders to ensure the success of
   the program.},

Abstract = {How does a technocratic entity, such as a central bank, craft a key
   policy intervention when faced with limits to established frameworks of
   governance? This article explores the Bank of England's turn to
   unconventional policy in 2009 drawing on a set of eighteen in-depth
   interviews with former members of the Monetary Policy Committee,
   Executive team, and staff economists, and a corpus of documents.
   Adopting Goffman's `framing analysis', it argues that the limits to
   established governance led to the temporary replacement of the New
   Keynesian frame with a Monetarist frame, as a result of expert
   struggles, with consequential outcomes on the policy intervention. As
   the backstage dissensus spilled over onto the frontstage, manifesting as
   limits to knowledge, the Bank's `expert authority' was threatened. The
   Bank engaged in `manufactured consensus'-a backstage compromise between
   competing frames forged into a frontstage consensus via a hybrid
   frame-which proved to be a fragile strategy. By throwing light on the
   backstage-frontstage relations of technocratic organizations, I claim
   that an intervention may be shaped both by internal processes as well as
   by the ways in which the organization seeks to handle the external
   demands to which those very same internal processes may give rise.},

Title = {Losing control is not an option. Resource allocation to police oversight
   agencies in Western states},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},

Volume = {102},

Pages = {1095-1118},

Abstract = {Independent police oversight is a specific government delegated function
   that has been neglected by scholars of regulation. The main goal of this
   article is to understand the allocation of state resources to
   independent police oversight agencies (POAs) in the post delegation
   stage. We test whether the aim of delegation is better governance in
   complex areas to increase police agents' accountability ({''}policy
   complexity{''}) or to avoid political costs of agencification
   ({''}agency losses{''}). A survey of 27 POAs in Europe and Canada shows
   that POAs tend to receive significantly fewer state resources when they
   have a high level of formal independence or strong legal empowerment.
   Resource allocation seems more congruent with an ``agency losses{''}
   logic than with the goal of making regulation more efficient. Our
   findings have notable implications for international norm-setting bodies
   (the UN, the Council of Europe), who have not sufficiently codified the
   allocation of resources.},

Abstract = {This article goes beyond the presentation, assessment and discussion of
   the Berggruen Governance Index by suggesting potential next steps for
   governance indicators and relevant data systems more generally.
   Specifically, it addresses four ways to advance research on governance
   performance. The first two, greater cross-validation and
   cross-fertilisation and a systematic assessment of the legal-regulatory
   context, address the two major challenges of current research, namely
   the weak connection between the theoretical understanding of governance
   and the current stock of indicators as well as the tenuous connection
   between conceptually grounded indices on the one hand and the needs of
   policymakers to have actionable results on the other. The other two
   proposals, that is the development of governance operationalisations
   based on network structures and the notion of planetary governance,
   suggest transcending the current nation-state and variable-based frame
   for governance indices towards actor-based indicators and dashboards.},

Abstract = {This research investigates the impact of coastal management regulations
   on Indonesia's tourism. Through literature review, it examines the
   effectiveness of statutory regulations. In order to manage coastal
   resources sustainably, comprehensive legislation and stakeholder
   involvement are needed. The importance of laws such as the PWP3K,
   Spatial Planning, and Job Creation for regulating coastal areas is
   underscored. These laws and regulations have a crucial role in achieving
   integrated and sustainable coastal area management, which must be
   implemented through spatial planning policies. Sustainable development
   requires a legal basis for coastal spatial planning regulations based on
   the 1945 Constitution and Pancasila philosophy.},

Abstract = {The economic costs of environmental regulations are well documented, but
   their political cost is still unclear, especially in cases of
   substantial pollution reduction. This study presents empirical evidence
   for the unexpected political costs of China's war on air pollution.
   Using a clean energy regulation as a case, we demonstrate that it
   significantly reduces air pollutants over a short period; however,
   exposure to the regulation erodes local political support and trust in
   government officials. In addition, we show that stringent environmental
   regulations significantly reduce local political trust when it entails
   high policy costs for local residents and had weak policy participation.
   Our results indicate that stringent regulations may improve
   environmental quality at the cost of local political legitimacy.

Abstract = {Viktor Orban has been a key figure in increasing the role Euroscepticism
   plays in European integration. By developing a new relational approach
   to rhetorical political analysis, this article examines how Orban uses
   Eurosceptic rhetoric to move the largely pro-EU Hungarian public towards
   an EU-critical position. By analysing the Hungarian Prime Minister's
   speeches and interviews, it identifies three strategies of Eurosceptic
   positioning, political, cultural, and democratic, by which Orban
   strategically creates distance between the EU and Hungarian voters
   regarding the EU's migration policy. Orban's dynamic positioning
   expressed through his Eurosceptic rhetoric allows him to be pro- and
   anti-integrationist simultaneously.},

Abstract = {What explains the variation in countries' propensity to engage in
   austerity policy? Economic and political country-level factors are the
   paramount explanations in the literature. Nevertheless, variation in
   fiscal preferences at the executive level remains underexplored, except
   for ideology. Moreover, budget decisions are endogenous to the state of
   the economy, thus casting doubt on standard measures based on the debt
   and/ or deficit ratio. This article contributes to the literature in two
   ways. First, I turn to the individual level of analysis and suggest that
   leaders with business experience are more likely to pursue a balanced
   budget and tend to implement fiscal consolidation policies based on
   spending cuts. Second, I ease concerns about individuals' self-selection
   into office by relying on fiscal adjustments that are weakly orthogonal
   to the economic cycle. The statistical analysis of a panel of 17 OECD
   countries between 1978 and 2014 confirms the theoretical expectations.
   The results are robust to a variety of specification and statistical
   methodologies and hold for a subset of as-if random leadership
   transitions following close elections. A case study of Brian Mulroney's
   governments in Canada (1984-93) further illustrates the argument.},

Title = {Theorizing Decision-Making in International Bureaucracies: UN
   Peacekeeping Operations and Responses to Norm Violations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {Many international organizations (IOs) provide assistance to governments
   through country offices or peacekeeping operations. Sometimes,
   government authorities in countries receiving IO services violate norms
   that underpin the IO's engagement. IO officials must then choose between
   confrontational and conciliatory responses. These responses are located
   on a spectrum that ranges from a firm and public response to silence and
   downplaying. How do IO officials decide on their response? Based on over
   200 interviews with UN peacekeeping officials, we argue that the factors
   that shape their decision-making are found across three categories:
   individual, departmental, and positional. In terms of individual
   characteristics, previous experience, career security, and the length of
   service at a particular duty station matter. Regarding departmental
   factors, politicization of work, professional composition, and the type
   of interlocutors predispose departments to be supporters or critics of
   authorities in recipient countries. In terms of positional
   considerations, the place of a post or department in the IO hierarchy,
   relations with other IO entities, and the distance from the field play a
   role. While important in its own right, decision-making by civilian UN
   peacekeeping officials is informative about similar processes in other
   complex international bureaucracies that employ individuals from diverse
   backgrounds.
   Muchas organizaciones internacionales (OOII) prestan asistencia a los
   Gobiernos a traves de oficinas en esos paises o de operaciones de
   mantenimiento de la paz. A veces, las autoridades gubernamentales de los
   paises que reciben servicios de las OOII quebrantan las normas que
   sustentan el compromiso de las OOII. Los funcionarios de la OOII deben
   entonces elegir entre emitir respuestas de caracter confrontacional o de
   caracter conciliatorio. Estas respuestas se situan dentro de un espectro
   que abarca desde respuestas firmes y publicas hasta respuestas basadas
   en el silencio y en la minimizacion del asunto. Como deciden los
   funcionarios de las OOII cual sera su respuesta? Partimos de la base de
   mas de 200 entrevistas con funcionarios de mantenimiento de la paz de la
   ONU, con el fin de argumentar que los factores que dan forma a su toma
   de decisiones se encuentran divididos en tres categorias: individuales,
   departamentales y posicionales. En cuanto a las caracteristicas
   individuales, se considera que son relevantes la experiencia previa, la
   seguridad en la carrera y la antiguedad en el servicio dentro de un
   lugar de destino determinado. En lo que se refiere a los factores
   departamentales, vemos como la politizacion del trabajo, la composicion
   profesional y el tipo de interlocutores predisponen a los departamentos
   a ser partidarios o criticos de las autoridades de los paises
   receptores. Con respecto a las consideraciones posicionales, tanto el
   lugar que ocupa un puesto o un departamento dentro la jerarquia de la OI
   como las relaciones con otras entidades de esa OI y la distancia
   existente desde el terreno juegan un papel importante. Si bien la toma
   de decisiones por parte de los funcionarios civiles de mantenimiento de
   la paz de las Naciones Unidas es importante por derecho propio, tambien
   resulta informativa sobre procesos similares en otras OOII que emplean a
   personas de diversos origenes en burocracias complejas.
   De nombreuses organisations internationales (OI) apportent leur aide aux
   gouvernements par le biais de bureaux nationaux ou d'operations de
   maintien de la paix. Parfois, les autorites gouvernementales des pays
   recevant un service des OI violent les normes qui sous-tendent
   l'implication des OI. Les officiels des OI doivent ensuite choisir entre
   la confrontation et la conciliation. Ces reponses se situent sur une
   palette qui va de la fermete et la publicite au silence et a la
   minimisation. Comment les officiels des OI decident-ils de la reponse a
   adopter ? En nous fondant sur plus de 200 entretiens avec des officiels
   du maintien de la paix de l'ONU, nous affirmons que les facteurs qui
   faconnent leur prise de decisions peuvent etre personnels, ou bien en
   lien avec leur service ou leur fonction. En termes de caracteristiques
   individuelles, l'experience anterieure, la securite professionnelle et
   la duree du service a un poste particulier sont importantes. A l'egard
   des facteurs lies au service, la politisation du travail, la composition
   professionnelle et le type d'interlocuteurs predisposent les services a
   soutenir ou critiquer les autorites des pays beneficiaires. Sur le plan
   des considerations vis-a-vis de leur fonction, la place d'un poste ou
   d'un service au sein de la hierarchie de l'OI, les relations avec les
   autres entites d'OI et la distance par rapport au terrain jouent un
   role. Bien qu'elle soit importante en elle-meme, la prise de decisions
   par les officiels civils du maintien de la paix de l'ONU nous renseigne
   quant aux processus similaires dans d'autres OI qui ont recours a des
   personnes aux profils divers au sein de bureaucraties complexes.},

Title = {Civil War Mediation and the Conflict Environment: Does Regional
   Instability Influence the Onset of Mediation?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {Hostile regional environments can spur civil war at home. Do they also
   affect mediation in a state's ongoing civil war? We hypothesize they do,
   but in ways that produce competing effects: Third parties hesitate to
   offer mediation in a conflictual environment, but hostile environments
   also make disputants more amenable to mediation. We test these diverging
   expectations using a measure of conflict environments that aggregates
   spatially and temporally proximate civil war in a state's neighborhood.
   Our empirical analyses reveal that third parties are significantly less
   likely to offer mediation as exogenous factors mount, a finding that
   holds even for third parties who have historic or security linkages to
   the civil war state. However, we find limited evidence that disputants'
   decisions to accept mediation are driven by regional security concerns.
   Instead, local conflict conditions present more pressing concerns that
   drive disputants to accept offers to mediate. Taken together, the
   findings suggest potential mediators should pay attention to both a
   civil war state's regional environment and local conditions, lest they
   underestimate disputants' willingness to come to the table. Our work
   newly underscores the costs and risks associated with conflict hot spots
   and the risk for certain conflicts to be bypassed by peace brokers.
   La presencia de entornos regionales hostiles puede estimular la guerra
   civil dentro del ambito nacional. Afectan tambien a la mediacion en una
   guerra civil en curso dentro de un Estado? Nuestra hipotesis es que si
   afectan, pero de maneras que producen efectos opuestos: los terceros
   pueden tener dudas acerca de ofrecer mediacion en un entorno
   conflictivo, pero los entornos hostiles tambien hacen que los litigantes
   sean mas susceptibles a la mediacion. Ponemos a prueba estas
   expectativas opuestas mediante la utilizacion de una medida de entornos
   de conflicto que agrega la guerra civil inminente en las proximidades de
   un Estado de forma espacial y temporal. Nuestros analisis empiricos
   revelan que es significativamente menos probable que los terceros
   ofrezcan mediacion a medida que aumentan los factores exogenos. Esta
   conclusion se aplica incluso a terceros que tienen vinculos historicos o
   de seguridad con el Estado en situacion de guerra civil. Sin embargo,
   encontramos un numero limitado de pruebas respecto a que las decisiones
   por parte de los litigantes acerca de aceptar o no esta mediacion esten
   impulsadas por preocupaciones de seguridad regional. En cambio, las
   condiciones de conflicto nacional presentan preocupaciones mas urgentes
   que provocan que los litigantes puedan aceptar ofertas de mediacion. Las
   conclusiones sugieren, una vez tomadas en conjunto, que los potenciales
   mediadores deberian prestar atencion tanto al entorno regional de un
   Estado en guerra civil como a las condiciones nacionales, con el fin de
   no subestimar la voluntad de los litigantes de sentarse a la mesa.
   Nuestro trabajo subraya, de forma novedosa, los costes y los riesgos
   asociados con los puntos criticos de conflicto, asi como el riesgo de
   que ciertos conflictos puedan ser eludidos por parte de los agentes de
   paz.
   Les environnements regionaux hostiles peuvent favoriser l'apparition
   d'un conflit civil dans un pays. Ont-ils aussi une influence sur la
   mediation lorsqu'un conflit civil est en cours au sein d'un etat? Nous
   emettons l'hypothese que cette influence existe, tout en produisant des
   effets antagonistes : les tiers pourraient hesiter a proposer une
   mediation dans un environnement conflictuel, mais les environnements
   hostiles favorisent egalement l'acceptation d'une mediation par les
   parties d'un conflit. Nous verifions ces attentes contraires a l'aide
   d'une mesure des environnements conflictuels qui regroupe les guerres
   civiles proches sur le plan spatial et temporel au sein d'un quartier
   d'un etat. Nos analyses empiriques revelent que les tierces parties ont
   une probabilite bien moindre de proposer une mediation quand les
   facteurs exogenes s'accumulent, resultat qui reste vrai quand les tiers
   entretiennent des relations historiques ou de securite avec l'etat oa se
   joue une guerre civile. Cependant, nous ne trouvons que peu d'elements
   pour confirmer que les decisions des parties au conflit d'accepter la
   mediation sont motivees par des preoccupations de securite regionale.
   Les conditions conflictuelles locales representeraient une problematique
   plus urgente qui pousserait les parties au conflit a accepter la
   mediation. L'ensemble de nos resultats indique que les mediateurs
   potentiels devraient prendre en compte les contextes regionaux et locaux
   d'un etat soumis a un conflit civil pour ne pas risquer de sous-estimer
   la volonte de negociation d'une partie. Notre travail souligne
   differemment les couts et risques associes aux points chauds d'un
   conflit et le risque que les negociateurs de paix contournent certains
   conflits.},

Title = {Demand for Statehood: The Case of Native Military Recruitment in World
   War II},

Abstract = {This paper examines how the demand for independence appeared in the era
   of Decolonization. I argue that nationalist movements were more likely
   to emerge in places where the colonial authorities recruited the native
   population in World War II. The theory highlights the role of war
   veterans in creating the demand for independence and in facilitating it
   through organized collective action. Drawing on original World War II
   native recruitment data, an analysis of nationalist movements in
   sub-national units from 1945 to 1984 provides evidence consistent with
   the theory. The findings in this study help us better understand the
   rise of nationalist movements in the twentieth century and the political
   effects of military service.
   Este articulo examina como surgio la demanda por la independencia en la
   era de la descolonizacion. Sostenemos que era mas probable que los
   movimientos nacionalistas surgieran en lugares en los que las
   autoridades coloniales reclutaran a la poblacion nativa para la Segunda
   Guerra Mundial. La teoria destaca el papel de los veteranos de guerra en
   el surgimiento de la demanda por la independencia y en su facilitacion
   mediante la accion colectiva organizada. Un analisis de los movimientos
   nacionalistas en las unidades subnacionales desde 1939 hasta 1984, a
   partir de los datos originales sobre el reclutamiento de la poblacion
   nativa para la Segunda Guerra Mundial, proporciona pruebas consistentes
   con la teoria. Los hallazgos de este estudio nos ayudan a comprender
   mejor el aumento de los movimientos nacionalistas en el siglo XX y los
   efectos politicos del servicio militar.
   Cet article analyse de quelle maniere les revendications d'independance
   sont apparues au moment de la decolonisation. J'avance que les
   mouvements nationalistes avaient davantage tendance a emerger dans les
   territoires ou les autorites coloniales avaient enrole des populations
   natives durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Cette theorie souligne le
   role des veterans de guerre dans l'apparition des revendications
   d'independance, ainsi que leur capacite a stimuler le processus au moyen
   d'actions collectives organisees. Elle est confirmee par une analyse des
   mouvements nationalistes au sein d'unites locales entre 1939 et 1984,
   elle-meme basee sur des donnees relatives a l'enrolement de populations
   colonisees pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Les resultats de cette
   etude nous permettent de mieux comprendre l'emergence de mouvements
   nationalistes au XXe siecle, ainsi que les consequences politiques du
   service militaire.},

Title = {The regulatory ecosystem of data driven campaigning in the UK},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},

Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Political campaigns are increasingly described as data-driven, as
   parties collect and analyse large quantities of voter data to target
   their campaign messages in ever more granular ways, particularly online.
   These practices have increasingly been facing calls for greater
   regulation due to the range of harms they are seen to pose for citizens
   and democracy more generally. Such harms include the intrusions on voter
   privacy, reduced transparency in how messages are constructed and
   targeted at voters and exposure to increasingly divisive and polarizing
   political content. Given that data-driven campaigning (DDC) encompasses
   a range of different practices that are likely to fall under the remit
   of multiple agencies, it is not evident how suitable current regulatory
   frameworks are for addressing the harms associated with the growth of
   DDC. This paper takes a first step toward addressing that question by
   mapping an emergent regulatory ``ecosystem{''} for DDC in the particular
   case of the UK. Specifically, we collect and analyse interview data from
   a range of regulators working directly or indirectly in the election
   campaigns and communication arena. Our analysis shows that while privacy
   violations associated with DDC are seen by regulators to be largely well
   covered by current legislation, other potential harms are given lesser
   to no priority. These gaps appear to be due to regulators lacking either
   the powers or the incentives to intervene.},

Abstract = {Few scholars have dedicated their attention to the role of think tanks
   as policy experts within captured states. We investigate how, why, and
   to what extent think tanks are used in the captured states in the
   Western Balkans. Our assumption was that think tanks could become party
   to the processes of ``capture{''}. However, original findings from focus
   group and interviews with think tankers show that think tank expertise
   is perceived as an imposed obligation-from external pressures and
   existing national regulatory frameworks. Accordingly, incorporation of
   think tank policy advice is fulfilled to an extent, but not necessarily
   for the sake of improving the quality of public policies. In this
   environment, think tanks are enrolled in the simulacra of inclusive
   policy deliberation without substantially influencing policy making.
   Nevertheless, these organizations have developed creative mechanisms to
   survive, preserve their independence, and still foster advice uptake
   within captured bureaucracies. Openly value-driven advice is the
   overarching one.},

   Colombia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Volume = {61},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1069-1084},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Can the legacy of state violence undermine participation in transitional
   justice services designed to consolidate peace after conflict? We argue
   that, in the aftermath of armed fighting, state-perpetrated violence
   leads to reduced uptake of government reconciliation policies. We
   leverage spatial and temporal variation in levels of civilian
   victimization by perpetrator and find that, in contrast to violence
   committed by non-state groups, violence carried out by state forces
   against civilians is associated with lower levels of enlistment in
   Colombia's state-run victims' registry. We replicate this relationship
   using survey data and present evidence linking victimization by the
   state to lower levels of trust in the government overall. Together, our
   analyses demonstrate that disaggregating the identity of armed actors
   can provide significant theoretical and empirical advances in our
   understanding of peacemaking and post-conflict reconstruction. In the
   Colombian case, the legacy of state violence leads to the systematic
   exclusion of certain types of victims from transitional justice and
   undermines trust in the institutions responsible for building durable
   pathways to peace. Consequently, our findings have implications for the
   design of transitional justice policies, the study of the legacies of
   conflict on political and social outcomes, and processes of
   post-conflict peacebuilding.},

Abstract = {This article presents a `primacy of domestic politics' interpretation of
   the Thatcher government's main objectives in the negotiations of the
   early 1980s, which secured the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997. In
   the immediate aftermath of the Falklands conflict, sovereignty issues
   were uppermost in public discourse and the government's decision to cede
   sovereignty over Hong Kong seems inconsistent with other elements of
   Thatcher's foreign policy. However, when placed in the context of
   domestic economic objectives it is clear that the liberalisation and
   deregulation agenda would be undermined by a lack of investor confidence
   in sterling overseas should business confidence be disrupted in Hong
   Kong with a potentially disastrous diversification out of sterling. The
   1984 Joint Declaration secured special status for Hong Kong enshrining
   the independence of the currency and the Hong Kong banking system
   thereby averting a sterling crisis which would have had major
   implications for the City of London and Thatcher's domestic policies.},

Abstract = {Following the 2016 EU referendum on Britain's membership in the European
   Union, many people described themselves as ``Leavers{''} or
   ``Remainers.{''} Here, we examine the emotional responses associated
   with Brexit identities using survey data collected from two nationally
   representative samples of the British public in 2019 (N = 638) and 2021
   (N = 2,058). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that many in both
   samples had coherent Leave or Remain identities. Remain and, to a lesser
   extent, Leave identities (regardless of how people actually voted in the
   referendum) predicted distress about Brexit-related events and clinical
   symptoms of depression and anxiety at both time points. Structural
   equation models suggested that the effect of identities on symptoms was
   largely mediated by distress about Brexit-related events. We demonstrate
   a lasting impact of Brexit on the mental health of UK citizens and show
   that the formation of novel political identities has been more important
   in this process than voting behavior.},

Abstract = {Judging by its doctrinal publications, the UK Defence establishment
   stands poised to begin a process of unprecedented change. The language
   of `multi-domain' thinking is prominent within this discourse and is
   identified as being a key vehicle via which UK Defence will deliver upon
   its programme of reform. This article seeks to offer an initial
   evaluation of these claims and to assess them in light of the burgeoning
   literatures on Western defence `transformation' and military innovation
   that have emerged since the early 2000s. We argue that `multi-domain'
   thinking reflects a form of `cosmetic' emulation by the British Defence
   establishment and that its appearance within UK doctrine has been driven
   more by internal politics than by a clearly thought-through adoption of
   a new form of military practice.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Open government (OG) is an increasingly used management model among the
   public administrations of European countries and of the European Union,
   which is currently working on The Path to the Digital Decade. This
   supposes the application of measures to promote proximity and
   citizenship's prominence in many public policies, leading to improved
   quality of democracy. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed
   to a forced digitalization of many public services. Despite the fact
   that studies on OG do not usually focus on them, political parties are
   essential actors for the success or failure of OG measures, both from a
   bottom-up and a top-down perspective, on public administration
   transformation. Moreover, political parties are transforming themselves
   into more open organizations at the same time. We define open parties as
   political parties with high standards in transparency, participation,
   and collaboration. They also feature high degrees of organizational
   digitalization. This article proposes a framework for analyzing
   political parties' openness and explores available empirical data on
   different aspects related to OG in the European context. We have found
   that most parties possess a good level of local organizational strength
   but still need to reach better levels of anticorruption commitment, to
   form stronger ties with affiliated organizations, and especially to
   improve the participation of members and activists in their
   decision-making. Furthermore, elitism, clientelism, and populistic
   rhetoric represent significant obstacles that could hinder the party
   reform process.},

Abstract = {The likelihood that a military coup may result in unfavorable reactions,
   such as domestic citizen protests, international condemnation, and
   sanctions, varies depending on the circumstances. How can we explain
   such variations in domestic and international reactions? This study
   focuses on the presence or absence of postcoup proclamations by the
   military that their rule would only be temporary and theorizes the
   impact of these promises on domestic and international reactions to the
   coup. Specifically, this study hypothesizes that postcoup promises
   suppress anti-regime protests and negative reactions from the
   international community, but this effect is limited to the post-Cold War
   period. These arguments have been verified through statistical analyses
   using a newly constructed dataset of postcoup proclamations and
   illustrative case analyses.},

Abstract = {Changes brought about by the digitalisation of journalism in the global
   South have implications for the role that the press plays in politics
   and governance, particularly in terms of giving a voice to those on the
   margins. This paper presents original evidence from India to consider
   how Twitter is reshaping the hierarchies within journalism and how it
   contributes to a `star system' in Indian media institutions whereby
   national journalists as well as celebrities have gained more influence
   over journalists working in the regional press. Drawing on public
   profiles of over 50 journalists, while anonymizing individual
   identities, we computationally map their follower-following networks on
   Twitter and analyse the resulting structures to show how they intensify
   the historical divide between the Delhi-based legacy institutions and
   the vernacular language media. Besides using network graphs, we develop
   topic models of the biographies of journalists from different social
   cohorts and find a divergence in the way celebrity-seeking journalists
   use Twitter more effectively than those working in the regional press,
   with the latter not able to match the strategic use of the network for
   personal branding by the former cohort. We conclude that this divergence
   can also be contributing towards a star system like structure of
   journalism online with readership and influence flowing to those at the
   centre. We conclude with recommendations for editors, journalists as
   well as technology developers on how to avoid such outcomes.},

Abstract = {We offer a novel conceptualization of government credibility and a new
   framework for analysing the institutions that governments constitute to
   enhance their credibility. While the literature commonly pertains to
   government credibility institutions as an apolitical instrument of `good
   government,' we argue that there are `varieties of government
   credibility' and therefore political trade-offs between different
   credibility-enhancing institutions. To demonstrate this, we introduce
   `social credibility' as an additional type of government credibility
   alongside the widely-discussed `market credibility.' Through historical
   cases, we show that social credibility institutions played a crucial
   role in constructing social security and point at fundamental tensions
   between market credibility institutions and social credibility
   institutions. Therefore, instead of focusing on the supposedly
   apolitical question of how to enhance government credibility, research
   should concentrate on the very political issue of how prioritizing
   certain types of credibility affects others and their associated
   institutions.},

Abstract = {As part of efforts to mass higher education, China introduced
   state-sponsored student loans around the turn of the century, a
   progressive social policy reflecting the country's move toward increased
   marketization and decentralization in delivering educational services.
   The loan scheme, open to low-income students, is a voluntary policy
   transfer that draws on lessons from abroad. Unexpectedly, it stalled
   soon after implementation. Subsequent local experimentation brought it
   back on track. This article uses the Dolowitz and Marsh policy transfer
   framework to identify and explain the unsuccessful transfer. It also
   uses Heilmann's model to examine the local experimentation that brought
   about institutional change nationwide. The article argues that policy
   transfer, in conjunction with policy experimentation, provides practical
   frameworks for capturing the subtleties of China's hierarchical
   governance and the different complications experienced throughout the
   policy process. The article thus contributes to the integration of
   policy transfer and experimentation as a broader toolbox for policy
   analysis.},

Journal = {POLITICS},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {This article takes the Yellow Vests (YVs, Gilets Jaunes) movement as a
   case in point to study the mechanisms by which social media can enhance
   protest participation. Building on the literature on social media and
   protest behaviour, we study the association between different political
   experiences on social media and protest engagement. We rely on novel
   survey data from the project YELLOWPOL collected in France in 2019
   during a period characterised by the mobilisation of the YVs. We find
   that individuals' experiences on social media play a role in connecting
   general social media use with their participation in protests.
   Specifically, we show that simply using social media cannot predict
   protest behaviour, but seeking content from the accounts of
   decision-makers and activists and using social media to express opinions
   contributes to protest participation. These findings enhance the
   understanding of the individual-level mechanisms linking social media
   use and protest behaviour in first-wave democracies, expanding existing
   knowledge on the use and consequences of Internet-mediated technology on
   political participation and political change.},

Abstract = {Research on violently contested cities has focused on cities in the
   global South and on civil war contexts. This article makes the case for
   broadening this empirical scope to cities in non-war contexts, which are
   considered `at peace' but where politicians regularly declare war on
   e.g. drugs and terrorism. Experiences of violence, such as riots, youth
   violence and the aftermaths of terrorist attacks in a marginalised
   social housing neighbourhood in Grenoble (France) serve as the empirical
   grounding of this argument. Participatory action research with different
   collectives in this neighbourhood shows that community initiatives were
   able to have a positive impact on the destructive consequences of
   different forms of paroxysmal violence. These collectives initiated
   action in the aftermath of paroxysmal violence. One of them placed peace
   at the heart of its approach. By weaving everyday relationships its
   members could repair the social tissue that violence had destroyed.},

Abstract = {Empirical analysis of China's health diplomacy toward Latin America and
   the Caribbean in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that even
   though the region remains peripheral among China's foreign priorities
   its health diplomacy functions as a diffusion tool for increasing its
   soft power in the region, particularly against the background of the
   evolving China-United States rivalry. The source and development of
   Chinese soft power in the Global South should be understood as the
   diffusion effect of the combination and interdependence of its material
   hard power and its ideational soft power. Un analisis empirico de la
   diplomacia sanitaria de China hacia America Latina y el Caribe en el
   contexto de la pandemia de COVID-19 sugiere que, aunque la region sigue
   ocupando un lugar periferico entre las prioridades exteriores de China,
   su diplomacia sanitaria funciona como una herramienta de difusion para
   aumentar su poder blando en la region, particularmente en el contexto de
   la rivalidad entre China y Estados Unidos. La fuente y el desarrollo del
   poder blando chino en el Sur Global deben entenderse como el efecto
   disperso de la combinacion e interdependencia de su poder duro material
   y su poder blando ideacional.},

Abstract = {A growing body of research suggests that the global conception of
   climate change is increasingly taking a justice-focus. However, the
   justice-framings of different actors in the UNFCCC process and their
   evolution have not yet been examined. We conduct a critical discourse
   analysis of climate justice claims of state and non-state actors in
   COP15, COP19, COP21 and COP24 which are key moments for climate justice
   under the UNFCCC. Our findings indicate that the UNFCCC has not
   delivered on climate justice, power stands out as a key issue in the
   negotiations, and the negotiations reproduce structures of climate
   injustice. We identified four new country groupings with different
   climate justice frames. The Radicals consider climate change an imminent
   threat, while Opportunists seek to benefit from it. The Hypocrites
   recognize their contribution to climate change but avoid responsibility
   through libertarian mechanisms. The Evaders construe justice a normative
   issue and block others' justice claims. These groupings help discern how
   justice framings have evolved and how they are used in strategic ways to
   advance interests in multilateral forums.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to investigate the relationship between different
   styles of humorous communication (i.e. controlling and liberating) and
   conflict transformation in groups, in particular the transformation of
   task and process conflicts into relationship conflict. This study also
   examines the extent to which power distance moderates the association
   between controlling humor and relationship conflict.
   Design/methodology/approachThe authors collected data using a survey
   from 536 participants from two different countries varying in power
   distance (Romania and The Netherlands) working in groups in
   organizations from various sectors. FindingsSupporting the hypotheses
   presented in this study, multi-level data analyses showed that
   liberating humor has a positive association with task conflict, while
   controlling humor has a positive association with both process and
   relationship conflict. Moreover, task and process conflict mediate the
   relationship between liberating and controlling humor (predictors) and
   relationship conflict (outcome). The hypothesis regarding the moderating
   effect of power distance was not fully supported by the data.
   Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is
   the first to explore the multilevel interplay of humor and intragroup
   conflict in cross-cultural settings and shows how various types of humor
   can shape the emergence of conflict and its transformation.},

Abstract = {Much recent policy discourse has pivoted on the relationship between
   terrorist campaigns and an emergent feature of the global financial
   landscape in the form of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are a subset
   of digital currencies that are distributed by the developers thereof.
   The various unique features of cryptocurrencies have led to discussion
   in punditry about how terrorists could benefit from this new mode of
   financial transaction but few policy-oriented works and scholarly
   assessments exist to outline and assess this claim. This article
   describes cryptocurrencies, and assesses them in line with the
   operational realities of terrorist campaigns. I argue that, while there
   is limited evidence that terrorists are likely to disproportionately
   benefit from use of cryptocurrencies at present, there do exist unique
   opportunities for money laundering and revenue generation.},

Abstract = {The growth of urbanization created new challenges for local governments
   to match UN sustainable goals such as being resilient and inclusive.
   These goals are most unlikely in informal settlements characterized by
   vulnerability and rejection. This study investigates the relationship
   between good urban governance and the resilience of informal settlements
   in Zanjan City, Iran, using criteria such as participation, equity,
   effectiveness, accountability and security as independent variables. The
   data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. Pearson correlation
   test and multivariate regression analysis were used to analyze the
   effect of the independent variable on the resilience of informal
   settlements in Zanjan. The results showed that all variables have a
   significant relationship with the dependent variable. The results of
   multivariate regression analysis indicated that the three variables of
   participation, effectiveness and accountability had a significant
   effect. However, the other two variables, equity and security, had a
   less significant effect on resilience. Five indicators of the Urban
   Governance Index can be used as a guiding tool for managing informal
   settlements.},

Abstract = {Does preventive repression dampen or does it bolster mass support for
   groups that dissent despite obstruction? Although a large literature
   recognizes the importance of preventive repression for authoritarian
   stability, we know very little about its effects on public opinion. To
   gain traction on this question, this article draws on evidence from
   unusually detailed data on unauthorized and authorized protests from
   Russia and an original survey experiment. The author shows that when
   authorities engage in preventive repression, such as when they deny
   protest authorizations, protesters' ability to generate support is
   compromised. Preventive repression also conditions the effect of
   nonviolent demonstrator tactics on public opinion. These effects,
   however, are contingent on citizens' attitudes about the law and the
   authorities. This article's findings-which provide one of the first
   causal tests of the mass opinion effects of preventive repression-expand
   our understanding of the consequences and audiences of repression and
   have implications for studies of authoritarian resilience.},

Abstract = {In the contemporary moment of the Anthropocene there appears to be a
   growing consensus on the need to move beyond the key modernist binary,
   the Human/Nature divide. We draw out a shared understanding at work in
   International Relations across critical approaches in Science and
   Technology Studies (STS), new materialist, and material feminist fields,
   as well as critical Indigenous, decolonial and pluriversal thought. This
   is an understanding that seeks to go beyond the limits of modern
   epistemological and ontological assumptions of human exceptionalism.
   These approaches seek to rework both sides of the Human/Nature divide:
   to reconstitute the Human as a knowing, responsive and relational
   subject, no longer tainted by hierarchies of race and coloniality;
   while, redistributing agential capacities of responsivity, care and
   relation beyond the Human. Drawing from work across the broad field of
   critical Black studies, we flag up the limitations of these entangled,
   relational posthuman and more-than-human imaginaries, which can easily
   reproduce hierarchies of subordination and control. We suggest that
   another approach to the Human/Nature divide is possible, a critical
   perspective we call the Black Horizon, focused upon the task of
   deconstruction: an approach which emphasises difference rather than
   identity, negation rather than addition, critique rather than
   affirmation.},

Abstract = {The literature on technocracy has shown that expertise is a crucial
   factor in driving support for technocrats. However, the literature has
   not investigated yet what happens when technocrats are opposed to
   partisan experts. In this article, we want to fill this gap by analysing
   the support for two potential ministers of health with relevant
   expertise for their portfolio but with a different relationship to
   partisan politics. For this purpose, we run a novel survey in 14
   European countries with more than 20,000 respondents. Our main results
   show that non-partisan experts are preferred over partisan experts
   across Europe, both when citizens have a high sympathy and a low
   sympathy for the party appointing the minister. However, in the latter
   case, the effect is more evident.},

Abstract = {The song ``Apagando el sistema{''} was released in 2015 during protests
   against the youth labor law known as the Ley Pulpin and frequently
   reposted on Facebook to show solidarity with various political and
   social issues. Analyzed from the perspective of what I call ``fusion
   aesthetics,{''} it can be considered to build on the tradition of the
   Latin American Nueva Cancion, reflect the fragmented nature of protests,
   and help the musicians negotiate their identities as mestizos and fight
   racism and discrimination in Peru. La cancion ``Apagando el sistema{''}
   fue lanzada en 2015 durante las protestas de la ley laboral juvenil
   conocida como Ley Pulpin, y se republico en Facebook con frecuencia para
   mostrar solidaridad con diversos temas politicos y sociales. Un analisis
   desde una perspectiva de lo que yo llamo ``estetica de fusion{''} nos
   permite decir que la cancion se basa en la tradicion de la Nueva Cancion
   latinoamericana, refleja la naturaleza fragmentada de las protestas y

Abstract = {Street-level bureaucrats shape policy through using discretion in their
   interactions with citizens and service users in delivering public
   services. Discretion allows street-level bureaucrats to bridge between
   public policy and the complex, individual, human situations they
   encounter. Drawing on insights from feminist institutionalism, this
   article establishes gender as a relevant analytical category in
   understanding discretion. We set out three analytical propositions:
   street-level bureaucrats work in gendered institutional contexts that
   shape their discretion; street-level bureaucrats are gendered actors,
   whose discretion is shaped by their individual gendered dispositions;
   and street-level bureaucrats' discretion has gendered effects. We
   investigate these propositions through a case study of the early
   implementation of the classification of misogyny as a hate crime among
   police forces in England and Wales. In addressing this analytical
   intersection between street-level bureaucracy and feminist
   institutionalism, we bring a gendered perspective to street-level
   bureaucracy, and a focus on how rules are interpreted to feminist
   institutionalism, forging new ground in public administration.},

Abstract = {Studies on electoral clientelism are increasingly focusing on the demand
   side and explaining how voters react to electoral inducements. However,
   there is limited research about how candidate attributes and
   partisanship can determine citizens' reactions to clientelism. This
   article therefore tests the relative weight that voters place on
   candidate attributes and partisanship in their reactions to
   clientelistic targeting in the context of a new democracy. We use
   evidence from an original conjoint experiment conducted in 2021 in
   Romania, where electoral clientelism is frequent. Our findings show that
   citizens react negatively to clientelistic inducements in general, but
   the effects vary based on the targeting strategy used by politicians.
   These negative effects are considerably weaker among co-partisans. This
   observation is especially relevant when testing the effect of
   partisanship in a political setting where it is low.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I take issue with Arthur Isak Applbaum's power-liability
   view of political legitimacy. In contrast to the traditional view that
   legitimate rule entails a moral duty to obey, here called the right-duty
   view, Applbaum argues that political legitimacy is a moral power that
   entails moral liability for the subjects of political rule. According to
   Applbaum, the power-liability view helps us explain how responsible
   citizens in some cases can act contrary to law while still recognizing
   the claims of law. Against Applbaum's attempt at establishing the
   power-liability view through conceptual analysis, I argue that we cannot
   specify the moral implications of de jure legitimacy without considering
   the moral argument that justifies the right to rule. I further argue
   that Applbaum's normative account of political legitimacy implies
   commitment to a normative idea that forms the basis of a strong case in
   favor of the right-duty view. Finally, I argue that the present defense
   of the right-duty view has resources to account for the moral phenomena
   that prompt Applbaum's advocacy of the power-liability view.},

Abstract = {Disruptive protest has become increasingly studied and promoted across
   the social sciences, not least in relation to climate protests. This
   paper asks what the rationale and effects of disruptive protest are. It
   argues that disruptive protest carries a prefigurative legitimacy,
   envisaging a more democratic and just society while aiming for broader
   appeal and legitimacy rendered by liberal discourses. The paper takes a
   political theory perspective through both the literature on civil
   disobedience and the anarchist literature on direct action. It then
   explores how the key attributes of these literatures render legitimacy
   to the practices and discourses of two social movements that have made
   widespread use of disruptive protest in recent years: the Spanish
   anti-eviction movement Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca (PAH) and
   the mainly British climate change movement Extinction Rebellion (XR).},

Abstract = {This contribution applies the Q methodology to investigate Chinese
   public employees' accountability preferences under different
   accountability relationships in delivering public services. We identify
   four accountability preferences: a vertically oriented accountability, a
   network-style accountability, a style of accountability between market
   and participatory accountability, and a vertically oriented style of
   market accountability. Our data show that Chinese public employees hold
   varied accountability preferences in public service delivery, and
   hierarchy is a relatively popular one. It is suggested that governors
   should effectively align different accountability relationships with the
   aim of better steering the behavior of public employees in public
   service delivery.},

Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},

Abstract = {A popular explanation for governments' persistent enthusiasm for
   evidence-based policymaking (EBPM) is its expected capacity to solve
   policy conflict. However, research is divided on whether or not EBPM
   actually has a positive impact on conflict. On the one hand, EBPM is
   said to introduce a set of principles that helps overcome political
   differences. Simultaneously, EBPM has been criticised for narrowing the
   space for democratic debate, fuelling the very conflict it is trying to
   prevent. This article explores how EBPM structures policy conflict by
   studying the example of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) in
   policy processes through reconstructive interviews and ethnographic
   observations. It argues that, although EBPM channels conflict in a way
   that prompts engagement from stakeholders, it also escalates conflict by
   misrepresenting the nature of policy processes. As such, the findings
   suggest that managing process participants' expectations about what
   evidence is and can do is key in fostering productive policy conflict.},

Abstract = {This article examines the forms of `civility' promoted by South Sudanese
   NGO leaders and staff in their efforts to navigate a context of
   pervasive political repression. Drawing on in-depth, life-work history
   interviews, it shows how the careful cultivation of a `non-political'
   identity was a way of securing space to operate in a highly militarised,
   politically restricted environment, of working across the divisions
   created by conflict, and of creating small spaces for change. The
   article also points to the limitations of these non-political positions,
   to the struggles of aspirational projects to overcome the inequalities
   in which they are embedded, and to the risk of reproducing the
   hierarchies and exclusions of the wider humanitarian industry. For
   external actors engaged in `localisation' efforts, the discussion is a
   reminder that decisions about which organisations to fund are inherently
   political, with implications for dynamics of inequality and
   marginalisation in South Sudanese (civil) society.},

Abstract = {Rwanda and Uganda have had strained relations, oscillating between warm,
   lukewarm, hostile and outright war. Since the biggest falling out during
   the Second Congo War (1998-2003), both governments have variously
   accused each other of wrongdoing, including allegations of supporting
   rebel activities, covert counterintelligence operations and espionage.
   The most recent escalation in frosty relations saw the closure of Katuna
   border post. Because the respective ruling parties - the Rwandan
   Patriotic Front and the National Resistance Movement - at a minimum have
   shared ideological and historical origins, we would expect relations to
   be strong and constructive not hostile or tenuous. Yet, it is precisely
   the shared history and social ties among the politico-military and
   intelligence elites that shape the suspicion, mistrust and hostility
   that feed into official policies. This article analyses how shared
   ideological and historical origins, social relations and kindred ties
   inform individual attitudes and perceptions of key elites toward each
   other's government.},

Title = {Europe first? The rise of EU industrial policy promoting and protecting
   the single market},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},
Year = {2023},

Pages = {2063-2096},

Abstract = {Within Europe's regulatory state, industrial policy has largely remained
   within national governments' remit. Yet, a plethora of new supra- and
   cross-national industrial policy initiatives have recently emerged
   whereby the Commission proactively engages in pan-European activities to
   foster innovation and economic development. This article brings the
   `Developmental Network States' (DNS) literature into dialogue with EU
   integration scholarship to explain both the timing of EU industrial
   policy's rise since the mid-2010s and the variation in forms of EU
   integration of different industrial policy functions. Our analysis
   suggests that the Commission increasingly operates four major
   developmental functions akin to DNSs and aimed at promoting and
   protecting the single market. Neofunctionalist theories of EU
   integration explain these momentous shifts. The timing behind the rise
   of EU industrial policy is best explained as an interplay of functional,
   cultivated, and political spillovers, driven especially by the
   Franco-German realignment on pro-EU industrial policy positions since
   2016. Variation in the governance forms of integrated EU industrial
   policy functions is instead explained in terms of the degree of
   pre-existing integration of extant policies, the low vs high politics
   nature of the policy domain and the types of externalities attached to
   the specific policy area.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 28},
Abstract = {Incels, Involuntary Celibates, are men who both struggle with lack of
   sexual and romantic relationships and participate in online communities
   espousing a misogynistic ideology. This study characterizes users of
   three popular Incel forums. Using network analysis and community
   detection, we identify their main issues and interests and assess
   whether interests predated or followed their initial participation in an
   Incel forum. Results indicate that users commonly engage with content
   concerning mental health and relationships, but also participate in
   other hateful forums. Contributions to hateful forums mostly predated
   their earliest engagement with an Incel forum. Implications for
   prevention and intervention are discussed.},

Abstract = {The existing framing and narrative studies focus on the influence of
   framing and narratives targeting one population as a whole but neglect
   how these can affect the subgroups of the target population differently.
   Using a survey experiment, this research investigates whether and how
   implicitly gendered narrative cues affect public acceptance of male or
   female unauthorized immigrants from Mexico and the Northern Triangle.
   Based on the experimental results, younger male unauthorized immigrants
   were less likely to be accepted by participants when public safety cues
   were presented and more likely to be accepted when economic contribution
   cues were presented. Conversely, female unauthorized immigrants were
   less favored by participants when economic contribution cues were
   presented and more favored when public safety cues were presented. These
   findings show how the dominant narratives contribute to the publics'
   gender biases against unauthorized immigrants and reveal future
   direction for developing narratives and framing studies.},

Abstract = {PurposeAlthough work-related antecedents of abusive supervision are
   well-known, knowledge on the cross-domain antecedents of this
   destructive leadership behavior is scarce. Accordingly, this study aims
   to investigate off-the-job supervisors' after-work experiences that may
   influence their work behavior. The authors explore how and when a
   supervisor's poor recovery experiences lead to abusive supervisory
   behaviors through a negative start-of-workday mood for high vs low
   supervisor sleep quality. Design/methodology/approachThe authors
   conducted a single-source, three-phase field study (N = 422) to test the
   proposed moderated mediation model for participants from a large
   telecommunications company located in Anhui province, People's Republic
   of China. FindingsPoor recovery experiences in the supervisor's personal
   life can spill over to their work domain and provoke abusive supervisory
   behavior through the mediating effect of a negative start-of-workday
   mood. Moreover, a supervisor's good night's sleep (i.e. first-stage
   moderator) serves as a key mitigating factor to diminish the negative
   start-of-workday mood resulting from a lack of relaxation, mastery
   experiences and control experiences (except for the lack of
   psychological detachment from work) and lessens abusive supervision.
   Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature examining
   off-the-job events to understand the antecedents of abusive supervision
   that are beyond organizations' control but significantly influence
   workplace behaviors, showing that not all antecedents of abusive
   supervision exist in the workplace; some are transferred from the home
   domain through nonvisible moods. Finally, the inclusion of sleep quality
   as a first-stage moderator provides insights on preventing abusive
   supervision caused by nonwork-related events. This adds a unique
   dimension to the abusive supervision literature by highlighting factors
   in the home domain that can prevent negative spillovers to the work
   domain. The authors conclude with some theoretical and practical
   implications for researchers and practitioners.},

Abstract = {The first people to suspect or know about someone involved in acts of
   violent extremism will often be those closest to them: their friends,
   family and community insiders. They are ideally placed to play
   particular roles: (a) to notice any changes or early warning signs that
   someone is considering violent action to harm others, and (b) to
   influence and facilitate vulnerable individuals to move away from
   violent extremist involvements. The willingness of those close to
   potential or suspected violent actors to come forward and share their
   knowledge and concerns with authorities is thus a critical element in
   efforts to prevent violent extremist action. This Canadian study
   replicates the focus and methodology of three previous Community
   Reporting Thresholds studies with an increased scope and sample size.
   Our findings highlight the ways in which Canadian community respondents
   framed their understanding of and engagement with reporting as intimate
   bystanders on someone close radicalising to violence in relation to
   three main domains: needs-based, rights-based and systems-based. This
   paper will explore what we have learned from data across three Canadian
   cities with a particular emphasis on how the domains of needs, rights
   and systems are conceptualized and enacted by Canadian respondents.},

Abstract = {How can attention to spatial dynamics improve our understanding of
   where, how, and why conflict-related violence (CRV) concentrates within
   postwar cities such as Mitrovica? Like many other postwar cities,
   Mitrovica - one of Kosovo's largest cities - remains affected by
   violence connected to the preceding war. This violence is not equally
   distributed across the city but rather concentrates to certain
   flashpoints while other sites are comparatively calm(er). To date,
   however, research on postwar cities has not fully explained such
   patterns, partly due to limitations in microlevel data. In this article
   we rely on novel georeferenced data on CRV, in combination with in-depth
   fieldwork, to map CRV in Mitrovica and explore the causes for its
   spatial clustering. Using this approach, we show that CRV concentrates
   at Mitrovica's Main Bridge and explore this concentration using
   relational space as an analytical lens. The analysis contributes new
   insights into patterns of violence in Mitrovica, demonstrates the value
   of combining systematic data on the patterns of CRV with in-depth
   exploration into its underlying dynamics, and contributes to existing
   research on Mitrovica as well as on postwar cities and postwar violence
   more broadly.},

Abstract = {How do domestic trials addressing wartime violence affect public opinion
   of government? The legitimation functions of national courts are well
   studied in liberal democracies, but less is known about the effects of
   trials that address abuses committed during large-scale conflict. This
   article investigates how the extent to which such trials achieve
   procedural justice (fairness in process) and retributive justice
   (allocation of punishment) affects perceptions of political legitimacy.
   I provide survey-experimental evidence from post-conflict El Salvador
   that leverages the repeal of a longstanding amnesty law. Although a
   trial in general improves citizen evaluations of state competence,
   fairness and punishment serve crucial - and distinct - legitimation
   functions. Procedural fairness significantly increased citizens'
   willingness to comply with state authorities, regardless of trial
   outcome. Yet, an unfair trial, when coupled with punishment, bolstered
   trust in politicians and the judiciary. This suggests a trade-off
   between public preferences for fairness and an `iron fist' approach to
   violence. The findings reveal the limits of procedural justice in a
   post-conflict environment and furnish new insights on the multifaceted
   functions of human rights trials.},

Abstract = {How does the Russian war in Ukraine affect European integration?
   Bellicist theories predict a push towards federation, marked by a
   centralization of fiscal, coercive and administrative core state powers
   at the EU level. But is it happening? We examine two main conditions of
   bellicist integration. The `functional' condition refers to the
   efficiency gains of centralization: no federation without functional
   benefit. The `political' condition refers to a threat-induced alignment
   of interests and identities that makes centralization politically
   viable: no federation without public support. We gauge both conditions
   during the early months of the war and explain why they have not pushed
   the EU towards centralized federation but, to the contrary, towards
   decentral alliance. We discuss issue-specific differences in defence,
   energy and fiscal policy and conclude with some general theoretical
   implications.},

Title = {Tracking Climate Securitization: Framings of Climate Security by Civil
   and Defense Ministries},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Defense ministries regularly frame climate security in their national
   security strategies. Recently, ``civil{''} ministries also begun
   mentioning climate security. However, they do not mean the same thing.
   This article develops four indicators to assess the commitment of
   climate security framings to an understanding of climate security as
   either human/environmental or national security issue. It applies the
   indicators to fifty submissions of Nationally Determined Contributions
   (NDC) by civil ministries and seventy defense publications. The paper
   finds that NDC commonly refer to climate changes' anthropogenic origins
   and biophysical impacts but rarely to indirect consequences such as
   migration or conflict. In contrast, military administrations rarely
   mention anthropogenic origins but warn more often than NDC of indirect
   consequences. This shows that a civil domestic discourse on climate
   security has emerged, more attuned to human security and environmental
   security and more conducive to climate change mitigation and adaptation.
   The paper argues that organizational theory can explain these
   differences in securitization: defense and civil ministries frame
   climate security differently so that it falls in line with their
   respective mandates and established organizational features. The article
   concludes with a checklist for assessing framings of climate security.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the former colonial governance system (FCR) in the
   erstwhile FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas, present-day Newly
   Merged Tribal Districts). The main purpose of the research is to provide
   an argument that the colonial governance structure was not the only
   cause for the widespread militancy in South interviews with different
   stakeholders and literature review, it is found out that the FCR with
   all its inherent faults was deemed successful in the administration of
   the North West Frontier and it was not responsible for the militancy in
   the tribal district of South Waziristan. Thus, the paper analyzes the
   old governance system prior to the spillover of militants and it reaches
   to the conclusion that the FCR proved to be an effective tool for the
   political administration of the border area of South Waziristan in both
   the colonial and post-colonial periods. The study emphases that
   mismanagement, corruption and incompetency of bureaucracy has led to the
   weakening of FCR, traditional institutions of dispute resolution and the
   indigenous leadership model thereby creating leadership vacuum which was
   in turn filled by the militants. The study has employed ethnographic
   based data collection techniques to reach the findings that old
   administrative structure is not responsible for the chaos and militancy
   in South Waziristan.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses whether the effect of campaign-style enforcement
   can surpass the short term from the perspective of authority allocation.
   Based on the theory of authority allocation, we establish an explanatory
   framework for the impact of authority allocation on the effect of
   campaign-style enforcement. We argue that, through authority allocation,
   the central government has both formal authority and real authority,
   which helps to extend the effect of campaign-style enforcement beyond
   the short term. We empirically studied the regulatory compliance in
   China's environmental administrative talk from 2014 to 2016. Statistical
   findings supported by robustness checks confirm our theoretical
   hypotheses. Further analysis shows that campaign-style enforcement can
   be more effective when local officials have longer tenure, higher levels
   of education, or older age. Our paper shows that authority

Abstract = {Why did some American citizens choose to travel to fight in Syria and
   Iraq rather than engage in Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
   (ISIS)-inspired terrorism in the United States? We conducted a social
   network analysis (SNA) on a sample (n = 224) of extremists who either
   plotted ISIS-inspired attacks within the United States or attempted to
   travel to Syria or Iraq to join the group between 2013-2020. We test how
   network size, network interconnectedness, and the importance of trusted
   network members impact the choice of American ISIS offenders to travel
   or plot terrorist attacks. Our results show that Americans were more
   likely to choose to travel to fight when they had access to large, dense
   networks that were embedded with trusted associates. Those without
   access to similar networks abandoned their preferences for foreign
   fighting and instead plotted attacks within the United States. The
   findings provide pertinent policy implications for countering violent
   extremism.},

Abstract = {Political parties use electoral clientelism to mobilise their core
   voters and to persuade swing voters to support them. Earlier research
   shows that clientelism occurs more often in highly competitive
   elections. Against these conclusions, this article argues that a large
   margin of victory can drive the use of electoral clientelism
   irrespective of the type of constituency. The analysis uses county-level
   data from the 2020 election campaign in Romania and shows that electoral
   clientelism is used more in those constituencies with a clear winner.
   These effects are robust when controlling for socio-economic
   vulnerability and the percentage of the urban population.},

Title = {Iran's uprisings for `Women, Life, Freedom': Over-determination, crisis,
   and the lineages of revolt},
Journal = {POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article explores the manifold lineages of crisis and revolt
   currently afflicting the Islamic Republic of Iran, most recently
   bursting forth in the 2022/2023 national uprisings where women-led mass
   protests and forceful rejection of mandatory veiling laws captured
   global attention. This interdisciplinary piece of research, bringing
   together several different theoretical approaches and historical
   literatures, interrogates and reflects upon what I call following Stuart
   Hall a `conjunctural crisis' along the four major axes of (1) gender
   oppression and social reproduction; (2) the ethnocentric, dominative,
   and centralising nation-state and the still unresolved `ethno-national
   question'; (3) `religious democracy' and the impasse of the Reform
   movement; and (4) authoritarian neoliberalism and the Islamic Republic's
   political economy of predation. The article aims to show not only how
   these distinct crises have longer and more complicated lineages than
   might initially appear to be the case but also demonstrate how they have
   mutually constituted and shaped one another over the course of several
   decades, constituting part of a larger political and social system.
   Moreover, it aspires to provide a systematic and historically
   contextualised account of ongoing emancipatory struggles for democratic
   rights and liberation in today's Iran.},

Abstract = {Politicians are increasingly able to communicate their values,
   attitudes, and concerns directly to voters. Yet little is known about
   which of these signals resonate with voters and why. We employ a
   discrete choice experiment to investigate whether and which
   social-psychological attitudes predict how adult British voters respond
   to corresponding attitudinal signals communicated by candidates in
   hypothetical social media posts. For all attitudes studied, covering
   social feelings (trust, collective nostalgia), social perceptions
   (nationalism, populist sentiment), and social commitments (national
   identification, authoritarianism, egalitarianism), we find that
   participants are much more likely to vote for candidates who signal
   proximity to their own attitudinal position and less likely for
   candidates who signal opposing views. The strongest effects were
   observed for national identification, authoritarianism, and
   egalitarianism, indicating the importance of commitment to a shared
   group and to particular principles for distributing power and resources
   within and between groups. We further demonstrate that
   social-psychological attitudes are not acting as mere proxies for
   participants' past votes or left-right ideology. Our results extend
   adaptive followership theory to incorporate preferences concerning
   intragroup coordination and intergroup hierarchy, while highlighting the
   social-psychological dynamics of political communication that may
   transcend the concerns of particular election cycles.},

Abstract = {This article develops and applies an innovative methodology based on
   social network analysis and cluster analysis to analyze the organization
   of policymaking relations in multi-level political systems, focusing on
   the migration policy field. In doing so, it addresses four limitations
   of existing research on multi-layered migration policymaking, which
   tends to focus on policy and legal documents rather than real-world
   interactions, conceptualize governmental levels in morphological terms,
   neglect conflictual interactions, and narrowly focus on big cities. This
   innovative approach is applied to the heuristic case of Italian asylum
   policy after the 2015 ``refugee crisis{''}, which allows to derive three
   conceptual claims about the organizations of multi-level
   migration-related policymaking interactions. First, these interactions
   can be highly conflictual and multi-level migration policymaking should
   not necessarily be seen as a negotiated order among public and
   non-public actors. Second, existing typologies need to be complexified,
   accounting for the significance of intricately nested and overlapping
   ``multi-level networks{''} emerging over and above multi-layered
   institutional structures. Third, showing that Italian asylum policy
   actors interact more frequently and collaboratively with
   ``like-minded{''} actors regardless of official roles and governmental
   levels, the article identifies a new ``political{''} or
   ``ideological{''} axis along which collaborative and conflictual
   relations can be organized.},

Abstract = {Contemporary studies of civil conflict focus heavily on combatant
   treatment of civilians. Research on human rights (HR) abuses committed
   by states has benefitted from several widely available datasets on state
   violations. By comparison, researchers and policymakers have been
   limited by a dearth of data on violations committed by rebel groups. We
   introduce a new resource, the Rebel Human Rights Violations (RHRV)
   dataset, which measures the frequency with which rebel groups engage in
   eight HR abuses. The data include information for all rebel groups
   around the world between 1990 and 2018, and capture a wide range of
   violations, including arbitrary killing, detention, forced recruitment,
   property damage, torture, sexual violence, forced displacement and
   movement restriction. The RHRV provides new opportunities for
   researchers and policymakers to analyze an important aspect of civil
   conflict: the abuse of civilian populations by rebel groups.},

Abstract = {The growing interconnections among societies have facilitated the
   emergence of systemic crises, i.e., shocks that rapidly spread around
   the world and cause major disruptions. Advances in the interdisciplinary
   field of complexity can help understand the mechanisms underpinning
   systemic crises. This article reviews the most important concepts and
   findings from the pertinent literature. It demonstrates that an
   understanding of the nature of disruptions of globally interconnected
   systems and their implications is critical to prevent, react to, and
   recover from systemic crises. The resulting analytical framework is
   applied to two prominent examples of global systemic crises: the 2008
   global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The article provides
   evidence that relying on reactive and recovery capacities to face
   systemic crises is not sustainable because of the extraordinary costs
   they impose on societies. Efforts are needed to develop a multipronged
   strategy to strengthen our capacities to face systemic crises and
   address fundamental mismatches between the nature of global challenges
   and the necessary collective action to address these challenges.},

Abstract = {The United States has long been concerned with nuclear proliferation in
   the Middle East. It went to war in 2003 on the (false) premise that Iraq
   was close to building nuclear weapons. In 2004, the Brookings
   Institution warned of a nuclear tipping point' that might be reached due
   to some combination of changes in US policy, the breakdown of the global
   non-proliferation regime, the erosion of regional security, domestic
   imperatives and the increased availability of technology.(') In 2010,
   Richard L. Russell contributed an article to Joint Forces Quarterly
   called Off and Running: The Middle East Arms Race', in which he noted
   that a desire among regional governments to deter adversaries,
   compensate for conventional-weapons shortcomings, enhance war-fighting
   capabilities, garner domestic political power, and augment their
   international standing and leverage, especially in relation to the
   United States, could compel an arms race.(2)},

Abstract = {Public finance lies at the heart of politics. It shapes citizens'
   political attitudes and behaviors. While the expenditure side has been
   studied very extensively, the income side has been neglected, especially
   in authoritarian regimes. Taking China as an ideal case, we use a
   nation-wide random sample of urban residents to study how citizens under
   strong authoritarian states perceive their tax burdens. We find that
   Chinese citizens have low tax consciousness, defined as the perception
   of fairness both in comparison to people they know and to the amount of
   public goods they receive. Citizens' income, the amount of public goods
   they receive, and media consumption have important effects on their tax
   perception. We argue that there are three mechanisms used by China's
   ``half-tax state{''} to reduce their citizens' tax perception: (1)
   reduce the salience of people's tax burden, conditional on their income
   level, (2) generate fiscal illusion effects while providing public
   services in return for taxes paid, and (3) use propaganda to shape the
   ideology of tax compliance.},

Abstract = {In response to the perceived risk to health posed by obesity,
   governments in over 40 countries have introduced sugar taxes (also known
   as soda taxes), often as part of wider plans to improve national food
   environments. In this study we apply critical discourse analysis (CDA)
   to analyze 29 television news interviews addressing the sugar tax, in
   order to expose how and why media companies and the experts involved
   stage and maintain controversy. Our analysis provides evidence of a
   broad range of devices, ranging from the macro choice of interviewees
   and the role of the interviewer to their micro level rhetorical choices.
   They also include experts molding the same evidence to support their
   position and interviewers posing questions they know will result in a
   blunt contradiction. While individually each device may appear
   relatively inconsequential, their repeated use generates possibilities
   for self-perpetuating intertextuality and provides a sense of
   intractability that contributes to public disengagement with the issue.
   The value of studies such as this is to elucidate the use, ubiquity and
   effects of these devices that may otherwise go unnoticed or
   unquestioned.},

Abstract = {Coordination on mass protest plays an important disciplining role in
   ensuring compliance with electoral rules, with elections serving as a
   public signal of the incumbent's popularity. But the link between the
   informativeness of the election and the enforceability of electoral
   rules hinges crucially on the veracity of the electoral process. We
   model how doubt about electoral integrity influences compliance with
   electoral rules. Our analysis explains why electoral rules in advanced
   democracies are less resilient, and incumbents less willing to step
   aside, than suggested by the standard model of electoral turnover. We
   clarify how incumbent behaviour responds to changes in the cost of
   protest, and external overtures that make stepping down more attractive.
   Our findings contribute to the debate on the role of equilibrium
   multiplicity in models of mass uprisings.},

Abstract = {As the importance of right-wing populist parties (RPPs) has grown
   significantly in Europe, with some even forming governments, the
   attendant political and policy programs are attracting greater
   attention. However, to date most of the relevant research has been
   focused on the core slogan policies of RPPs, relating to immigration and
   the economy. This has left the parties' educational policies
   understudied. In seeking to address this situation, we analyse changes
   in the citizenship-education curricula that Poland's schools pursued
   during the years 2017 to 2022, with the country's ruling party (Law and
   Justice-PiS), thus offering a case study of a typical RPP. This article
   scrutinizes citizenship-education curricular changes pursued by PiS-with
   an approach that regards this as the field that best allows the desire
   to reconstruct the model of citizenship to be discerned. We also explore
   a process of ``civic de-socialization, `` and the new system of values
   being put in place in the curricula, by the Polish government. We
   examine whether the new provisions this entails fit into the ideological
   system of right-wing populists, and we conclude by developing
   hypotheses, and seeking to conclude theoretically, that ideological
   radicalization in education is being observed, in the wake of years of
   rule by an RPP. Interesting in this regard is the finding that more
   profound changes were not put into effect until a second stage to the
   reforms was reached. Overall, the case of the curriculum pursued in
   Poland by PiS points to a new ontology of citizenship, more nativism,
   and an anti-progressive agenda.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, myriad studies have explored the effects of
   nonviolent resistance (NR) on outcomes including revolutionary success
   (short-term and long-term) and democratization, and how nonviolent
   mobilization can play a similar role to violence in affecting social
   change in some settings. This special issue seeks to advance our
   understanding of the role of nonviolence by tackling some key
   assumptions in existing work that are complicated by historical and
   contemporary realities of deepening polarization worldwide. This issue
   addresses four key areas within conflict and peace research that limit
   our ability to make sense of NR: (a) the fragmented nature of civil
   resistance campaigns in terms of supporters and demands; (b) the
   increasing prevalence of authoritarian or anti-egalitarian nonviolent
   campaigns; and (c) the complicated nature of revolutionary success.
   Cutting across all three of these substantive areas is another key area,
   which is: (d) the United States as an increasingly salient site of
   conflict and contention.},

Abstract = {Public emergencies are focal events that present possibilities for
   policy changes. This study aims to explain policy insights on policy
   change in Iran through analyzing how the Iranian government's policy
   toward the long-awaited e-authentication finally changed in the wake of
   the outbreak of COVID-19. Due to the policy context of Iran, it uses the
   Multiple Stream Model, in which three streams were identified: problem,
   policy, and political dynamics. The paper contends that while the second
   stream existed prior to the pandemic, the first one had not yet been
   appropriately recognized by the government. Furthermore, it identifies
   the political stream as the third missing link for policy change. With
   the spread of coronavirus, these three streams converged, thus opening a
   window of opportunity for enacting this policy change. Two main reasons
   behind the emergence of this opening are identified: first, arising a
   new complex problem (COVID-19) that necessitated new initiatives, and
   second, growing public anxiety about the pandemic. Iran's desperate
   circumstances, which included an already severely depressed economy as
   the result of sanctions, were further exacerbated through the
   socio-economic repercussions of the pandemic. Furthermore, the growing
   demand from prospective traders to register for the stock exchange
   during the lockdown prompted officials to make a realistic decision. As
   a result, barriers to e-authentication were overcome and policy change
   happened. The paper highlights the security perspective as a necessary
   condition for policy change in Iran. Finally, it discusses the
   likelihood of permanency of the change.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been growing interest in the theory and
   practice of design in the public sector. Service design aims to improve
   the experience of public services through a human -centred, iterative
   and collaborative process of creativity and problem solving. However,
   there is a lack of empirical research on the application of design
   approaches in public service settings. This article aims to fill that
   gap, drawing on service research and empirical illustrations to explore
   what is being designed, how service design is practised, and the
   implications of service design. By applying `design of services' and
   `designing for service' perspectives, the focus of design is discussed,
   along with its implications for design practice and impact. While the
   analysis suggests an important shift in the practice of design with a
   focus on services, it proposes that applying design for service may
   further the potential of design and support deeper transformation. In
   this way, the article makes a significant contribution to scholarship on
   policy design, as well as public service delivery.},

Title = {When do decision makers listen (less) to experts? The Swiss government's
   implementation of scientific advice during the COVID-19 crisis},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Under which conditions do politicians listen to scientific experts in a
   crisis? This study addresses this question by assessing how the Swiss
   government implemented 186 policy recommendations formulated by the
   National COVID-19 Science Task Force (STF) to combat the spread of the
   virus and alleviate its impact on the health system, society and economy
   during the first year of the pandemic. Results of multiple regression
   analyses show that the impact of problem pressure on the propensity of
   the government to implement experts' recommendations varies over time:
   it was considerably larger during spring 2020 than afterwards. We argue
   that this reflects a change in status of the STF during the second phase
   of the pandemic: it was distanced from the political-strategic level of
   the crisis management organization and its epistemic authority was
   increasingly questioned by political parties and interest groups. Policy
   scholars should thus give more attention to how rapidly the government's
   propensity to rely on expert advice can change.},

Abstract = {Centre-left political parties are undergoing an identity crisis. This
   article is a comparative analysis of how the three sister labour parties
   in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand are refurbishing their
   agendas. We integrate Barrientos and Powell's framework, with Freeden's
   concept of ideological morphology, to systematically map the three
   parties across three main domains: their discourse and values, their
   political economy, and their social policy agendas. We then apply four
   different analytical frames to better understand the ideological and
   policy trajectories of our cases. These frames comprise `values, not
   ideology', `quietism', `third way', and `thin labourism'. We argue that
   the frame of `thin labourism' best captures the recent developments of
   these modern labour parties. In sum, the parties are still rooted in a
   recognisable centre-left tradition, but they operating from a narrower
   base of core values.},

Abstract = {Processes of constitutional discussion increasingly invite widespread
   popular inclusion and participation. Conceptual and practical problems
   remain, not least the respects in which inclusion is to take place. In
   deeply divided places, these challenges are intensified, first in the
   difficulties of conceptualising inclusion, and second in the practical
   dangers participation may pose to peace. We tackle these problems
   empirically by looking at a hard case of constitutional discussion amid
   division: the re-emergence of debate about Irish unity in Northern
   Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Through focus groups and
   interviews, we explore how `others', disengaged from the main political
   groups and defined transversally, approach the discussion, showing that
   they welcome the prospect of participation and seek to remove discursive
   triggers of conflict by focussing on shared everyday experience. We
   discuss the implications for the constitutional process and the likely
   impact on polarisation. The analysis has implications for the literature
   on divided societies, for constitutional theory and for policy. We argue
   that it is both possible and desirable to remedy group exclusion while
   facilitating universalistic discussion and lessening the dangers of
   polarisation. The policy implications are quite radical.},

Abstract = {How conspiracy theories mobilize protesters against the Covid-19
   measures and whether they harbor an underestimated potential for
   radicalization requires more research. This paper first recognizes the
   possibility of anti-government conspiracy theories to mobilize a
   heterogeneous ``resistance movement `` and theorizes their ability to
   radicalize some supporters. An analysis of 71 interviews from the German
   magazine ``Demokratischer Widerstand `` reveals that an entire
   ``Covid-regime `` is often marked as an enemy. The empirical
   investigation suggests that conspiracy beliefs reflect a means of
   processing adverse experiences and anxieties, yet are increasingly
   directed against the political order, fostering anti-democratic
   attitudes and actions.},

Abstract = {The recent popularity of nationalist movements bears witness to the
   continued power of national feeling in politics. This article considers
   the potential relationship between different kinds of national
   attachments and what we call active and allegiant citizenship-support
   for democracy, community participation, and prosocial behavior. We
   analyze these relationships using data from two waves of the European
   Values Study. We find that a set of attachments often called civic
   nationalism-including patriotism, national identity, and respect for
   one's country's institutions-are connected with better citizenship on
   virtually all of our outcomes, whereas ethnic nationalism is frequently
   connected with worse citizenship. These associations, however, tend to
   be weaker in the postcommunist states which have a different experience
   with both nationalism and democracy. The results suggest that national
   feeling can be a double-edged sword for citizenship.},

Abstract = {The general purpose of this paper is to examine the US' contemporary
   strategic approach on the Eastern Mediterranean in the analytical
   context of renewed great power tensions. Even though the Eastern
   Mediterranean does not constitute a high priority for Washington,
   following the 2017 strategic reorientation toward tackling rival great
   powers' international influence US foreign and security policy in the
   region is organized according to a dual balancing strategy vis-a-vis
   Russia and China. To investigate this hypothesis, we focus on two
   relevant subjects: developments in relations among Turkey, Greece, and
   Cyprus in conjunction with Russia's influence in the region and Europe's
   energy security and China's moves in the Eastern Mediterranean in the
   framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.},

Abstract = {This article explores Western donors' support for the decentralization
   reform in post-Euromaidan Ukraine prior to Russia's full-scale invasion
   of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, with a focus on the relationship between
   decentralization and conflict management. It demonstrates that, despite
   the protracted conflict in eastern Ukraine, bilateral donors have
   preferred to address Ukraine's decentralization from the governance
   reform perspective, rather than as a form of territorial self-governance
   (TSG) arrangement, linked to conflict resolution. They have also tended
   to ``outsource `` conflict-related support to multilateral
   organizations. This article explains the Russian Federation's use of the
   so-called Donetsk and Luhansk ``People's Republics `` as proxies in an
   international conflict and the contested nature of the role played by
   the Minsk Protocol in determining the form of support provided for
   reform. It concludes with insights into the implications of donor
   support for the decentralization reform in Ukraine for research on
   decentralization and other TSG solutions in conflict-affected contexts.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study, based on the conservation of resource theory, aims to
   investigate the negative impacts of abusive supervision on helping
   behaviors among employees by examining the mediating role of rumination
   and the moderating role of psychological flexibility.
   Design/methodology/approachA total sample of 282 reliable questionnaires
   are collected from 282 employees working in education and banking
   sectors of Pakistan. SPSS and AMOS are used for data analysis of the
   proposed model. FindingsThe findings reveal that rumination mediates the
   relationship between abusive supervision and employees' helping
   behavior. In addition, the results show that higher levels of
   psychological flexibility negatively moderate the relationship between
   abusive supervision and employees' helping behaviors through mediation.
   Practical implicationsThis study elucidates how and when abusive
   supervision deters helping behavior among employees and provides useful
   guidelines for banking/university's administration to understand harmful
   consequences of abusive supervision and take appropriate policy measures
   to lessen their harmful effects upon employees. Originality/valueBy
   proposing a moderated mediation model, this study discovers rumination
   as a key mediator that links abusive supervision to employees' helping
   behaviors and identifies the role of psychological flexibility in
   diminishing the negative impacts of abusive supervision upon employees'
   helping behaviors through rumination.},

Title = {Don't Kill the Messenger: Perceived Credibility of Far-Right Former
   Extremists and Police Officers in P/CVE Communication},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 6},
Abstract = {Former extremists and terrorists ('formers') are seen as key messengers
   and mentors in preventing and countering violent extremism (P/CVE).
   Their assumed effectiveness rests on their unique, intrinsic source
   credibility due to their biography. Having `walked the walk' and `talked
   the talk', it is widely assumed that such individuals are ideal to
   present counter messages. Formers are typically viewed as more credible
   and effective messengers in contrast to other messengers, in particular
   the police, when targeting `hard-to-reach' audiences. This study
   presents findings from an experimental survey that tested whether
   far-right former extremists and police officers are perceived as
   credible sources in P/CVE communications among the general population
   and among a far-right milieu. Challenging wide-held assumptions in the
   P/CVE field, the present study found that far-right former extremists
   are perceived as neither credible nor lacking credibility among the
   general population, nor are they perceived as credible among a far-right
   milieu. Further, police officers were found to have the highest
   credibility in P/CVE communication. The paper outlines policy options
   for engaging with former extremists in P/CVE: detailing ways to embed
   former extremists with messengers who have institutional expertise.},

Abstract = {My aim in this chapter is to explain the dynamics of what are termed
   `narratives'. I place in the fore-front the realities of `battles of
   narratives' characteristic of all armed conflict, violence and extreme
   competition between human-beings, in the attempt to understand what is
   happening. Truth and reality are under test, sometimes severe. Urban
   warfare is comprehensively described in other chapters, as derived in
   individuals' lives and experiences. The context provides extreme events
   with a multiplicity of concurrent narratives, most difficult to
   understand let alone resolve physically and in accord with ethical
   principles. I also find that the physical and mental battles of
   narratives can be both real and synthetic accounts. That means too often
   we are tempted to be fixated on `The Narrative' as a metaphor for

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine whether the documents prepared by
   the European Commission (EC) under the leadership of Ursula von der
   Leyen are based on a coherent vision of the international role to be
   played by the EU in the digital area. It attempts to achieve this goal
   by referring to two concepts popular in the analysis of the
   international role of the EU: as a normative and regulatory power. The
   question posed is, To what extent does the European Commission want the
   EU to play the role of a normative or regulatory power on the
   international stage in the field of digital policy? To answer it, the
   author focuses on an analysis of von der Leyen's speeches and selected
   EC documents. Following Mayring, the author has used a method involving
   the qualitative content analysis of speeches and policy documents. The
   author tries to find signs that the EC wants the Union to play a role as
   a normative or regulatory power in the digital sphere. The study shows
   that the titular institution refers to these concepts in its documents.
   The Commission also assumes that the Union can play both roles
   simultaneously, thus strengthening its ability to influence third
   parties in the digital sphere. However, whether it does so intentionally
   or because it lacks a concrete vision of the EU's international role in
   the digital area remains unresolved.},

Abstract = {U.S. interest and involvement in Central and Eastern European countries
   have gone through various phases, from an intensification, when the
   spread of democracy in countries of the former USSR became a priority of
   American foreign policy, through a period of decidedly weakened
   engagement of the United States in this region and focus on other areas,
   to a phase of renewed attention by American policymakers to the domestic
   affairs of European countries, on the one hand because of the democratic
   crisis and the ongoing process of democratic backsliding in many
   countries, and on the other hand with Russia's increasingly aggressive
   actions against Ukraine, culminating in the military attack launched on
   February 24, 2022. The author analyzes how the US foreign policy toward
   this region has changed over the past two-plus decades, both in the
   conceptual sphere and in the actual foreign assistance activities
   undertaken.},

Abstract = {After the Cold War, western states focused their activities on promoting
   democracy in the former communist countries in Central and Eastern
   Europe. These activities are based on the liberal assumption that
   ensuring democracy, respecting human rights, and building a market
   economy will create a zone of peace and prosperity. The US addressed its
   policy of exporting democracy to the CEE region, what in practice
   manifested itself as supporting pro-Western forces and organizing
   peaceful `regime change.' The EU has undertaken a policy of partnership
   with CEE countries and admitting the countries most advanced in
   democratic and market reforms. On the other hand, NATO pursues an `open
   door' policy and militarily strengthens its eastern flank. All this
   eastern policy of the West faces opposition from Russia, which does not
   recognize the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of states in its neighborhood,
   as it claims that they are a manifestation of the expansion of the USA
   and the West at the expense of its legitimate security interests. Russia
   is particularly opposed to Ukraine's efforts to join NATO. The CEE
   region has become a zone of competition for influence between the West
   and Russia, and this has led to Russia's policy of aggression toward
   Ukraine.},

Title = {A Decolonial Feminist Politics of Fieldwork: Centering Community,
   Reflexivity, and Loving Accountability},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {International studies scholarship has benefitted from insights from
   anthropology, peace and conflict studies, geography, and other
   disciplines to craft a thoughtful set of reflections and considerations
   for researchers to take with them ``into the field{''} when they embark
   on ``fieldwork.{''} In this essay, we map out a history of critical
   approaches to fieldwork, starting with the encounters that initially
   encouraged reflection on the positionality of the researcher and the
   power dynamics of research. Building on decolonial feminist scholarship,
   we show how a commitment to reflexive practice ``in the field{''} has
   developed further, through a reflection on the self as a researcher and
   on ``the field{''} as a construct. This ethical and political commitment
   prompts a rethinking of key concepts in fieldwork (and research more
   generally), including those of ``the researcher,{''} ``the research
   participant{''} (or ``population{''}), ``expertise,{''} and what
   constitutes ``data{''} and ``knowledge.{''} We argue that a preferable
   approach to critical fieldwork is grounded in feminist and decolonial,
   anti-racist, anti-capitalist politics. This approach is committed not
   just to reflecting critically on ``the field{''} and the interactions of
   the researcher within it but also to challenging the divisions,
   exclusions, and structures of oppression that sustain the separations
   between ``here{''} and ``there,{''} ``researcher{''} and
   ``researched,{''} and ``knower{''} and ``known.{''}
   El conocimiento academico en materia de estudios internacionales se ha
   beneficiado de los conocimientos de la antropologia, de los estudios en
   materia de paz y conflictos, de la geografia y de otras disciplinas con
   el fin de elaborar un conjunto reflexivo de reflexiones y
   consideraciones que los investigadores puedan llevar consigo ``a su
   campo{''} cuando se embarquen en ``trabajos de campo{''}. En este
   estudio trazamos una historia de los enfoques criticos del trabajo de
   campo, partiendo de aquellos encuentros que, inicialmente, alentaron la
   reflexion sobre la posicionalidad del investigador y las dinamicas de
   poder de la investigacion. Partiendo del conocimiento academico en
   materia de feminismo decolonial, demostramos como se ha ido
   desarrollado, en mayor medida, un compromiso con la practica reflexiva
   ``en el campo{''}, a traves de una reflexion sobre el yo como
   investigador y sobre ``el campo{''} como constructo. Este compromiso
   etico y politico impulsa un replanteamiento de conceptos clave en el
   trabajo de campo (y en la investigacion en general), incluyendo los
   conceptos de ``el investigador{''}, ``el participante en la
   investigacion{''} (o ``poblacion{''}), la ``experiencia{''}, asi como lo
   que constituye ``datos{''} y ``conocimiento{''}. Argumentamos que un
   enfoque preferible para el trabajo de campo critico deberia estar basado
   en politicas feministas y decoloniales, antirracistas y
   anticapitalistas. Este enfoque se compromete no solo a reflexionar
   criticamente sobre ``el campo{''} y las interacciones del investigador
   dentro de el, sino tambien a desafiar las divisiones, exclusiones y
   estructuras de opresion que sostienen las separaciones entre ``aqui{''}
   y ``alli{''}, ``investigador{''} e ``investigado{''} y ``conocedor{''} y
   ``conocido{''}.
   La recherche en etudes internationales a beneficie de renseignements
   issus de l'anthropologie, des etudes de la paix et des conflits, de la
   geographie et d'autres disciplines. Cela a permis d'elaborer un ensemble
   complet de reflexions et de considerations que les chercheurs peuvent
   exploiter << sur le terrain >> lorsqu'ils se lancent dans un << travail
   de terrain >>. Dans cet essai, nous retracons l'histoire des approches
   critiques du travail de terrain, en commencant par les rencontres qui
   ont initialement encourage a la reflexion sur la positionnalite du
   chercheur et sur les dynamiques de pouvoir de la recherche. Nous nous
   appuyons sur la recherche feministe decoloniale pour montrer la maniere
   dont un engagement pour une pratique reflexive << sur le terrain >> a
   continue a se developper par le biais d'une reflexion sur le soi en tant
   que chercheur et sur << le terrain >> en tant que construction. Cet
   engagement ethique et politique invite a reetudier des concepts cles du
   travail de terrain (et plus globalement de la recherche), notamment ceux
   de << chercheur >>, de << participant a l'etude >> (ou de << population
   >>), << d'expertise >> et de ce qui constitue les << donnees >> et les
   << connaissances >>. Nous soutenons qu'une approche preferable du
   travail de terrain critique est ancree dans des politiques feministes et
   decoloniales, anti-racistes et anti-capitalistes. Cette approche
   s'engage non seulement a mener une reflexion critique sur << le terrain
   >> et sur les interactions du chercheur en son sein, mais aussi a
   remettre en question les divisions, exclusions et structures
   d'oppression qui entretiennent les separations entre << ici >> et <<
   la-bas >>, entre << chercheur >> et << participant a l'etude >> et entre
   << connaissant >> et << connu >>.},

Abstract = {Scholars have noted the compatibility of right-wing populism-centering
   on belief in an antagonistic relationship between `the people' and `the
   elite' - with climate change skepticism. In this paper, we examine
   process skepticism, a type of criticism that we argue is especially
   well-aligned with populism. Process skepticism focuses not on denying
   evidence of climate change (evidence skepticism) nor on critiquing
   policy responses (response skepticism), but on directly attacking the
   scientific and political processes underlying climate science and policy
   decision-making. We examine the prevalence of populist ideas in climate
   skeptical frames disseminated in U.S. media between 2008 and 2020. As
   expected, we find robust evidence of populist skepticism, particularly
   in far-right outlets. More importantly, the majority of populist
   messages were process skeptical in nature. The emergence of process
   skeptical populist frames may critically impede climate policy efforts
   by promoting distrust that is especially resistant to increasing
   scientific evidence or policy advancements.},

Abstract = {Civil-military relations and terrorism are both extensively studied
   subjects. Their relationship has, however, yet to be examined. We
   maintain that public conflict between the civilian and the military
   leadership in a country and declining civil control over the armed
   forces may often precipitate a rise in domestic terror events.
   Civil-military conflict and reduced civilian control can lead to agency
   slack by the armed forces and ineffective counterterror policies. These
   phenomena are also associated with policies that exclude groups in
   society and generate grievances, leading some to turn to terror. In zero
   inflated negative binomial analyses of domestic terror events and two
   distinct indicators of civil-military tension, we find support for our
   contention. Terror incidents increase both when civil-military conflict
   rises and when civilian control decreases. Our results add to
   understanding of both the domestic consequences of civil-military
   tension and the types of influences that impact domestic terror.},

Abstract = {Migration is widely considered a sensitive and contested area of EU
   policymaking, with Member States reluctant to cede control. Yet,
   supranational rules on `legal migration' increasingly reduce Member
   State discretion to control migration. While Commission entrepreneurship
   has been proposed as an explanation, its importance for supranational
   outcomes remains unclear. To understand the role of Commission
   entrepreneurship in enabling supranational policy outcomes, this study
   traces the negotiations of on one central labour migration policy, the
   Intra-Corporate Transferee Directive. I demonstrate how the Commission
   was able to defuse opposition by proposing a narrow policy instrument
   and framing it as a matter of business needs, international obligations
   and competitiveness rather than labour migration. This enabled an
   environment of `quiet politics' where concerns over sovereignty and
   control were tuned down to a preference for administrative flexibility.
   The findings have implications for our understanding of the dynamics of
   supranationalization in politically sensitive policy areas.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the economic contribution of migrant
   workers in maintaining essential services and access to goods. This new
   perspective on migrants as essential workers raised expectations in
   migration studies that it could reinvigorate an inclusive setting in
   terms of migration debates and policies. Building on this potential, we
   examine migration debates in the political party arena with a focus on
   centrist parties. The analysis focuses on Austria, a country with a high
   dependence on migrant labor in key sectors and a long-standing
   contestation of migration across the political party spectrum. Drawing
   on an analysis of parliamentary contributions and press releases by the
   Austrian People's Party (oVP) and the Social Democratic Party of Austria
   (SPo) during the pandemic, the study finds that the debates did not
   change fundamentally. Whilst external shocks such as the Covid-19
   pandemic have a limited potential to reverse the focus on unwanted
   migration in European party politics, crises can lead the political
   center to reemphasize bifurcation strategies in response to shifts in
   public discourse, as this study of the Austrian case during the pandemic
   suggests.},

Abstract = {Despite emigrations' adverse impacts on several EU Member States,
   especially in Central Eastern Europe, topics like brain drain and
   depopulation have received relatively little attention at EU level
   compared to concerns associated with free movement and immigration. This
   article offers an answer to why this is so. Drawing on agenda-setting
   theory, it argues that the institutional framework of the EU both
   inhibits and disincentivises attempts to turn emigration into an EU
   level topic. Seen through the lens of the EU policy, regulating
   emigration becomes a matter of cohesion policy, which makes it both
   difficult and unattractive to lobby. To assess the argument empirically,
   the article draws on elite interviews with national and EU policymakers
   and document analysis from 2010 to 2023. The analysis reveals a
   structural bias of the EU and offers an example of how pertinent
   political issues fail to become EU topics.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship in law and society has engaged in novel ways with
   maritime spaces, articulating how they inform legal theory more broadly.
   This essay builds on such scholarship, and on a broad-brushed survey of
   maritime history, to make two basic arguments. First, a look at
   political and legal processes regarding maritime spaces reveals that law
   is transnational `all the way down'. Legal theorists often assume that
   transnational legal processes are an added layer beyond domestic and
   international law. But the maritime perspective reveals that
   transnationalism comes first, both analytically and historically, as a
   constant negotiation of the relationship between what is `inside' and
   what is `outside' a polity. Second, the maritime space begins, at least
   in dominant legal traditions, as an absolute exteriority - imagined as
   outside or beyond polities and jurisdictions. But with the climate
   crisis and the emergence of the Anthropocene we may observe an
   inversion, the sea now appears as a record of harmful human activity; a
   mirror showing a troublesome collective portrait of humanity. The
   inversion from a maritime exteriority to the intimacy of ubiquitous
   environmental harm defines the parameters of law and politics today. The
   essay concludes with reflections on how the maritime perspective may
   best be engaged today in responding to that image through political
   action. It conceptualizes what I call the `commonist lifeboat' - a model
   of bottom-up universalism for tumultuous times.},

Abstract = {Recent research reveals that EU agencies have initiated a whole set of
   voluntary accountability practices. Reputational considerations have
   been put forward as an important mechanism driving such organisational
   behaviour. This paper tests this theoretical explanation in a
   quantitative manner based on a survey among EU agency leaders. We find
   that the factors explaining voluntary accountability differ depending on
   the audience to whom account is rendered. Nonetheless, a consistent
   finding is that media salience is associated with voluntary
   account-giving, which supports the argument that voluntary
   account-giving helps agencies to mitigate the risks of reputational
   threats. The analysis also suggests that voluntary accountability is
   useful for highlighting the agency's competence when principals are not
   paying close attention to the agency's performance. These results show
   that a reputational, multi-audience perspective helps us understand
   which EU agencies are likely to become accountability entrepreneurs and
   to whom they will expand their accountability.},

Abstract = {This article uses concepts from Lacanian discourse analysis to examine
   the rise and fall of Liz Truss, and to draw conclusions about the nature
   and resilience of neoliberalism. I begin by outlining Lacan's theory of
   the four discourses in relation to neoliberalism, distinguishing a
   `neoliberal master discourse' comprising soaring rhetoric about freedom
   and prosperity, from a `neoliberal university discourse' grounded in
   economic science. I argue Liz Truss represented an unusually pure form
   of the neoliberal master discourse, prioritising notions of freedom and
   prosperity over the more pragmatic focus on austerity and market
   discipline. However, when Truss' discourse failed it led not to the
   repudiation of neoliberalism, but rather to the return of a neoliberal
   university discourse of austerity developed by Rishi Sunak and Jeremy
   Hunt. I conclude that the relationship between the neoliberal master and
   university discourses is crucial to understanding the ongoing discursive
   resilience of neoliberalism.},

Title = {Estimating the effect of policy entrepreneurship on individual

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLICY ANALYSIS},

Abstract = {Most studies of policy entrepreneurship seek to understand how
   entrepreneurs influence the behavior of policy-makers in the
   agenda-setting or decision-making phases of the policy process. Recent
   scholarship has sought to understand what role entrepreneurs might play
   in policy implementation by focusing on their ability to influence
   bureaucrats' discretion and behavior. However, these studies overlook
   the potentially critical influence of policy entrepreneurs during the
   implementation of ``opt-in{''} policies that require voluntary
   compliance by individuals to be successful. Here, we consider whether
   and how a visible policy entrepreneur can impact opt-in policy
   implementation, focusing on their credibility-or ability to gain public
   trust-as a potential driving factor of their influence. Using the
   empirical context of COVID-19 vaccination recommendations, we identify
   Dr. Anthony Fauci as a highly visible policy entrepreneur and assess his
   influence on individual vaccine intention and uptake. Drawing on data
   from a novel panel survey of the American public on attitudes about the
   virus, risk, politics, and vaccination during the first several months
   of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the United States, we test the
   relationship between respondent trust in Dr. Fauci and changes in
   reported intention to vaccinate and vaccination uptake across time. We
   find that trust in Dr. Fauci is an important predictor for influencing
   individuals' intention to vaccinate and actual vaccination behavior.},

Abstract = {Private regulations are often presented as low-cost and flexible
   institutions that can act as policy incubators. In this article, I
   question under which conditions they go beyond legal compliance and
   experiment with new rules. Based on a content analysis of 126 data
   privacy regulations adopted between 1995 and 2016 in the European Union
   and the United States and thirty-five semistructured interviews, I show
   that most private regulations include no regulatory novelties. By
   disaggregating the temporal and spatial distribution of the few
   novelties, I add nuance to this overall finding and show that private
   regulations adopted in the United States before 2000 experimented more
   than others. I argue that this variation reflects the different demands
   for private regulation in the two jurisdictions and their evolution over
   time. In the European Union, the early adoption of privacy laws led
   public regulators and businesses to look for private regulations to
   reduce transaction costs and thus limited their interest in
   experimenting with new requirements. In the United States, businesses
   hoped to gain a first-mover advantage by including new data privacy
   rules in their private regulations. However, the growing use of private
   regulations to ease transnational data flows also led to their use as
   tools to reduce transaction costs.},

Title = {The Moral Economy of Welfare: Bulgarian Roma Migrants Reclaiming Social
   Citizenship through Fraud},

Abstract = {This paper explores the constitution of a moral economy of welfare
   through acts of benefit fraud. The structural conditions of contemporary
   labour, citizenship and migration regimes in Europe exclude large shares
   of workers from access to social citizenship and place them in a
   position of undeserving trespassers of the social contract. Drawing on
   the case of Bulgarian Roma engaged in precarious labour and short-term
   intensive mobility between Bulgaria and the Netherlands, I show how
   labour conditions in both countries and the structures of the welfare
   regimes effectively exclude them from access to social citizenship and
   confine them to the realms of informal work, thus putting them in a
   position of differential inclusion. The benefit fraud in this context
   has multiple interpretations-ranging from crime through a survival
   strategy to a claim to social justice. By mobilizing the idea of the
   moral economy of welfare, I seek to explain how migrants justify their
   actions not as a transgression, but as a claim to social citizenship and
   a critique of an unjust social and economic order. In a moral economy of
   welfare, the migrants see themselves as deserving state support both by
   virtue of being citizens and of being good workers. Being excluded from
   proper welfare support is interpreted as a failure of both states. In
   this context, the fraud is framed in moral terms as an act of
   citizenship aiming to restore justice.},

Abstract = {Surveying the role of the arts in social movements offers approaches for
   ways in which art therapists can be collaborators in peacebuilding. A
   contemporary review of activist and protest art reveals four sources of
   inspiration for how art therapists can contribute: intentional symbols
   and metaphors, solidarity, memorializing, and resilience. When
   integrated with peacebuilding strategies, art therapists can support
   social movements by visualizing injustices, representing voices,
   bringing people together, and imagining solutions. By working in
   collaboration with peacebuilders, art therapists can apply social
   justice stances to different strands of peacebuilding.},

Abstract = {Narratives, it is often said, help us make sense of the world. They
   structure reality and reduce complexity. Yet narratives, we argue, are
   also visionary. They open up worlds, they allow us to imagine
   alternative realities and render a matter urgent. In our study of
   counterterrorism exercises for the German police we examine the
   `governing forces' of narratives: Narratives help to connect the dots
   and create a sense of how new forms of terrorism have entered urban
   life, thus making new forms of security responses seem indispensable.
   They also help bring the police trainees close to the realness of a
   threat as well as of the training situation. `Naming the city' where
   terror attacks have happened works like a vehicle that transports the
   experience. Bringing approaches of narrative criminology into dialogue
   with studies of governmentality allows us to capture the forms of
   subjectivity that the trainings produce. Rather than a top-down
   endeavour of the state, security is better understood in how it is put
   into practice - and how the unforeseeable is meant to be embodied.},

Abstract = {The recent resurgence of inflation in Europe has led the ECB to increase
   interest rates and phase out asset purchase programmes designed to
   address the effects of the Great Financial Crisis. This article
   investigates how the ECB has adjusted its logic of responsibility
   throughout this series of crises. Using a topic model and in-depth
   analysis of speeches, we examine the ECB's strategic framing of linkages
   related to inflation during three historical periods: the Central Bank
   Independence (CBI) era (1998-2011), the secular stagnation era
   (2011-2021), and the new inflation era (2021-). Our findings indicate
   that modifications made to the CBI's linkages during the secular
   stagnation era shaped the ECB's framing of the new inflation era in a
   novel way. However, despite acknowledging difficult policy tradeoffs,
   which they used to downplay in the past, ECB policymakers have continued
   to reframe its initial imperative of responsibility in the hope of
   avoiding policy discussions on regime change.},

Abstract = {The Council of Europe's Budapest Convention on cybercrime (2001) remains
   a key landmark in multilateral governance on cybersecurity. Negotiated
   over two decades ago, this regional agreement gains renewed significance
   today through its enduring impact, its rarity as a binding multilateral
   agreement on cyber-issues, and its role in shaping the debate on free
   speech and the criminalization of online content. This article asks how
   the almost-total exclusion of content crimes from the Convention can be
   explained. Drawing on new documents published for the twentieth
   anniversary of the Convention, including detailed testimonials from its
   chair and principal drafters, the article highlights the importance of
   long-term career connections among technically-savvy and diplomatically
   experienced negotiators, creating a transnational policy network that
   overcame differences and power imbalances. Understanding how the
   Budapest Convention resolved disagreements helps contextualize current
   crises in multilateral cybersecurity and cybercrime governance and
   provides a path away from growing digital authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {This paper reconceptualises the subaltern as a power-position based on
   Gramsci, countering the postcolonial subject-positioning, to uncover
   inter-subaltern hierarchies. Postcolonial nationalist discourse
   perpetuates a static West/non-West dichotomy, obscuring dominations
   within the `non-West'. A Gramscian perspective allows for understanding
   subalternity as relative power and as an objective condition for undoing
   subalternity, enabling an examination of hegemony and subalternity
   beyond the West/non-West dichotomy. The emergence of the Kurdish third
   way through the Rojava Revolution and the Peoples' Democratic Party
   (HDP), rooted in Kurdish subaltern consciousness, illustrates this
   perspective by challenging Arab and Turkish nationalist hegemonies and
   state dominations in Syria and Turkey.},

Abstract = {In the context of China's central government's promotion of local
   officials' performance evaluation for environmental protection and the
   division of responsibilities between the party and the government, this
   study investigated China's political budget cycles and conducted
   empirical tests using data obtained from 2007 to 2020 for provincial
   officials. It was found that in the middle of their tenure, provincial
   governors tend to expand expenditures for economic development and
   environmental protection, while provincial party secretaries only expand
   expenditures for economic development. This finding reveals three
   important logics running through the operations of China's political
   budget cycles, namely, top-down logic, timing logic, and division of
   labor logic. These results are validated through various robustness
   tests. Further analysis found no significant correlation between
   provincial officials' years in office and expanded expenditures on
   economic development and environmental protection. Moreover, the fiscal
   strategy of expanding expenditures in the middle of their tenure showed
   no significant positive influence on their promotion. The aforementioned
   findings provide new evidence and insights for a deeper understanding of
   the influence of political factors on the cyclical fluctuations of
   China's local fiscal policies.},

Abstract = {This article explores what it is to explain extremism. Rather than
   providing yet another explanation of extremism, it takes a bird's eye
   point of view at existing explanations of extremism. What is it that
   scholars are doing in seeking explanations of extremism? This article
   answers this question by considering four issues. First, exactly what is
   the explanandum for explanations of extremism, what is it that we seek
   to explain? Second, what is it to explain extremism rather than
   describing, interpreting, understanding, or predicting it? Third, how
   can explanations of extremism be categorized and what does that mean for
   the extent to which can they be combined? Fourth, what semantics is
   useful in construing an explanation of extremism? It turns out that most
   insights equally apply to explanations of related yet distinct
   phenomena, such as fundamentalism, fanaticism, conspiracy theorizing,
   and terrorism. The article concludes by providing five concrete
   guidelines that will help fine-tune and compare various explanations of
   extremism.},

Abstract = {Why, and to what extent, must taxpayers share the costs of raising
   children with parents? The most influential argument over this question
   has been the public goods argument: Taxpayers must share costs with
   parents because and to the extent that child-rearing contributes toward
   public goods by helping to develop valuable human capital. However,
   political theorists have not examined the public goods argument in a
   context in which replacement migration is available: If replacement
   migration can provide valuable human capital more efficiently than
   child-rearing, can the public goods argument still justify a taxpayer
   obligation to share the costs of child-rearing? This article argues that
   there are importantly different versions of the public goods argument,
   and that on a plausible version of that argument, it can withstand the
   replacement migration challenge under most circumstances.},

Abstract = {Do UN missions reduce forced displacement? Facing insecure environments,
   civilians are left with three choices: staying; moving to a safer
   community; or moving outside their country. Their aspiration and ability
   to move depend on individual characteristics and macro-level factors,
   such as the social, economic and political context in which these people
   live. Research shows that UN missions can impact and reset the
   macro-level context altered by war, especially in the security and
   economic domain. However, we lack empirical evidence on whether this
   impact helps UN peacekeeping tackle forced displacement and returns.
   This article offers the first global analysis of whether and how UN
   missions can shape aggregate population movements during civil wars. We
   combine data on outflows and returns of refugees and internally
   displaced people (IDPs) with data on distinct UN missions' features that
   we expect to affect population movements, namely the size of their
   contingents and their mandated tasks. Using matched samples, we find
   that the unfolding of the outflows and inflows processes are affected by
   different features of UN missions. Sizeable deployments decrease IDPs
   flows and encourage their return; refugee outflows, on the other hand,
   may increase in presence of UN missions. Furthermore, missions with
   displacement-related mandates are associated with decreasing IDP flows
   overall, but only encourage refugees' returns.},

Abstract = {In Hood's (1983) classic ``NATO{''} scheme, nodality-centrality and
   visibility in information networks-is one of the four tools of
   government. Despite its potential as a resource to effect policy change,
   contemporary scholars have largely neglected this unique policy tool.
   However, the growing prominence of digital platforms in public life
   prompts a rediscovery of this concept. The decisive shift is the
   parallel growth of citizen nodality, which can increase societal
   capacity and enhance government nodality, partly by allowing citizens to
   challenge government nodality. Moreover, citizen nodality and government
   nodality can interact to promote more democratic government. With the
   aim of rediscovering and updating nodality, this article defines the
   concept, reviews how the modern digital landscape has transformed the
   practice of nodality, and proposes a conceptual and methodological
   toolkit. The goal is to understand how nodality may be more effectively
   used by policy-makers while at the same time fostering democratic
   governance.},

Title = {Government Ownership of IMF Conditionality Programs: Conceptualization,
   Measurement, and Validation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {The shifting emphasis on performance evaluation and accountability in
   the context of financial lending or foreign-aid arrangements sponsored
   by international organizations (IOs) has brought to the fore the
   question of government ownership of reforms. While the concept of
   ownership has featured highly in academic and policy debates over the
   effects of IO conditionality, it arguably remains theoretically elusive,
   ill-identified, and under-specified. In this article, we focus on
   International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs and define government
   ownership with respect to the counterfactual level of de jure structural
   reforms that would be achieved in the absence of IMF conditionality. We
   then use the synthetic control method to identify continuous levels of
   ownership as a function of a treatment effect on treated compliers and
   operationalize the concept of ownership over external- and
   financial-sector conditionality across a restricted sample of
   uninterrupted IMF arrangements (1980-2014). Furthermore, we probe the
   criterion and construct validity of our measure with respect to known
   determinants, proxies, and outcomes of ownership. We argue that ours is
   a reliable, replicable, valid, robust, and systematic measure of
   ownership that can help better identify and estimate the indirect
   relationship between program design and policy implementation.
   El enfasis cambiante en la evaluacion del desempeno y la responsabilidad
   en el contexto de los prestamos financieros o los acuerdos de ayuda
   exterior patrocinados por organizaciones internacionales (OOII) ha
   puesto de relieve la cuestion de la apropiacion de las reformas por
   parte del Gobierno. Si bien el concepto de la apropiacion ha ocupado un
   lugar destacado en los debates academicos y politicos sobre los efectos
   de la condicionalidad de las OOII, podria decirse que sigue siendo
   teoricamente elusivo, mal identificado y poco especificado. En este
   articulo, nos centramos en los programas del Fondo Monetario
   Internacional y definimos la apropiacion por parte del Gobierno en
   relacion con el nivel contrafactual de las reformas estructurales de
   jure que se lograrian en ausencia de la condicionalidad del FMI. A
   continuacion, utilizamos el metodo de control sintetico para identificar
   niveles continuos de apropiacion como funcion de un efecto de
   tratamiento sobre los cumplidores (compliers) tratados. Ademas,
   utilizamos este metodo para poner en practica el concepto de apropiacion
   sobre la condicionalidad de los sectores externo y financiero en una
   muestra restringida de acuerdos ininterrumpidos del FMI (1980-2014).
   Finalmente, investigamos la validez de criterio y de constructo de
   nuestra medida con respecto a los determinantes, indicadores y
   resultados conocidos de la apropiacion. Argumentamos que nuestra
   medicion de la apropiacion es fiable, replicable, valida, solida y
   sistematica que puede ayudar a identificar y estimar mejor la relacion
   indirecta entre el diseno de los programas y la implementacion de
   politicas.
   L'interet croissant pour l'evaluation des performances et la
   responsabilite dans le contexte des prets financiers ou des arrangements
   relatifs a l'aide etrangere des organisations internationales (OI) a
   fait apparaitre la question de la propriete gouvernementale des
   reformes. Bien que le concept de propriete se situe au c oe ur des
   debats academiques et politiques relatifs aux effets de la
   conditionnalite des OI, il reste complique a theoriser, mal identifie et
   peu precise. Dans cet article, nous nous focalisons sur les programmes
   du Fonds Monetaire International pour definir la propriete
   gouvernementale relativement au niveau contrefactuel des reformes
   structurelles de jure qui seraient obtenues en l'absence de la
   conditionnalite du FMI. Ensuite, nous utilisons la methode a controle
   synthetique pour identifier les niveaux durables de propriete comme une
   fonction d'un effet de traitement sur les patients volontaires. Nous
   souhaitons egalement rendre operationnel le concept de propriete de la
   conditionnalite des secteurs externes et financiers au sein d'un
   echantillon restreint d'accords ininterrompus du FMI (1980-2014). De
   plus, nous sondons le critere pour etablir la validite de notre mesure
   par rapport aux determinants, intermediaires et resultats connus de la
   propriete. Nous soutenons la fiabilite, la replicabilite, la validite,
   la solidite et la systematicite de notre mesure de la responsabilite.
   Elle permet de mieux identifier et estimer la relation indirecte entre
   la conception d'un programme et la mise en application d'une politique.},

Abstract = {This special issue examines the `disruptive' effects of the COVID-19
   pandemic, focusing on how researchers working on sub-Saharan Africa and
   the Middle East have been constrained to adapt their research practices.
   It delves into the `making' of research during a pandemic, exploring the
   short-, medium-, and long-term impacts and the challenges and
   adjustments that have arisen. The issue addresses three main areas : the
   reformulation of research objects and methodological approaches, the
   reconfiguration of access to fieldwork and respondents, and the
   rebalancing effects of the pandemic on research dynamics between the
   Global North and South.},

Title = {Developing Xiong'an New Area: A new regime for space production in
   China's national technopole?},
Journal = {GLOBAL PUBLIC POLICY AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {292-308},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Xiong'an New Area is not only a newly emerging and nationally endorsed
   technopole, it is also regarded as a test-bed for novel forms of
   governance and financial management in China. Although it is currently
   only in its starting phase, Xiong'an demonstrates that various
   institutional features are very different from those found in
   traditional technopoles, such as National High-tech Industrial
   Development Zones (NHTIDZs). How such institutional innovation affects
   feasibility and viability of the construction and maintenance of new
   high-tech metropolises is under-studied. This article develops a
   conceptual framework based on the theory of space production and
   identifies two types of space production, global industrialization and
   local urbanization, which are then applied to the NHTIDZs. Analysis of
   the situation in Xiong'an leads to the conclusion that Xiong'an
   represents a mode of strong state-led space production within China's
   governance modernization. This not only opens the door to a
   reconsideration of current land finance and social management systems
   but it also implies that the transferability of its institutional
   innovations is limited to other cities where imposing greater social
   control through technologies is possible.},

Abstract = {Does ideology prevent social movements from resorting to violence?
   Structuralist, organisational, or political economy theories are widely
   agnostic on the relationship between ideology and the use of violence.
   In contrast, this article argues that founding ideologies indirectly
   shape social movements' long-run decisions regarding the use violence,
   primarily by influencing the kind of individuals who join the movement
   to begin with. A path dependency develops as new members reinforce the
   initial ideology, as individuals who might tip the
   ideological-organisational equilibrium towards utilising new tactics
   join other organisations instead. Over time, ideology morphes from being
   initially an endogenous factor into an exogenous constraint how the
   group can behave. The article compares the mainstream Egyptian Muslim
   Brotherhood (MB), al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya (IG) and the Jihad Organisation
   (JO), studying individual biographies, the groups' recruitment patterns
   and their corresponding ideologies. The article thereby explains why the
   MB, with some minor exceptions, remained committed to non-violent
   activism, in contrast with the JO that resorted to violent means only
   and the IG that applied both violent and non-violent means. In the
   conclusion, the article addresses cases in Algeria and Madagascar to
   indicate the relevance of this argument beyond Egyptian Islamist
   movements to future comparative work.},

Abstract = {Cueca brava, urban cueca from Santiago, has historically been a
   male-dominated song and dance practice. Its vocal technique, canto
   gritado, is often considered synonymous with masculine bravado. However,
   in the 2010s, the singer Josi Villanueva began transforming this scene
   by teaching women to sing cueca brava. The experiences of participants
   in Villanueva's community classes were shaped by Chile's Mayo Feminista
   movement in 2018, and her pedagogical practices help participants enact
   an embodied process of sacando la voz (raising one's voice) through
   which women dismantle the limits put on their bodies and voices when
   they are silenced in musical or social spaces.Historicamente, la cueca
   brava, o cueca urbana de Santiago, ha sido una practica de canto y baile

Abstract = {This paper introduces the theoretical concept of perceived resource
   access security in order to assess the link between natural resource
   scarcity and interstate conflict. It develops the hypothesis that
   resource access through international trade is an important determinant
   for conflict behaviour of states arising from resource concerns,
   implying a shift in focus away from endowments and towards competition
   for access. The main analysis is conducted in the form of a unit fixed
   effects logistic regression covering country-dyads of the period
   1962-2010 with military interstate dispute (MID) initiation as dependent
   variable. The empirical findings consistently demonstrate that a
   diversified position in resource supply networks mitigates the conflict
   propensity of states characterized by outside dependence for access to
   natural resources, and thereby help to determine conditions under which
   trade reduces conflict.},

Abstract = {How strongly embraced within the officer corps is the commitment to
   supporting and defending the Constitution and to the ethic of
   nonpartisanship? This article answers that question through a 2019/2020
   survey of 1,470 service academy students, including with a list
   experiment. The results show that cadets engage in what we term
   ``selective endorsement{''} of norms, whereby they endorse norms as long
   as they are not in tension with their partisan identities. In
   particular, the list experiment reveals that when provided an
   opportunity to obscure their preferences, many cadets supported
   following civilian orders, even those at odds with democratic
   traditions-and that partisan dynamics may play a role in determining how
   they respond. The article has important implications for scholarly
   research on norm robustness and socialization, as well as practical
   consequences for civil-military relations in light of ongoing challenges
   to democracy in the United States today.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the speed of rulemaking in American state
   governments. Drawing on a unique data set of over 250,000 individual
   rules issued by states from 1993 through 2009, we introduce new measures
   of the speed and breadth of rulemaking in American state bureaucracies,
   providing a new way of evaluating the incidence of rulemaking delay
   within and across governments. We focus specifically on how
   professionalism and oversight powers of state legislative and executive
   branches affect rulemaking speed and find that states with more
   professionalized legislatures and governments with extensive
   legislative/executive oversight powers experience greater delays in rule
   adoption. These findings provide important new insights into the
   politics of regulatory delay and suggest disparate ways in which
   sub-national governments approach regulatory policymaking in a federal
   system.},

Abstract = {With the outbreak of the pandemic, in the midst of the worst crisis in
   the tourist sector in Uruguay, and in a context of entrepreneurs'
   general concurrence with government measures as opposed to marked worker
   dissatisfaction, the links of the center-right government headed by Luis
   Lacalle Pou with businessmen and tourism workers have been characterized
   by cooperation rather than conflict. This situation can be attributed to
   the preexistence of a social protection framework and solid labor
   institutionality, the country's democratic strength and political
   culture favoring dialogue, and the instrumental business power compared
   with the weakness of the tourism workers' collective action. En medio de
   la peor crisis del sector turistico, y en un contexto de conformidad con
   las medidas gubernamentales por parte de los empresarios y de marcada
   disconformidad por parte de los trabajadores, el vinculo entre el
   gobierno de centroderecha de Luis Lacalle Pou y los empresarios y
   trabajadores del turismo se ha caracterizado por la cooperacion mas que
   por el conflicto. Esta situacion puede atribuirse a la combinacion de
   factores asociados a la preexistencia de una matriz de proteccion social
   y una solida institucionalidad laboral; a la fortaleza democratica del
   pais; a su cultura politica favorecedora del dialogo y al poder
   instrumental del empresariado frente a la debilidad de la accion
   colectiva de los trabajadores del turismo.},

Title = {The role of sexism in holding politicians accountable for sexual
   misconduct},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Experimental research on the impact of the \#MeToo movement on the
   evaluation of politicians has focused on how the impact is conditioned
   by partisan motivation. Beyond partisanship, gender identity and sexist
   attitudes may also act as a barrier to the success of \#MeToo in
   challenging sexual misconduct in politics. In a conjoint experiment, we
   examine the extent to which sexism and gender identities
   (feminine/masculine identity and self-identified gender) condition how
   individuals respond to politicians accused of sexual misconduct.
   Respondents were shown two profiles of fictional British male candidates
   accused of sexual misconduct where the characteristics of the candidate
   and the scandal were (the number of allegations made, whether they
   apologized for the misconduct, their partisanship, and their stance on
   Brexit). We find that in general, more severe misconduct has a more
   negative impact on evaluations but that respondents who expressed
   attitudes consistent with hostile sexism were less likely to punish
   politicians for multiple offenses and less likely to reward a
   recognition of wrongdoing. Categorical gender identity, whether the
   respondent was a man or a woman, did not condition the electoral
   consequences of the scandal and a feminine and masculine identities
   moderated the impact of the political stance of the candidate. We
   conclude by discussing the importance of measuring gender attitudes,
   especially sexism and non-categorical measures of gender identity, in
   future studies on the political consequences of \#MeToo.},

Abstract = {Theorists of the transnational cleavage, defined as a political reaction
   against European integration and immigration, also regularly
   conceptualise international trade preferences as a component of this
   contemporary societal divide. Yet empirical analyses of this cleavage
   focus on the former two topics, while trade and the transnational
   cleavage has not been systematically investigated. Making use of a new
   item in the 2019 Chapel Hill Expert Survey that measures party support
   for protection of domestic producer groups versus support for trade
   liberalisation, we examine the applicability of explanations for
   European integration positioning for the topic of trade. The results
   show that party positions on international trade correlate with parties'
   underlying two-dimensional ideology: parties of the economic left and
   culturally conservative parties support trade protection. The findings
   advance previous studies on the transnational cleavage and party
   positioning on trade, and demonstrate the continued importance of
   economic factors in driving patterns of trade protection.},

Abstract = {The European Commission has traditionally held a weak position in the
   policy domain of EU security and defence policy and has been seen as a
   `least likely' case of supranational integration. Nevertheless, in
   recent years, the Commission has steadily expanded its role and ambition
   within this policy field - a process which gained in momentum after
   Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Thus, this
   article investigates how the war in Ukraine has led to the establishment
   of new security and defence initiatives and to a stronger geopolitical
   role for the Commission. This paper theorises that the war in Ukraine is
   serving as an engine of integration. The article traces how the
   Commission seizes the windows of opportunity created by crises to
   strategically expand its mandate on security and defence policy and in
   the development of the sanctions policy regime.},

Abstract = {This study examines intra-group competition over settlements in
   protracted conflicts, focusing on how they empower certain veto players
   allowing them to make deals across ethnic boundaries to compete with
   co-ethnic elites for in-group support. Institutional settlements can
   provide material benefits alongside conditions for participation in
   shared institutions to access those benefits. Cooperative players who
   emerge as alternatives to status quo veto players undermine existing
   elites' support by striking bargains across ethnic boundaries, including
   on institutional participation to provide public goods, rather than
   maintaining ethnic closure. Cooperative players emerge during periods of
   economic decline, elite-led group closure, and when solutions to
   practical problems are linked to peace settlements. This argument is
   developed using analysis of group-level competition during settlement
   efforts in Cyprus and Kosovo.},

Abstract = {The study of scientific advisory committees (SACs) is a recurrent topic
   of research in public policy and public administration. Scholars are
   increasingly interested in analyzing the scientization of policy advice
   as well as the role played by knowledge-based policymaking processes.
   Despite recent developments in the field, SACs studies continue to face
   an analytical and empirical gap due to the lack of parsimonious
   conceptualizations of the characteristics that enable them to be both
   theoretically relevant and effective in driving comparative analysis. To
   fill this research gap, this article proposes a novel typology of SACs
   based on a specific conceptualization of the motivations of policymakers
   that allows the selection of two classificatory criteria: the origin of
   the members and the degree to which their expertise is homogeneous. The
   theoretical relevance of this typology is illustrated by applying it to
   the SACs established in the Italian regions to address the COVID-19
   pandemic. The article highlights the relevance of the typology to the
   theory underlying the empirical analysis. In doing so, it provides
   relevant insights into the composition and nature of SACs that is useful
   not only for the academic debate on evidence-based policymaking but also
   for both practitioners and decision-makers.},

Abstract = {The British military institution, like other armed organizations
   worldwide, relies heavily on the unpaid domestic labour performed by
   civilian women married to its servicemen. This labour does not often
   feature in public understandings of how the military functions, and
   feminists have argued that its invisibility contributes to the
   naturalization of military power. The silence surrounding military
   wives' unpaid labour, however, is not complete, and this article
   explores how such labour is represented in autobiographical accounts
   written by British military wives. These texts are often centred around
   descriptions of domestic labour and, moreover, make overt claims about
   its importance to the institution itself. In my analysis, however, I
   explore how the texts simultaneously make claims about the importance of
   this labour and make it invisible as labour by positioning it, instead,
   as acts of love. Taken together with the idea that outsiders cannot
   fully understand life in a military family, I demonstrate how this
   framing serves to close down space for critique of the military. In
   addition, I argue that paying attention to how militarism functions not
   only through fear and suffering but also through love helps to flesh out
   our analyses of militarism and war as social institutions.},

Abstract = {Terrorist organizations are often described as brands. However, the most
   important visual representations of these brands - terrorist groups'
   logos - have remained unexplored. In this article, we demonstrate that
   logos are signalling devices that provide vital cues on the propensity
   to use violence. To this end, we code and analyse 562 terrorist logos
   (2000-16). After providing a descriptive overview of the main colours
   and symbols used by terrorist groups worldwide, we rely on a
   zero-inflated negative binomial model to analyse the relationship
   between these organizations' visual choices and their deadly activities.
   Our results show that the presence of violent, religious, and extremist
   symbols in terrorist organizations' logos, as well as the use of black
   as the main colour, correlates with more frequent and deadlier attacks.
   These findings have important policy implications, demonstrating that
   logos serve as behavioural cues predicting the threat posed by terrorist
   groups not less effectively than their ideology. By highlighting the
   importance of visual artifacts like logos and their amenability to
   quantitative research, our article also provides a novel methodological
   contribution to international relations, helping bridge the gap between
   explanatory and critical security studies.},

Abstract = {When and how does public opinion affect the delegation choices of
   legislators in the EU? We argue the European Parliament and the Council
   of Ministers limit the discretion of the Commission in response to
   EU-wide scepticism and politicisation of EU policies. Public opposition
   to EU policies, their contestation, and potential scrutiny motivate the
   EU legislators to minimise the discrepancies between the adopted and
   implemented policies. They do so to avoid bearing the costs of
   disregarding public preferences over the level of EU integration. Our
   analysis of legislation adopted between 2009-2019 relying on a novel
   dataset on public policy preferences and agency discretion supports this
   expectation. The results offer evidence of previously unexplored
   responsiveness of the EU institutions emerging in the policy
   implementation that might entail efficiency losses.},

Abstract = {We are hated for having different shades of skin colour, following
   different faiths, being of different ethnicities, or having different
   cultural backgrounds. Due to this, every single one of us is to deal
   with difficulties on a daily basis. Dignity for the inherent worth of
   every human being is indispensable. Concerns about the effects of
   cultural ignorance and intolerance have permeated contemporary
   socio-scientific discourse. It is essential to be cautious and conscious
   of our mindset and tendency to make mistakes in a world that is
   constantly advancing and becoming more integrated, interconnected, and
   interdependent than ever before owing to globalisation. This piece
   examines several persisting global challenges wherein common civilians
   are attacked, persecuted, and ostracised. The study is relevant since it
   examines, explores, and analyses the inappropriate socio-political,
   psychological, and cultural factors leading to almost complete
   misunderstanding and breakdown among people from different ethnic,
   racial, religious, and cultural backgrounds. As such, the article's main
   argument is that every nation has the challenging and significant
   obligation to figure out how its citizens from diverse cultural
   backgrounds may live side by side peacefully without inciting
   large-scale violent conflict or causing the disintegration of the nation
   as a whole. In the interest of restoring humanity, peace, and serenity
   worldwide, the study also proposes some culturally appropriate
   alternatives and/or possibilities to those unjust global phenomena.
   Finally, the findings indicate that some sort of learning strategy,
   enculturation, and interethnic and intercultural interactions and
   rapport has the potential to eradicate or at least mitigate such
   concerns.},

Title = {Microsoft's Challenge to US Militarization of Cyberspace: A Lacanian
   Study of Norm Entrepreneurship},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Microsoft is making strategic attempts to change the US government's
   practices of exploiting technical vulnerabilities in Microsoft software
   for military and intelligence purposes. So far, these efforts have not
   borne fruit. Microsoft's strategy has much in common with one of the
   most common strategies proposed by the International Relations
   literature on norm entrepreneurship in terms of exposing the
   contradictions between the government's ideals and practices. The
   article contributes to this literature by examining Microsoft's strategy
   through Lacanian psychoanalysis and suggests that it fails to work as
   intended, not because the US public or those in government remains
   unaware of the contradictions, but because the strategy is unable to
   address the existing desire to transgress the cyber ideals. Lacan's
   formula for transformation, the Analyst Discourse, provides an
   alternative framework for examining norm entrepreneurial potential in
   light of such transgressions. It proposes that the entrepreneur must
   occupy a position as the (psycho)analyst who hystericizes the norm
   violator. The article revisits Microsoft's attempt to halt the
   militarization of cyberspace and argues that the proposal of becoming a
   ``Cyber Red Cross{''} holds a potential to hystericize but cannot
   succeed as long as Microsoft refuses to repress its status as a
   profitable cyber expert.},

Title = {Determinants of Conflict-Related Sexual Violence: A Meta-Reanalysis
   Distinguishing Two Classes of Zero Observations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Existing databases on conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) feature a
   disproportionate number of ``zero{''} observations, which conflate a
   true absence of CRSV with an unknown presence of CRSV. Empirical studies
   model such zeros as solely indicating a lack of CRSV, thereby obscuring
   what needs to be known about its determinants and patterns. In this
   article, I present a comprehensive meta-reanalysis of quantitative CRSV
   studies that have disregarded the two-fold nature of excessive zeros in
   their data. To redress this neglect, I differentiate the two types of
   zeros probabilistically and then estimate the prevalence of CRSV
   conditional on the statistical partitioning of its two zero types. My
   meta-reanalysis refines previous findings, restoring confidence in
   intuitive theoretical expectations and resolving inconclusive and
   unexpected results in the field. It also dispels potential
   misconceptions by providing alternative evidence and explanations.
   Overall, distinguishing the two classes of zeros in estimation yields
   more informed results, making substantial contributions to scholarly
   understanding of CRSV while avoiding spurious confirmations and
   disconfirmations.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) and its member states are the world's largest
   development donor, but the European financial architecture for
   development suffers from well-documented problems of fragmentation. EU
   member states' decision to convene the Wieser Group in April 2019 raised
   expectations over rationalising the roles of the European Investment
   Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
   (EBRD). However, the Council of the EU showed little enthusiasm for the
   group's call to create a single entity for external development finance.
   Twelve months later, member states endorsed Team Europe, an alternative
   approach which mobilises the resources of the EIB, the EBRD, the
   European Commission and national development finance institutions in
   support of shared development goals. This article seeks to explain why
   the Council ultimately preferred Team Europe's coordinated approach to
   the Wieser Report's centralised vision of a European Climate and
   Sustainable Development Bank. In keeping with new intergovernmentalism,
   we find that member states' willingness to cooperate but reluctance to
   delegate, and the aim of EU institutions to protect their turf, favoured
   Team Europe. We see few reasons to expect radical changes in this domain
   despite continued doubts over the effectiveness and coherence of
   European development finance.},

Abstract = {This article proposes that national identity is regarded as a key
   cultural filter for understanding external perceptions of the EU among
   the public. It examines the relationship between national identity and
   attitudes toward the EU in Israel while considering the distinction
   between national identification and national chauvinism via two survey
   studies. Study 1 (N = 1050) used Israel's hosting of the Eurovision Song
   Contest 2019 to explore the relations between national
   identification/chauvinism and general sympathy for the EU. Study 2 (N =
   657) inspected the extent to which national identification and national
   chauvinism are related to perceptions of the EU as a normative power.
   The findings indicate that national identification and chauvinism relate
   dissimilarly to attitudes toward the EU and that exposure to the
   Eurovision Song Contest also interacted with these relations. These
   findings emphasize the function of national identity as a cultural
   filter.},

Abstract = {Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 launched a high
   intensity war that represents one of the major conflicts of the
   post-cold war period. How can we explain a decision so fraught with
   consequences? What does this aggression say about Russia's relationship
   to its former empire and about its ability to waive a neo-imperial
   model? What does it say about the tools Russia mobilizes to shape its
   international environment? The purpose of this article is to attempt to
   answer these questions by exploring Ukraine's place in its relation to
   the world, and by questioning singularities of the Ukrainian issue. By
   mobilizing history and historiography, such exploration means replacing
   the Ukrainian question in Russia's power project. It confirms the impact
   of perceptions and representations in international relations.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes Chineseness in premodern Vietnam and its influence
   on Vietnam's foreign policy toward China and Southeast Asia both past
   and present. The term Chineseness refers to the practice and
   preservation of Confucian ideas and values in Vietnam, which arguably
   consists of the Mandate of Heaven and Confucian Orthodoxy concepts and
   their subsequent orthodox lineage issue. Being considered culturally
   closer to China than Korea and Japan, Vietnam, throughout history, has
   relied on these concepts to position itself strategically and navigate
   its relations vis-a-vis China and other smaller countries in Southeast
   Asia. Vietnamese courts used to question the legitimacy and orthodox
   lineage of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty because they imagined themselves
   as part of the Sinic world. The sense of superiority over Manchus and of
   being the guardian of Sinic civilization reached a climax during the
   Nguyen dynasty, in part shaping Vietnam's foreign policy toward China
   and other Southeast Asian countries at that time. In addition, this
   deep-seated Chineseness also helps Vietnam's decision-makers to
   understand contemporary China, and subtly guides the creation of
   Vietnam's foreign policy today.},

Abstract = {Nudging is a popular and influential approach in policymaking. Yet, it
   has faced substantial criticism from several policy perspectives, with
   growing concern raised about the efficacy of some nudge interventions.
   This article offers an evaluative framework for nudging which captures
   these various perspectives. Our 4S framework highlights the importance
   of nudges being sufficient, scalable, and subjective, in addition to
   being statistically significant, to be an effective policy response. We
   review various nudge interventions, coupled with various methodological
   critiques, to demonstrate the need for a more expansive evaluative
   framework. The 4S framework synthesizes these sizeable literatures and
   numerous critiques to meet this need, serving as an important
   contribution to behavioral policymakers. We argue that the 4S framework
   complements existing frameworks for designing behavioral interventions
   as an evaluative framework. By adopting the 4S framework, policymakers
   will be better placed to design interventions which are effective in
   relation to the wider policy environment.},

Abstract = {(Non-)implementation of rules is a key issue in the EU literature.
   During the European `migration crisis' in 2015/16, several member states
   openly deviated from the clear rules the legal framework of Schengen and
   Dublin established. Although these controversies have attracted much
   attention, member states' authorities can also deviate from European
   rules in everyday decision making. Little is known about this leeway.
   For example, the Dublin system allows countries to send asylum seekers
   in an `outgoing procedure' when they conclude that another Dublin state
   is responsible for the asylum application. This paper develops the
   argument that efficiency considerations lead national authorities to
   specialise in asylum seekers from countries from which they already have
   many residents. Asylum seekers from these countries are less likely to
   be sent in an outgoing procedure. The Dublin system does not intend this
   type of selection based on nationality. Using unique, high-quality
   register panel data from Switzerland, the statistical analysis of
   multilevel models shows that an outgoing procedure is indeed more likely
   for applicants from countries with a comparatively small number of
   residents. The findings of this analysis have broader implications for
   the Common European Asylum System.},

Abstract = {What explains the emergence of al-Qaeda and the Islamic State as parties
   in civil wars? This study provides the first large-N analysis of this
   question, studying a sample of states in Africa, the Middle East and
   Asia, 2003-2020, contributing to ongoing debates among peace and
   conflict scholars about jihadist rebels in civil war. Theoretically, it
   is argued that higher levels of state repression and states' military
   capabilities should impact the preferences of local groups and increase
   the likelihood of a `transnationalization'. On the other hand, it is
   hypothesized that increases in bureaucratic state capacity should reduce
   the risk of such transnationalization. A series of penalized logistic
   regressions yield support for the hypotheses regarding state repression
   and bureaucratic capacity, but not military state capacity. The findings
   point towards the importance of bureaucratic capacity building as well
   as the potentially adverse consequences of excessively repressive
   counterterrorism strategies.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the self-respect argument for basic liberties,
   which is that self-respect is an important good, best supported by basic
   liberties, and that this yields a reason for the traditional liberty
   principle. I concentrate on versions of it that contend that
   self-respect is best supported by basic liberties for reasons related to
   the recognition that such liberties convey. I first discuss the two
   standard approaches loosely associated with John Rawls and Axel Honneth.
   Here self-respect pertains to traits and conduct (Rawls) or to one's
   personhood (Honneth). It is argued that these approaches fail to show
   why self-respect is better supported by the liberty principle than
   certain alternatives worth taking seriously - unless (in the case of
   personhood self-respect) self-respect is construed in such a narrow way
   that it is not a condition for autonomy or welfare in any plausible
   sense. I then identify a self-attitude that I call ``a sense of
   competence{''}, which at least shows that the liberty principle is more
   important to autonomy than what we might otherwise have reasons to
   believe.},

Abstract = {Policy decision-making modes in governance contexts have become
   increasingly participatory. This raises questions about legitimacy, and
   how to measure this concept. The current article advances a multifaceted
   measurement of perceived legitimacy of policy decision-making modes in
   participatory governance, capturing the three components of legitimacy
   (input, throughput, and output) with two items each. This six-item
   measure was tested in a vignette survey (total N = 4583), which was
   administered among four types of democratic stakeholders: politicians,
   civil servants, civil society, and citizens. Respondents completed the
   scale for four different policy decision-making modes (representative,
   consultative, co-decisive, and decisive). Our six-item scale shows
   excellent internal consistency as an encompassing measure, while at the
   same time also allowing for fine-grained analyses on difference patterns
   in the input, throughput, and output components of legitimacy. As such,
   it provides a relevant and parsimonious tool for future research that
   requires a multifaceted measurement of the perceived legitimacy of
   participatory governance.},

Abstract = {The paper aims to add to the debate on the varieties of neoliberalism
   and the homogenizing effects of megaproject-based urban development. It
   examines the acculturation of the growth imperative as the master
   discourse that supports the development and implementation of two
   projects aimed at transforming the centers of Tampere, Finland, and
   Lodz, Poland. The selected cities shared similar traits as industrial
   centers in the past, but their current socioeconomic situation is
   entirely different. Tampere holds the title of ``Finland's most likeable
   city,{''} while rapidly depopulating Lodz was labeled the ``Polish
   Detroit.{''} Nevertheless, both municipalities became attracted by the
   idea of boosting their development through implementing large-scale
   infrastructural investments to reshape their centers. Inspired by
   discursive institutionalism, which defines discourse as a set of policy
   ideas and values, and interactive policy communication and formulation
   processes, the paper reconstructs and compares the strategic visions of
   Tampere's ``Five Star City Centre{''} and ``The New Centre of Lodz.{''}
   It demonstrates how the proponents of the projects discursively forced
   consent around proposed ideas. Namely, it shows how the issues of
   complexity, risk, and potential conflict of the two megaprojects have
   been addressed. On a conceptual level, the paper shows how policy
   convergence can be discursively facilitated in different socioeconomic,
   cultural, and political circumstances.},

   Right: How Welfare Regimes Shape Electoral Outcomes},

Abstract = {This study examines how the growing competition over immigration and
   welfare between social democratic parties and populist radical right
   parties impacts electoral outcomes. The study argues that the historical
   legacies of the social democratic and conservative welfare regimes
   influence how voters respond to this competitive struggle. The findings
   support this argument. In the social democratic regime, populist radical
   right parties gain more support when they compete over welfare, although
   Nordic social democratic parties can mitigate this trend by appearing
   tough on immigration. However, populist radical right parties' emphasis
   on welfare is the main source of electoral mobilization, particularly
   among voters with anti-immigration sentiments. In the conservative
   regime, the competitive dynamic is less connected to immigration, and
   populist radical right parties' welfare discourse appeals primarily to
   economically vulnerable voters, while social democratic parties lose
   votes by taking a strict stance on immigration. These results have
   important implications and suggest that welfare regimes shape voting
   behaviour differently today than in previous eras.},

   `dynamic', and `subtle' solution. I argue that this view is incomplete.
   In fact, the early climate regime included additional layers of
   differentiation that go beyond the binary distinction between Annex and
   non-Annex parties. Through a discussion of three episodes in which
   states adjusted the system to the `special circumstances' of regime
   members, I show how informalization and individualization - two
   hallmarks of differentiation in the Paris Agreement - had become central
   well before COP-21 and that the international climate regime thus
   developed a lot more gradually than is often assumed.},

Title = {Civil servant tactics for realizing transition tasks understanding the

Abstract = {The transition literature argues that governments have an essential role
   in facilitating societal transitions. The current paper aims to provide
   a theoretical and empirical understanding of this government role by
   analyzing the work of entrepreneurial civil servants. These civil
   servants try to execute transition tasks but are often resisted by their
   colleagues who invoke dominant traditions in Public Administration. This
   raises the question of how they deal with this resistance and manage to
   execute government transition tasks. We introduce a heuristic
   rounds-model to understand the interplay between contestation and
   responses. Due to its subsequent rounds, the model shows ongoing
   tactical work navigating opposition and uncovers the tactics'
   temporariness and their capacity to backfire. We illustrate the value of
   the heuristic model by analyzing the clash between opposing
   rationalities and the change agents' continuous tactical adjustment in
   our case study on ``Mobility as a Service{''} in the Netherlands.},

Abstract = {In this forum, we focus on the possibility and necessity for active
   refusal in research, and the complexities of refusal. We offer four
   different perspectives, based on our shared concerns and understanding
   of the harms caused by some field research, and driven by our engagement
   with and membership in some of the communities experiencing this harmful
   fieldwork in peace, (post)conflict and security settings.Drawing on
   feminist, queer, indigenous, anti-racist and decolonial literatures and
   interventions, we seek to further a practice of refusal as an essential
   component of researcher reflexivity Our various positionalities and
   privileges, and the research entitlement they can bring, necessitate
   grappling with refusal: we must do better at saying `no'. We must also
   be careful about the ethics of refusal itself: Who gets to say `no' to
   whom? What comes after the refusal? We hope our interventions encourage
   more of these conversations and (more importantly) practices.Refusals
   can be an important `full stop' that interrupt exploitative
   relationships, and that challenge neoliberal and neocolonial conditions
   of knowledge production. But they can also be generative of different
   ways of sharing knowledge, leading to new partners and locations, new
   conversations that cross the boundaries between the imperialist
   categories of the researcher and the researched, and new relationships
   outside of research and outside of work.},

Title = {Automating activation in Australia: a critical policy discourse analysis
   of the new employment services model},

Abstract = {This article critically analyses the policy discourse that accompanied
   the introduction of the `New Employment Services Model' (NESM) into the
   Australian social security system. Critical policy discourse analysis of
   documents presenting reforms to employment services provision shows that
   the NESM embeds a logic of activation that construes job seekers both as
   passive units requiring external motivation (through `employment
   support' and `mutual obligation'), and as active agents responsible for
   their own situation. This contradictory logic results in inconsistencies
   between the espoused aims of the reforms and the experience of those
   subject to the policy mechanisms. Analysis of departmental outcomes data
   illustrates the inconsistent operational consequences of the conflation
   of `targeted compliance' and `support.' Due to the technological
   automation of activation processes, the real discursive innovation of
   the NESM is one of `digital depoliticization,' whereby the moralizing
   assumptions that inform punitive activation are embedded and therefore
   concealed in the policy technology. The operational effect is to
   subordinate the achievement of employment to compliance with mutual
   obligation requirements as a structured aim of employment services
   provision.},

Abstract = {The concept of empowerment, particularly in relation to women as agents
   of social and political change, has its origins in grassroots
   development praxis and theorising under the rubric of post-development,
   but its meaning is highly contested in contemporary international
   governance. In this paper, we analyse the shifting terrain of
   empowerment in development, peace, and security governance through the
   case of the Women, Peace and Security agenda. We present a thematic
   analysis of the articulation of empowerment, built from a detailed
   genealogy of the concept and deployed across a dataset of 149 NAPs
   produced by 90 UN member states. Our analysis shows that the ways in
   which empowerment is put into discourse in NAPs is worth analysing in
   detail, and does not foreclose the possible expansion of practice of
   women's empowerment, despite the restrictive imperatives of neoliberal
   governance. This suggests, ultimately, that grassroots praxis may
   continue as an effective site of resistance, despite the co-optation of
   the concept of empowerment by peacebuilding and development
   institutions.},

Abstract = {The vote of no-confidence is the primary mechanism through which the
   principle of government accountability to the legislature - the defining
   feature of parliamentary democracy - is achieved. Yet, no research has
   been devoted to its influence on the relations between the government
   and the mechanism's main users - the opposition. This article attempts
   to fill this lacuna by theorising how restrictiveness in the vote of
   no-confidence influences the opposition's strategies vis-a-vis the
   government in legislative voting. We delineate the influence of the vote
   of no-confidence on the opposition via its preference to pursue more
   cooperative strategies, as opposed to conflictual ones, distinguishing
   between the two stages of the vote of no-confidence - initiating and
   voting. We empirically explore the relation between the vote of
   no-confidence and the voting behaviour of 59 opposition parties in 16
   countries, showing that greater restrictions on both stages of the vote
   of no-confidence correlate with less conflictual opposition behaviour.},

Title = {Achieving cross-sectoral policy integration in multilevel

Abstract = {The big policy challenges of our times are complex problems cutting
   across policy sectors and levels of government. To answer the question
   how cross-sectoral policy coordination in multilevel structures can be
   achieved, we argue in line with policy integration and multilevel
   governance scholarship that ``loosely coupled{''} institutions create
   the interdependency necessary to secure complex coordination. This
   argument is substantiated empirically by investigating coordination of
   energy transition in the German Bundesrat. Expectations are derived on
   how loosely coupled institutions promote coordination. They are tested
   using a mix of empirical data. It can be shown that loosely coupled
   institutions indeed enable coordination by linking powers across
   multiple dimensions, creating incentives for cross-sectoral
   communication, using personal ties in negotiations to bridge different
   institutional backgrounds, and sequencing the decision process to allow
   strategic shifts between coordination dimensions. Those mechanisms may
   not guarantee the best possible result, but they provide a satisfactory
   solution at least.},

Abstract = {While extensive research has shown that policy outputs are punctuated,
   there is a paucity of research about the punctuation of public opinion
   and political participation. We know policymakers rely on political
   participation to understand public opinion, so we need to understand the
   patterns and flows of this participation, to help understanding
   democratic responsiveness, and how policy outputs behave. I advance
   punctuated equilibrium theory by applying it to individuals' decision to
   participate, and the policy issue they choose to engage with. I argue
   that bounded rationality and disproportionate information processing,
   driven by media and interest group coverage of trigger events, will
   result in a punctuated equilibrium pattern in both the decision to
   participate and the issues focused on. Using new datasets on the volume
   and topic of letters to the Australian Prime Minister and American
   President, I find consistent evidence of punctuations, using weekly,
   fortnightly, and annual data, across Australia and America,
   notwithstanding institutional, cultural, and behavioural differences.
   These results extend punctuated equilibrium further up the policy
   process chain than has previously been done, supporting its claim as a
   ``full theory of government information processing.{''} Doing this helps
   us to understand the difficulty in translating environmental and public
   demands into policy.},

Abstract = {The lethality and the frequency of terrorist attacks conducted by
   militant organizations vary considerably. Some militants perpetrate
   extreme and systemic levels of terrorist violence, some only do so
   occasionally, and others never conduct terror operations. To predict
   group-level differences in this outcome, we draw on conceptual
   frameworks in the political science and psychology fields to argue that
   prior military experience shapes leaders' willingness to engage in
   terrorist violence. But not all experiences are created equal. We argue
   that formal experiences such as those associated with military training
   serve as a restricting influence on terrorist violence, while less
   formal and less structured experiences such as time in active combat are
   associated with increases in future terrorist violence. Using new data
   on the individual backgrounds of militant leaders active between 1989
   and 2013, we find support for our hypotheses. This study contributes to
   the academic literature by bringing the leader back into explanations of
   wartime terrorist activity. Our findings also carry notable policy
   implications for policy makers, warfighters, and counterterrorism
   practitioners.},

Abstract = {Regulatory agencies care about their reputation, which helps sustain
   their authority. As innovation can introduce uncertainty in governance,
   delaying action or overlooking danger can negatively affect agencies'
   standing. Aware of these reputation risks, agencies rely on a set of
   methods to govern the unknown. These methods, we argue, are: (1)
   categorization, if the innovation is considered identical to known
   regulatory categories; (2) analogy, if the innovation is considered
   similar to known categories, and; (3) new categorization, when new
   classifications are deemed necessary to address the innovation. Each
   method shapes governance by triggering the application of existing
   regulations (categorization and analogy), calls for either technical and
   regulatory fixes (analogy), or calls for broader regulatory undertakings
   (new categorization). Agencies' choice of methods, we argue, is shaped
   by concerns over performative reputation (i.e., showing the ability to
   fulfill core tasks), which in turn is affected by agencies' ability to
   demonstrate technical rigor (i.e., technical reputation).},

Abstract = {Critical Military Studies (CMS) has emerged as an important
   subdiscipline in international security studies and an interdisciplinary
   field in its own right. In this article, we offer a close reading of
   foundational CMS literature to reveal its distinct approach to the
   critical study of military power. We argue this foundational literature
   is characterised by a commitment to a series of `in-between' and
   `engaged' positions on conceptual binaries between civilian and military
   spheres, questions of methodological proximity to or distance from
   military actors, and ethical political support for or opposition to
   militarism. While CMS makes important contributions to analyses of
   military power and security, we argue it too often re-centres white
   western male military subjects and agendas while marginalising
   antimilitarism. In this way, we argue, it reproduces a form of epistemic
   and `methodological whiteness' that limits its potential to offer a
   sustained critique.},

Abstract = {Scholarship on evidence-based policy, a subset of the policy analysis
   literature, largely assumes information is produced and consumed by
   humans. However, due to the expansion of artificial intelligence in the
   public sector, debates no longer capture the full range concerns. Here,
   we derive a typology of arguments on evidence-based policy that performs
   two functions: taken separately, the categories serve as directions in
   which debates may proceed, in light of advances in technology; taken
   together, the categories act as a set of frames through which the use of
   evidence in policy making might be understood. Using a case of welfare
   fraud detection in the Netherlands, we show how the acknowledgement of
   divergent frames can enable a holistic analysis of evidence use in
   policy making that considers the ethical issues inherent in automated
   data processing. We argue that such an analysis will enhance the
   real-world relevance of the evidence-based policy paradigm.},

Abstract = {Indices of gender equality provide an inconsistent picture of current
   gender inequality in countries with relatively high equality. We
   examined women's and men's subjectively perceived gender inequality and
   their support for gender equality in the general population and in
   politicians, respectively, in three countries with relatively high
   gender equality: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany
   (total N = 1,612). In both women's and men's perceptions, women were
   treated more unequally than men. However, the inequality that women
   perceived was larger than the inequality men perceived. Additionally,
   women reported they personally experience less inequality than women as
   a group (person-group discrepancy). Finally, women's and men's
   left/liberal (vs. right/conservative) political ideology turned out to
   be a relatively more powerful predictor of support for gender equality
   than perceived personal and societal inequality. We discuss reasons for
   why political ideology emerged as the strongest predictor of equality
   support and sketch out implications for policy efforts toward promoting
   gender equality.},

Title = {What Do Overrepresented and Underrepresented Groups Tell Us About Risks
   for Involvement in Islamist Extremism?},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 21},
Abstract = {On the basis of empirical research on an underrepresented
   group-Turkish-Dutch youngsters-and an overrepresented group-converts-in
   Islamist extremist movements, we want to contribute to the debate on
   what fosters radicalization and resilience. While in both the
   underrepresented and the overrepresented group there are ample factors
   recognizable that are commonly identified as contributing to
   radicalization, Turkish-Dutch youngsters hardly become involved in
   Islamist extremism, while converts are involved to a larger extent than
   one might expect on the basis of the number of converts. To shed light
   on these findings, we will demonstrate how this differential involvement
   can be understood through the concept of ``relational
   embeddedness{''}.(1) We will demonstrate how the relational embeddedness
   of this underrepresented and overrepresented group contributes in
   various ways to either the lack of susceptibility or the susceptibility
   to involvement in Islamist extremist groups. We will do this with
   reference to their sources of identification, their religious
   socialization, and the availability of legitimate political pathways. In
   the concluding discussion, we will argue that these insights can
   contribute to a more nuanced policy approach.},

Abstract = {David Hume alluded to the politics of slaveholding throughout his career
   and was among the first to observe that the republican tradition has an
   awkward relationship with slavery. This article places Hume's critique
   of Roman slavery in conversation with recent debates over
   ``neo-Roman{''} liberty, paying special attention to Hume's complaint
   that some republican advocates for political liberty have also
   apologized for personal slavery. Most of Hume's direct comments on
   slaveholding appear in the 1752 essay, ``Of the Populousness of Ancient
   Nations,{''} where Hume criticized Roman slavery for its negative
   effects on population growth. But more was at stake than ancient
   demography. Even abolitionists who abhorred Hume's racism still drew
   upon his argument against ancient slavery-which they read as a
   commentary on the modern colonies.},

Abstract = {In the era of surveillance capitalism (Zuboff, 2019), the deployment of
   a digital and biometric ID, named Aadhaar ('foundation' in Hindi), in
   India from 2009 onwards, strongly disputed but spreading in many
   Southern countries, deserves special attention. The present text relies
   on grey literature and a multi-sited ethnography of the project. It
   addresses a gap in the literature: The reasons why some players (and
   which ones) in the corporate world needed a digital and biometric ID in
   the 2000s. The study identified three key motivations: being able to
   link databases to extract behavioural surplus, especially in the South
   which lacked `cookies' as universal personal identifiers; find new
   markets for biometric technologies, and possibly new populations to
   register for northern governments; and also find a way to recover from
   the 2008 economic crisis. This text is the first of a series that
   reviews the Aadhaar project.},

Abstract = {Are public sector workers more supportive of technocracy than people not
   employed in the public sector? Public sector workers play an important
   role in the functioning and safeguarding of democracy. However, because
   of their training as neutral and competent policy workers and
   implementers, it is often claimed that they hold relatively strong
   technocratic attitudes. In this study, we compare the support for
   technocracy of 35,395 public sector and non-public sector workers across
   25 European countries. The results show that on average, public sector
   workers are not more supportive of technocracy than non-public sector
   workers, and that the effect of public sector employment on support for
   technocracy differs across countries. Furthermore, we find that trust in
   representative institutions and satisfaction with government can reduce
   support for technocracy.},

Abstract = {Most research in policy transfer studies focused on cases of policies
   originating from the `Global North'. However, recently countries of the
   `Global South' became sources of models. With the exception of a few
   studies, literature has not considered these developments. This paper
   aims at contributing to this direction, by proposing an agenda drawn
   from policy transfer studies as well as from the observation of Brazil's
   and China's engagement in policy transfer. This exercise helps highlight
   a series of aspects overlooked by the literature. Understanding their
   motivations, their timing and other important aspects related to these
   processes can shed new light on policy transfer phenomena. New research
   questions are introduced and illustrated by examples from Brazil and
   China.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the tensions that exist between the two major
   missions that have structured the activity of the International Labour
   Organization (ILO) since the 1920s : the objective of social justice on
   the one hand and economic development on the other. It examines the
   difficulties of the organization in enforcing the social standards it
   promotes when the objective of growth and economic development imposed
   by other international actors come into tension with them. It studies
   the extent to which the various development programs implemented by the
   organization since the 1930s have attempted to address this
   contradiction. These issues are discussed through case studies in the
   changing contexts of a century of ILO history.},

Abstract = {A neglected topic in empirical research on national identity is its
   stability at the individual level, and this is especially true for its
   content, that is, the meaning elements that people associate with the
   concept of nation. In this article, we study the stability of key
   dimensions of national-identity content. We ask three simple questions:
   How stable is national-identity content-as captured in the ethnic/civic
   framework-at the level of individual citizens? Are there clear
   differences in stability across subgroups? What are the implications of
   interindividual differences in stability? Analyzing data from four waves
   of a large-scale panel survey of German citizens (N = 4,654) collected
   over a five-year period (2016-21), we show that there is high but not
   perfect stability of the degree to which individuals subscribe to ethnic
   and civic criteria of nationhood. Second, we find little difference in
   stability as a function of several theoretically selected
   characteristics. Third, we show that the association between
   national-identity content and relevant political attitudes (immigration
   attitudes and far-right party support) increases with intraindividual
   stability. These findings have important implications for our
   understanding of how national-identity content is shaped and mobilized
   and how it can influence political attitudes and behaviors.},

Abstract = {After the dissolution of the Soviet bloc, joining the European Union was
   a top priority for most East European countries. To join the EU, the
   Copenhagen Membership Criteria required that candidate countries develop
   stable democratic institutions, establish the rule of law, defend human
   rights, and ensure the protection of minorities in addition to creating
   free markets. While the EU was extraordinarily successful in promoting
   economic criteria for membership in minute and fundamental ways, its
   record of using the incentive of membership as a way of promoting and
   protecting minority rights was much more mixed, especially for the
   diverse Roma population.},

Abstract = {While the digitalisation of political parties is increasingly analysed,
   less attention has been paid to the evolution of digital procedures and
   their consequences on intra-party democracy and party change. We propose
   a typology for identifying different types of evolution processes
   (consolidation, reconfiguration, mutation, and elimination) using the
   Spanish party Podemos paradigmatic case. Our analysis points out the
   centrality of hard and soft setbacks in the evolution of the digital
   procedures of the party. Findings indicate the relevance of different
   dynamics, such as institutionalisation, personalisation, and
   factionalism, jointly with other internal and external factors. Studying
   the evolution of digital party procedures is relevant for tracing party
   change in digital parties and other parties that are experiencing
   digitalisation processes.},

Title = {Programmatic action in Chinese health policy-The making and design of
   ``Healthy China 2030{''}},
Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {534-552},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Programmatic Action Framework (PAF) is a powerful analytical
   perspective to advance our understanding of policy change by stressing
   the role of programmatic groups and how they promote their preferred
   policy programs. While the PAF has been applied successfully to European
   countries and the US, a considerable research gap remains regarding its
   explanatory power in other regions and political settings. To step into
   this research gap, we apply the PAF to authoritarian China through a
   qualitative case study of the making of ``Healthy China 2030{''}, a
   national health policy program. We explore two research questions:
   firstly, to what extent can the PAF be operationalized in a nondemocracy
   to identify programmatic groups and evaluate policy design, and second,
   what are the limitations and challenges facing the application of the
   PAF to nondemocracies? Our empirical analysis shows that the design of
   this policy program involves actors from different policy areas, despite
   the top-down political structure. With regards to the transfer of PAF
   hypotheses, we show that the framework is a helpful lens to identify
   programmatic groups and to evaluate policy programs' potential for
   success based on coherence, responsiveness, and program fit. Meanwhile,
   the research process of our study revealed the challenges of applying
   policy process theories to China, including hard-to-reach political
   actors for data collection, lack of transparency regarding collaboration
   processes between actors, and a lack of publicly available
   program-related information.},

   From India},

Abstract = {Minimal understandings of populism focus on measuring explicit stances
   of antielitism and people centrism. What remains poorly understood is
   the way less overt forms of populist rhetoric enable leaders to emulate
   the language of common citizens to achieve electoral success. This
   article suggests that the study of the populist discourse also requires
   taking into account their implicit occurrences, that is, those conveying
   connect, closeness, commonness, and similarity with ordinary people.
   Expressed through performances of ``layman likeness,{''} they enable
   populist politicians to dissociate from traditional ruling elites while
   enabling people leaders' identifications. Using a novel 261-million-word
   dataset of Indian political discourses-including the speeches of 11
   Prime Ministers-to proxy such identifications, we argue that populist
   leaders rely on a mimesis of the common people. Three core mimetic
   speech items are quantified: intimacy, disintermediation, and
   simplicity. We use a replicable corpus-contextual multiword collocation
   technique to populate lexicons of pretested psychometric profiles as
   well as a threefold validation method. The analysis finds that current
   Prime Minister Narendra Modi communicates mimetic identification around
   his persona, indexing the linguistic markers of his stylistic,
   ideological, and institutional populist politics. We indicate that our
   context-aware method could also be of use to study the cross-regional
   variability of mimetic populism.},

Title = {Deepening apartheid: The political geography of colonizing
   Israel/Palestine},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JAN 11},
Abstract = {The paper analyzes the regime in Israel/Palestine using a political
   geographical perspective. It demonstrates how a combination of colonial,
   national, capitalist and liberal forces have put in train a process of
   ``deepening apartheid{''} in the entire territory controlled by
   Israel-between River and Sea. This undeclared regime has been
   established to guard the `achievements' of settler colonial Judaization
   of the land and the domination of the Jewish minority. As described by
   the Rome Statute, it has become an institutionalized regime of
   systematic oppression and domination by one group over others, with the
   intention of maintaining that regime. Hence the political geographical
   analysis shows clearly that the wide description in academic and
   international circles of Israel as ``Jewish and democratic,{''} is based
   on a denial of the clear racialized hierarchy of civil statuses. This
   setting enhances Jewish supremacy (using different methods) it in all
   regions, while Palestinians are fragmented into lower rungs on the
   ethnic hierarchy-de facto and de jure-thereby contradicting the tenets
   of democratic civil equality. Theoretically, the paper draws on the
   links between settler colonial expansion, the rise of ethnocracy,
   partial liberalization under global capitalism, and the making of
   apartheid. It shows that historically Jewish colonization of
   Palestine-the underlying logic of the regime-has advanced in six main
   historical-geographical stages, encountering persistent, and at times
   violent, Palestinian resistance. The paper then analyzes in more detail
   the emergence of one regime between River and Sea, in which the state
   uses military, spatial, economic, and legal powers, as well as
   geopolitical maneuvering (particularly US support) to oppress
   Palestinians, while promoting democratic rights and economic development
   among Jews. This has enabled Israel to integrate and ``whiten{''}
   Mizrahi and other Jewish groups into mainstream Zionism. Rivaling
   Palestinian political projects have been fragmented, ghettoized,
   attacked violently, and severely weakened. The paper shows how Jewish
   colonization, on both sides of the Green Line (which has also included
   some tactical withdrawals), has led to the establishment of four
   hierarchical types of citizenship, governed as ``separate and
   unequal{''}. The relations between the groups resemble the racialized
   categories used in Apartheid South Africa and include (a)
   ``White{''}-Jewish Israelis-with full citizenship rights; (b)
   ``Colored{''}-Palestinian Arabs with Israeli citizenship with partial
   rights; (c) ``Black{''}-Palestinians under occupation lacking
   citizenship or political rights; (d) ``Gray{''}-an emerging group,
   consisting of non-citizen migrants and asylum seekers.},

Abstract = {Large masses adhered to coup-affiliated generals in Spain and
   revolutionary leaders in Iran as a result of a combination of ideology
   and religion that skillfully used religious rituals and imagery to
   cement and unify an entire social bloc and articulate its grievances
   against the ruling government. The celebrations of Semana Santa and
   Ashura became not just a vehicle to unify different competing factions
   in Civil War Spain and Revolutionary Iran; they were also reinterpreted
   through the lenses of nationalism and socialism and weaponized against
   their enemies. The appropriation and reinterpretation of Christ's
   Passion and Hussein's martyrdom at Karbala helped indoctrinate the
   population with the idea of a new National Catholicism and Islamic
   Socialism, and thus achieve the Gramscian objective of constructing a
   new moral order and a new type of society.},

Abstract = {Banking Union was a major policy response to the financial crisis that
   began in 2007 and the subsequent Eurozone crisis. Moral hazard has
   frequently been presented as a major cause of these crises. Therefore,
   Banking Union can be understood as a response to moral hazard in
   relation to banks and sovereigns. Yet, moral hazard was an acknowledged
   and supposedly managed problem prior to these events. Paradoxically,
   moral hazard has been used to justify contradictory policy options to
   safeguard European financial system stability, such as decentralized
   institutional arrangements for banking supervision but also a
   centralized system coordinated by the European Central Bank (ECB). To
   address this paradox, this paper investigates moral hazard as a
   political concept. Based on a comparison of how central bankers from the
   Bundesbank and the ECB understand and use the moral hazard concept, this
   paper argues that moral hazard is closer to the realm of politics than
   expertise.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a major economic crisis worldwide. The
   monetary policy response of the European Central Bank (ECB) was fast and
   massive. The ECB also intervened on the supervisory side because, after
   the establishment of Banking Union, the ECB was given responsibility for
   banking supervision in the euro area through the Single Supervisory
   Mechanism (SSM). This paper explains the response of the ECB-SSM to the
   COVID-19 related economic crisis during 2020 and 2021, up until February
   2022. These ECB actions include the reduction of bank capital buffers,
   the redefinition of non-performing loans, and the limitations on
   dividends and bonuses paid by banks. We adopt a neofunctionalist
   approach, which suggests that policies are developed at the EU level in
   response to need, whereby supranational actors and spillovers are
   particularly important. We offer some concluding insights into whether
   the ECB-SSM's responses have led to a further deepening of integration.},

Abstract = {This article draws attention to developments in agricultural and
   fisheries policy in Norway and the EU after the implementation of the
   EEA Agreement in 1994. It is argued that the policy in both areas has
   become more similar, and this is explained by the fact that both Norway
   and the EU must follow the same international agreements, that both
   share many of the same ideas regarding what constitutes proper policies,
   and that Norway is increasingly importing laws and regulations from the
   EU. In conclusion, it is argued that continued EEA association will be
   far less challenging for the agricultural and fishing industries than a
   new free trade agreement or EU membership.},

Abstract = {Civil society organizations (CSOs) are shaping the formation of a
   bottom-up regionality in the context of the 2030 Agenda implementation.
   Using the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region as a case, this
   article unravels the pivotal role they play in the diffusion and
   incorporation of the Sustainable Development Goals. Drawing from
   qualitative content analysis of official documents, critical discourse
   analysis of primary and secondary sources, and semi-structured
   interviews, we understand CSOs as institutional entrepreneurs with

Abstract = {Henry Hunt, Henry George The English Corn Laws, 1815-1846, were
   initiated to protect landowners' commercial rents; the 1770 food crisis
   in France to raise the surplus on the King's land; the 1770 famine in
   Bengal to raise the profits of the East India Company. These examples
   indicate how poverty and starvation in the period 1750-1850 could be
   caused by commercial power abuse, harming the public but benefiting
   landowners and commercial interests. The essay emphasizes how
   progressive economists at the time recommended free trade to tame the
   commercial abuse. The left agitated for markets rather than monopoly.
   The right agitated for privileges rather than competition.},

   working in and incarcerated in correctional centres. Re-sponding to
   COVID-19 in correctional centres is a major challenge, particularly due
   to overcrowding and limited medical resources. This paper uses secondary
   data to investigate the spread of COVID-19 in South African
   cor-rectional centres. It focuses on the problems faced by the South
   African Department of Correctional Services in preventing the spread of
   COVID-19 in its correctional facilities. The author proposes measures to
   be followed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in such facilities. The
   findings reveal that despite efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19
   in South African correctional centres, the virus spread rapidly among
   inmates and prison workers.},

Abstract = {I argue that exchange rates are an underappreciated explanation for the
   significant variation in the extent of female labor force participation
   in developing countries. Occupational segregation in developing
   countries is such that women working outside of the home tend to be
   segregated in labor-intensive export-oriented industries. Consequently,
   when an overvalued exchange rate increases export prices, it reduces
   commensurately the demand for female labor. This causes some women to
   drop out of the labor force. Data from over 150 low- and middle-income
   countries between 1990 and 2015 support this argument.},

Abstract = {Space military power refers to a state actor entering space freely,
   seeking the goals of benefiting national space interests, maintaining
   space security and the capabilities of fulfilling space infrastructure,
   and implementing space military policies. As the earliest ``space
   power{''} in the world, Germany has been committed to continuous
   capacity building and policy planning in the space military field. This
   article seeks to provide a detailed overview of Germany's unique
   historical background and evolutionary logic on space military power and
   strategic origin. Based on literature review and studies pertaining to
   space military strategy theories, this article reveals basic facts of
   Germany's space military development under the ``ideality
   -materialization{''} mutual constructed context, and illuminates the
   implications of theoretical changes in Germany's space military strategy
   guidance from peaceful utilization and passive defense to effective
   control.},

Abstract = {The article examines the leadership shift toward the EU sanctions policy
   against Russia in context of ongoing reconsideration of status quo that
   was caused by full-scale Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The author draws
   attention to the transformation of the EU political leadership and their
   vision on the matter of foreign policy-making as a response to Russian
   aggression. Particular focus is put on the comparative analysis of
   competition outcomes between transactional and transformational
   viewpoints on sanction policy against Russia in years 2014-2021 and
   since February 2022.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {Existing work on the democratic accountability of foreign policy
   suggests that when an incumbent incurs foreign policy losses, including
   but not limited to standing down in a crisis, making costly compromises,
   or accepting defeat abroad, opposition politicians at home weigh
   criticizing the government with the national interest. But this work has
   largely been developed with a view to explaining oppositional behavior
   in consolidated democracies. I argue that while electorally competitive
   oppositions in weakly institutionalized regimes can and frequently do
   criticize elected incumbents for costly foreign policy reversals, they
   are less likely to do so if they believe this criticism may negatively
   affect democratic stability and potentially invite irregular leadership
   turnover, as this would prevent the opposition from coming into office.
   I find support for this hypothesis, which I term oppositional
   pragmatism, in a survey experiment on 430 political party workers
   affiliated with Pakistan's biggest political party and directionally
   consistent effects on a smaller but highly elite sample of 202 Pakistani
   legislators.},

Abstract = {The EU's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has renewed discussions on
   whether the gap between responsibility and responsiveness is, to some
   extent, constructed. This discussion only partly applies to courts,
   which are important in interpreting EU crisis responses. While judges do
   not rule in a political vacuum, it is not their main task to please
   public opinion. Even if they were to be influenced by changes in public
   mood, judges have little incentives to claim responsiveness in their
   judgments. By contrast, higher courts may be considered the epitome of
   responsibility since they are themselves bound by the law and entrusted
   to decide on conflicting responsibility claims of other actors. Hence,
   we ask how different courts interpret responsibility - their own and
   that of others - during the Eurozone and the COVID-19 crises. We conduct
   a comparative analysis of responsibility claims in the jurisprudence of
   the EU Court of Justice (CoJ) and the German Federal Constitutional
   Court (FCC) at two crucial crisis moments. We find little evidence of
   judges claiming responsiveness, but important differences in the
   constructions of responsibility between the two courts and across
   crises. The gap between how the courts construct their shared
   responsibilities in EU economic governance has seemingly narrowed.},

Abstract = {When the European Monetary Union became effective in January 1999, the
   accounting treatment for claims and obligations which the Eurosystem's
   National Central Banks (NCBs) incur against each other in the
   `Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Express Transfer' (TARGET)
   system remained unspecified. Only later in 1999, the Governing Council
   of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided that these claims and
   obligations should be shifted to the ECB's balance sheet as a central
   counterparty-a process called `novation'. This ex-post decision
   completed monetary unification by uniquely `stitching together' NCBs'
   balance sheets while profoundly transforming the role of the ECB's
   balance sheet. First, novation centralised it at the Eurosystem's apex,
   which had not been politically feasible ex ante. Secondly, novation
   repurposed it into a multilateral mechanism to provide automatic,
   unlimited funding for cross-border payment imbalances. Thirdly, novation
   allowed monetary technocrats to operationalise it as an autonomous
   `firefighting' balance sheet for unconventional monetary policy.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The intricate connection between violent and nonviolent extremism has
   been a source of debate among radicalization scholars. Some suggest that
   despite their non-military tactics, Islamists share ideological
   commonalities with jihadists. Others emphasize the unbridgeable rifts
   between non-violent and violent Islamists. Rather than simply viewing
   Islamism and Salafism either as a gateway to or a bulwark against
   terrorism, we analyze the contingent and variegated movements between
   violent and non-violent extremism in the context of religio-political
   polarization in Indonesia. Behavioral and ideological change, we argue,
   is best seen as a continuum with possible gradations along the spectrum,
   across which movement is determined by external shocks, reflection, and
   the role of social networks. Three case studies are discussed which
   represent three types of crossover: the ideological and tactical shift
   from Salafism to jihadism; the tactical radicalization of a splinter
   faction of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI); and the hybrid (partial
   ideological and tactical) deradicalization of Jemaah Islamiyah.},

Abstract = {Determining what makes a person happy is an extremely complicated task.
   The objective of this article is to identify the effects of the
   composition and orientation of governance bodies in municipalities on
   individual subjective well-being. We connect the data from a large
   Spanish welfare survey to municipal data covering the aforementioned
   dimensions of political configuration. Unlike previous country-level
   studies, we find no significant effects of political orientation when
   applied to municipal data. In contrast, political alternation emerges as
   a relevant driver of subjective well-being, especially when corrupt
   local governments are replaced. Furthermore, the fragmentation in the
   Spanish political landscape after the 2015 elections improved the level
   of political competition, which, in turn, exerted a positive effect on
   subjective well-being.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this explorative and mixed methods research is to
   discover and describe the possible archetypes of high school and
   vocational school students from empirical data produced by young people
   and media, and to discuss what kinds of power relations these archetypes
   can create in Finnish society. Indeed, the empirical data produced by
   young people and those found in newspapers reveal archetypes and various
   power relations. In particular, the data indicate how the vectors of
   such archetypes guide thinking about young people and their life
   courses. In particular, the archetypes illustrate how vocational school
   students have to defend themselves and their choices in their daily
   lives, while high school students do not. Furthermore, the empirical
   data illustrate how the lives of vocational school students are mainly
   described as happening here and toward the future of the voiceless
   proletariat, while high school students are considered active and
   successful changemakers. Vocational school students also question
   official Finland and the place where they have been situated. Among
   others, this can create an opportunity for information operations.},

Abstract = {Freedom of information (FOI) laws are known to expose governmental
   weaknesses, but do they improve the structural workings of public
   administration, professionalizing governance? This study examines FOI's
   effect on a cornerstone of effective governance-bureaucratic hiring.
   Using coarsened matching methods to compare over 5400 municipalities in
   Brazil-approximately half possessing FOI regulations and half without-we
   identify significant reductions in discretionary patronage-based
   appointments. Municipalities with FOI regulations reduce both higher
   level ``political control{''} and lower-level ``electoral rewards{''}
   hires. Our explanation, tentatively supported by a comparison of early
   versus late FOI adopters, centers on sequencing: in the short term,
   leaders view FOI as a supplement to administrative control and thus
   reduce higher-level hires. As FOI becomes more institutionalized and
   exposures more probable, leaders reduce lower-level hires. Contributing
   to scholarship on transparency and bureaucracies, our results enjoin
   policymakers to double-down on commitments to FOI policies.},

Title = {Outsourcing authority in global policy: legitimating the anti-money
   laundering regime through professionalization},
Journal = {POLICY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {70-82},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {How is authority legitimated when global policy leads to the delegation
   of implementation and monitoring tasks to private actors? This paper
   shows that putting private actors at the forefront of compliance gives
   them significant interpretation autonomy, with knock-on effects for how
   rule-making authority is legitimated. I show that actors can mobilize to
   claim expertise based on their practice in, and input to, transnational
   administration and that professional associations are important arenas
   for establishing and legitimating these claims. The paper explores these
   dynamics through an empirical focus on the global anti-money laundering
   regime. Revolving around the Financial Action Task Force, the regime to
   tackle illicit finance has been a highly political process with a global
   reach. Yet it relies heavily on financial institutions to put systems in
   place that control the flow of money. This puts private compliance
   officers at the forefront of transnational administration. The paper
   shows that compliance officers have responded to the demands of this
   role by professionally organizing. Focusing on the largest professional
   association, the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering
   Specialists or ACAMS, a US-based association with a global program and
   membership, the paper explains that professionalization mechanisms have
   helped demarcate practice boundaries and support the expertise claims of
   private sector employees. By becoming the experts, these officers can
   claim pragmatic authority over what global policy rules and standards
   mean and how they can be implemented.},

Abstract = {Popular peasant feminism was pioneered by Latin American rural women
   organized by the Coordinadora Latinoamericana de Organizaciones del
   Campo (Latin American Coordinator of Rural Organizations) member
   organization of the international peasant movement La Via Campesina (the
   Peasant Way-LVC). These organizations have moved forward on gender
   issues to incorporate a socialist-feminist agenda despite the challenge
   this agenda faces with regard to their organizational practices and
   political projects. Latin American peasant, indigenous, and black women
   have produced oppositional and situated feminist practices and
   epistemologies that enable them to resignify feminism and address their
   food sovereignty paradigm from a decolonized feminist perspective,
   interconnecting the struggle for sovereignty with regard to land and
   territory as well as the body.El feminismo campesino popular fue
   iniciado por las mujeres rurales latinoamericanas, organizadas bajo la
   Coordinadora Latinoamericana de Organizaciones del Campo, organizacion
   miembro de el movimiento campesino internacional La Via Campesina (LVC).
   Estas organizaciones han avanzado en temas de genero buscando incorporar
   una agenda socialista-feminista a pesar del desafio que enfrenta dicha
   agenda en relacion con sus practicas organizativas y proyectos
   politicos. Las mujeres campesinas, indigenas y afrodescendientes
   latinoamericanas han llevado a cabo practicas y epistemologias
   feministas opositoras y situadas que les permiten resignificar el
   feminismo y abordar el propio paradigma de soberania alimentaria desde
   una perspectiva feminista descolonizada, interconectando la lucha por la
   soberania con la tierra y el territorio, a la vez que con el cuerpo.},

Abstract = {Numerous scientific reports have evidenced the transformation of the
   earth system due to human activities. These changes - captured under the
   term `Anthropocene' - require a new perspective on global law and
   policy. The concept of `earth system law' situates law in an earth
   system context and offers a new perspective to interrogate the role of
   law in governing planetary challenges such as climate change. The
   discourse on earth system law has not yet fully recognised courts as
   actors that could shape climate governance, while climate litigation
   discourse has insufficiently considered aspects of earth system law. We
   posit that courts play an increasingly influential climate governance
   role and that they need to be recognised as Anthropocene institutions
   within the earth system law paradigm. Drawing on a set of prominent
   climate cases, we discuss five inter-related domains that are relevant
   for earth system law and where the potential influence of courts can be
   discerned: establishing accountability, redefining power relations,
   remedying vulnerabilities and injustices, increasing the reach and
   impact of international climate law and applying climate science to
   adjudicate legal disputes. We suggest that their innovative work in
   these domains could provide a basis for positioning courts as planetary
   climate governance actors.},

Abstract = {Existing studies suggest that right-wing populist parties (RWPPs) appeal
   to people in communities that have fallen behind in material terms.
   However, it remains open which benchmark communities apply as they
   become politically discontented. We argue that the structure of
   territorial inequalities influences the benchmarks used by people in
   regions falling behind. Panel data regressions using subnational
   election results in EU states from 1990 to 2018 reveal a sharp contrast
   between the economic geographies of right-wing populism in core and
   peripheral EU member states. We find a strong association between
   falling behind the richest region of the country and RWPP support within
   core EU countries, while in peripheral EU states falling behind the EU
   core is associated with regional support for RWPPs. This suggests that
   RWPP voters in peripheral countries cue on how they are faring relative
   to the EU core, while RWPP supporters in core countries cue on how they
   are faring relative to dynamic regions of their own country. Our
   analysis also shows that increased manufacturing employment reinforces
   the effect of falling behind the richest region in core EU member
   states, while we find no strong evidence that regional economic
   stagnation is important to the electoral performance of RWPPs.},

Abstract = {This article suggests that humanity may be approaching a critical
   juncture, since a confluence of macro-historical changes
   might-individually or collectively-fundamentally transform the field of
   human rights, and usher in a second human rights era. In particular, it
   suggests that the confluence of tectonic geopolitical changes,
   system-wide shifts in climate and energy, and fundamentally new
   developments in science and technology might lead to a rupture of the
   same scale as the cluster of events that heralded the onset of the
   current rights regime. This argument builds on a number of literatures,
   especially those focused on norms cycles, rights generations, and what
   is being called the ``ontological turn.{''} Yet the implications extend
   beyond these conversations in terms of both conceptual scale (the
   emphasis here is on critical junctures between eras, rather than cycles
   or generations within eras) as well as temporal scale (the emphasis is
   on the medium-to-long-range future, rather than the near future). An
   effort to ground this speculation takes the form of testable hypotheses
   and practical recommendations.},

Abstract = {Brazil is often cited for its high levels of inequality. Despite some
   success in reducing this inequality during the Partido dos Trabalhadores
   (Workers' Party-PT) period, the rise of Jair Bolsonaro as Brazil's
   president threatens to reverse this trend as he actively seeks to
   promote policies that will lead to greater financialization of the
   Brazilian economy. In recent years, several studies have shown that the
   financialization of the economy as a whole can lead to a rise in
   inequality, but the financialization of the health and education sectors
   has not been of particular interest to researchers and government
   officials. An empirical analysis of the pattern of income inequality in
   twenty-first-century Brazil paying particular attention to the potential
   impact of the financialization of health and education sectors on this
   process shows a correlation between greater financialization (especially
   in the health sector) and an increase in income inequality.O Brasil e
   frequentemente destacado pelos seus niveis elevados de desigualdade.
   Apesar de algum progresso na reducao da desigualdade durante o periodo
   de governacao do PT, a tomada de posse como presidente de Jair Bolsonaro
   ameaca reverter esta trajetoria, nomeadamente via o apoio a uma maior
   financeirizacao da economia. Nos ultimos anos, varios estudos mostraram
   que a financeirizacao da economia como um todo pode conduzir ao aumento
   da desigualdade. Porem, a financeirizacao dos setores da saude e da
   educacao nao tem sido alvo de interesse particular. Uma analise empirica
   do comportamento da desigualdade no Brasil no sec. XXI salientando o
   potencial impacto da financeirizacao da saude e da educacao, sugere que
   uma maior financeirizacao, em particular do setor da saude, esta
   associada a um aumento da desigualdade na reparticao do rendimento no
   Brasil.},

Abstract = {Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack and the subsequent war in Gaza has forced
   the Palestinian question back to the top of the Middle Eastern agenda
   after years of neglect. The crisis has also confirmed Hamas's identity
   as an agent of resistance rather than governance and shattered Israel's
   perceptions of its own power, the competence of its security services
   and political leadership, and the manageability of its immediate
   neighbourhood. Israeli forces may well destroy Hamas's advanced military
   capabilities and decapitate its Gaza-based command, but they are
   unlikely to obliterate Hamas as a social, political and ideological
   actor, and a determined insurgency. In Arab forums, the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict will probably inhibit normalisation with
   Israel and overshadow other conflicts. Iran does not have an immediate
   interest in expanding the war and has other options through partners for
   signalling support for Hamas. The war broadly benefits Tehran by
   affirming its forward-defence strategy, re-energising its axis of
   resistance and shaking its regional rivals.},

Abstract = {Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, and again after the invasion
   of 2022, much analysis of the conflict has been rooted in extant
   theories of international relations and state behaviour. Numerous
   explanations of the causes of Russia's invasion, predictions about the
   conflict, and prescriptions for state action have been offered by
   scholars with expertise in international relations theory but little
   familiarity with the region, its politics, or its history. In this
   article, we critique this trend, focusing primarily on the work of
   international relations scholars of the realist school and specifically
   the writing of John Mearsheimer. We propose the concept of ``epistemic
   superimposition{''} to describe the methodological error of overlaying
   abstract theories onto unique historical and political contexts, which
   can lead to poor engagement with empirical evidence or to ignoring
   empirical evidence altogether. To bear out this idea, we show both how
   realist theory fails the empirical test in Ukraine and situate this
   failure within the broader scholarly context of expertise in
   international relations theory. We conclude with a call for more careful
   application of theory by theorists but also for privileging area studies
   and deeper qualitative research of local political contexts in analyzing
   contemporary global events.},

Abstract = {The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was the result of
   almost two years of work from several participants and organizations
   before its adoption in the United Nations on December 10, 1948. The
   Declaration is one of the world's most famous and translated documents
   even though its principles and moral insights are far from realized
   around the world today. Although it was a collaborative work with many
   authors involved, some writers played significant roles in a special
   way. This article aims to present and analyze the contributions of two
   of the main drafters, namely the philosopher and diplomat Charles Malik
   (1906-1987) from Lebanon and the philosopher and diplomat P.C. Chang
   (1892-1957) from the Republic of China. Malik and Chang were the only
   philosophers in the drafting team, and they were all-rounded
   intellectuals and educators. In contrast to Chang and Malik, several of
   the other writers of the UDHR were lawyers or politicians. Chang and
   Malik came from different philo-sophical traditions. Chang had the
   pragmatist philosopher John Dewey as his tutor at Columbia in the
   beginning of the 1920s. Malik studied for the philosophers Alfred North
   Whitehead at Harvard and Martin Heidegger in Freiburg during the 1930s.
   The philosophical differences between Chang and Malik created fruitful
   dialogues between the two drafters. This article explores how the
   educational backgrounds and the previous professions of Chang and Malik
   influenced the character of the UDHR.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2025},

Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article explores the role of traditional, state-run media as tools
   for both, promoting policy, and providing feedback about
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs)-related policies in Egypt. It also
   gives insights into how media might contribute to shaping policy on NGOs
   in countries with similar systems of media governance. The study tests
   the social construction and policy design theory's ``target population
   proposition{''} by conducting a thematic analysis of news articles on
   NGO Law 70 of 2017. It adds a new media studies perspective to Schneider
   and Ingram's theory by exploring the framing effects of the media as
   mediators between governmental policy and target groups of that same
   policy. The findings confirm Schneider and Ingram's theory in
   post-uprising Egypt. It delineates that state-run media variously frame
   policy rationales of Law 70 of 2017. Dichotomous framing was found to
   support the significant burdens imposed on, and the sub-rosa benefits
   granted to, NGOs by the new policy. Media frames also varied according
   to NGOs' social construction and power level. This distinction in policy
   rationales draws the line between developmental NGOs and advocacy
   organizations whose agenda is perceived as a source of threat to the
   sovereignty, political independence, and national interests of the
   state.},

Abstract = {International election observation has been scrutinized over the past
   two decades by scholars trying to explain its aim, scope, and
   consequences. As it is now a standard practice in democratizing
   countries, scholarly literature has almost reached a consensus on the
   ability of observers to deter election-day fraud, one of the most
   positive unintended consequences of election observation. Using data
   from the 2004 Ukraine presidential election, this article extends our
   knowledge through a natural experiment on polling station-level election
   results. I will show that observation during counting does not have a
   stronger effect than observation during opening and/or polling. Results
   support previous studies showing the usefulness of election observation
   in reducing election-day fraud but add an important finding that
   deserves further scholarly attention.},

Abstract = {When are executives in authoritarian regimes more likely to comply with
   formal legislative powers? Building from theories of authoritarian
   power-sharing, we argue that executives will be more likely to respect
   legislative prerogatives when protests or elite organization increase
   the ability of legislators to undermine the executive's political
   position. We evaluate this argument by analyzing novel protest and
   legislative data in Jordan between 2010 and 2015. In line with our
   expectations, we find that parliamentary queries were more likely to
   receive the required response from the cabinet during months of higher
   protest activity and when they were submitted by MPs from Jordan's only
   well-organized opposition bloc in the parliament. This study extends the
   burgeoning scholarship on authoritarian legislatures by contributing to
   understanding of executive-legislative interactions under autocracy and
   providing new insights into the conditions under which these
   legislatures are more likely to influence decision-making processes.},

Abstract = {Unconditional basic income (UBI) is a redistributive policy proposal
   that is receiving increasing attention in the Spanish political sphere.
   Welfare attitudes literature has shown that support for UBI is higher
   among left-wing citizens and those of lower socioeconomic status.
   However, previous studies have not addressed the mediating role of
   ideological values such as egalitarianism or meritocratism in supporting
   UBI. Furthermore, studies have not considered the interactive
   relationship between ideological and self-interest motives when studying
   attitudes toward UBI. Drawing on modernization theory, we propose that
   individuals' socioeconomic status conditions the role of ideological
   motivations in shaping support for UBI. To test this hypothesis, we
   study data from two different surveys conducted in Spain in 2017 (N =
   1958) and 2021 (N = 2004). Our findings suggest that ideology is a less
   relevant motivation for supporting UBI among the Spanish citizens of
   lower socioeconomic status, but it becomes increasingly salient among
   higher-status citizens. Among the latter, egalitarian values lead
   leftists to support UBI, whereas anti-egalitarian and meritocratic
   values lead rightists to anti-UBI positions. We discuss these findings
   within the framework of modernization theory, addressing support for UBI
   by different social groups and the ability of this policy proposal to
   elicit broad-based support.},

Abstract = {For the past years, the national rhetoric in Sweden has changed. Due to
   the Russian actions in Ukraine and Crimea, efforts towards mobilizing
   military and civil preparedness increased. The concept of the `total
   defence' was reintroduced and has led to shifting priorities in Swedish
   politics, serving as a happy object and remedy in times of security
   threat and social anxiety. The article critically examines what this
   mobilization requires from the civil society actors. Drawing on a wide
   scope of material, including interviews, observations, news articles,
   and policy documents, our analysis shows that gender-based power and
   norms are integral to rebuilding the Swedish total defence. Moreover,
   different forms of benign masculinist protection mask processes of
   asymmetric influence and power distribution and renders any position of
   critique suspicious.},

Title = {South Africa's unjust climate reparations: a critique of the Just Energy
   Transition Partnership},

Abstract = {This briefing critically discusses the moral question of whether South
   Africa deserves climate reparations.1 It examines the deeply unequal and
   polluting nature of the South African economy in order to demonstrate
   how claims from South Africa for climate finance and reparations are
   morally complex and fraught. For South Africa's claims for climate
   reparations and finance to be justified, the article proposes two
   conditions. First, that South Africa act in line with its fair share of
   global climate action. Second, that climate finance must help to
   transform South Africa's deeply unjust society and bring benefits not to
   the rich elite, who themselves owe climate reparations, but to the
   majority, especially the poor, Black and working class.Applying these
   two principles, the briefing asks whether the Just Energy Transition
   (JET) Partnership and the accompanying Investment Plan announced by
   President Cyril Ramaphosa meet those conditions. It argues that they
   potentially fail to meet both. The piece also warns that global South
   countries must be critical of JET Partnership funding models, as they
   may be used as tools to entrench the interests of international
   financiers who seek to dominate the clean energy future. To counteract
   such a possibility, climate justice movements should work to ensure that
   climate finance is a true fulfilment of climate debt owed to the global
   South, which works to ensure meaningful social, economic and ecological
   justice.The author writes this piece not just from an academic
   perspective as a postdoctoral research fellow. He also writes it from
   his perspective as the elected General Secretary of the South African
   Climate Justice Coalition - a coalition of over 50 trade union,
   grassroots, community-based and non-profit organisations working
   together to advance a transformative climate justice agenda.2 In his
   role as general secretary, he has engaged with coalition member
   organisations and worked to build a shared and critical activist agenda
   towards both the JET Partnership and the South African government's
   response to the climate crisis more generally.},

Title = {Climate change, counter-terrorism and capitalist development in Somalia},
Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Abstract = {Somalia is often referred to as a `failed state'. In addition to
   ineffective governance, feeble economic development, and a large
   anti-government insurgency, it faces increasingly severe climate
   change-induced devastation. This article offers a critical discussion of
   the role of capitalist interests and ideology as a factor in the climate
   crisis. It explores interlocking issues of (1) the relationship between
   the ruling political class of Somalia and capitalist mining interests;
   (2) the largely covert US-backed `war on terror' in Somalia; and (3) the
   ongoing, capitalism-induced climate crisis. The article analyses current
   US and Somali proposals to address these issues. Many of these proposals
   remain trapped in the politico-ideological deadlock of capitalist
   developmentalism, oriented towards fossil fuel extraction and
   militarised accumulation. The trajectory of this current path in Somalia
   is leading to immiseration, oppression, displacement for millions of
   people, and the destruction of an already deteriorating environment.
   Alternative paths to avert these catastrophes require transnational
   solidarity, cooperation and assistance.
   La Somalie est souvent consideree comme un \& DLANGBRAC; etat failli \&
   drangbrac;. Outre une gouvernance inefficace, un developpement
   economique faible et une insurrection anti gouvernementale de grande
   envergure, le pays est confronte a une devastation de plus en plus grave
   induite par le changement climatique. Cet article propose une analyse
   critique du role des interets et de l'ideologie capitalistes en tant que
   facteurs de la crise climatique. Il explore les questions
   interdependantes (1) de la relation entre la classe politique dirigeante
   de Somalie et les interets miniers capitalistes ; (2) de la \&
   DLANGBRAC; guerre contre le terrorisme \& drangbrac; en Somalie,
   largement dissimulee et soutenue par les etats-Unis ; et (3) de la crise
   climatique actuelle induite par le capitalisme. Cet article analyse les
   propositions actuelles des etats-Unis et de la Somalie pour traiter ces
   questions connexes. Nombre de ces propositions restent coincees dans
   l'impasse politico-ideologique du developpementalisme capitaliste,
   oriente vers l'extraction des combustibles fossiles et l'accumulation
   militarisee. Cette trajectoire actuelle en Somalie conduit a la
   pauperisation, a l'oppression, et au deplacement de millions de
   personnes ainsi qu'a la destruction d'un environnement deja en voie de
   deterioration. Les voies alternatives pour eviter ces catastrophes
   requierent une solidarite, une cooperation et une assistance
   transnationales.
   A Somalia e frequentemente referida como um caso de `estado falhado'.
   Para alem de uma governacao ineficaz, de um fraco desenvolvimento
   economico e de uma grande insurreicao antigovernamental, o pais enfrenta
   uma devastacao cada vez mais grave induzida pelas alteracoes climaticas.
   Este artigo oferece uma discussao critica sobre o papel dos interesses e
   ideologia capitalistas como fator na crise climatica. Explora questoes
   interligadas de (1) a relacao entre a classe politica dominante da
   Somalia e os interesses capitalistas da mineracao; (2) a `guerra ao
   terror' apoiada pelos EUA na Somalia, em grande parte encoberta; e (3) a
   crise climatica em curso, induzida pelo capitalismo. Este artigo analisa
   as atuais propostas dos EUA e da Somalia para abordar estas questoes
   relacionadas. Muitas dessas propostas permanecem presas no impasse
   politico-ideologico do desenvolvimentismo capitalista, orientado para a
   extracao de combustiveis fosseis e a acumulacao militarizada. A
   trajetoria deste caminho atual na Somalia esta a desembocar no
   empobrecimento, na opressao, no deslocamento de milhoes de pessoas e na
   destruicao de um ambiente ja em deterioracao. Caminhos alternativos para
   evitar estas catastrofes exigem solidariedade, cooperacao e assistencia

Pages = {23-39},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {What determines the performance of international organisations (IOs)? We
   argue that funding structures remain an overlooked driver of IO
   performance. Over the past decades, donor governments have provided an
   increasing share of their contributions to IOs in the form of earmarked
   resources, which provide them with the opportunity to restrict the use
   of funding to specific themes, sectors, regions, countries or projects.
   This development has raised concerns about the ability of IOs to perform
   their duties, given that earmarked funds distort programme priorities
   away from recipient need and increase transaction costs for IO staff.
   Beyond qualitative evidence from case studies, concerns about the
   performance-related effects of earmarking remain untested in large-N
   analysis. Drawing on 64 performance assessments of 32 IOs from 2009 to
   2021, undertaken by the Multilateral Organisation Performance Assessment
   Network, we employ latent factor analysis to extract measures of process
   performance-the extent to which IOs have rules, procedures and routines
   in place to plan strategically, manage operations efficiently, liaise
   with partners effectively, monitor results and promote institutional
   learning-and outcome performance-the extent to which IOs achieve results
   that are relevant, efficient and sustainable. Using multivariate
   regressions, we find that earmarked funding is negatively related to
   process performance. Our result is robust to alternative model
   specifications and an instrumental variable design that helps mitigate
   concerns about endogeneity. These results have important implications
   for our understanding of IO performance and policy implications for
   donors of IOs.},

Abstract = {Recent applications of Punctuated Equilibrium Theory have linked
   institutional design to budgetary changes, yet much more work is needed
   to unravel the mechanism through which bureaucracy moderates the odds of
   budget punctuations. Three important systems of China's bureaucracy
   receive close attention: cadre promotion, exchange, concurrent system
   and their impact on budgetary dynamics. This research investigated the
   impact of cadre management systems in China's bureaucracy on budgetary
   changes by leveraging a unique dataset of 31 provinces budget
   punctuations and provincial personnel deployments during 1996-2016 and
   employing multidimensional panel fixed effect regression. Empirical
   evidence shows that secretaries of provincial Party Committee with
   stronger promotion incentives and career experience in relevant
   institution reduce budget punctuations. In addition, provinces with
   concurrent secretaries of Party Committee experience less punctuated
   budgetary changes. Findings of the study are conducive to improving the
   understanding of the impact of China's bureaucracy on policy changes and
   governance performance, and expanding the application of punctuated
   equilibrium budget theory in the Chinese context.},

Abstract = {The policy-responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have fuelled expectations
   about potential paradigmatic change in European Economic Governance
   (EEG). Building on existing scholarship on policy paradigms, we develop
   testable expectations about the steps preceding paradigmatic change,
   which we explore on the basis of three types of data. First, we show how
   public spending in three key Eurozone countries between 2008 and 2021
   follows predicted patterns of the punctuated equilibrium model. Second,
   we show that governments' justifications for their annual budgets
   reflect a gradual change in policy-ideas between 2009 and 2020,
   following the expected three orders of change. Third, we show how this
   gradual change is also present in the European Country-Specific
   Recommendations and in the bureaucratic logics within the European
   Commission. Our findings reconcile three strands of scholarship on
   policy change and have implications for our understanding of the
   European integration process and for future research on economic
   policy-making within EEG.},

Title = {Looking for relief: Developing an testing the emotion-regulation
   explanation of selective exposure to political information},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {279-297},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Though selective exposure is immensely important for the functioning of
   democracy, no consensus exists as to its cause. The most frequently
   assumed causal explanation is cognitive dissonance avoidance, but direct
   empirical tests of this explanation are incredibly rare and have
   generally not been supportive. Furthermore, although cognitive
   dissonance avoidance concerns regulation of emotional states, this
   explanation has not yet been integrated with the newest research on
   emotion-regulation processes and their role in shaping political
   attitudes and behavior. I perform such a theoretical integration and
   derive testable implications of the emotion-regulation account of the
   role of cognitive dissonance in shaping selective exposure. I test these
   together with expectations derived from an alternative explanation
   (informational utility), in two, original, preregistered survey
   experiments with 4864 U.S. adults combined. I consistently find support
   for the emotion-regulation account in experimental tests and in two out
   of three observational analyses. The alternative explanation of
   informational utility finds support in observational analyses, but not
   in the experimental tests. The study provides the first experimental
   evidence linking emotion regulation and selective exposure and suggests
   that people do, indeed, select like-minded sources to downregulate
   negative emotion.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic brought forward new questions about the efficient
   implementation of arduous public policies. Drawing evidence from the
   pandemic, this article argues that, during crises, policymakers will
   often opt for evidence-informed policymaking, hoping for better results.
   In line with previous studies, we show that citizens trust more policies
   coming from experts rather than policymakers and elected politicians. We
   also add nuance to these claims as we attribute this tendency to the
   technocratic legitimacy thesis, referring to the symbolic significance
   of expert authority. Employing a public opinion survey conducted across
   four European countries, Germany, Greece, Sweden, and the United
   Kingdom, we show that independently of prior levels of political trust
   and each country's mortality rate, citizens welcomed evidence-informed
   policies during the pandemic's first wave. Politicians can leverage
   these insights to increase public compliance with crisis management
   policies.},

Title = {Move First to Avoid the Worst: Leadership Turnover and the Targeting of
   New Leaders},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {Are leaders more likely to face militarized challenges earlier in their
   tenure? Existing studies posit contradictory hypotheses: new leaders can
   both invite challengers to take advantage of their inexperience and
   deter challengers by their strong incentive to establish a reputation
   for resolve. This paper seeks to reconcile these competing propositions
   by developing an argument that centers on the direction of foreign
   policy preference change associated with leadership turnover. I argue
   that foreign adversaries are likely to challenge a new leader in their
   rival state only when the newcomer is perceived to be more hawkish than
   the predecessor. The perception of a heightened risk of conflict
   accompanied with the emergence of a more hawkish leader in the rival
   state gives foreign adversaries a stronger incentive to seek for an
   early confrontation in which they can (re)demonstrate their own position
   to the new hawk. In contrast, when the newcomer is perceived to be more
   dovish than the predecessor, optimistic expectations of future
   interactions tend to restrain foreign adversaries from provoking the new
   dove, whose reputation concerns are high. A series of statistical
   analyses on post-WWII dyadic rivalries with democratically elected
   leaders on the target side yield strong evidence that supports this
   conditional hypothesis.
   Existe una mayor probabilidad de que los lideres tengan que enfrentarse
   a desafios militarizados al principio de su mandato? Los estudios
   existentes plantean hipotesis contradictorias: Por un lado, los nuevos
   lideres pueden incitar a los retadores a aprovechar su inexperiencia y,
   por otro lado, los nuevos lideres pueden disuadir a los retadores debido
   a que estos lideres tendrian un fuerte incentivo para crearse una
   reputacion de ser resolutivos. Este articulo busca reconciliar estas dos
   proposiciones contradictorias mediante el desarrollo de un argumento que
   se centra en la direccion del cambio que se produce en las preferencias
   en materia de politica exterior y que esta asociado con la rotacion del
   liderazgo. Argumentamos que es probable que los adversarios extranjeros
   desafien a un nuevo lider en su Estado rival solo cuando el recien
   llegado sea percibido como mas agresivo que el predecesor. La percepcion
   de un mayor riesgo de conflicto, junto la aparicion de un lider mas
   agresivo en el Estado rival, ofrecen a los adversarios extranjeros un
   incentivo mas fuerte para buscar una confrontacion temprana en la que
   puedan (re)demostrar su propia posicion al nuevo lider. En contraste,
   cuando existe la percepcion de que el lider recien llegado es mas
   moderado que su predecesor, el hecho de que existan expectativas
   optimistas con respecto a interacciones futuras tiende a impedir que los
   adversarios extranjeros provoquen a este nuevo lider moderado, cuya
   preocupacion por su reputacion es alta. Mostramos una serie de analisis
   estadisticos sobre las rivalidades diadicas posteriores a la Segunda
   Guerra Mundial con lideres elegidos democraticamente en el area
   objetivo. Estos analisis generan una fuerte evidencia que apoya esta
   hipotesis condicional.
   Les dirigeants ont-ils plus de risques d'etre confrontes a des
   difficultes militaires au debut de leur mandat ? Les etudes existantes
   formulent des hypotheses contradictoires : les nouveaux dirigeants
   peuvent a la fois inviter les concurrents a profiter de leur manque
   d'experience ou les en dissuader grace a leur forte motivation d'etablir
   une reputation de determination. Cet article tente de reconcilier ces
   propositions contradictoires en developpant un argumentaire centre sur
   la direction du changement de preferences en matiere de politique
   etrangere qui accompagne un remplacement de dirigeant. J'affirme que les
   adversaires etrangers n'auront des chances de mettre au defi un nouveau
   dirigeant d'un etat rival que s'il apparait comme plus belliqueux que
   son predecesseur. La perception d'une augmentation du risque de conflit
   qui accompagne la survenue d'un dirigeant plus belliqueux dans un etat
   rival fournit davantage de motifs aux adversaires de chercher la
   confrontation tot afin de demontrer (a nouveau) leur propre position a
   ce nouvel acteur. Par opposition, quand un nouveau dirigeant apparait
   comme plus pacifiste que son predecesseur, les adversaires etrangers
   auront des attentes optimistes concernant de futures interactions. Ils
   seront donc moins enclins a provoquer ce nouvel acteur soucieux de sa
   reputation. Une serie d'analyses statistiques sur les rivalites
   dyadiques d'apres-Seconde Guerre mondiale avec des dirigeants elus
   democratiquement du cote cible genere des resultats qui viennent
   fortement etayer cette hypothese conditionnelle.},

Abstract = {Participatory governance arrangements are assumed to strengthen elected
   representatives' capacity for political leadership. This study argues
   that the relationship between participatory arrangements and perceived
   political leadership depends on the design of the participatory
   arrangements. Drawing on a survey to local councilors in Norway, we
   found that sharing power with citizens through interactive governance
   arrangements was associated with lower perceived capacity for political
   leadership than giving power away through distributive arrangements.
   Case studies exploring how politicians experienced interactive and
   distributive participatory arrangements showed that politicians were
   especially ambivalent about interactive arrangements that were perceived
   to disrupt their traditional ways of doing political leadership.
   Notably, interactive arrangements were believed to decrease leadership
   capacity because politicians remained responsible for matters over which
   they no longer had full control, challenging their ability to stay
   accountable to the voters.},

Abstract = {Fee-for-service remains a popular mode of paying for healthcare despite
   widespread knowledge of its ill effects. This has resulted in a gap
   between policy knowledge (understood as consensus among experts) and
   policy practice (actual policy measures to implement the consensus) in
   healthcare. The existing literature attributes such gaps to a range of
   factors, including the stakeholders' different interests, incentives,
   ideas, and values. Our focus on this debate is through the lens of
   policy capacity, specifically the ability of public actors to utilize
   policy knowledge and inform policy practice. We show that the observed
   knowledge-practice gap is rooted in the complexity of healthcare payment
   reforms. While actors agree on the problematic condition, there is a
   deep disagreement on what to do about it. Agreeing on and adopting
   alternate payment arrangements are challenging because reformers need to
   anticipate and respond to the future while accommodating the interests
   of the current providers who benefit from the status quo. In such
   instances, the capacity of public actors to devise reforms and overcome
   resistance to them is critical. We argue that the knowledge-practice gap
   in healthcare payments exists because of deficiencies in the analytical
   abilities of governments to devise workable alternate arrangements and
   shortcomings in their political capacity to overcome the resistance to
   proposed reforms. Put differently, we argue that no amount of evidence
   or consensus among stakeholders is sufficient when the analytical and
   political capacities to act on the evidence are lacking. The arguments
   are illustrated with reference to payment reforms in South Korea and
   Thailand.},

Abstract = {This study examines potential variations in everyday Chinese citizens'
   support for two prevailing economic governance forms in contemporary
   China: the regulatory and statist approaches. Leveraging the Chinese
   Citizens Expectations of the State Survey, it argues that the current
   support for either forms of economic governance fall within a distinct
   societal cleavage between regime insiders and outsiders. The study
   suggests that there is widespread support for a regulatory governance
   approach across the general public, irrespective of the insider and
   outsider dualism. However, support for a statist governance approach is
   much stronger amongst regime insiders, who exhibit a skepticism of
   domestic privately owned firms. Furthermore, support for the statist
   governance approach is stronger amongst older age segments of the
   population and weaker with the more highly educated. These findings
   provide insights into potential social divisions over the role of the
   state in governing the economy. More broadly, the findings speak to the
   efficacy of popular legitimacy strategies for the Communist Party of
   China.},

Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {230-243},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {The recent literature has inquired how media, official discourses,
   popular culture, or even sports and toys, can shape political imaginary
   into thinking that military intervention is the only relevant course of
   action. In this endeavour, the role of wargaming in justifying further
   militarisation remains largely understudied. By building upon the RAND
   Baltic 2014-2015 wargame and the subsequent NATO decision to deploy
   troops in the Baltics and Poland, I propose that certain wargames can
   legitimise the use of force in three ways: by reflecting the security
   community's concerns in the storyline of the game, by designing the game
   in such a manner that preparation for war becomes the only well-founded
   means of tackling the issues posed by the game, and by enhancing its
   circulation in the defence field, notably by presenting the wargame as
   having the same level of credibility as science. Drawing upon assemblage
   theory, I propose that wargaming encompasses more than the individual
   experiences of its players. It encompasses the extensive sociotechnical
   assemblage of practices, technologies, networks of actors, and resulting
   emergent properties that together can amplify the conditions of
   possibility favourable to military deployment.},

Abstract = {The escalating rivalry between the United States and China in the
   semiconductor industry has critical implications for global technology
   policy and governance. This paper proposes an innovative approach to
   modeling the strategic interactions between these superpowers using
   concepts from reinforcement learning and game theory. Specifically, we
   apply Coordinating Q-Learning, an algorithm adept at handling complex
   multi-agent systems, to simulate signaling games between the U.S. and
   China. This technique avoids problematic rationality assumptions that
   often hinder empirical verification of signaling models. Through
   iterative learning based on environmental rewards, the model provides
   insights into how semiconductor strategy may evolve. We present
   simulated outcomes that reveal potential scenarios and strategic
   decisions shaping the U.S.-China relations in this sphere. The model
   highlights the risks of undermining existing multilateral governance
   regimes and fracturing global technology ecosystems.},

Abstract = {This article suggests that we need to rethink the legitimacy of EU
   referenda by considering them as democratic games with different groups
   of players, levels and rounds. Unlike most research on EU referenda
   informed by direct democracy or demoicracy, the article employs the
   approach of agonistic democracy. It argues that we need to shift
   analytical focus from the member-state to the EU citizen and develop
   EU-level criteria for a comprehensive assessment of EU referenda's
   legitimacy. The criteria are whether all EU citizens - and not just the
   citizens from the country conducting the referendum - had opportunities
   to participate in the political dialogue surrounding the EU referendum,
   and whether citizens across the EU have been able to develop EU-level
   democratic subjectivities through such participation. Applying these
   criteria in the cases of the Greek and British EU referenda, the article
   finds legitimacy shortcomings for both, yet with variations.},

Abstract = {In re-reading Watson's The Evolution of International Society through
   the work of Giovanni Arrighi, this article makes two contributions to
   the English School (ES). Firstly, I offer a more grounded analysis of
   Watson's `succession of hegemonies' from the seventeenth century
   onwards. Secondly, and relatedly, through closer attention to the
   dynamics of capitalist international society, we are better able to
   apprehend the current contradictions and challenges facing contemporary
   international society. Rather than replace Watson with Arrighi, I argue
   that Arrighi's framework of `systemic cycles of accumulation'
   complements and extends the insights offered in Watson's magnum opus. It
   is hoped that this dialogue between the ES and critical political
   economy may open the way for further ES research on the (dis)orderly
   dynamics of capitalist international society.},

Abstract = {People usually update their beliefs selectively in response to good news
   and disregard bad news. Here, we investigated in two preregistered
   experiments (N = 278 and N = 306) (1) whether such valence-dependent
   belief updating also underlies information processing in the context of
   climate change and (2) whether it can be altered by interventions
   informing about different aspects of climate change. To this end, we
   adapted a well-established belief update task to the context of climate
   change. In multiple trials, participants were asked about their beliefs
   about adverse consequences of climate change; subsequently, they were
   asked to update their beliefs in light of new information. Both studies
   provided evidence against the hypothesis that people integrate good news
   about climate change more than bad news. After half of the trials,
   participants were randomized to one of four video-based interventions,
   each of which aimed at promoting a more accurate risk perception and
   increasing pro-environmental intentions. After the interventions,
   participants showed a more accurate risk perception, and women rather
   than men increased their intentions for pro-environmental behavior. The
   results provide implications for climate change communication, as they
   show that when facing the consequences of climate change, people adjust
   their risk perception accurately and increase their pro-environmental
   intentions.},

Abstract = {The article presents a case study aiming at reconstructing the social
   impact of the digitalization policy promoted by the National
   Archaeological Museum of Naples. The main impacts detected include an
   higher cultural participation's rate, thanks to an integrated strategy
   that enhanced the museum's reputation; an improved social inclusion,
   thanks to the social networks' strength of weak ties; finally, the
   digital policy stimulated reflection and created a sense of belonging
   thanks to a videogame arousing emotions. The results call for the
   development of an evaluation agenda for museums and other institutions
   willing to enhance the social impact of digitalization policies, and
   suggest the need to strengthen the empirical research for
   impact-oriented policy design in this field.},

Abstract = {Wildfires and subsequent community evacuations offer a highly visible
   example of climate change-induced dislocation. In so-called Canada, both
   the changing climate and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples are
   policy priorities for the federal government and certain provincial
   governments, like the Province of British Columbia. Despite these
   purported policy priorities, we find evidence that colonial logics-like
   the rejection of Indigenous governments' capacity and knowledge to shape
   this policy area-underpin emergency management, resulting in the
   perpetuation of inequities and less effective responses. By analyzing
   data from Indigenous Services Canada, we find that First Nations are
   disproportionately affected by largely climate-related disasters,
   evacuating at a higher frequency-328 times higher, on average. We then
   employ a decolonial lens to analyze the policy landscape and actions
   taken to date and examine whether emergency management is moving away
   from unilateral policymaking in favor of more horizontal, multilevel
   governance arrangements. We find that both the federal and British
   Columbia governments perpetuate barriers that prevent First Nations from
   acting as effective first responders in emergency situations.},

Abstract = {States usually support terrorist groups to weaken their rivals, silence
   their opponents and give themselves options they otherwise lack. By
   providing weapons, training, a sanctuary and other support, states can
   make terrorist groups more deadly, increasing their skill and
   survivability. At the same time, states often impose constraints on
   their proxies, creating many difficulties for the terrorists. Iran and
   other enemies of the United States and its allies have long supported
   terrorists, and state sponsorship is likely to play a role in any
   continued confrontation with Russia, which may double down on existing
   ties to extremists given its humiliation in Ukraine and desire for
   revenge on its enemies. Confronting state sponsors of terrorism is
   difficult, however. For democracies, applying a `state sponsor' label
   can be a powerful rhetorical, legal and policy tool. At the same time,
   it can often be misused, become an empty political gesture or even
   backfire. The `state sponsor' label is highly politicised, and
   long-standing sponsors like Pakistan have avoided it. Clarifying what
   state sponsorship is, increasing the flexibility of the designation,
   giving policymakers more leeway on when to impose sanctions, and
   otherwise knowing how to better combat a state sponsor is vital.},

Title = {Juxtaposing violent extremism and critical radicalism in Europe: the
   role of reflexive awareness in pursuit of religious purity and cultural
   essence},
Journal = {POLITICS RELIGION \& IDEOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {352-376},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Employing an approach that focuses on three goals of ideology-making
   (i.e. resolving grievances, seeking status, socialization), this study
   explores the reflexive boundaries between (1) 68 individual
   representations of violent `Jihadi' and `right-wing' extremism in
   Europe, and (2) 130 young adult European citizens who pursue religious
   purity or cultural essence. Having identified the latter as a pool of
   `critical radicalism' in the current political context, the study
   juxtaposes violent and non-violent radicalizations by challenging two
   interrelated assumptions. The first is the sameness assumption: those
   who use a similar repertoire are unified by their similarity. The second
   is the continuum assumption: radicalism will eventually lead to
   violence, given that `radicalization' discursively implies a shift
   towards promoting or carrying out violent behaviour. Drawing on
   comparisons between interview and media narratives, I argue that violent
   extremism and critical radicalism part ways while developing reflective
   methods to evaluate grievances, reclaim agency in response to status
   losses, and align social bonds with the ideology. The conceptual
   divergence indicates several fault lines between ideological simplicity
   and completeness and relates to individuals' self-awareness in
   (re)making the ideology rather than a given ideology. This concluding
   remark has implications for the value of reflexive awareness in
   democracies.},

Abstract = {Given the heterogeneity of European welfare states, governments' efforts
   in `social investment' reform may reap different outcomes in different
   national contexts. Through multi-level modelling based on longitudinal
   microdata from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions
   (2004-2013) and on country-level policy indicators, this article
   assesses: whether citizens of countries that put higher budgetary
   efforts into social investment have better employment prospects and
   whether increasing such efforts over time improves employment chances
   within a country; whether people living in social investment-oriented
   welfare states maintained higher employment chances in the years of the
   Great Recession; whether micro-level employment outcomes depend on
   (in-)complementarities between investment- and protection-oriented
   policies. The results reveal that the most social investment-oriented
   welfare states show higher individual-level employment chances, which
   they were able to preserve during the Great Recession. However,
   increasing resources on social investments does not always yield
   empirically discernible returns over the short-to-medium term.},

Abstract = {International climate governance no longer takes place only in the
   UNFCCC but is spread across numerous fora that collectively form the
   international regime complex on climate change. For climate leaders like
   the EU, the regime complex creates opportunities for strategic activity
   in its diplomacy across the different fora. This article examines how
   internal compartmentalisation affected the EU's diplomacy across the
   international regime complex on climate change in the negotiation of
   four climate agreements: the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC), CORSIA (ICAO),
   the Kigali Amendment (Montreal Protocol), and the Initial Strategy
   (IMO). It finds that internal compartmentalisation indeed hinders the
   EU's pursuit of a comprehensive climate diplomacy, making the regime
   complex a missed opportunity for the EU. Various combinations of a lack
   of communication channels, different priorities and policy framings, and
   a lack of resources and expertise contributed to situations where the EU
   was limited in using the regime complex.},

Abstract = {Content moderation for counterterrorism purposes is hobbled by the
   problem of specificity: the difficulty of knowing what content could
   lead to violence. Online content is generated by terrorists and their
   supporters for sinister purposes but circulated and consumed by a far
   wider audience who may be inspired, disgusted or indifferent. The
   presence or discoverability of terrorism content may serve real and not
   merely abstract interests of freedom of expression and personal
   development. However, the traditional approach of identifying
   fundamental human rights which may or may not be outweighed by the
   counterterrorism interest is complicated by two factors discussed in
   this article: firstly, the unsuitability of the human rights framework
   in the online space; secondly, the difficulty of understanding
   trade-offs between restrictions on free expression and the capacity of
   the internet in its current form.},

   Critical Learning Community},

Abstract = {This paper features the process whereby an experimental Women, Peace,
   and Security (WPS) program fostered a critical learning community around
   peace and security across 13 countries and with 40 women. It addresses
   the epistemological questions of doing research in collective ways (with
   and among activists/scholars), the axiological challenge of recognizing
   and embracing counter-expertise, and the possibilities for incorporating
   values and practices of care as well as non-extractivism in producing
   and disseminating knowledge. By articulating the core ethical principles
   that emerged from this experience, the paper suggests a critical
   feminist epistemological commitment in taking seriously grassroots
   women's knowledge in peace and security processes, rather than what is
   often done in both policy and academy: prescribing their needs from
   above, interpreting their knowledge from the outside, and advising what
   problems to tackle and how to live.
   Este articulo presenta el proceso mediante el cual un programa
   experimental en el marco de \& DLANGBRAC;Mujeres, Paz y Seguridad \&
   drangbrac; (MPS), fomento una comunidad de aprendizaje critica en torno
   a la paz y a la seguridad en 13 paises y con 40 mujeres. Este articulo
   aborda las cuestiones epistemologicas derivadas del hecho de realizar
   una investigacion de manera colectiva (con y entre activistas o
   academicos), el desafio axiologico de reconocer y abrazar la \&
   DLANGBRAC;contraexperiencia \& drangbrac;, y las posibilidades de
   incorporar tanto valores como practicas en materia de cuidados, asi como
   el no extractivismo en la produccion y en la difusion del conocimiento.
   Este articulo, por el hecho de articular los principios eticos basicos
   que surgieron de esta experiencia, sugiere un compromiso epistemologico
   feminista critico para tomar en serio el conocimiento fundamental de las
   mujeres dentro de los procesos de paz y seguridad, en lugar de lo que se
   hace, con frecuencia, tanto en la politica como en el mundo academico:
   prescribir sus necesidades desde arriba, interpretar su conocimiento
   desde el exterior y aconsejar tanto que problemas se deben abordar como
   la forma en que se debe vivir.
   Cet article presente le processus par lequel un programme pour les
   femmes, la paix et la securite (FPS) a promu une communaute
   d'apprentissage critique autour de la paix et de la securite incluant 40
   femmes dans 13 pays. Il s'interesse aux questions epistemologiques d'une
   recherche collective (avec et parmi des militants/chercheurs), au defi
   axiologique quand il s'agit de reconnaitre et d'accepter une
   contre-expertise, et aux possibilites d'incorporation de valeurs et
   pratiques de precaution, mais aussi de non-extractivisme dans la
   production et la diffusion des connaissances. En articulant les
   principes ethiques fondamentaux qui ont emerge de cette experience,
   l'article indique un engagement epistemologique feministe critique
   relativement a la prise au serieux des connaissances fondamentales des
   femmes sur les processus de paix et de securite. Celui-ci s'oppose aux
   tendances recurrentes dans les domaines politique et academique: la
   hierarchie prescrit les besoins des femmes, des personnes exterieures
   interpretent leurs connaissances et on leur prodigue des conseils sur
   les problemes a regler et leur facon de vivre.},

Abstract = {Many autocrats govern with an in-group, whose support must be secured,
   and an out-group, which is subject to repression. How do autocrats
   exploit in-group/out-group dynamics to secure their survival? One
   strategy, we argue, is to broadcast out-group repression to the in-group
   as a signal of the regime's capacity for violence. Empirically, we focus
   on China, where the government represses ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang.
   Drawing on 1 million articles from six propaganda newspapers, we show
   that the regime broadcasts out-group repression to urban elites on each
   anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, when 10\% of Beijing
   residents joined anti-regime protests. To understand its effects, we
   conducted a survey experiment balanced on the national census during the
   June 2020 Tiananmen anniversary. Using a list experiment to mitigate
   preference falsification, we show that CCP propaganda about Uyghurs
   during the Tiananmen anniversary discourages protests among politically
   engaged urban elites because they fear repression.},

Abstract = {Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, people have witnessed a deluge of conspiracy
   theories and disinformation. As the coronavirus poses a significant
   threat to individuals' lives, these conspiracy theories are dangerous,
   as they erode public trust and undermine government efforts to fight the
   virus. This paper examines the political determinants of COVID-19
   conspiracy beliefs. Particularly, we analyze how government policy
   responses to the pandemic and individuals' ideological predispositions
   interact to shape people's tendencies to believe conspiracy theories.
   Using survey data from 22 advanced industrial countries, we show that
   political conservatives are more prone to conspiracy beliefs than
   liberals. More importantly, this tendency is reinforced when the
   government adopts stringent containment policies. Our results suggest
   that governments' policy efforts to contain the coronavirus can trigger
   an unintended backlash from political conservatives. This study has
   important implications for the behavioral and attitudinal effects of
   government containment policies that are often overlooked.},

Abstract = {This study assesses the claim that food insecurity leads to
   participation in unrest. I argue that insecure access to food can
   provide a motivational force to engage in urban unrest. But individuals
   must also have the capacity to partake in collective action, and acute
   food insecurity may undermine mobilization potential. Further, food
   insecurity is a mundane and widespread grievance often seen as an
   apolitical issue. I therefore suggest that organizational networks could
   facilitate the occurrence of unrest, as they provide both an existing
   mobilizing structure and the potential to politicize an individual-level
   grievance. The article explores the relationship between food access and
   unrest participation on the individual level in the context of
   Johannesburg, South Africa. I find that food insecurity increases the
   likelihood of unrest participation and that some types of organizational
   networks are catalysts of such effects.},

Abstract = {Since the deployment of the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Mali
   (MINUSMA), host communities have witnessed not only significant levels
   militarization but also continuous conflict. Noticeably, national-level
   politics and specific urban issues mix and manifest especially around
   MINUSMA's physical presence. The ensuing protest and violence challenge
   the UN mission to consider its immediate and long-term imprint on the
   place of intervention and the urbanism it produces. How does
   peacekeeping contribute to the destruction and production of urban
   space? What kind of urbanism does, and should, a peacekeeping mission
   foster? Based on a qualitative analysis, this article considers violent
   contestation in the context of MINUSMA, focusing on incidents in Kidal,
   Gao, and Mopti. It suggests `conflict urbanism' as conceptual framing to
   analyse the characters of urban contestation in the presence of peace
   operations and to signal the necessity to sustain some forms of
   contestation as part of Mali's peacebuilding efforts.},

Abstract = {Although the need for local ownership of peacebuilding is routinely
   emphasized, the importance and the modalities of engaging with local
   cultures and traditions are not adequately understood, and the
   peacebuilding potential of local customs remains largely unharnessed.
   Drawing on extensive interviews with community leaders (n94) and farmers
   and villagers (n107), and using a conceptual framework that combines
   notions of the everyday and events that mark a rupture with the
   everyday, this article explores the opportunities that local people's
   everyday interactions, culture, and traditions offer for peacebuilding
   in post-Islamic State Ninewa Plains, Iraq. In doing so, the article
   makes a theoretical contribution to the everyday peace literature by
   further developing existing typologies of everyday acts and attitudes of
   everyday peace. Demonstrating how everyday acts and attitudes of peace
   sit on a scale with negative peace on the one end and positive peace on
   the other, the article introduces the concept of `affinity' on the
   positive peace side of the scale, to refer to an affective engagement
   with the other and to acts of getting to know, understand, and
   participate in what is important to the other community.},

Abstract = {This present research explores a progressive repurposing of Virtual
   Reality technology, Virtual Immersive Contact (VIC), in a real-world
   setting to; explore viability to reduce prejudice and investigate the
   role of empathy in motivating prosocial behavior. The study employed a
   between-subjects repeated-measures experimental design of a randomized
   sample (n = 113) split into two conditions to reduce prejudice and
   discrimination in the active conflict area of the Central African
   Republic (CAR). In line with the study's hypotheses, VIC produced a
   significant increase in empathic concern for the Muslim outgroup and
   intentions to donate to a Muslim family, while also showing that the
   relationship between empathy and helping behaviours was mostly explained
   by confounding variables. This research provides both the first evidence
   of its kind that VIC could be a new form of fostering positive
   intergroup contact in an active conflict setting, crating a new facet of
   intergroup contact theory, and further evolving the literature on the
   empathy, prosocial behaviour relationship.},

Abstract = {The impact of corporate political spending on environmental policy has
   drawn numerous attention from researchers and policymakers. However, few
   studies have analyzed the empirical effect of corporate spending on
   environmental policy in aggregate. In this study, I analyze the impact
   of corporate independent spending bans on state environmental policy,
   utilizing the repeal of such bans in 23 states following the 2010
   Supreme Court's Citizens United decision as a research design. Through
   difference-in-differences tests, I find no evidence that the removal of
   independent expenditure bans influenced state environmental policy,
   regulations, or outcomes, or overall policy liberalism. I also find that
   corporate direct contributions did not increase in treated states, which
   may explain the lack of environmental policy effects. These results
   demonstrate that corporations did not utilize the new spending avenue
   after Citizens United to influence state environmental policy in
   aggregate and raise questions concerning corporate political spending
   and environmental preferences.},

Abstract = {This analysis explores the rationale of the sanctions imposed on Russia
   in response to the invasion of Ukraine launched in February 2022.
   Sanctions research identifies three distinct logics: a classical logic
   that aims to destabilise a government by harming its economy as a whole
   and encouraging mass mobilisation; a more selective logic aimed at
   encouraging the elites to withdraw their support for the rulers, while a
   third logic conceives of sanctions as tools aimed at domestic audiences
   and third countries. The analysis concludes that all these logics
   operate simultaneously in the case of ongoing sanctions regime against
   Russia. This departs from previous practice which claimed to be

Abstract = {Hybrid professionals, that is, professionals who have transitioned to
   managerial roles, have emerged in numerous public settings. Through
   in-depth qualitative methodologies, the literature has shown a good
   degree of heterogeneity in the way hybrid professionals perceive and
   manage their hybridity. In this study, we aim to develop a theory-based,
   multidimensional instrument able to capture such heterogeneity in a lean
   but sensitive way. In this instrument, we combine consolidated scales of
   identity centrality and integration and vignettes, on the one hand, to
   measure the perception of hybrid professionals of the relationship
   between their professional and managerial identities and, on the other
   hand, to elicit the practices they use to deal with the demands of the
   professional and managerial logics. We first validate the instrument on
   a sample of school principals in the Italian context and then describe
   the six profiles of hybrid professionals derived from the analysis. We
   suggest three avenues for applying such an instrument.},

Abstract = {Research has shown that politicians' perceptions of public opinion are
   subject to social projection. When estimating the opinions of voters on
   a broad range of issues, politicians tend to assume that their own
   preferences are shared by voters. This article revisits this finding and
   adds to the literature in three ways. First, it makes a conceptual
   contribution by bringing together different approaches to the analysis
   of projection and its consequences. Second, relying on data from surveys
   with politicians (n = 866) in four countries (Belgium, Canada, Germany,
   and Switzerland) conducted between March 2018 and September 2019, it
   shows that there is more projection in politicians' estimations of their
   partisan electorate than in their estimations of the general public or
   of their geographic district. Third, comparing the data on politician
   projection with data from parallel surveys with citizens, the article
   reveals that-at least in three out of the four countries studied
   here-elected politicians are not better at avoiding erroneous projection
   than ordinary citizens. The article discusses the implications of these
   findings for the workings of representative democracy.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 26},
Abstract = {This paper takes advantage of the theoretical framework of ``reciprocal
   socialization{''} first proposed by Terhalle to assess the role of the
   G20 in shaping the interactions between emerging and traditional
   creditors on coordination of sovereign debt treatment and development
   cooperation. It focuses on the case of China, arguing that the G20 has
   strengthened Chinese identity as a ``responsible major country,{''} and
   fostered its learning from the OECD and the Paris Club on debt
   restructuring and development assistance norms even without formal
   membership. This paves the way for the G20 to launch the Debt Service
   Suspension Initiative (DSSI) and the Common Framework for debt treatment
   beyond the DSSI in 2020 in response to the pandemic, a milestone of
   formal coordination between China and the Paris Club. While China
   exhibits more flexibility in endorsing the rules of the Paris Club, it
   is also expected to argue for its legitimate interests in BRI lending
   and reinterprets these rules on debt sustainability and development
   finance more broadly.},

Abstract = {Since the security of energy supply in Europe is at stake, the debate on
   energy sources prominently took hold on the agenda of European
   countries. Nuclear energy is one of the issues on this agenda. However,
   nuclear energy is discussed quite differently in Germany and France,
   although the two countries both experienced strong public protest in the
   1970s and are similar in size, economy, industry and culture. By
   comparing the two, this article analyses the reasons for the different
   debates on nuclear energy existent in Germany and France. It argues that
   stances on nuclear energy form the core of social identities that
   prevent members of these groups to deviate from the group norm. The
   relevance of certain types of identities is a function of the
   institutions of the political system. To change the way energy sources
   are discussed, it is necessary to create or make salient different group
   identities.},

Abstract = {This article examines the determinants of the positioning of secondary
   states in the US-China conflict over market access for China's Huawei.
   Our explanations draw on three branches of realism: balance-of-threat
   theory, patron-client theory, and Hirschman's theory on trade
   relationships and foreign-policy convergence. For the dependent
   variable, we assemble a new dataset of the attitudes of 70 states toward
   Huawei's investment aspirations. We present a series of ordered logit
   regression models from which three main patterns appear. First, less
   powerful states seem more acceptive of the Chinese company. Second,
   those states that rely on US security guarantees tend to be far more
   rejective of Huawei. Third, whereas trade with China appears to be a
   factor in the reasonings of other states, trade with the US is not. In
   sum, the patron-client theory offers the most cogent explanation of the
   divergence of responses to Huawei.},

Abstract = {The digitalisation of public policy requires that the State uses
   citizens' personal data. Although researchers agree that data privacy is
   important, we know little about the conditions under which citizens
   approve of their personal data being used in different policy domains.
   This study relies on data from original surveys conducted in Switzerland
   to demonstrate that citizens' willingness to share their data with the
   State is low and varies across policy domains. Support for sharing is
   significantly higher when the data are used to prevent benefit fraud in
   social assistance or to improve health research than when they are used
   to fight tax evasion or to prevent crime and terrorism. Nevertheless, we
   also argue that the more citizens trust government and the more
   important they consider a policy issue to be, the more likely they are
   to share their data with the State officials in charge of the relevant
   policy. Previous use of apps also increases citizens' agreement for the
   policy-related use of their personal data.},

Abstract = {Competition policy has been at the core of the European integration
   project from its very inception. The United Kingdom (UK) played a truly
   pivotal role in the development of European Union (EU) competition
   policy with the policy long presenting one of the best illustrations of
   Europeanisation. The public vote for Brexit in 2016 pushed the reset
   button for the UK's engagement with the EU and saw successive UK
   governments all pursuing a de-Europeanisation trajectory as part of
   their objective of `taking back control'. State aid emerged as a
   contentious issue during the Brexit negotiations. The UK government
   hailed its new Subsidy Control Act (2023) as a clear departure from the
   EU state aid regime, but is this a case of de-Europeanisation or partial
   de-Europeanisation? This article argues that the UK has still not
   entirely broken free from EU's state aid regime and finds itself in a
   state of orbiting Europeanisation.},

Abstract = {Significant increases in defence spending in European NATO and European
   Union member states are intended to address long-standing capability
   shortfalls, support the modernisation and growth of armed forces,
   replenish stocks, and fill gaps created by the transfer of equipment and
   munitions to Ukraine. Yet Europe's defence-industrial base will struggle
   to meet this increased demand in the short term. Furthermore, the war in
   Ukraine has revealed Russia's broader threat to Europe, while the United
   States' `pivot to Asia' is likely to accelerate and reduce the American
   role in Europe's defence. Accordingly, Europe needs an epochal shift in
   political thinking, coupled with significantly higher defence spending
   and a determined effort to reset public perceptions of the need for
   strong defence. None of these requirements currently looks assured.},

Title = {Bridging the ``consent gap{''}: mechanisms of legitimization in a
   cross-border megaproject},

Abstract = {In the recent debate on megaprojects (MPs), greater attention is devoted
   to the functioning of the interorganizational and multiactor networks
   that are one of the most innovative features in recent years. The
   complexity of these structures brings out governability issues for an
   MP's management. Mutual recognition and consent become elements capable
   of inaugurating more collaborative processes and practices to reduce
   organizational and management criticalities in MPs. This paper focuses
   on a neglected relational dimension, namely legitimacy. We argue that
   legitimacy is instead the central dimension that attributes
   effectiveness and capacity for action to the organizations involved.
   Legitimacy regulates the relationship between various organizations-and
   especially-between organizations and the public sphere. Institutionalist
   theory assigns a central role to legitimacy in the construction of
   social processes, defining it as a generalized form of social acceptance
   toward an actor, an idea, or a project. In this paper, we hypothesize
   that the legitimacy attributed and ``held{''} by the stakeholders is a
   crucial element in countering three critical aspects of MPs, namely the
   uncertainty, complexity, and conflict acting on the construction of
   public consensus and the quality of relationships between the
   participating stakeholders. We verify our hypothesis by analyzing a
   cross-border MP, the Fehmarnbelt Fixed Link between Germany and Denmark.
   The paper concentrates on the mechanisms with which stakeholders can
   acquire legitimacy using the Eriksen discursive legitimation scheme.
   These mechanisms are different (evidence-based, public participation,
   and legislators' command) and produce different outcomes in terms of
   increasing or containing these three criticalities.},

Abstract = {This article critically analyzes the human rights perspective upon what
   has emerged as one of the most significant socioeconomic and political
   chal- lenges confronting many millions of people residing within
   high-income, liberal-democratic societies: rising poverty and
   socioeconomic inequality. This article argues that international and
   domestic human rights law and the social and political imaginaries of
   the wider human rights community largely fail to adequately diagnose and
   effectively respond to poverty and inequality within high-income,
   liberal-democratic societies. As a political and ethical doctrine
   founded upon a normative commitment to social justice, human rights
   should be taking the lead in efforts to condemn, understand, and develop
   responses to the poverty and inequality which blight the lives of many
   millions of people within many of the world's most affluent and,
   allegedly, most ``liberal{''} societies. Human rights law has
   historically not done so. We, as a community, have not done so. This
   article offers a specific explanation for this continuing failure, by
   focusing upon the absence of any concerted recognition of or engagement
   with social class as it contributes to and compounds our exposure to
   poverty and inequality. Human rights remain largely blind to the many
   ways in which social class is intricately connected to poverty and
   inequality. The human rights community within high-income,
   liberal-democratic societies characteristically fails to take class
   seriously. Building upon previous writing in this area, this article
   explains why class is rarely recognized or engaged with by the human
   rights community. This article also sets out the basis for how we might
   begin the task of overcoming this highly damaging class blindness, to
   set the stage for what the author asserts as an urgent need if human
   rights is to provide the kind of political and ethical leadership
   required to effectively engage with poverty and inequality in affluent
   societies: the degentrification of human rights.},

Abstract = {The impact that the works of Antoine-Henri de Jomini, especially his
   flagship book Precis de l'art de la guerre, had upon the development of
   military thought is commonly known. However, in contrast to the lively
   interest shown towards Jomini's input with regards to the development of
   French, Russian, American or Italian military theory, there is no study
   devoted to the role he played in the shaping of Prussian military
   thinking. The main interest of the article is to present and explain the
   conditions of Jomini's influence on Prussian military strategy in the
   first half of the nineteenth century.},

Abstract = {As research on violent extremism continues to progress beyond some of
   the field's earlier challenges, new ways of gathering primary source
   data are becoming increasingly popular. One such data collection
   methodology implemented widely across parallel fields is crowdsourcing:
   the process of gathering information, or input, from large numbers of
   people, either for payment or not, online. In this research note, we
   present a brief introduction to crowdsourcing, highlight a popular
   platform for gathering samples online, Prolific, and present four
   studies conducted by the research team to demonstrate the unique
   benefits and challenges of crowdsourcing samples online for research on
   violent extremism.},

Abstract = {Stakeholder theory has been advocating the inclusion of affected parties
   in organizational processes to increase the legitimacy and effectiveness
   of organizational governance. However, organizations can fail to achieve
   these objectives if there is no systematic link between stakeholders and
   their constituency. Based on democratic notions of representation, we
   argue that democratic stakeholder representativeness is an essential
   virtue of stakeholder governance processes. We conceptually derive
   authorization and accountability as normative elements of stakeholder
   representativeness and operationalize the construct by proposing
   empirical indicators of stakeholder representativeness as well as
   procedural guidance on their adoption in a practical governance context.
   By doing so, we contribute to the advancement of practical stakeholder
   governance as well as to the public management and organizational theory
   literature by specifying and operationalizing a construct that had
   previously been only vaguely defined.},

Abstract = {Objective/context: South America has undergone a process of
   democratization and progressive reduction of inter-state disputes since
   the 1980s and 1990s. The disappearance of threats traditionally faced by
   several states in the region, or their management within the framework
   of different conflict resolution mechanisms, has led to an unintended
   effect known as threat deficit, a strategic scenario in which the
   external threat perception of a State disappears or is considerably
   weakened. The literature argues that border conflict resolution and
   democratization are associated with a reduction in the size of military
   budget and organization. Methodology: The article is an exploratory
   analysis that compares the cases of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru,
   Colombia, and Venezuela in the period 1981-2020 and identifies how the
   so-called policy of bases has impacted the military organization
   measured in terms of the number of military bases. Conclusions: In a
   context of democratization and a marked reduction of inter-state
   conflict in South America, the number of bases has not only been
   maintained but, in most cases, increased. Originality: No previous works
   have analyzed this issue for the South American region.},

Title = {Intellectual Humility and Political Polarization: An Exploration of
   Social Networks, Attitudes, and Affect},

Abstract = {Political polarization is increasing in the United States, threatening
   social harmony. As this threat grows, it is important to identify
   factors that engender polarization and ways to disrupt them. To this
   end, we examined the buffering role of intellectual humility against
   political polarization and the potential mediating role of political
   heterophily (i.e., affiliation and communication with political outgroup
   members). Data were collected in five assessments over an eight-month
   period, beginning one day prior to the 2020 U.S. presidential election
   (N = 387) and ending in July 2021 (N = 181). Results showed that
   intellectual humility was associated with (1) less affective and
   attitudinal polarization (although in some cases this effect was only
   present among conservatives) and (2) more political heterophily.
   Cross-sectional and prospective mediation analyses suggested that
   intellectual humility may act through political heterophily to reduce
   attitude polarization. Our findings offer support for the notion that
   intellectual humility buffers against political polarization and provide
   preliminary evidence for political heterophily as one mechanism of
   action.},

Abstract = {Scholars have written on the extensive risks that transnational
   terrorism entails for militant groups that perpetrate such attacks.
   However, despite these risks, transnational terrorism has become an
   increasingly common feature of civil wars. This raises the question: Why
   do rebel groups launch terrorist attacks outside of the countries they
   are fighting civil wars in? I argue that weaker rebel groups are more
   inclined to turn to such tactics because they are desperate, and as a
   result, are more willing to make the gamble to signal their resolve,
   impose costs on their enemies, avoid direct military confrontation with
   domestic security forces, and generate external support. Using data on
   the transnational terrorist attack patterns of all rebel
   group-government dyads present in the Uppsala Conflict Data Program
   (UCDP) Dyadic Dataset from 1970 to 2013, I find that conventionally weak
   rebel groups are more likely to rely on transnational terrorism.},

Abstract = {Air pollution is a pressing concern for the Chinese government. While an
   increase in public concern about air pollution can be politically costly
   for the regime, we show that the Chinese government proactively utilizes
   the news media to increase public awareness of air pollution instead of
   suppressing relevant information. By analyzing media coverage of air
   pollution by 161 government-controlled and commercially-oriented
   newspapers between 2000 and 2017, we find that government-controlled
   newspapers provide more extensive coverage of air pollution than
   commercially-oriented newspapers. This tendency has become more
   pronounced since China declared its war on air pollution. Automated text
   analysis further demonstrates that the news media under government
   control emphasized the government's response to air pollution, while
   diverting attention away from the negative health effects of air
   pollution. The analysis suggests that an authoritarian government can
   strategically use the news media to enhance public support for pollution
   mitigation strategies.},

Abstract = {Both proponents and critics of the regulatory state thesis view the
   creation of non-majoritarian institutions, such as independent
   regulatory agencies, as a process of `depoliticisation'. This article
   problematises this assumption by proposing an analytical framework for
   better understanding the link between politicisation, depoliticisation,
   and the delegation of powers to non-majoritarian institutions, based on
   a study of drug rationing policies in England and France. A greater
   delegation of decision-making powers to a regulator enables policy
   decisions that are likely to prove politically costly, but such
   decisions are also likely to attract greater counter-mobilisation,
   undermining policy stability over time. By contrast, in a less delegated
   setting, elected politicians can prevent unpopular policy choices from
   being taken, which contributes to policy continuity. The article further
   argues that, where decision-making powers are highly delegated, the
   regulator's autonomy and the visibility of losses imposed by policy
   decisions condition the politicisation process. These findings suggest
   that, far from depoliticising policy problems, delegated policymaking
   insulated from politics can undermine itself by becoming a source of
   subsequent politicisation; they thus question the prevailing notion that
   delegation to non-majoritarian institutions contributes to policy
   stability.},

Title = {Theatre and Human Rights: The Politics of Dramatic Form},
Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-31},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This project develops theoretical intersections between theatre and
   human rights and provides methodologies to investigate human rights
   questions from within the perspective of theatre as a complex set of
   disciplines. While human rights research and programming often employ
   the arts as representations of political, social, and economic abuses,
   this study focuses on the intricacies of dramatic form and structure as
   uniquely positioned to interrogate important questions in human rights
   theory and practice. This project positions theatre as a method of
   examination, or as Alexander Baumgarten discussed, art as a way of
   knowing, rather than emphasizing more limited however important purposes
   the arts serve to raise conscious-ness that accompany other, often
   considered more primary modes of analysis. A main feature of this
   approach includes emphasis on dialectical structures in drama and human

Abstract = {Foreign aid to regional international organizations (RIOs) has increased
   tremendously in recent decades. The vast differences between RIOs give
   rise to the question of why some RIOs attract considerable amounts of
   aid while others attract much less, or even nothing at all. To address
   that question, this article sets out and examines a set of hypotheses
   that focus on various characteristics of RIOs that allow donors to
   reduce transaction costs. Empirically, the analysis proceeds via two
   steps: the hypotheses are first subjected to an empirical plausibility
   probe based on quantitative methods and then illustrated based on case
   study of the Southern African Development Community. The findings reveal
   that RIOs are most attractive when they operate in a range of policy
   fields, involve many member-states and are engaged in long-lasting
   collaborations with donors. By contrast, there is little support for
   conventional explanations as to why RIOs attract funding - for instance,
   claims that being democratic, being most in need or providing donors
   with market access will lead to greater funding. The rather disturbing
   policy implication is that a small number of RIOs are likely to continue
   to attract the bulk of funding, whereas poorly funded RIOs are unlikely
   to attract significant amounts of aid.},

Abstract = {Efforts to set standards for artificial intelligence (AI) reveal
   striking patterns: technical experts hailing from geopolitical rivals,
   such as the United States and China, readily collaborate on technical AI
   standards within transnational standard-setting organizations, whereas
   governments are much less willing to collaborate on global ethical AI
   standards within international organizations. Whether competition or
   cooperation prevails can be explained by three variables: the actors
   that make up the membership of the standard-setting organization, the
   issues on which the organization's standard-setting efforts focus, and
   the ``games{''} actors play when trying to set standards within a
   particular type of organization. A preliminary empirical analysis
   provides support for the contention that actors, issues, and games
   affect the prospects for cooperation on global AI standards. It matters
   because shared standards are vital for achieving truly global frameworks
   for the governance of AI. Such global frameworks, in turn, lower
   transaction costs and the probability that the world will witness the
   emergence of AI systems that threaten human rights and fundamental
   freedoms.},

Abstract = {This article studies the violent politics of stigmatisation and erasure
   of nationalist urban infrastructure. In general, urban infrastructure is
   a mechanism of state power. But, through the case of the imposing
   presence of Turkish nationalist infrastructure in the Kurdish city
   Diyarbakir, it demonstrates that when tied to an antagonistic
   nationalist political project, this infrastructure is often purposefully
   built to violently cleanse urban spaces of the national ``other{''}. Be
   it a statue, a mural or a picture of a nationalist leader - this
   infrastructure is incapable of inflicting physical pain. Nonetheless,
   its violence is symbolic and meant to have a real effect on Diyarbakir's
   Kurds' ability and willingness to identify as Kurds. That said, violence
   does not entirely inform the spatial experience of those targeted by
   this nationalist infrastructure. The article demonstrates that Kurdish
   residents also found ways of remaining unaffected, even treating the
   infrastructure laden with Turkish nationalist iconography as a reminder
   of their own Kurdish identity. This article thus expands our
   understanding of what nationalist infrastructure does. It may be
   designed to be violent. However, it also reveals itself to be a site of
   contestation - equally inspiring the persistence of the
   counter-narrative of the national ``other{''}.},

   institutional factors or party characteristics?},

Abstract = {A vital political opposition is one of the cornerstones of democracy,
   yet we know surprisingly little about the conditions that shape it. In
   this paper, we offer a comprehensive assessment of the drivers of
   parliamentary opposition in European Union (EU) politics in five
   countries: Denmark; Germany; Ireland; Sweden; and the United Kingdom.
   Based on an extensive hand-coded data set of 7,520 statements made by
   members of parliament (MPs) during both plenary sessions and
   deliberations during European Affairs Committee (EAC) meetings, we
   examine how institutions and party characteristics shape two types of
   oppositional behaviour: the expression of critique and the presentation
   of alternatives. We find that both factors are important for
   understanding to what extent, and how, opposition is voiced in national
   parliaments. Oversight institutions' strength and a party's degree of
   Euroscepticism jointly function as significant determinants of the
   likelihood that MPs will express opposition in the form of critique.
   However, when it comes to the likelihood of offering alternatives,
   oversight institutions' strength fails to explain variations in the
   share of alternatives, while degree of Euroscepticism remains a
   significant predictor.},

Abstract = {The intense Latin American electoral cycle of 2020-22 coincided with
   deteriorating socio-economic conditions in the wake of the COVID-19
   pandemic and increasing frustration with the status quo. Anti-incumbent
   sentiment coupled with demands for more inclusive and fair economic
   models prompted a pronounced shift to the left in the region, although
   with many different shades of `pink'. But an increasingly polarised and
   fragmented political and social environment is testing the ability of
   new governments to deliver change, as shown by the popular rejection of
   a new constitution in Chile. A more limited fiscal space is also
   constraining these governments' effectiveness. Nevertheless, political
   alignment among countries with important stakes in global climate-change
   mitigation and thwarting drug trafficking could produce more cohesive
   foreign-policy stances and increased regional leverage.},

Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},

Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-89},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Studies have noted geographical variations in support for the communist
   parties in Kerala. However, practices adopted by communists in Kerala to
   maintain their dominance in these geographical regions and how residents
   of these places relate to these practices have not been sufficiently
   explored. This article, based on field insights from a panchayat in
   North Kannur investigates party-society links. It is argued that while
   material factors help link party and voter, these links are complex and
   do not conform to clientelism or patronage, as conventionally
   understood. These links are embedded in a local social context which
   adds elements of mutuality and non-hierarchical interaction between
   citizens and party. Ideology also conditions party-society linkages.},
