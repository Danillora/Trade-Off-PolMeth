Abstract = {The research into the strategies of the sides in the Russia-Ukraine war
   is of great relevance, as it is one of the most intense conflicts on the
   territory of Europe since World War II. Further, the violent actions
   committed by the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine have had
   an unprecedented impact on the international peace architecture and
   international relations; they have caused a humanitarian, economic, and
   social crisis on a regional and global scale. The present research may,
   most notably, help understand the causes and consequences of the
   conflict. For this reason, this paper aims to analyze and cover the
   peculiarities of the main military and political strategies of Ukraine
   and the Russian Federation in the context of the 2022 war, as well as
   evaluate specific actions the enemies took against each other as
   international actors. The updating of the states' strategies should be
   noted, as previously Ukraine was regarded only in the context of
   European integration and reforms, while the full-scale war increases
   Ukraine's subjectivity, particularly in terms of planning and
   implementation of military decisions and more proactive diplomatic
   efforts. Russia's strategies were considered in the context of Western
   theoretical models aimed at establishing it as a regional leader with
   extensive military potential. Moreover, the beginning of the full-scale
   war proved that in the situation of the military conflict against
   Ukraine and its allies Russia's strategic resources are limited, which
   calls for further research. The results of this investigation provide a
   theoretical basis for further research in the field and are of
   importance for the understanding of security issues, and safeguarding of
   peace and stability not only in Ukraine and Europe but all around the
   world.},

Abstract = {Advancing learning is a central tenet for improving public action.
   Recent calls for agility, robustness, prototyping and other strategies
   for coping with crises imply continual learning and improvement. This
   article contributes to challenging this ideal interpretation of the
   learning process. It provides conceptual and methodological tools to
   investigate the relationship between policy learning and policy change
   and sheds light on the diverse dynamics and types of learning that can
   emerge from crises. At the conceptual level, the article presents a
   learning matrix that classifies the possible outcomes in the
   relationship between learning and change. On methods, our research
   design includes process tracing, binary comparisons, and an innovative
   real-time approach to the study of learning. The article investigates
   three municipal case studies from the Italian food stamp programme
   implemented during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The repetition of the
   programme over a short period of time offers the opportunity to
   investigate inter-crisis learning, the process by which lessons from the
   first wave of implementation contributed to reforms in the second
   delivery. The coronavirus crisis magnified the acquisition of knowledge
   and provided radical inter-programme lessons - long-term,
   non-incremental learning beyond the management of the emergency. Yet,
   the findings also highlight how this window of opportunity for learning
   quickly closed and how certain lessons learned may be lost in the
   process of reform, hard to implement or are unlikely to be extrapolated
   across contexts.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes South Africa's role in the African Union's Agenda
   2063. It examines South Africa's position as a leading regional power
   post-apartheid. The study contends that Pretoria has developed a
   strategy towards its region. The argument is supported by a descriptive
   analysis of the implementation of Auda-Nepad and South Africa's efforts
   to broaden the thematic scope of the AU. The results show that South
   Africa's strategy as a leading regional power in Africa has been
   achieved through Pretoria's role as a paymaster in both the AU and
   Auda-Nepad, alongside the development of its own Agenda 2063 projects.},

Title = {Low-Skilled Liberalizers: Support for Free Trade in Africa},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {77},
Number = {4},
Pages = {848-870},
Abstract = {Despite populist backlash against globalization in advanced
   industrialized countries, developing countries have recently sought to
   liberalize trade. To shed light on this phenomenon, we investigate mass
   attitudes toward free trade in thirty-six African countries. Using two
   rounds of Afrobarometer data and original survey data from Ghana and
   Uganda, we find that individuals hold views that are consistent with
   their economic self-interest. As factor endowment models predict for a
   sample of skill-scarce countries, low-skilled individuals are more
   likely than high-skilled individuals to support free trade. Moreover,
   the strongest negative effects of skill occur for the most skill-scarce
   countries in the sample and are driven by individuals in the labor
   force. Our results are robust to measuring variables more precisely in
   original surveys and controlling for other factors thought to shape
   attitudes. The findings indicate that previous evidence against factor
   endowment models may have partially resulted from inadequate data from
   the developing world.},

Abstract = {The period with Ine Eriksen Soreide serving as foreign minister
   (2017-2021) provides an exciting window into the development of
   Norwegian China-policies. After a six-year freeze in the political
   relations between Norway and China, Soreide took on the task of
   normalizing the relationship and navigat-ing it into a time
   characterized by sharpened conflicts. In this article, we seek answers
   to two central questions: how did the China-policies evolve during these
   years, and what explains the turn towards more security-and
   value-ori-ented measures in the second half of the period? We combine
   theories and explanations emphasizing the role of institutional
   stability, stepwise political change, and structural, international
   influence.},

Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},

Volume = {81},

Pages = {240-253},
Abstract = {As an elected member of the UN Security Council between 2021 and 2022,
   Norway had the opportunity to achieve results within one of the world's
   most powerful institutions. As a penholder on Afghanistan, Norway
   accomplished several important press statements, presidential statements
   and the 2022 extension of the United Nations Assistance Mission in
   Afghanistan (UNAMA). The context for this work was the seizure of power
   by the Taliban in Afghanistan in August 2021, and the invasion of
   Ukraine by the veto power Russia in February 2022. Based on interviews
   with Norwegian diplomats, and other elected and permanent members, this
   article investigates the informal penholder system in the UN Security
   Council. Furthermore, it looks into Norway's role and experience as the
   penholder for Afghanistan. Practice theory brings insight to how an
   informal practice like penholding in the UN Security Council can provide
   influence for elected members if they know how to take advantage of this
   role. The article concludes that penholding is an important role for
   elected members in order to achieve influence in a specific case, but
   also to promote one's own priority areas. However, influence through
   penholding is still conditioned by the country's social capital, and
   goodwill from permanent members of the Security Council.},

Abstract = {The paper discusses the relationship between city and war, from
   antiquity to modern conflicts. The permanence of the connection was
   especially emphasized with the metamorphoses in the appearance of the
   city caused by the war were also recognized, as well as the restrictions
   that the city places on military power. Dependence of the commander's
   decisions on the specifics of urban warfare was considered. It was
   concluded that commander's decisions always fall into the plane that
   passes through three points: imperative of victory, principle of
   avoiding unnecessary risk and moral conscience. In most cases,
   commanders have to balance between them considering many factors -
   political, sociological, economic, psychological and ethical.},

Abstract = {The article explores the driving forces behind the increase in
   Czech-German defence cooperation since the mid-2010s. We argue that the
   growth is due to several factors: Germany's more active role in European
   security, an upgrade of the political framework of Czech-German
   relations and the Czech Republic's need to modernise its armed forces.
   Further enhancement of relations was hindered by underdeveloped
   cooperation within the defence industry. The war in Ukraine has broken
   through this `glass ceiling', and the quality of Czech-German defence
   cooperation is increasing.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the recent discussion on planetary justice
   by analyzing two environmental justice struggles around mining projects
   that impact indigenous peoples and traditional communities in Brazil and
   South Africa. Though locally based, these ecological distribution
   conflicts are connected to global chains, impacting the whole planet. We
   focus on peoples' demands and to what extent their ways of knowing and
   being were considered in public consultation and litigation. Moreover,
   we reflect on what we can learn from these struggles. Our argument goes
   beyond distributive or procedural justice claims as these peoples are
   resisting the ontological erasure of their worlds, demanding to be
   consulted and participate in their own terms. These cases teach us that
   a deeper understanding of planetary justice entails diverse
   considerations of time, space, and the relations between human and
   non-humans. Assessing these struggles offer concrete ways to reimagine
   just relations, for many worlds in one planet.},

Title = {A Common Psychology of Male Violence? Assessing the Effects of Misogyny
   on Intentions to Engage in Violent Extremism, Interpersonal Violence and
   Support for Violence against Women},

Abstract = {The growing evidence base of risk factors for violent extremism
   demonstrates overlaps with different types of gender-based violent
   behaviours, such as intimate partner violence, sexual assault, and
   sexual harassment. Each of these manifestations of violence are, to a
   varying extent, underpinned by misogynistic and hypermasculine attitudes
   and behaviours. The present analysis aims to address the limited
   empirical research on the links between misogyny, violent extremism, and
   gender-based violence by conducting survey-based analyses employing a
   newly developed and validated psychometric scale to measure misogyny.
   Based on a U.K. nationally representative survey (n = 1500), we examine
   the underlying mechanisms and contingent effects linking misogyny to
   violent extremism, interpersonal violence, and violence against women.
   The results show that misogyny predicts violent extremist intentions,
   willingness to engage in interpersonal violence and increased support
   for violence against women via revenge planning and hypermasculinity,
   particularly among men who experience a sense of violated entitlement
   and greater threats to the ingroup. Among women, misogyny is not
   associated with violent extremist intentions but is associated with
   readiness to use interpersonal violence and with increased support for
   violence against women. Our findings largely suggest a common psychology
   underlying different types of male violence. This has important
   practical implications, (1) suggesting that misogyny is a shared risk
   factor which underpins different types of male violence, (2)
   highlighting the mechanisms which link misogyny to (extremist) violence,
   (3) while further providing evidence which articulates when and for whom
   misogyny may be a risk factor. Establishing the relevance of misogyny as
   a risk factor for extremist and gender-based violence provides evidence
   pointing towards the potential benefits of incorporating misogyny within
   existing (extremist) risk assessment tools. Identifying shared
   mechanisms via which misogyny exerts its effects on different forms of
   male-perpetrated violence, further offers initial evidence to inform
   programmatic approaches to prevent and counter gender-based and targeted
   violence.},

Abstract = {Crypto-finance is becoming increasingly popular, but the area is still
   unregulated in many ways. Its innovations promise to bring benefits by
   decreasing costs and increasing choices for intermediaries and
   customers. At the same time, and among other things, the breakdown of
   important exchanges and lawsuits against prominent figures illustrate
   potential challenges for investors, financial stability, and monetary
   sovereignty. How does the EU navigate the crypto verse? In this article,
   we analyse three regulations of the EU's Digital Finance Package through
   the lenses of discursive and historical institutionalism to understand
   when and where concerns about digital sovereignty motivate action. We
   argue that EU actors aim to regulate digital finance and retain
   sovereignty by employing different narratives that justify their policy
   choices. EU regulators upgrade existing regulations to cover digital
   finance areas that resemble traditional financial services and justify
   it by existing rationales on investor protection and financial
   stability. Digital finance poses security challenges that are new to
   financial regulation. EU actors employ a narrative of security threats
   to increase control in areas traditionally dealt with in cybersecurity.},

Abstract = {PurposeDrawing on cognitive appraisal theory, this study aims to explore
   the indirect effect of work/family boundary violations on teleworkers'
   counterproductive work behavior (CWB). In addition, it examines the
   moderating role of involuntary teleworking in this
   context.Design/methodology/approachBased on the diary study method, this
   study used 543 questionnaires collected from 122 teleworkers in
   China.FindingsThe findings indicate that working time demands mediate
   the relationship between work boundary violations and teleworker CWB,
   and threats to family roles mediate the relationship between family
   boundary violations and teleworker CWB. In addition, involuntary
   teleworking positively moderates the relationship between work boundary
   violations and working time demands, as well as the relationship between
   family boundary violations and threats to family
   roles.Originality/valueThe study makes several valuable contributions to
   the extant literature. First, it enhances research on the antecedents of
   teleworker CWB. Second, by introducing two mediating variables
   corresponding to two types of boundary violations, the paper provides
   new insights and a fresh understanding of the effects of boundary
   violations in teleworking situations. Third, by considering the
   moderating role of involuntary teleworking, this research adds to the
   current knowledge on the impact of discussing boundary violations solely
   on teleworking or traditional office days.},

Abstract = {Recently, an emerging body of research has diagnosed a `crisis of trust'
   in rural and peripheral areas. Yet, the majority of these works overlook
   local institutions as a potential alternative source of governance.
   Relying on original, nationally representative survey data from nine
   European countries, this article suggests that local institutions act as
   a safe haven for individuals with high levels of place-based resentment.
   Substantially, for these individuals, political trust in the local level
   significantly exceeds political trust in the national level. This
   dynamic is largely driven by concerns over representation. The stronger
   citizens feel that their place is overheard, the more they trust local
   relative to national institutions. This nuances the narrative of the
   `crisis of trust' in an important way. Rather than conceiving it as a
   crisis haunting the political system in general, it seems to be better
   understood as a crisis of the national level specifically.},

Abstract = {I study if industrial decarbonisation yields elevated perceptions of
   political and economic unfairness. Decarbonising industry is central for
   the Green Transition, but it will disproportionately affect regions
   where brown sectors, which have been made uncompetitive, are
   concentrated. I contribute to studies on political consequences of the
   Green Transition by exploring perceived unfairness as one outcome from
   these uneven effects. In regions where industrial decarbonisation and
   employment declines in brown sectors have been greater than in other
   regions, residents may feel that they have disproportionately borne the
   economic costs of industrial decarbonisation for their country, and may
   consider their governments to have neglected their interests. I test
   these expectations in 60 West European regions using past (2013-2018)
   employment and CO2 emissions trends from the three most carbon-polluting
   sectors, as proxies for industrial decarbonisation accompanied by
   employment declines in brown sectors, and combined them with micro-level
   data from the European Social Survey (2018). I find that regions exhibit
   elevated perceptions of economic and political unfairness only when they
   experience both relative CO2 emissions and employment decline in these
   sectors. As perceived unfairness underpins some of the political
   discontent observed today, this finding highlights the need for Green
   Transition policies that minimise labour market disruptions.},

Title = {Analysing the policy process of China's political accountability in the
   prevention and control of COVID-19},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},

Month = {2023 DEC 8},
Abstract = {The strategy used in China to prevent and control COVID-19 has been
   clearly different from that used in other countries worldwide. Indeed,
   China's ``dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy{''} mandated that all officials
   strictly and immediately implement policies emanating from the central
   government and higher levels of government aimed at preventing and
   controlling COVID-19. To ensure that public officials prevented and
   controlled COVID-19 in a timely and efficient manner, China introduced a
   series of policies of political accountability. When officials failed to
   implement prevention and control policies competently, they were quickly
   held politically accountable. Based on the institutional analysis and
   development framework and policy process theory, this paper constructs a
   theoretical analysis framework. With this foundation, we conduct a
   bibliometric visualisation and statistical analysis of China's political
   accountability policies. The findings show that: (1) the selected
   policies aimed at preventing and controlling COVID-19 followed a clear
   logic and structure leading to political accountability and were shaped
   by certain methods, paths, lists, implementation requirements, etc.; (2)
   the political accountability policies implemented in China were strict,
   broad, and timely; and (3) the practical measures included in the
   policies and the characteristics of political accountability were based
   on the integration of internal and external oversight by the party,
   innovative approaches to accountability and the establishment of
   accountability inventories. Our empirical results are useful for
   measuring and enforcing political accountability policies in China and
   contribute to the academic discussion in this field, providing a
   reference for political accountability in other countries.},

Abstract = {The German right-wing populist party ``Alternative for Germany{''} (AfD)
   opposes diverse family lifestyles by promoting the return to a family
   model of father, mother, and children. This ``Narrative of Return{''}
   paves the way for the party's anti-gender, anti-childlessness, and
   anti-immigration agendas. The article examines how narratives about
   families as promoted by AfD reflect or address experiences of the
   post-socialist transformation in East Germany. It turns out that
   Narratives of Return (NoR) overlook the elderly as acting individuals
   and disregard the ways they engage with their families, and how they
   continue to organize their lives autonomously in old age. NoR instead
   depict older people as an anonymous group of supposedly undeserving
   retired, who benefit from society and family without having any function
   in them. However, discourses on care for the family can be traced down
   to a micro-level that confirms how care for the family is, in fact, care
   for older people. The article presents two selected life stories of
   advanced-age East Germans to substantiate this claim. The life stories
   reveal that older people themselves believe in various notions of
   family, despite being served with NoR in recent past. Experiences in the
   former German Democratic Republic (GDR) even seem to prevent older
   people from again falling for totalizing schemes that order and
   prescribe uniform (family) experience. Consequently, it is not to be
   expected that NoR will succeed in closing discourses on care for the
   family easily.},

Title = {The Inner Dynamics of Moral Economies: The Case of Waste Management},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {321-338},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The article examines the internal dynamics and relationality of moral
   economies. It focuses on labor relations to understand how people find
   balance between collective moral frameworks and individual everyday
   acts. Drawing on ethnographic research among the Czech landfill workers
   during the neoliberalization of the waste industry in the 2010s, the
   article explores two spheres of waste management: the informal
   scavenging of landfill workers and the management of wastewater.
   Salvaging things via scavenging and management of wastewater provide two
   arenas for analyzing the ways people reason about the good, dignity, and
   justice while following their own goals. Using inspirations from the
   scholarship on moral economy and everyday ethics, the author argues that
   these two theoretical directions may benefit from the respective
   strengths of each other's approaches: a capacity to recognize patterns
   of moral reasoning behind struggles for dignity in an unequal world
   versus an actor-oriented situational sense of ethics growing from
   everyday life on the ground. The article points at a scalar reshaping of
   moral economies and brings attention to a morality that does not reflect
   only direct transactions but also more imaginative relations to distant
   others.},

   been driven by deliberate government interventions aimed at stimulating
   market creation and development. The interventions have involved the

   establishment, powers, and roles of the Monetary Authority of Singapore,
   Temasek Holdings, and the Development Bank of Singapore indicates
   significant motivations regarding the fitness-for-purpose of such
   organizations in fostering financial sector development. In doing so, it
   situates them in the wider context of government and governance, locally
   and internationally, in terms of their astutely influencing policy
   decisions and facilitating policy implementation as justification for
   their continuing to contribute to the country's economic and social

   interview series I conducted with 15 African feminist activists,
   policymakers, researchers and artists of diverse ages, genders,
   sexualities, ability and nationality in which they shared their visions,
   personal and institutional biographies and aspirations. It explores the
   intersections of feminist activism, knowledge production, solidarity and
   power dynamics in Africa and the African diaspora. The essay delves into
   how African feminists challenge existing power structures, including
   patriarchy, colonialism, racism, fundamentalisms, capitalism and
   heteronormativity. It emphasises the importance of feminist scholarship
   and activism in reshaping political economies and political ecologies
   and challenging the status quo. The piece discusses the lived
   experiences of African feminist social movements and their efforts to
   redefine social contracts.},

Abstract = {The rise of Jair Bolsonaro to power in 2018 in Brazil was considered a
   disruptive event characterized by the insurgence of far-right politics
   and their use of digital platforms to spread disinformation. This
   election was also marked by an unusual disparity in voting intentions
   between men and women for Bolsonaro, leading to the rise of the feminist
   movement named \#EleNao (\#NotHim). Despite its efforts, \#EleNao was,
   as it is well known, unable to defeat Bolsonaro. Considering these
   events, in light of discourse and intersectionality theories, this paper
   aims to discuss the regimes of truth (Foucault, 1971) regarding the
   intersection of gender, race, class, and religion (Collins, 2019) in the
   2018 runoff. The results show that the mobilization of controlling
   images (Collins, 2002) of feminism done by the far-right played a
   crucial role and was reinforced by the left's inability to provide a
   proposal that could address the needs of a wider public, especially
   evangelical women.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights the importance of local and individual context in
   either facilitating or hindering processes of integration for reunited
   refugee families settling in unchosen areas. It adds to understandings
   of integration by analyzing the day-to-day active and processual nature
   of place-making, from the perspective of families. The findings are
   based on qualitative interviews with 13 refugee families-21 parents and
   8 children aged between 12 and 18, who had recently been reunited in two
   large cities in the UK: Glasgow and Birmingham. The paper explores the
   local conditions families identified as conducive to settling in their
   local area and argues that the process of attaching to their new locales
   was mediated through the social connections they made. The article
   contributes to knowledge by demonstrating how families exercised agency
   and resilience in place-making in unchosen spaces, through the people
   they met and the relationships they developed. Further, it critiques the
   tendency to denigrate ``exclusive{''} bonding ties, particularly between
   co-ethnics and pays attention to the role of friendship in routes to
   belonging in unchosen spaces.},

Abstract = {International institutions are facing increasing criticism of the
   legitimacy of their authority. But what does it mean for an
   international institution to be legitimate? Arthur Applbaum's latest
   book provides a convincing new concept of legitimacy, namely, the
   power-liability view, and a new normative conception, the free group
   agent account. However, it is not clear how they can be applied to the
   international level. First, this paper examines how different concepts
   of legitimacy can be applied to international institutions. Second, it
   assesses three different conceptions of legitimacy, namely, the service
   conception, Applbaum's free group agent account and the autonomy-based
   conception for the international level. It outlines how on the last
   conception, international institutions' legitimacy depends on three
   different aspects required to protect autonomy: the political power of
   the institution; its purpose; and its relation to other institutions.
   Finally, the paper argues that the creation of an international
   institution should be seen as part of relational legitimacy and that
   state consent plays an important role to protect the political autonomy
   of peoples.},

Abstract = {This article argues that small oil-importing states are particularly
   adept at circumventing oil sanctions and leveraging them to further
   expand their own markets. It points to the unique advantages and
   necessary preconditions that make small states successful in their
   search for `sanctions busters' in the global oil market, especially when
   approaching countries that recently became oil exporters. Using
   declassified Israeli, British and US archival material, this article
   sheds light on how Israel capitalized on the 1973 Arab oil embargo to
   gain access to Ecuador's market through its oil sector, but failed to
   repeat this success in Norway and the United Kingdom.},

   Truth and Justice, I am wrestling with how to write about Palestine, at
   the same moment that I am contending with the media's erasure and
   dehumanisation of Palestinian life, in January 2023. And here I am
   again, on 19 October, 2023, with the proofs for this piece arriving in
   my inbox, while witnessing bombs rain down on Gaza; a second Nakba and
   genocide that has the world's full awareness and legitimacy. I wrote and

Abstract = {Political disagreement with family members can have a deleterious impact
   on familial relationships, but the long-term consequences are
   understudied. This study examined the relational outcomes of familial
   political incongruence two years after the 2019 social unrest in Hong
   Kong and the extent to which frequency and types of family contact
   explain their association. This two-wave questionnaire study augmented
   with a 14-day daily record of family contact recruited (1) young adults
   and (2) parents with children aged 18-30 (N = 559). Nearly half of the
   respondents reported significant political incongruence with their
   parents/children. We observed consistent findings in both adult children
   and parents. Greater parent-child political differences were associated
   with reduced likelihood of having positive family communication and
   family functioning. Increased political differences with family members
   were associated with greater odds of family dysfunctionality. Moreover,
   expression of love and care mediated the effect of political differences
   with family members on changes in family functioning. This study
   demonstrates familial political incongruence exerts an influence on
   families two years after the unrest. Parent-child political differences
   are associated with a decline in the quality of family communication and
   family environment. We discuss how parent-child political incongruence
   drives a family to worsened well-being through dysfunctional family
   dynamics.},

Abstract = {In his response, Manjeet S. Pardesi argues that global international
   relations and relational scholarship rooted in global history can learn
   much from each other and must work together to overcome Eurocentrism
   while avoiding other forms of `centrisms'. The second contribution by
   Zeynep Gulsah capan aims to underline three interrelated dynamics: space
   (global), time (history), and knowledge. In the third and final
   response, Musab Younis draws on Edward Said's critique of
   `counter-conversion' to suggest how anticolonial and postcolonial
   thinkers sought to create oppositional forms of knowledge while
   remaining alert, in ways not always replicated in recent writing, to the
   dangers of nativism.},

Abstract = {This article examines G. A. Cohen's endorsement of a hybrid ethical
   theory and its relationship to his critique of John Rawls's egalitarian
   liberalism. Cohen claimed that Rawls's appeal to special incentives was
   a distortion of his own difference principle. I argue that Cohen's
   acceptance of a personal prerogative (the central element of Samuel
   Scheffler's version of a hybrid ethical theory) has several untoward
   consequences. First, it illuminates how any reasonable challenge to
   Rawls's liberalism must recognise Thomas Nagel's arguments concerning
   the problems that arise when one attempts to implement a political
   theory analogous to a hybrid theory of ethics. Second, it undermines
   Cohen's critique of Rawls. Third, it undermines the plausibility of
   Cohen's ethos-driven social egalitarianism. The article concludes that,
   despite Nagel's concerns, the most plausible form of egalitarianism-one
   that can accommodate the requirements of a hybrid ethical theory-will be
   Rawlsian, rather than Cohen's ethos-based system.},

Abstract = {In framing themselves as myth-busters, historical IR scholars have
   inscribed the distinction between history and fiction into how they
   speak to the discipline. And yet, engagement with what this might mean
   for the status of historical knowledge has mostly focused on broad
   metatheoretical distinctions and debates. Against this, I argue that
   questions about historical knowledge and its status are best understood
   as contingent settlements in the research practice of writing history,
   pursuing specific questions and writing specific answers. Through an
   exploration of the early stages in the creation of the Iberian Empires
   in the fifteenth century and the chronicles that provide an account of
   it, the article seeks to make visible the negotiations and settlements
   involved in writing history along four aspects of the distinction
   between history and fiction: facticity, emplotment, genre and the
   situated politics of history.},

Abstract = {Despite many policies produced to mitigate racism and other forms of
   discrimination in the public education sector, the inability to
   implement these policies fall short. These policies may appear to
   address inequities by attempting to meet legal requirements, however,
   they do not always address the structural power dynamics grounded in
   white supremacy which continue to perpetuate systemic racism. Drawing on
   examples from the Ontario public education sector such as employment
   equity policies, Afrocentric Alternative Schools in the TDSB and the
   Student Resource Officer program in Toronto schools, I illustrate how
   positivist inspired ``evidence-based{''} policy processes fail at
   offering policy solutions for equity issues by ignoring those who do not
   fall into the purview of the economic and political interests of
   dominant stakeholders in the policy process. Deploying an anti-racist
   and anti-colonial framework, I examine the superficial attempts to
   garner inclusivity through equity policies that continually fail to heal
   the wounds of exclusion by reproducing multiple band-aid policies rather
   than formulating a restructuring of public education in the Ontario
   public education system that will allow equity seeking groups a place at
   the table.},

Pages = {1494-1515},

Abstract = {This article advances the literature on the spatial patterns of EU
   support by arguing that the relationship between regional inequality and
   EU trust is not linear. We posit that, to fully understand this
   relationship, we should systematically investigate three dimensions of
   regional inequality, i.e., regional wealth status, regional wealth
   growth, and regional wealth growth at different levels of wealth status.
   Using individual-level survey data for EU27 countries and the UK from 11
   Eurobarometer waves (2015-2019), we show that a non-linear association
   exists whereby poor and rich European regions tend to trust the EU more
   compared to middle-income regions, and that within-region over-time
   growth is associated with higher levels of EU trust. We demonstrate that
   the association between growth and EU trust is more pronounced among
   poor and middle-income regions compared to rich regions. Our findings
   have implications about the nature of public Euroscepticism and the ways
   in which to address it.},

Abstract = {A major Shi'i political system in the contemporary world is based on the
   theory of the `Guardianship of the Jurist' (velayat-e faqih). The theory
   maintains that the most senior Shi'i cleric, who is the deputy of the
   Hidden Imam, is not only the religious, legal, and judicial authority
   but should also be the head of an Islamic state. This article explores
   contemporary Shi'i Iranian cleric Ayatollah Yusuf Sanei's approach to
   this theory. The article demonstrates that Sanei was a pro-velayat-e
   faqih theorist following the birth of Islamic Republic, but came to
   criticise it after the rise of the Reformist Movement in Iran and the
   ascension of Mohammad Khatami to presidency until his death in 2020. The
   article argues that, as a reformist Shi.i scholar, Sanei challenged
   various aspects of the theory in the last two decades of his life. It
   concludes that, rather than being an anti-velayat-e faqih theorist,
   Sanei argues for a `conditional' guardianship theory since he considered
   the legitimacy of a system based on the velayat-e faqih to be heavily
   dependent on public consent rather than God's will.},

Abstract = {Objective/context: This article studies the appearance in 2014, and
   subsequent consolidation, of a center-periphery cleavage, in the sense
   of Lipset and Rokkan, in Colombia's voting pattern in national
   elections. Methodology: We performed a cluster analysis of the electoral
   results at the municipal level of the presidential runoffs and the 2016
   plebiscite. Conclusions: We show how increasingly marked geographical
   patterns are configured that oppose electoral behaviors of
   municipalities in the center and geographic periphery of the country. We
   also point out how we can specify the analysis of this cleavage through
   subcategories of electoral behaviors, to end with reflections on its
   nature and possible future evolution. Originality: The study draws
   attention to the importance of taking into account the center-periphery
   cleavage as a structural factor for understanding Colombian elections
   beyond particular circumstances, such as those that characterized the
   last electoral cycle of 2022.},

Title = {Local Government Taxing Power for Digital Consumption: A Case Study of
   Hotel, Restaurant, and Entertainment Taxes in Indonesia},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Limited tax collection authority in local self-governments hampers
   revenue generation in rural regions with smaller populations and limited
   commercial activity, while the growth of the digital economy further
   complicates tax collection for local governments. The objective of this
   study is to examine the challenges encountered by both the central and
   local tax administrations in Indonesia when implementing
   consumption-based taxation, especially in light of the increasing
   prevalence of digital transactions. The study reveals that the shift
   from traditional to digital transactions is likely to result in
   conflicting taxing rights between central and local governments. Local
   governments are typically entitled to a share of taxes on certain forms
   of consumption, such as accommodation, food delivery, and entertainment.
   However, the use of digital platforms to provide these services has
   significantly reduced the local government's share of tax revenue. This
   issue is exacerbated when the central tax administration, with its
   competitive advantage, administers the transaction alongside the broader
   value-added tax object. In addition to the unclear tax-sharing
   arrangement, the underlying problem consists in the inadequate coverage
   of all digital transactions, potentially leading to revenue leakage and
   double non-taxation.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen unprecedented interest in girls' activism, and
   yet our understanding of their politics is still limited. More broadly,
   children have largely been absent from International Relations
   scholarship, despite the centrality of childhood and our understandings
   of it to global politics. Where they have featured, it is often as
   victims of phenomena beyond their control, or as the perpetrators of
   crimes, but rarely as active subjects able to influence politics for the
   better. In this article, I review the emerging literature that aims to
   conceptualise girls' agency in global politics. I show the parallels
   between recent work in Girlhood Studies and in feminist and postcolonial
   IR, in exploring the potential for feminist activism within and against
   neoliberalism. Finally, I outline how a `transnational girlhoods'
   approach might enable feminist scholars to explore how girls across a
   range of different contexts are challenging inequalities},

Abstract = {What is the strategic logic of so-called `total defence'? At first
   glance, total defence may appear as one coherent strategic concept.
   Indeed, it was predominantly small, non-aligned states that pursued
   total defence during the Cold War. In this article, however, we
   demonstrate that depending on how `total war' is understood, there are
   subsequently different strategic logics ingrained in total defence. We
   show this by developing a typology of different total defences; and by
   empirically illustrating variation in strategic logics over time through
   a historical analysis of the total defence(s) in Sweden. Recognising the
   inherent variation of total defence is important since it helps us to
   understand that hidden behind a nominal pursuit of a total defence
   strategy are multifaceted strategies.},

Abstract = {There are growing calls to address the Eurocentrism of classical English
   School (ES) scholarship and to adopt more holistic frameworks of
   analysis, which include alternative, non-Western forms of international
   order and interactions with the European international systems. This
   article investigates Adam Watson's contribution to `decentring' the ES.
   Two dimensions of Watson's work speak to this objective. The first is
   his development of a more inclusive comparative historical sociological
   analysis of states-systems. The second is his development of a more
   generic concept of systems as complex, variegated and shifting
   relationships of authority, highlighting the prevalence of hierarchy and
   hegemony in states-systems. However, Watson's work remains inflected
   with Eurocentrism in several important respects. These include his
   narrative of the evolution of the contemporary states-system, which
   largely remains one of the autonomous development and expansion of
   Europe, and the limited ways in which his narrative includes the agency,
   voices and experiences of non-European peoples.},

Abstract = {The Democratic Republic of Congo hosts the longest-running and largest
   United Nations peacekeeping mission in history. The United Nations also
   has reckoned with sexual exploitation and abuse in its own ranks and, in
   2003, recognized its importance with a Bulletin which became known as
   the `zero tolerance policy'. Policymakers and researchers have paid
   little sustained attention, however, to children fathered by
   peacekeepers. In this article, we share the results of our mixed-methods
   SenseMaker (R) research with community members who interact with
   peacekeeping personnel and interviews with 58 women who are raising
   children fathered by peacekeepers. Despite the United Nations policies
   in place, most women did not report children fathered by peacekeepers
   and did not receive systematic support. The analysis reveals a large gap
   between the aspirations of the `zero tolerance policy' and its
   operationalization in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We uncovered
   deep poverty and insecurity as both driving and resulting from women's
   sexual encounters with peacekeepers, with support needs largely unmet.
   We argue that there is a lack of enforcement of the United Nations
   policies, jurisdictional complexity and inaccessible justice, as well as
   significant gaps between the United Nations' approach to investigating
   and supporting children fathered by peacekeepers and the expectations of
   mothers, resulting in worsened life conditions for mothers and their
   children.},

Abstract = {The understanding of resilience, and how the ability to respond or
   adjust to new situations can be implemented and evaluated, gained
   prominence in public policy. This study examines how European Union (EU)
   member states plan to support cultural and creative sectors (CCSs)
   within the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) of the
   NextGenerationEU Program and how they plan the CCSs to contribute to the
   grand challenges of our time. Using mixed methods, it is found that the
   understanding of how structural deficiencies in CCSs can be addressed is
   not systematic and not all countries invest to make the cultural
   infrastructure more future-proof. Neither the budgets nor the mode of
   resilience (absorption, adaptation, and transformation) exposed in the
   plans consistently correlates with how countries intend to address key
   impact pillars. Countries with larger CCSs are more prone to
   transformation. The theoretical contribution lies in the elaboration of
   the concept of ``ex ante resilience.{''}},

   Pedagogical Critique},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the pedagogical implications of the ``Global
   International Relations (GIR){''} and ``Worlding Beyond the West{''}
   agendas. These two programs have criticized IR's Western-centrism and
   offered systematic ways to expand beyond IR's Euro-Atlantic roots. Their
   development coincides with other high-profile theoretical and
   historiographic developments, not to mention societal imperatives, to
   expand the substantive remit of the discipline. However, the
   diversification agenda has been mostly concerned with the research
   output of IR and has treated the pedagogical side of IR's intellectual
   life as a secondary consideration. Proponents of the GIR and Worlding
   agendas have yet to convert these programs into a classroom pedagogy.
   This paper fills that gap. It critiques the practical and intellectual
   limits of GIR and Worlding pedagogies. More importantly, it provides
   theoretically informed ways to transpose their diversification projects
   into the undergraduate classroom. In doing so, this paper bridges
   disciplinary analysis, IR theory, and IR pedagogy in an integrated
   analysis of IR's much-needed attempts at diversification.},

Abstract = {We examine the implications of anti-statist populist leaders'
   inattention to competence and service delivery, and their embrace of a
   particular form of dysfunctional politics: government shutdowns. This
   paper explores the effects of US government shutdowns on agency policy
   implementation and personnel and using survey data from several hundred
   thousand federal employees. The first study gauges the effect of the
   2018-2019 shutdown on specific elements of agency policy implementation.
   The results suggest that shutdowns, as a type of shock associated with
   anti-statist politics, undermine the quality of government in the eyes
   of those closest to the work. The second and third studies consider the
   effect of shutdowns on employee morale, using the 2013, and 2018-2019
   shutdown. While our findings indicate that the 2013 shutdown wrought
   durable negative impacts on the morale of shutdown agency personnel,
   that event appears to have prepared agencies to absorb any negative
   morale impacts in the 2018-2019 shutdown. Our study shows both the
   immediate and long-term dynamics of government shutdowns on policy
   implementation and the administrative workforce.},

Abstract = {How should we deliberate with citizens who entertain post-truth beliefs
   in democratic societies? This is a central question for those interested
   in wielding the epistemic potential of democratic deliberation against
   post-truth. Yet, the strength of proposed deliberative solutions depends
   on the accuracy with which post-truth is diagnosed. Taking seriously the
   connection between epistemic diagnosis and deliberative remedy, this
   paper looks at the motivations provided by non-vaccinating parents for
   their beliefs and argues for an understanding of post-truth as misplaced
   distrust in testimony, as against a standard view of post-truth as
   indifference to fact. Second, the paper argues this new diagnosis of
   post-truth renders ineffective deliberative strategies aiming to harness
   the power of impersonal reason and accuracy, of the kind recently
   defended by Simone Chambers. Instead, combating post-truth as the paper
   defines it is effectively accomplished through employing bridging
   rhetoric.},

Abstract = {Recent innovation research in the public sector demonstrates the
   advantages of collaborative innovation, but also recognizes the complex
   character of collaborative innovation processes. These complexities
   might both stimulate and hinder collaborative innovation. Through a
   qualitative comparative analysis of empirical data from 19
   public-private innovation partnerships (PPIs) in five European
   Countries, we show how particular types of complexity leadership (i.e.,
   generative leadership and administrative leadership) act on these
   complexities in PPIs to produce highly innovative services. The results
   show that small partnerships use generative leadership in the presence
   of network complexities, and administrative leadership in the absence of
   network complexities to produce highly innovative services. However,
   large partnerships only use generative leadership, while abandoning
   administrative leadership, to produce highly innovative services. These
   findings bring about theoretical and practical insights as to how
   various forms of complexity leadership might be employed in varying
   contexts of partnership complexity.},

Abstract = {The mutiny and death of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Russia's Wagner
   Group paramilitary outfit, has created great uncertainty about how
   Russia will manage paramilitary organisations going forward. Wagner has
   played a key role in expanding Russian influence in the Middle East and
   Africa at relatively low cost, while keeping official casualty counts
   limited in Ukraine and Syria in particular. The group or some version of
   it, whether unified or fragmented, will likely continue to operate,
   probably under stronger control of the Russian Ministry of Defence, but
   with a continuing role for one or more oligarchs.},

Abstract = {Has the Committee of the Regions (CoR) any role in the EU's foreign
   policy? We conceptualize the CoR as an EU para-diplomatic actor, and we
   explore the evolving and multi-faceted role of the CoR in the European
   Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) by employing a two-fold approach: first, from
   an institutional perspective, we examine the role, capacity, and limits
   of the CoR's engagement. Second, from a functional dimension, we
   investigate the added value of the CoR's initiatives in the ENP and the
   EU foreign policy more generally. We show that the CoR has managed to
   expand its room for manoeuvre acting `below the radar' by establishing
   communication channels and promoting subtle ways of mediation,
   especially in conflicts of high intensity whereby the EU and national
   authorities fail to deliver. Our findings contribute to the more
   comprehensive understanding of both the EU foreign policy and the CoR's
   positioning in the EU institutional architecture.},

Title = {When bargaining is and is not possible: the politics of bureaucratic

Abstract = {In looking at the complex relationship between expertise and power in
   policymaking, what is amiss are studies on how the expertise exchange
   bargain between politicians and bureaucracy works in practice,
   especially in antidemocratic contexts. To deal with this limitation, we
   use Christensen's (Christensen, J. (2022). When bureaucratic expertise
   comes under attack. Public Administration) expertise bargain change
   model for examining the authority transaction between politicians and
   bureaucrats. Upon external shocks, such as democratic backsliding with
   the sidelining of policy advice, the extant expertise bargain is
   challenged. We explore how the bureaucracy acted toward the government's
   adversarial (and even antagonistic) stance and how that relationship
   toward the expertise bargain changed in two policy areas in Brazil
   (health and environment) during Bolsonaro's administration (2019-2022).
   Notably, this article relies mainly on qualitative data from in-depth
   interviews with bureaucrats who provided expertise to the government on
   these policy areas during the Bolsonaro administration's transition.
   Ancillary documentary sources were examined to detail the strategies of
   attack from government toward bureaucratic expertise and ancillary
   documentary sources of quantitative data from a survey with bureaucrats
   fielded during the Bolsonaro administration's first year. Results show
   three factors that condition bureaucratic expertise's resilience: the
   nature of the attack (local or extensive), the knowledge base's and
   epistemic community's level of cohesion, and the advice system's degree
   of institutionalization. This case study sheds light on how different
   policy advice arrangements respond and function under antidemocratic
   contexts, allowing the application and enrichment of policy expertise
   literature outside regular democratic politics.},

Abstract = {A thorny debate persists as to the causes of the attacks that affected
   France since 2015. One view is that France is being attacked because of
   the secular and liberal values it embodies. According to a second
   thesis, France is attacked in response to its interventionist foreign
   policy. Our contribution proposes to respond to this debate via a
   behavioral, statistical and comparative analysis of attacks in the name
   of the Islamic State around the world from 2013 to 2019. Our analyses
   reveal that countries with liberal values (right to blasphemy, tradition
   of press caricature, and tolerance of homosexuality) are on average not
   subject to an increased number of attacks. Conversely, countries
   involved in air strikes in Iraq or Syria are significantly more
   affected. A temporal analysis confirms the causal effect of military
   strikes on attacks, and not the opposite effect.},

   migration during COVID-19 in Italy},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 24},
Abstract = {Since the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, migrants' mobility has been
   increasingly securitised as governments have been adopting extraordinary
   measures to close both external and internal borders. Similarly, the
   presence of migrants within countries has often been met with lower
   levels of acceptance, leading to the implementation of discriminatory
   and xenophobic measures. Although debates on the securitisation of
   migration are well established in the literature, this article
   demonstrates how the securitisation of migration during the COVID-19
   pandemic has relied on gendered and racialised notions deeply entrenched
   in the legacy of colonial modernity. Examining newspaper articles and
   declarations by Italian prominent politicians, this contribution shows
   how this process has happened through 4 main discursive frames imbued
   with racial and gendered assumptions: 1) the virus as a foreign threat;
   2) migrants as diseased bodies; 3) migrants as a burden; 4) migrants as
   racialised hypermasculine bodies.},

Abstract = {Recent literature has identified a new avenue for approaching peace in
   the post-peace agreement sphere: agonistic peace. While much of the
   nascent scholarship on agonistic peace includes mentions of gender, the
   link between agonistic peace and gender has yet to be clarified. This
   paper fills this gap in the literature in three critical ways. First, it
   demonstrates the shared importance in both certain strands of feminist
   theory and agonistic theory of anti-essentialism, intersectionality, and
   plurality. Second, it argues that agonistic peace's emphasis on
   transforming existing hegemonies through non-violent contestation must
   include a focus on addressing patriarchal patterns of oppression.
   Finally, through the empirical example of Colombia's Truth Commission,
   it demonstrates the ways in which a post-agreement examination of gender
   can serve as a tool for identifying agonistic peace practices in
   empirical cases.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {287-308},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to explore the role of perceived organizational
   injustice (POI) leading to workplace conflict in determining
   organizational performance (OP) among healthcare employees. This paper
   also examines the serial mediating effects of moral disengagement (MD)
   and knowledge hiding (KH). Design/methodology/approachIn all, 244 public
   and private hospital employees in Pakistan provided the data set.
   FindingsAccording to partial least squares-structural equation modeling
   findings, the negative association between POI and OP was serially
   mediated by KH and MD. The recovery process underlying the linkage
   between POI and OP is tested and highlighted in this paper as a first
   step in unraveling it. Research limitations/implicationsThe findings
   highlight the significance of taking moral and KH models into account
   when attempting to understand the moral cognitive processes that
   employees go through when they see injustice. Organizations should
   guarantee the equitable distribution of incentives and resources, as
   distributive and procedural justices are concerned with organizations.
   Originality/valueBy directing actions meant to prevent MD and KH, the
   findings may potentially inspire new, more focused treatments to
   safeguard patient safety and avoid losses in the healthcare industry.
   One way to reduce unethical conduct and MD is to have people declare or
   agree to a code of ethics.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between policy compliance, the
   emergence of alternate epistemes and authorities in online spaces, and
   the decline of trust and legitimacy in democratic institutions. Drawing
   on insights from public policy, regulation theory, and political theory,
   the paper critically engages with scholarship on ``policy-takers{''} to
   illuminate the tensions of compliance and legitimacy in liberal states.
   It proposes a compliance-legitimacy matrix that identifies the features
   of policy compliance-including consent, legitimacy, expertise, and
   trust-and their relationship to the disaggregation of policy knowledge.
   The article applies this framework to a case study of social media posts
   that respond to policy information during the management of the Covid-19
   pandemic in Australia. Through analysis of these posts, the study
   reveals the distrust in ``the science{''} and experts advocated by
   government and the calls from skeptic groups for noncompliance with
   public health measures. The paper argues that public policy faces an
   epistemic crisis of public confidence, with significant downstream
   consequences for compliance with public policy initiatives that has been
   brought on both by the failures of states to cultivate trust in science
   and the government. The compliance-legitimacy matrix offers a useful
   tool for policymakers to anticipate and address objections from
   policy-takers and to preempt and diffuse their fears.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 constitutes an unprecedented exogenous shock for democratic
   political systems across the globe. During this turbulent period, Italy
   and Israel have also experienced a government crisis. Building upon the
   ``coalition life cycle{''} and the ``critical events{''} approaches to
   government stability, this article explores the trajectories of the
   government crises in Italy and Israel in times of COVID-19. The article
   examines the impact of the cabinets' structural attributes and the
   pandemic in relation to the governments' early termination. In both
   countries, the oversized coalition configuration of the cabinets led to
   conflicts between the governing parties, which became untenable during
   the pandemic crisis, thus precipitating the governments' collapse.},

Title = {Classified and Secret: Understanding the Literature on Diversity in the
   Intelligence Sector},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Intelligence services are important sites of contestation, often the
   foci of reform and calls for greater transparency. Yet, while growing
   attention has been paid to intersectionality, gender equality reform,
   and progress in other areas of international affairs, little of this
   same transparency and attention has been paid to diversity in the
   intelligence sector. This paper seeks to bridge the gap, comprising a
   systematic review of the literature on diversity in the intelligence
   sector to improve our understanding of what is known and what can be
   known about the history and current make-up of the intelligence
   sector-and those who ``do intelligence work{''}. By identifying
   strengths and gaps in the literature and setting an agenda for future
   research within these ``secret institutions{''}, this paper argues that
   the lack of transparency, data, and knowledge on the interplay of
   gender, race, and sexuality, among other aspects of diversity in
   intelligence, is deeply troubling. It hampers our knowledge of how the
   sector may be ``gendered{''} or otherwise experienced, as well as how
   this particular area of the security sector may or may not be
   integrating gender and other perspectives into their work. This paper
   finds that diversity in the intelligence and national security sectors
   is both an asset and a liability to be managed. Diversity is seen as a
   source of intelligence gathering and analysis strength, as well as a
   potential threat to hegemonic masculinity in intelligence practice.
   Further, language and processes for promoting diversity in intelligence
   can reinforce stereotyped knowledge of marginalized groups that
   ultimately hamper calls for greater representation, diversity,
   inclusion, access, and opportunities in the intelligence sector.},

Abstract = {This article examines the crucial role of subnational actors in the
   diffusion of policy change at the international level, illustrated by
   the creation of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
   First, the concept of interlevel mobility, which combines the two-level
   game theory and policy entrepreneurship literature, is introduced.
   Second, the paper explores how subnational actors navigate between the
   national, international, and transnational levels, exerting influence
   and placing their preferences on the political agenda. This research
   contributes to a more robust theoretical understanding of policy
   entrepreneurship, provides new insights into the origins of IRENA, and
   offers valuable guidance for policymakers seeking to foster change, by
   linking policy change at the international level with subnational
   actors.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A key question of public sector innovation (PSI) scholarship is: which
   factors influence innovation? This paper focuses on managerial practices
   as drivers of PSI and addresses two research questions. First, how have
   the main types of managerial reforms-pertaining to marketization,
   results-orientation, and collaboration-influenced PSI? Second, how have
   different features of public sector reform strategies influenced PSI?
   Using survey data from 19 European countries, we show that reforms
   focusing on collaboration and results-orientation facilitate PSI, while
   marketization-type reforms have no significant impact. Our study
   indicates that reforms initiated by public administration (rather than
   politicians) are more conducive to PSI. We also show that reforms that
   are crisis-driven and reforms oriented toward cost cutting have negative
   impacts on PSI. Overall, our findings demonstrate that New Public
   Governance-type reforms exert more positive influence on PSI than
   NPM-type reforms.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the Ukrainian Revolution on Granite from two
   perspectives-on one hand as a starting point for Ukraine's independence
   aspirations, and on the other as a prototype for subsequent Ukrainian
   revolutions. This Revolution constitutes an example of an event whose
   significance was discovered many years later. Although it was partially
   successful, and more importantly it should be treated as one of the
   milestones on the road to Ukraine's independence, until the second
   decade of the twenty-first century it was assigned a marginal
   significance and almost ignored as a research subject. This article
   searches for the basic factors of the Revolution's success, based on the
   methodology provided by civil resistance theory and thus concentrating
   on its internal factors, especially on its objectives, the strategy, and
   methods of struggle. One of the main purposes was to analyze the sources
   of experiences from which the leaders of the protests drew. The
   Revolution on Granite is also presented as the inaugural event of a new
   chapter in the tradition of protests in Ukraine by introducing new
   elements. Although the later protests, especially the Orange Revolution
   (2003) and the Euromaidan (2013-2014), received inspiration from many
   symbols and experiences of other countries, the thread of the Ukrainian
   tradition became permanent, even though it was subject to changes},

Abstract = {While a large literature interrogates the causes and consequences of
   declining political trust in democracies, considerably less work has
   considered the everyday leadership strategies that might arrest this
   trend. I tackle this gap as I ask: what can politicians do to build
   trust? Going beyond the performance perspective current in political
   science, I suggest that all politicians can build trust by (1)
   increasing occasions for political contact and (2) utilising authentic
   political communication. These arguments are developed out of interviews
   with national politicians in five democracies (N = 51) and tested
   empirically with observational and experimental survey data gathered
   from a longitudinal sample of the UK public (N = 705). Attesting to
   academic work on the contact hypothesis and `authentic trust', as well
   as the testimony of politicians themselves, these analyses suggest that
   both strategies carry appraisive potential. These findings contribute
   conceptually and practically to our understanding of both trust and
   leadership in politics.},

Abstract = {This article addresses weaknesses in critical policy studies (CPS), by
   proposing we move toward adopting radical critical policy studies (RCPS)
   theory and empirical methodological approaches. This moves away from the
   euro-centric colonized/colonizer dichotomy, decentering whiteness/white
   gaze and situates racialized personhood at the center of decolonizing
   knowledge production. RCPS' intervention forces racialized
   academics/researchers to be cognizant of how although we navigate our
   own oppression/colonization within colonial institutions (academia, the
   state) we are not immune to reproducing this same system of harm we wish
   to dismantle by using Colonial Logics (the colonizers tool of whiteness,
   performative colonialism, systemic oppression and harmful practices) and
   engaging in Colonial by Proxy (see Diagram 5). We expand on RCPS with
   the concept of Decolonizing Self-Reflexivity and
   Positionality/Social-Location (Diagram 3, Decolonizing Self-Reflexivity
   and Positionality \& Social-Location Checklist tool) with the aim to
   hold ourselves accountable to higher standards, to be more critically
   self-aware of the complex duality of our privileged
   social-location/positionality, while de-colonizing our self-reflexivity
   with an active duty to prevent the reproduction of systemic performative
   colonialism throughout policy-making (as policy-makers) or in academia.},

Abstract = {The late David P. Calleo was a long-standing contributing editor to
   Survival and one of the most original and multifaceted scholars of his
   generation. An American himself, he became known as a critic of US
   imperial overstretch, arguing that the US hegemonic role threatened the
   equilibrium of both the world system and the American domestic political
   economy. Yet his critique embedded a deep appreciation for America's
   early post-war engagements, especially in Europe. He believed Europe
   needed more centralised diplomatic and military structures to cultivate
   greater strategic autonomy, while the US system of centralised federal
   hegemony was increasingly dysfunctional - in effect, that Europe needed
   to become more like America, and America more like Europe. Calleo warned
   against the pitfalls of the triumphalist `unipolar' world view,
   including the rapid enlargement of NATO with scant regard for Russian
   interests.},

Abstract = {In this article I consider religion in international political
   scholarship and suggest a study of its epistemological politics and
   conceptual history. I argue that scholarship which strives to `engage'
   or `recognize' religion in global politics remain ignorant of the costs
   involved. Building on this argument, I ask if the troubles with
   recognizing religion reflect more basic qualities of recognition
   scholarship. Following the work by Jacques Ranciere, Patchen Markell,
   Elizabeth Povinelli, and Jens Bartelson I argue that recognition has two
   faces and that along with its frequently acknowledged empowering aspect,
   it also comes with costs. In order to assess the costs of recognition I
   propose a study of its conditions of possibility, that is, a study of
   the ways in which the subjects of recognition become recognizable as
   such. In the final section of the paper, I apply this to the example of
   religion in global politics and the formation of the Muslim subject in
   the lead-up to the partition of British India and the founding of
   Pakistan.},

Abstract = {Indonesia has established regulations on the implementation of land
   e-certificate. Unfortunately, the policy has not been able to provide
   real protection for the people, in this case the holders of land rights
   and other interested parties. This study aims to analyze the
   significance of the blockchain implementation as a security system for
   land e-certificate that generate further implications such as the ease
   of doing business and investment index. This study is a legal study with
   comparative approach. The comparison used cases of Ghana and Germany as
   examples. The results of the study show that Indonesia should create a
   blockchain system, like in Germany, which regulates the provision of
   business and investment guarantees as the outcome of policy
   implementation. The policy on blockchain must formulate norms that
   guarantee the determination of the legal status of land owners of land
   right and interested parties.},

Abstract = {Radical realists criticise the role that moral intuitions play in
   moralist political philosophy. However, radical realists may also rely
   on certain epistemic intuitions when making use of their theories of
   ideology critique. Hence, one might wonder whether radical realists'
   criticism of moralists' intuition-dependence is hypocritical. Call this
   the intuition asymmetry objection. My aim in this article is to show
   that the intuition asymmetry objection fails. After examining the basis
   of objections by radical realists to the role of moral intuitions in
   moralist political philosophy, I show that the presence of intuitions in
   radical realist theories of ideology critique is consistent with their
   criticism of moralism.},

Title = {Contesting State Monologues: Indigenous Grassroots' Struggles with Prior
   Consultation Norms in the Peruvian Amazon},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Prior consultation (PC) has been an internationally enshrined norm for
   indigenous peoples' rights since the 1980s. Indigenous peoples have
   called for PC for decades, but when governments finally begin
   implementation, a paradox results: previous advocates increasingly turn
   away from consultation processes. I argue that only with the perspective
   that norms are and should be contested ``on the ground,{''} we are able
   to understand this contradiction. Therefore, the article presents a new
   conceptual and methodological interpretive framework for studying
   indigenous grassroots contestation. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in
   the Peruvian Amazon (2013-2016), I hone in on three layers of
   contestation-explicit contestation, attitudes and perceptions, and
   political implications-and demonstrate that (1) non-contestation
   confirms state monologues and is an alarming sign for silenced voices,
   not for norm support; (2) contested consultations reproduce asymmetries
   within indigenous groups replicating negotiations about extractive
   industry projects; and (3) opposition to consultation may be the most
   powerful tool for indigenous peoples to change narrow state
   interpretations and make use of veto rights. Scaling up these insights,
   the structure of PC accommodates two irreconcilable understandings: PC
   is either interpreted as an end in itself or as a means of indigenous
   self-determination.},

   non-treaty-based GGBs constitute a truly novel type of governance body,
   distinct from traditional treaty-based international organizations
   (IOs)? How do the distinctive features of GGBs affect their role in
   global governance? To what extent are GGB's patterns of emergence and
   development specific to policy sectors? This article tackles these
   questions, drawing on an original dataset on GGBs in five distinct
   policy areas (banking and finance, energy, global health, Internet, and
   migration policy). We combine a micro-organizational perspective with a
   meso-level network approach to unpack the main features of
   non-treaty-based GGBs vis-a-vis, traditional IOs. Our results provide
   support to the general expectation that non-treaty-based GGBs offer
   distinctive opportunities for global governance with respect to
   traditional IOs. However, importantly, this relationship is not
   dichotomous. We find that GGBs exist on a continuum of fit-to-purpose
   designs ranging from hard, formal, and intergovernmental models to a
   soft, informal, and multistakeholder-based form of governance. Lastly,
   we also find notable variations across policy areas, where global health
   stands out given its decentralized network structure.},

Abstract = {Member states use implementation to preserve core state powers, such as
   fiscal policy, vis-a-vis the European Union (EU), by choosing whether to
   adopt stricter or looser rules than the EU requires. However, these
   choices and their reasons when the EU extends its fiscal competences are
   understudied. We theorise how the interplay of uploading and downloading
   factors might lead member states to customise EU fiscal policy according
   to their preferences, if their capacity allows it. Using fuzzy-set
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis, we study the customisation of six
   rules of the Fiscal Compact in France, Germany and Italy in 2012 (N =
   18). Member states exercised `opposition through the back door' when
   uploading outcomes did not reflect their preferences and did not provide
   a credible deterrent. More often, however, member states as
   `customisers' acted as especially ambitious problem-solvers or signalled
   compliance, when uploading outcomes reflected their preferences or
   provided a credible enforcement threat.},

Abstract = {Under freedom of information (FOI) regulations, public officials are
   pressured to grant citizens access to public information by responding
   to citizen information requests. However, despite FOI regulations,
   information requests are treated with varying bureaucratic attention,
   resulting in a high number of ignored or overdue requests by public
   organizations. Focusing on this bureaucratic discrimination, this study
   aims to explain the determinants of varying bureaucratic responsiveness
   to citizen information requests. Responsiveness in this case is
   therefore either a successful response to the request, a refusal to
   respond to the request, or no response at all (i.e., the request is
   ignored). By drawing on public accountability, and thus a citizen-driven
   model of bureaucratic responsiveness, we shed light on the human aspect
   behind responsiveness to information requests. This research argues that
   the request's topic as an accountability-seeking indicator and the
   communication tone as an indicator for underlying emotions influence
   responsiveness. The results from applying text mining and text analysis
   techniques, such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis, on over
   100,000 citizen information requests filed via a German online FOI
   platform support these assumptions.},

Abstract = {In the context of limited state capacity and a politicized public
   administration, democratic backsliding tends to exploit preexisting
   deficiencies in the functioning of the public sector. Whereas staffing
   managerial positions with regime supporters is well-documented, less
   attention has been paid to the structuring and staffing of street-level
   bureaucracies under a spoils system. In this article, we use document
   analysis and in-depth interviews to analyze the case of Mexico's
   ``Servants of the Nation{''} -a group of more than 19,000 former party
   members and sympathizers hired by the government to perform street-level
   tasks- as an example of ``parabureaucracy{''}: an auxiliary street-level
   organization designed to perform a wide variety of tasks directly
   related to the executive's political agenda. We argue that
   parabureaucracies are designed to sideline formal administrative command
   structures for the benefit of the government in power but may also serve
   as a means to bypass stifled and dysfunctional traditional
   bureaucracies.},

Abstract = {Following the devastation of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul by the
   Islamic State, various foreign actors launched initiatives to
   reconstruct the heritage sites of the city. However, such efforts are
   underpinned by assumptions about how local people value their heritage,
   how they perceive its destruction, whether they view reconstruction as a
   priority and the extent to which they support foreign-led efforts to
   rebuild their heritage. This article holds these assumptions up to
   empirical scrutiny via an original survey of 1600 Mosul residents and
   their attitudes towards heritage. The results hold four key implications
   for current and future heritage projects in Mosul, namely that while
   residents want to see heritage sites reconstructed, they prefer that
   heritage reconstruction not be privileged over humanitarian aid,
   development and peace building; includes the rebuilding of their local
   religious sites as much as iconic and/or non-religious sites and
   transforms sites into new and more useful structures to the community,
   and while they acknowledge the work of foreign actors, they want agency
   and control over the future of their heritage. The article concludes by
   noting that such findings hold important implications for future
   foreign-led heritage projects in (post-)conflict environments where mass
   human suffering and heritage destruction has taken place.},

Abstract = {Why do states engage in violence against marginalized social groups?
   State violence is typically explained as a calculated response to
   dissent or as a means of preventing dissent. However, many instances of
   state violence against members of marginalized groups appear to be
   unconnected to dissent or anti-state mobilization. We examine this
   dimension of state violence and connect it to control of the government
   by nationalist political parties and the preferences of their voting
   bases. We argue that governments in which nationalist parties hold
   substantial influence are more likely to adopt policies that lead to
   abuse. Such policies include more aggressive policing of immigrants and
   ethnic minorities, and lax oversight and punishment of agencies
   responsible for policing. To test our argument, we examine the
   Ill-Treatment and Torture data, which record allegations of state
   violence and also information about the victim's identity. We find that
   states with nationalist governments are more frequently accused of abuse
   against marginalized groups. Our results suggest that, rather than
   constraining abusive behavior through electoral accountability, the
   public in democratic countries sometimes prefer leaders who create a
   more abusive environment for marginalized groups.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the central government's response to the Covid-19 crisis
   during the first wave in Spain, the article analyses the executive's
   strategy of power concentration, and the factors that shape its
   implementation. We sketch how the crisis erupted, the main measures and
   strategies adopted by the national executive, the role of the experts,
   and the interaction with other political actors and institutions. We
   also explore the second phase and how the political reaction evolved
   towards a more consensual approach. Paradoxically, the consequences for
   the political actors were apparently less harmful than expected, since
   the governments did not lose political support, and the electorate
   continued to support the policy measures adopted to mitigate the
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {This article identifies a mechanism through which multiparty mediation -
   mediation with multiple active third parties - has positive effects on
   civil war resolution. Balanced mediation efforts - those providing third
   parties biased toward both sides of the dispute - have unique advantages
   in generating peaceful outcomes. In particular, balanced efforts
   alleviate the commitment concerns faced by both the rebel group and the
   government, improving the prospects for peace. In this article, I
   develop a measure, Mediation balance, which aggregates the mediators'
   biases when multiple third parties are present. I also consider, both
   theoretically and empirically, how the number of mediators interacts
   with mediation balance to shape outcomes. I test my theory on civil war
   mediation attempts between 1989 and 2005, finding that balanced
   mediation efforts improve the probability of reaching an agreement.
   Furthermore, the strength of this effect is influenced by the number of
   mediators involved. Mediation balance also influences the probability
   the agreement halts the violence, albeit in unexpected ways.},

Abstract = {This paper asks what explains the creation and comparative features of
   national Investment Screening Mechanisms (ISMs) in Europe. After
   providing a brief history and definition of ISMs, we provide descriptive
   patterns about the similarities and differences in the investment
   screening features of national ISMs in EU member states. We then explain
   differences in national screening policies by focusing on the role of
   public debt, Chinese investment, R\&D expenditures and various
   geographic groupings. Finally, we make three policy arguments about the
   rise of ISMs in Europe: (1) ISMs have not been designed as protectionist
   instruments, (2) the politics of inward investment screening reflects a
   shift from economic to security logic in addressing the fundamental
   tension between the benefits and vulnerabilities of open markets and (3)
   the EU can use the `commercialisation' of security to extend its own
   competence in the security sphere. We conclude by considering how the
   rapid expansion of investment screening in Europe could affect economic
   openness, as well as the role of the EU as a global actor.},

Abstract = {Consistency in crisis communication is a key aspect of effective
   political leadership during crises, but can be difficult in multilevel
   systems due to the number of leaders and fragmentation of policymaking
   powers. The literature on multilevel governance suggests that
   centralisation enhances consistency in crisis communication while
   decentralisation leads to inconsistency. Consistency in crisis
   communication is also expected to depend on whether leaders coordinate
   crisis management. Comparing crisis communication in Germany, Italy, and
   the United Kingdom during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, this
   paper shows that centralisation does not automatically lead to
   consistent crisis communication. At the same time, decentralised
   decision making does not necessarily undermine consistency. Overall,
   crisis communication tends to be more consistent when leaders coordinate
   crisis management.},

Abstract = {How Israelis and Palestinians see the conflict between both groups and
   its eventual solution? Based on 38 in-depth interviews with Israeli and
   Palestinian political leaders, the article analyzes the Palestinian
   choice of the two-state solution as the best way to bring an end to the
   Israeli occupation of 1967. The article then explores the Israeli policy
   of annexation of the West Bank and the entrenchment of apartheid-a
   one-state reality of unequal rights from the river to the sea. While the
   Israeli interviewed attempt to normalize this one-state reality, the
   Palestinians oppose these attempts of normalization and perceive the
   emerging debate on the need to reconsider the two-state solution as part
   of Israel's efforts to normalize the facts on the ground. Finally, the
   article explores the particular position of the Palestinians in Israel,
   who were not part of the national project of Palestinian statehood and
   hence developed their own future vision, based on equal citizenship. The
   article concludes that more research is needed on this particular group.},

Abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) demonstrate an integration of
   development and environmental agendas. However, none of the
   environmental sub-targets, which were due by 2020, were accomplished.
   Global governance through goal setting requires functioning mechanisms
   of accountability. Based on a theoretical framework that differentiates
   between public, private and voluntary logic of accountability, the
   article illustratively explores accountability mechanisms concerning the
   UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This allows to discuss the
   untapped potential for holding power wielders, such as governments,
   private companies, and norm champions, accountable. While the SDGs were
   adopted within public governance institutions, there are regulative
   means of accountability available that follow private and voluntary
   logic. Acknowledging this hybrid character of accountability in the
   implementation stage, the article concludes that there is a need for
   additional research to explore dimensions of non-public accountability
   for goals agreed upon by the international community. SDG indicators
   should be mandatory for corporate reporting, and civil society
   organisations should report more comprehensively on the spread of
   environmental norms in global development.},

Abstract = {Decades of social science research on human rights has mapped the
   conditions under which states sign and ratify treaties, abide by their
   conditions, and promote or criticize human rights in other states. Some
   norms contained in the core human rights treaties, particularly civil
   and political rights, are seen by authoritarian states as politically
   threatening. Autocracies can reshape human rights through international
   institutions and seek to change their content over time. This article
   investigates China's engagement in the UN Human Rights Council, focusing
   on both the content and practices of the People's Republic of China's
   approach. In terms of content, it examines China's voting record to
   determine the issues it prioritizes. In terms of practices, it
   identifies four modes of pursuing normative change: mobilizing
   like-mindedness, implied coercion, tactical deception, and repression of
   critical voices. These modes capture a range of activity in and around
   multilateral institutions, some of which usually does not draw scholarly
   attention in studies of normative change. The findings provide insights
   into the future of human rights norms in the United Nations and beyond.},

Abstract = {Established theory views military innovation as extraordinarily
   difficult, resulting in painful if infrequent revolutionary
   transformations. This article presents a divergent view, in which
   military innovation occurs progressively in an evolutionary fashion.
   Drawing on New Institutionalism and the Sociology of Science and
   Technology, we explore processes of professional debate and
   consensus-building among military officers, which can lead to
   evolutionary innovation. Examining the future application of artificial
   intelligence to command-and-control in the Australian Army, we find that
   officer attitudes to automation are rooted in shared experience of
   existing digitisation programmes, creating an emergent consensus over
   the evolutionary trajectory of future military innovation.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights the perspectives of defence workers regarding a
   Just Transition of their industry, one of the most environmentally
   harmful sectors in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, pollution
   and use of non-renewable resources. It is based on (i) interviews with
   defence sector workers in the United States and the United Kingdom
   (n58); and (ii) focus groups with key representatives of national and
   international labour unions, defence companies and relevant NGOs (n18).
   Some of these defence workers and their trade union representatives
   envisioned a transformational path towards sustainability, including
   converting the defence sector to more socially useful production.
   Drawing on Gramsci, we define these as `counter-hegemonic views', since
   they challenge the hegemonic `growth coalition' and `treadmill of
   destruction' paradigms. Such views support and echo more radical
   interpretations of Just Transition, emphasising the necessity of a
   structural transformation of society to achieve a fair and effective
   transition to sustainability.},

Abstract = {This article provides an analysis of the current strategic rivalry
   between the USA and the People's Republic of China in the context of the
   history of international relations and the expansion of civilisations.
   It demonstrates that most attempts to analyse the substance of this
   important phenomenon in world politics are based on an excessively
   narrow view, in terms of both world history and the entire system of
   modern international relations. The article concludes that the current
   Sino-American conflict is neither purely civilisational nor
   geopolitical, but indicates that a civilisationally united Westernised
   world is entering a period of political disunity. This is how the
   conflict should be understood, and the process involved should be
   referred to, in today's foreign policy language, as the transition from
   unipolarity to multipolarity.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the strategies designed after the Great Financial
   Crisis (GFC) by European think tanks specialized in economic policy and
   evaluates the main issues that served to boost their capacity for
   international influence between 2009 and 2018. It studies the 19
   European think tanks in the economic policy category highlighted by the
   2018 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report. 91,393 news items published
   on the think tanks evaluated during the decade after the GFC are
   analysed and a causal model is proposed to understand the thematic
   specialization strategies of think tanks in the media sphere. The model
   includes economic and media diffusion attributes and was tested using
   Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). The results confirm
   that the main areas of specialization of economic policy think tanks
   include emerging issues related to the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs). The stability of the Eurozone is a
   cross-cutting issue that is integrated into the internal policy
   discourse. The solution to the proposed model reveals five strategies
   followed by European think tanks.},

Abstract = {What determines the outcomes of civil wars? Existing literature
   highlights numerous factors at the systemic, state, and organizational
   levels of analysis. Yet there is little research on the attributes of
   rebel leaders in shaping war outcomes despite ample theories of their
   importance in steering their organizations. This article focuses on
   rebel leaders' age as one key driver of their behavior. Applying
   insights from developmental psychology to the context of armed
   rebellion, we argue that young rebel leaders are the most likely to
   suffer military defeats, middle-aged leaders to win military victories,
   and elderly ones to reach negotiated settlements. We use a mixed-methods
   strategy to substantiate our claims, combining case studies of George
   Washington and Yasser Arafat with new data from the Rebel Organization
   Leaders (ROLE) database. Our findings help advance the study of
   non-state violent leaders in world politics while illuminating neglected
   sources of risk and opportunity for peace practitioners.},

Abstract = {With their integration into the global political world, the historically
   Buddhist countries of Southeast Asia have begun to augment, sometimes to
   the point of replacement, their traditional political structures with
   Westernized political institutions. Despite these formal changes, far
   less development has been made as a matter of underlying political
   theory. Though the language of contemporary Buddhist political thought
   and action is colored with talk of rights, it remains unclear how firmly
   this new orientation is founded. The consequences of this mixture of
   Western democratic political forms built upon an underlying foundation
   of Buddhist political theory can be seen in the developing human rights
   crisis in Myanmar. On the subject of the Muslim Rohingya, advocates of
   Burmese democracy, such as Aung San Suu Kyi, have seemingly found common
   cause with the military junta, with the country's newly-minted
   democratic institutions proving themselves to be inadequate as a means
   of sustaining rights protections for the religious minority group. This
   paper examines the standing of rights-language in Buddhist political
   thought and how these concepts have thus far proven insufficient as a
   surrogate to similar conceptions in the liberal tradition as a
   foundation for political protections.},

Abstract = {Women combatants of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ej
   \& eacute;rcito del Pueblo (FARC-EP) participated in the Colombian peace
   process at different stages, at the negotiation table, at the signing of
   the agreement, and in the implementation of the accords. However, the
   process of reincorporation into civil society also produces new roles
   that do not appear in the Peace Agreement. Once they lay down their
   arms, FARC-EP women want to enjoy all human rights and expand their
   freedoms. But the societies that receive them have structural flaws in
   the way they are treated. They are acquiring, adapting, or resisting
   gender regulations, not widely available in the armed group. Based on
   qualitative fieldwork, this research aims to expose functionings and
   real capabilities, in the light of dimensions of reincorporation.
   Further evaluations of achievements and limitations suggest that female
   FARC-EP ex-combatants face greater barriers, burdens, and gaps than
   their male counterparts. These refer to unpaid domestic and care work,
   and gender-based violence and discrimination.},

Abstract = {International mechanisms failed to achieve equitable distribution of
   COVID-19 vaccines-prolonging and deepening the pandemic. To understand
   why, we conduct process tracing of the first year of international
   policymaking on vaccine equity. We find that, in the absence of a single
   venue for global negotiation, two competing law and policy paradigms
   emerged. One focused on demand and voluntary action by states and firms,
   while the alternative focused on opening knowledge and expanding
   production through national and international law. While these could
   have been complementary, power inequalities between key actors kept the
   second paradigm from gaining traction on the global agenda. The failure
   of the prevailing policy paradigm to secure equity is explained, not by
   unforeseen technical and financing challenges as some suggest, but by a
   fundamental misalignment with the political environment. While norm
   entrepreneurs encouraged sharing, political incentives pushed
   governments towards securing and hoarding doses. Firms responded to the
   latter. Mechanisms like COVAX proved incapable of countering these
   predictable international and domestic political forces. Earlier funding
   would not likely have changed the behaviour of states or firms in the
   absence of legal commitment. Barring significant geopolitical changes, a
   shift to include open/supply-focused policies will be necessary to
   achieve equity in future pandemics.},

Abstract = {This briefing offers three contributions concerning the voter profile of
   the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), as witnessed at the 2019 elections
   in South Africa. The first is that the party's support base is
   relatively well educated (compared to the ruling African National
   Congress). Second, well over 10\% of party support comes from relatively
   high earners, as measured by income levels. Finally, EFF support appears
   notably `fluid', as indicated by voters switching support to the EFF
   (mostly from the ANC) and away from the EFF (mostly towards smaller
   parties), ultimately suggesting an image of the EFF as a `gateway
   party'.},

Title = {The design roots of policy problems: Unpacking the role of procedural
   tools in design fitness and resilience},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {102},
Number = {1},
Pages = {302-317},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {While policy design scholars have made significant conceptual and
   empirical advances in identifying and evaluating procedural tools, there
   has been a little focus on understanding how they interact with the more
   traditional ``substantive{''} elements of a policy mix and their
   critical functions in policy mix designs. As a result, there is
   uncertainty about how procedural tools affect policy effectiveness-at
   adoption or over time. To address this gap, we propose a framework for
   deconstructing policy mix designs to examine how procedural tools
   interact with substantive tools in ways that either contribute to or
   undermine design ``fitness{''} and ``resilience.{''} The framework's
   diagnostic utility is illustrated by its application to unpack
   healthcare arrangements in Singapore and India, which reveals design
   ``fault lines{''} that policy researchers and practitioners need to be
   aware of. We conclude by offering research directions for further
   investigating the role of procedural tools in shaping policy dynamics
   and outcomes.},

Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Governments borrow from a range of creditors-commercial banks, sovereign
   bondholders, official bilateral creditors, and multilateral financial
   institutions. Sovereigns' creditor portfolios vary significantly across
   space and time. While creditor portfolios partly reflect supply-side
   considerations (macroeconomic profiles and associated default risk),
   they also reflect governments' preferences over fiscal transparency.
   Governments that prefer to disclose less information about economic
   outcomes will choose borrowing instruments that are less public, such as
   private loans from banks (versus bondholders) and official sector
   borrowing from bilateral (versus multilateral) creditors. Empirical
   analyses of government debt composition across developing nations
   confirm these predictions. We also find support for our claims at the
   subnational level, using data from Mexican municipalities. We treat
   various types of credit (bilateral lending, multilateral finance, and
   sovereign bonds) as related, rather than distinct.},

Abstract = {Increasingly, scholars and practitioners are interested in evaluating
   the effectiveness of interorganizational networks. We use a
   configuration approach to study network effectiveness. This research is
   a mixed-method study of 26 education networks in the United States. We
   measure network effectiveness by comparing 4th-grade literacy, 8th-grade
   literacy, and high-school graduation rates. We compare these scores with
   all school districts in the state using interrupted time series or
   parametric difference-in-differences approaches. Then, drawing from
   qualitative data from interviews and archives, we investigate the
   network governance, environmental characteristics, and theories of
   change associated with greater student achievement. We find three
   configurations associated with network effectiveness using fuzzy-set
   qualitative comparative analysis. One configuration combines
   decentralized governance with a project theory of change in the context
   of resource munificence. A second configuration associated with network
   effectiveness is to combine learning and systems alignment theories of
   change with smaller network size and resource munificence. The final
   configuration combines decentralized governance, a learning theory of
   change, less resource munificence, and larger network size and does not
   use a systems alignment theory of change. The results support the
   configurational approach, which suggests multiple configurations of
   factors in combination may result in network effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Thirty years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, some historical
   legacies of the communist system still influence individual political
   attitudes. This article explores how historical legacies influence
   individual political and geopolitical preferences in three Ukrainian
   cities. We focus on the effects of parental and individual CPSU
   membership over individual support for EU/NATO membership, on
   perceptions of the Soviet period for Ukraine, and on the perceived
   legitimacy of the 11 May 2014 ``Donetsk People's Republic{''}
   independence referendum. Using survey data collected in Dnipro and
   Kharkiv in 2018, and in Mariupol in 2020, we show that (individual or
   parental) CPSU affiliation is positively correlated with pro-Western
   attitudes, indicating that many former members of the CPSU and their
   descendants have reoriented their geopolitical allegiances from East to
   West. Or, alternatively, that they are relatively politically adaptive
   and that their allegiance to communism wasn't fully solid in the first
   place.},

Title = {Barriers and enablers in designing regulations to restrict the exposure
   of children to unhealthy food and beverage marketing},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe insidious and pervasive nature of marketing of unhealthy
   food and beverages has been identified as one of several strategies the
   unhealthy food and beverage industry uses to exert their influence on
   population food choices and diet. Regulating the food and beverage
   industry's marketing practices is one mechanism to mitigate this
   commercial determinant of health. This paper seeks to understand the
   main barriers and enablers that governments face when attempting to
   design an appropriate regulatory system. Methods14 semi-structured
   expert interviews were undertaken with participants across different
   jurisdictions (Ireland, United Kingdom, Chile, Canada, Norway, Portugal
   and Brazil) who were involved in introducing marketing restrictions; and
   a purposive documentary analysis was carried out. A thematic analysis of
   this data was conducted informed by the Health Policy Triangle.
   ResultsMultiple common technical and political issues were experienced
   by governments regarding the form and substance of the policy design
   regardless of the jurisdictional context. Such issues included: whether
   to introduce a mandatory approach; what age group to protect; what
   nutrient classification system to use; how to define ``marketing to
   children{''}; and what mediums, settings and techniques to cover. The
   actors opposing regulation challenged the form and substance of each
   design element. However, having a strong political mandate to introduce
   regulation; multiple actors working together, including multiple
   government ministries, academics and civil society actors; and a strong
   evidence base supporting the policy design helped policymakers navigate
   the technical and political challenges faced when designing the
   regulatory approach. ConclusionDespite the different political contexts
   and actors involved in different jurisdictions internationally, there
   are many commonalities in the challenges and enabling factors faced by
   governments. Understanding the technical and political challenges
   experienced by governments and how these governments overcame those
   challenges is critical to improve capacity around designing more
   effective regulations to improve population's diets, and therefore NCDs.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the Growth Model (GM) research program in
   comparative and international political economy by analyzing the impact
   of Brexit on London and other financial centers within the European
   Union (EU). Our key contribution is to demonstrate that for many
   countries, national growth models are really city-level growth models,
   and that this is directly observable in the relationship between GMs and
   their international financial centers. Such city-level GMs are possible
   precisely because they do not depend on, nor are they deeply integrated
   into, the rest of their national economy. To explain these observations,
   we draw upon insights from economic sociology and argue that
   `place-specific social capital' and professional `linked ecologies' make
   such internationally oriented city-level GMs highly robust to external
   shocks - even one as big as Brexit. Empirically, we develop this
   argument using financial firm-level data to observe the post-Brexit
   movement of assets, loans, and jobs in London, Dublin, Amsterdam, Paris
   and Frankfurt. We conclude with some observations on what a city-level
   GM perspective means for the study of comparative and international
   political economy.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, the European Union (EU) has faced a number of
   severe crises threatening its core policy regimes and the future of its
   polity. Potentially existential crises, such as the Eurozone, migration,
   and Covid-19 crises, require political leaders who are able and willing
   to give orientation and provide stability. This article argues that
   France and Germany, as the Union's two largest member states, have been
   key for EU stabilization and (further) integration, especially in times
   of crisis. Thanks to their `embedded bilateralism', France and Germany
   have available important resources that other member states and the EU's
   supranational institutions are lacking. Yet, the emergence of
   Franco-German leadership and its impact on EU stabilization and
   integration depend on the demand for leadership, reflecting the status
   quo costs across the EU and the supply of leadership as the result of
   relevant Franco-German capacities. Demand and supply factors explain the
   varying record of Franco-German leadership and stabilization in the
   three EU crises under consideration.},

Abstract = {This article explores the structural conservatism of mainstream
   environmental politics, which systematically avoids problematising
   `forms-of-life' (normative practices and routines), and develops a
   conceptual alternative: eco-social politics. This concept positions
   itself in a quest to change the grammar of environmental politics by
   embedding it in the lived materiality of everyday life, but differs from
   prefigurative movement-oriented strategies by prioritising the
   integration of majority populations and by acknowledging the role of
   political rule-setting, i.e. coercion. Building on a multi-level
   integral state project, eco-social politics resides in particular
   strategies, procedures, and institutions to collectively (re)negotiate
   common sense, with the aim to partially and pragmatically suture social
   relations to find transformative answers to contemporary eco-social
   crises. Here, I explore potentials for stronger dialectical links
   between deliberative and representative democratic institutions.},

Abstract = {Can village leaders' performance impact villagers' trust in the central
   government? Using village leader-villager relations at the village level
   as the explanatory variable, we examine a previously ignored source of
   public trust toward the Chinese government: face-to-face interactions
   with local leaders. We argue that, as the party-state's first point of
   contact with villagers, villagers use their interactions with village
   leaders as a proxy to determine the trustworthiness of China's central
   government. By analyzing the latest Guangdong Thousand Village Survey
   from 2020, we find that when villagers report better relations with
   village leaders, they also express greater trust in the Chinese central
   government. We find additional evidence for this relationship through
   open-ended interviews of villagers and village leaders. These findings
   advance our understanding of hierarchical political trust in China.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the Women's Activities in Armed Rebellion (WAAR)
   project, a multi-methods project that includes a cross-sectional dataset
   of women's participation in more than 370 organizations fighting in
   civil conflicts between 1946 and 2015. The dataset features 22 measures
   of women's participation in rebel organizations: it includes prevalence
   and presence measures of women's participation in combat, non-combat and
   leadership roles; details on all-female units within groups (and their
   primary focus - combat or support activities); and presence measures for
   types of support work (disaggregated into clandestine work, outreach to
   civilian populations and logistical support) and types of leadership
   activities (military or non-military) that women contribute. The WAAR
   project also includes a detailed, qualitative assessment of women's
   involvement in each organization, comprising an approximately 360-page
   handbook of female rebel participation in the post-WWII period. This
   article describes the WAAR project and suggests avenues for future
   research leveraging these data.},

Abstract = {We examine the effect of sectarian politics in the presence of weak
   state capacity on long-term economic growth. To this end, we exploit the
   1956 civil uprising between Maronite Christian and Sunni Muslim factions
   in Lebanon to estimate the impact of sectarian political tensions on
   long-term growth. To isolate the impact of the uprising, we use
   synthetic control estimator and match Lebanon's pre-1956 growth and
   development trajectory with the rest of the world where such uprising
   did not occur, and estimate the counterfactual growth trajectory in the
   hypothetical absence of the sectarian conflict. Our evidence indicates
   large and pervasive negative growth effects of factionalism. Our
   estimates imply that Lebanon's per capita income down to the present day
   is on average 57\% lower than that of its pre-1956 synthetic control
   group without sectarian clashes, and does not seem to be driven by
   preexisting or subsequent trends and shocks. The negative long-term
   growth effect of sectarian conflict is robust to a battery of spatial
   and temporal placebo checks, choice of samples and is not sensitive to
   the composition of control groups.},

Abstract = {As a space of exchange that transcends historic jurisdictions, the
   Internet lacks a dominant security provider. This research examines how
   and why firms in platform capitalism have developed their own method and
   means of protection. `Trust and Safety' (T\&S) is a novel division of
   labour that has become nearly ubiquitous in the industry, encompassing
   many of the concerns raised about the influence of technology on
   politics, society and economy. The making of capitalist exchange online
   requires a similarly discrete making of protection beyond the state.
   T\&S work ensures that interaction and exchange are sheltered, doing so
   by curating trust between atomized individuals, and asserting what
   belongs and what does not. T\&S' centrality to platform capitalism can
   be explained-in part-by Weber's notion of the city as market-fortress; a
   spatialized condition of exchange protection that is foundational for
   fastening capitalism together and seeking to make it, and inequality,
   inevitable.},

Abstract = {Existing studies leave open many questions about the link between
   religiosity and the conservative political attitudes of Orthodox
   believers in Russia. This article employs qualitative research to
   highlight the role of religiosity in individual political choice. The
   empirical material was collected during interviews with believers in
   Lipetsk Oblast in 2019-2020. The results of the study revealed three
   types of conservative choice, depending on an individual's level of
   religiosity. Although religious beliefs and practices play different
   roles at different levels of religiosity, they are not crucial to
   believers' political choices.},

Abstract = {Federal administrations have been addressing the problem of hunger in
   Brazil since the days of Lula da Silva. An extensive review of the
   literature shows that the fight against hunger reached its highest level
   of priority during the Lula da Silva administrations (2003-2010), where
   it was organized with an institutional structure and seen as an
   international model for public policy. Every subsequent government since
   then has given less attention to it, ending in the complete neglect of
   the issue under the Bolsonaro administration. Governos federais tem
   abordado o problema da fome no Brasil desde a epoca de Lula da Silva.
   Uma revista exhaustiva da literatura aponta que a luta contra a fome
   atingiu o seu apogeu quando lhe foi atribuida maxima proridade na agenda
   politica federal durante os governos Lula da Silva (2003-2010) onde era
   organizada com base numa estrutura institucional que e hoje celebrada
   como modelo internacional de politica publica. Desde entao, cada governo
   sucessivo prestou cada vez menos atencao a fome, acabando no descaso
   completo do assunto sob o governo Bolsonaro.},

Abstract = {The emergence of Bolsonarism as a face of the extreme right in Brazil
   has come out of the articulation of several groups mobilized on social
   networks around a handful of key ideas including moral conservatism,
   economic liberalism, patriotism, public security, and a common enemy.
   Research on social networks and articles in the press shows that
   Bolsonarism has opened a Pandora's box, releasing behavior that combines
   racist antiracialism and racist racialism and that aims to dismantle the
   recent achievements of black and indigenous groups. A emergencia do
   Bolsonarismo como manifestacao da extrema direita no Brasil deve sua
   origem a articulacao de varios grupos que se mobilizaram nas redes
   sociais em torno de um conjunto de ideias chaves que inclui um inimigo
   comum, um conservadorismo moral, um liberalismo economico, o patriotismo
   e a seguranca publica. Estudos sobre as redes sociais e artigos nos
   jornais mostram que o Bolsonarismo tem abrido uma caixa de Pandora,
   fomentando um comportamento que combina o antiracialismo racista com um
   racialismo racista que almeja desmontar os sucessos recentes conseguidos
   por grupos negros e indigenas.},

Journal = {HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {The realization of a global, inclusive, nondiscriminatory, and quality
   education as a human right requires significant financing from developed
   stakeholders, as well as sustained commitment in developing states
   through the mobilization of domestic resources. Realigning the right to
   education against such targets is envisaged in the framework of
   Sustainable Develop-ment Goal 4 (SDG4). This paper demonstrates that
   despite financial pledges, which in many instances have materialized,
   only a handful of countries are on target to achieve the aims of SDG4 by
   2030, with many developed states falling drastically behind. Although
   financing is key to achieving SDG4, inclusivity is not high on states'
   agendas because of the imbalance of resources required to reach women
   and girls and the marginalized and impoverished as opposed to those
   living in urban centers and the middle class. The paper suggests that
   global financing for SDG4 should equally be aligned with efforts to
   reduce sovereign debt to such a degree that allows states to fund
   education without fear of being in default of their arrears. Ultimately,
   SDG4 should be the common concerns of all states because of the benefits
   to the entire international community.},

Abstract = {The `regulatory state' has prevailed in almost every sector of European
   public policy. The provision of security, however, is still widely
   viewed as the domain of the `positive state', which rests on political
   authority and autonomous capacities. Challenging this presumption, we
   argue that expertise - as foundation of authority - and rules - as
   policy instruments - also shape the provision of European security by
   national and, in particular, supranational `regulatory security states',
   namely the European Union (EU). We lay out a framework for mapping the
   uneven and contested rise of European regulatory security states;
   analyzing drivers and constraints of security state reforms; and
   grasping the implications of the regulatory security state for the
   effectiveness and democratic legitimacy of European security
   policy-making. We advance the research program on the regulatory state
   and contribute to an innovative understanding of who governs security in
   Europe's multi-level polity, by what means, and on what legitimatory
   grounds.},

Title = {The integrity of digital policies and political participation in Uganda:
   a tale of dissent and digital repression?},
Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {61},

Abstract = {In response to an unresponsive government, citizens in Uganda have
   reacted by constructing their own spaces of participation from below.
   These bottom-up participatory spaces help citizens to escape the
   repression of regimes and counter their elimination by political
   representatives and administrative elites from decision-making
   processes. However, the participatory instruments from below seemingly
   threaten the regime's survival and the elites' hierarchies.
   Consequently, the use of bottom-up instruments in Uganda has often faced
   severe restrictions and control from the state through the use of online
   and digital communication laws. What is the level of integrity and
   fairness of digital policies and new online and digital communication
   laws in Uganda? The article profiles the monitoring of online
   instruments of participation by the state, and discusses the views of
   Ugandans towards the integrity and implementation of digital policies in
   Uganda.},

Abstract = {In 2010, the United States Congress placed a moratorium on earmarks -
   congressionally mandated spending projects. But did the earmark
   moratorium actually rid public policy of earmarks? I use earmark data
   and 2010-2020 state-level highway funding metrics to examine the
   relationship between previously expired transportation earmarks and
   federal highway funding during the earmark moratorium. Earmarks in the
   2005 surface transportation law (SAFETEA-LU) continued to benefit
   certain states in 2020, even though the projects technically expired in
   2009. This is because the funding ``formulas{''} established by all
   post-2009 surface transportation laws were fully determined by the
   highway allocation percentage each state received in the preceding year,
   inclusive of earmarks. Further, I find the relationship between
   SAFETEA-LU earmarks and state funding disparities strengthened from 2010
   to 2020, meaning the expired earmarks increased in policy significance
   during the moratorium. Highly earmarked states became even more
   advantaged after the earmarks were institutionalised into the highway
   funding formula.},

Title = {Factors in National Self-Designation of Slavic Muslims in the
   Montenegrin Sandzak},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {835-856},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {National fragmentation of Slavic Muslims in the Montenegrin area of the
   Sandzak region into Bosniaks and national Muslims was recorded in the
   last two population censuses in Montenegro, with minor differences in
   the two sets of results. Therefore, the following question emerges: what
   are the social and political factors, prevalent in the Montenegrin area
   of the Sandzak region, that drive national self-identification of Slavic
   Muslims in this region either towards Bosniakism (national Bosniaks) or
   national Muslimhood (national Muslims). In the Montenegrin
   sociopolitical discourse in the relevant period, the social constructs
   ``Bosniak `` and ``Muslim `` have been shaped so that the first ethnonym
   implies stronger national ties and the tendency to complete one's
   national identity through identification with Slavic Muslims outside of
   Montenegro, while the second ethnonym is closer to Montenegrin state
   patriotism and the intra-Montenegrin state framework. Empirical material
   from relevant censuses shows that the tendency of Slavic Muslims in
   Montenegro to embrace national Bosniakism is not driven by actions of
   political elites, the proximity and influence of Bosnia, or the
   ethnic/pre-Islamic origin of this part of the Montenegrin population,
   but rather by the homogeneity of the population at the municipal level:
   national Bosniakism is more pronounced in confessionally homogeneous
   Muslim communities than in those municipalities where Slavic Muslims and
   Christians live side by side. This finding is interpreted from the
   perspective of symbolic interactionism: in the confessionally
   heterogeneous Montenegrin-Sandzak municipalities, we have witnessed
   self-censorship of Slavic Muslims in terms of their national
   self-designation, as a result of the need to preserve the positive
   perceptions held by their Christian fellow citizens. In confessionally
   homogeneous Muslim municipalities, this factor did not have a major
   impact, resulting in a significantly large-scale acceptance of national
   Bosniakism than in those local administrations in the Montenegrin part
   of the Sandzak region where Slavic Muslims live with the Christian
   population.},

   different directions on matters of global security. They are constructed
   as answers to sets of questions and issues, all pertaining to the
   supposed non-appreciating by others outside of the West of the `real

Title = {Deflective Cooperation: Social Pressure and Forum Management in Cold War
   Conventional Arms Control},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {77},
Number = {3},
Pages = {564-598},
Abstract = {Why do states create weak international institutions? Frustrated with
   proliferating but disappointing international environmental
   institutions, scholars increasingly bemoan agreements which, rather than
   solving problems, appear to exist ``for show.{''} This article offers an
   explanation of this phenomenon. I theorize a dynamic of deflective
   cooperation to explain the creation of compromise face-saving
   institutions. I argue that when international social pressure to create
   an institution clashes with enduring disagreements among states about
   the merits of creating it, states may adopt cooperative arrangements
   that are ill-designed to produce their purported practical effects.
   Rather than negotiation failures or empty gestures, I contend that
   face-saving institutions represent interstate efforts to manage
   intractable disagreement through suboptimal institutionalized
   cooperation. I formulate this argument inductively through a new
   multi-archival study of conventional weapons regulation during the Cold
   War, which resulted in the oft-maligned 1980 UN Convention on Certain
   Conventional Weapons. A careful reconsideration of the negotiation
   process extends and nuances existing IR theorizing and retrieves its
   historical significance as a critical juncture and complex product of
   contesting diplomatic practices.},

Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {This paper explores the securitisation geopolitics around environmental
   sustainability, advocating for regional securitisation as a means to
   address environmental challenges that otherwise complicate traditional
   security challenges, which are foundational to a regional security
   complex approach. The global landscape lacks a unified approach to
   environmental practices, prompting the examination of regional contexts
   to influence state behaviour and apply a regional security complex model
   to symbolise this transformation as ``Regional Environmental
   Sustainability Complexes{''} (RESC). The paper demonstrates that the
   South Asian Regional Security Complex (SARSC) concept by Buzan has
   evolved into the broader South Asian Regional Environmental
   Sustainability Complex (SARESC).},

   Interests},

Abstract = {In this article, Foreign Minister Huitfeldt presents three features of
   Norway's diplomacy during its two-year period as an elected member in
   the UN Security Council. Firstly, how has the UN Security Council
   membership affected Norwegian foreign policy and interests? Secondly,
   what have been Norway's main contributions to the Council's work? And
   thirdly, what have been the clear hallmarks to Norway's efforts and
   diplomacy in the Security Council? Furthermore, the Foreign Minister
   argues how the Security Council membership has strengthened Norwegian
   interests. Huitfeldt provides several examples on how Norway, as an
   elected member, utilised the scope for action in the Council, and
   combined a principled voice with pragmatic diplomacy that led to
   concrete results in terms of adopted resolutions and statements. She
   emphasises the importance of this problem-solving approach, particularly
   after Russia started its full-scale invasion of Ukraine 24 February
   2022. It was then crucial to avoid a complete paralysis of the Council,
   especially in dossiers not connected with Russia's war of aggression
   against Ukraine.},

Abstract = {This article examines the norm-setting role of the OSCE High
   Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM), particularly in relation to
   the evolving interpretation of the Framework Convention for the
   Protection of National Minorities (FCNM). It explores the interaction
   between the HCNM's various sets of Recommendations and the work of the
   Advisory Committee on the FCNM (ACFC). The article argues that while the
   HCNM's intention when starting the practice of endorsing or drafting
   thematic recommendations was not focused on norm-setting, its
   Recommendations have gradually contributed to particularizing
   international obligations concerning minority rights, especially in
   areas where the FCNM is less specific. The article highlights the
   importance of the HCNM and the ACFC in promoting an inclusive approach
   to minority rights, moving from a protectionist stance to the holistic
   management of diverse societies. It concludes by identifying factors
   that contribute to the HCNM's successful norm-setting, such as
   consultation, collaboration and a bold and creative, yet legally
   grounded, approach to recommendations.},

Abstract = {The present study analyzes the limits of regionalism in achieving SDG 8,
   with a focus on the Mexican reality. It is based on the hypothesis that
   the role of the national government is decisive for incorporation of the
   Agenda 2030 in cases of regionalism based on an intergovernmental
   dynamic. We argue that NAFTA had a limited impact on improving working
   conditions in Mexico, as it only affected export-oriented regions and
   sectors. Since 2019 there has been an increase in the minimum wage,
   which can be explained not only by enforcing the USMCA, but also by a
   compatibility between internal and external agendas. Therefore, the case
   of Mexico allows us to affirm that the national government was decisive
   for the incorporation of the Agenda 2030 in the context of
   intergovernmental agreements.},

Title = {In the Blind Spot of the Norwegian EU Debate: EU Health Preparedness
   After COVID-19},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Number = {4},
Pages = {602-614},
Abstract = {This article challenges the Norwegian EU debate by focusing on an
   overlooked but increasingly important policy area for European
   cooperation, namely health policy and more specifically health
   preparedness. The EU has started major processes related to health
   preparedness in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Norway takes part
   in some of these processes through the EEA agreement but is also
   currently excluded from important areas. This article serves two
   purposes: it maps ongoing EU development in health preparedness and
   assesses the extent to which this area should occupy more space in the
   Norwegian EU debate, including the sustainability of the current status
   quo. The article further identifies two specific areas that are central
   to Norway in relation to health preparedness. The first concerns the
   development of the EU's Health Union and Norway's political work to
   ensure formal access to all the initiatives that have recently been
   developed in the EU. The other concerns the effects that the EU's
   intensified work on health preparedness has for the Norwegian health
   industry. The article concludes that Norwegian vulnerabilities are
   particularly linked to Norway's political role as an EU outsider, but
   that these vulnerabilities must be considered in the context of any
   contribution the Norwegian health industry can make in the European
   health market if Norway becomes more closely connected to the Health
   Union.},

Title = {How Expert Committees Become Group Agents: Self-Legitimation in the
   Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {The UN human rights treaty bodies-groups of experts tasked with
   monitoring how states implement international human rights
   conventions-are increasingly portrayed as powerful collective entities
   with agency. This article focuses on one mechanism that helps
   collectives of individuals become group agents, namely internal
   self-legitimation. By internal self-legitimation, we mean practices such
   as narratives and rituals enacted by a group that ascribe legitimacy to
   it in the eyes of its members and are key to building common
   identification among them. We explore how self-legitimation facilitates
   group agency on the basis of a case study on the Committee on the Rights
   of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), obtaining empirical evidence for
   the study from content analysis of CRPD documents and interviews with
   former and present members. We show that specific legitimation
   narratives-related to the moral value of the committee's task and the
   moral integrity of its members, the fairness of the CRPD's procedures,
   and the committee's association with other presumably legitimate
   institutions-facilitated identity-building and helped the CRPD to
   develop the characteristics of a group agent and take decisions.
   Finally, we explore the conditions on which the findings might be
   applicable to other human rights treaty bodies.
   Los organos de los tratados de derechos humanos de la ONU, grupos de
   expertos encargados de supervisar la aplicacion de las convenciones
   internacionales de derechos humanos por parte de los Estados, se
   presentan, cada vez mas, como entidades colectivas poderosas que tienen
   capacidad de accion. Este articulo se centra en uno de los mecanismos
   que ayudan a los colectivos de individuos a convertirse en agentes
   grupales, es decir, la autolegitimacion interna. Por autolegitimacion
   interna, nos referimos a aquellas practicas, tales como narrativas y
   rituales promulgados por un grupo, que le atribuyen legitimidad a los
   ojos de sus miembros y que son clave para construir una identificacion
   comun entre ellos. Estudiamos como la autolegitimacion facilita la
   agencia grupal sobre la base de un estudio de caso relativo al Comite
   sobre los Derechos de las Personas con Discapacidad (CDPD), y obtenemos
   pruebas empiricas para este estudio mediante el uso del analisis de
   contenido de documentos del CDPD y de entrevistas, tanto con miembros
   anteriores como con miembros actuales. Demostramos que las narrativas de
   legitimacion especificas, relacionadas con el valor moral de la tarea
   del comite y la integridad moral de sus miembros, con la imparcialidad
   de los procedimientos del CDPD y con la asociacion del comite con otras
   instituciones presuntamente legitimas, facilitaron la construccion de la
   identidad y ayudaron al CDPD tanto a desarrollar las caracteristicas de
   un agente de grupo como a tomar decisiones. Por ultimo, estudiamos las
   condiciones mediante las cuales nuestras conclusiones podrian llegar a
   ser aplicables a otros organos creados en virtud de tratados de derechos
   humanos.
   Les organes de surveillance des traites relatifs aux droits de l'homme
   de l'ONU-des groupes d'experts charges de surveiller la mise en oe uvre
   des conventions internationales relatives aux droits de l'homme par les
   etats-sont de plus en plus souvent representes tels de puissantes
   entites collectives dotees d'une capacite d'action. Cet article se
   concentre sur un mecanisme qui permet aux collectifs de personnes de
   devenir des groupes agents, c'est-a-dire sur l'autolegitimation interne.
   Ce terme designe les pratiques (par exemple, des recits ou rituels) d'un
   groupe qui lui conferent une legitimite aux yeux de ses membres. Elles
   s'averent primordiales dans la creation d'une identite commune. Nous
   analysons comment l'autolegitimation facilite la capacite d'action d'un
   groupe en nous fondant sur une etude de cas du Comite sur les droits des
   personnes handicapees (CDPH). Nous obtenons des elements empiriques pour
   l'etude a partir de l'analyse du contenu du CDPH et des entretiens avec
   d'anciens membres ou des membres actuels. Nous montrons que certains
   recits de legitimation-concernant la valeur morale de la mission du
   comite et l'integrite morale de ses membres, l'equite des procedures du
   CDPH et son association avec d'autres institutions a priori
   legitimes-ont facilite la creation d'une identite et permis au CDPH de
   developper les caracteristiques d'un groupe agent et de prendre des
   decisions. Enfin, nous explorons les conditions d'application des
   resultats a d'autres organes de traites relatifs aux droits de l'homme.},

Abstract = {Following the rise in hate crime in Northern Ireland, in 2019 the
   Northern Ireland Assembly appointed Judge Marrinan to conduct a review
   into hate crime. Publishing his findings in his review in December 2020,
   this article examines the key recommendations that should be included in
   a Hate Crime Bill. As the Assembly is currently suspended, the article
   examines the hate crime statistics recorded following the publication of
   the review to illustrate why it is imperative that when it reconvenes,
   the Assembly introduce a Hate Crime Bill at the earliest opportunity.
   The article also argues that a prevention programme is introduced
   alongside the Bill to safeguard and prevent young people being drawn
   towards paramilitary activity along with hate crime and non-paramilitary
   terrorist activity. Young people are the focus of introducing an initial
   programme with the demographics in the hate crime statistics revealing a
   high number of offenders are that category. Following an examination of
   current programmes in place and the threat posed by paramilitaries and
   extremists, including the far right and extreme far right (neo-Nazis),
   the article recommends the current WRAP programme is developed to help
   and safeguard young people drawn to the paramilitaries to include hate
   crime and extremist related terrorism.},

Abstract = {The existing scholarship shows that neutral and non-aligned countries in
   Europe closely and often covertly engage with NATO despite their
   official posture. However, we lack comparative insights into how this
   phenomenon plays out in various countries. To understand this phenomenon
   of crypto-Atlanticism (CA) better we develop a framework to capture
   variations depending on the strength of elites' Atlanticist preferences
   and their perceptions of public opinion's preferences for neutrality. We
   illustrate our framework with evidence from twenty-four interviews with
   policy elites from Austria, Serbia and Sweden conducted between 2020 and
   2022. Our findings show that elites exhibited various forms of CA: while
   the strength of Atlanticism is stronger in Austria and Sweden than in
   Serbia, the degree of restriction in publicly expressing these
   preferences was less restrained in Sweden than in Austria and Serbia. In
   conclusion, we discuss the implications of our findings for the theory
   and practice of military neutrality.},

   explorations in the South China Sea},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 19},
Abstract = {Studies in maritime diplomacy have treated the development of oil and
   gas explorations in the South China Sea as taken-for-granted events. On
   the contrary, this study argues that assessing the maritime diplomatic
   properties inherent in energy reserve explorations can reveal unique
   insights, motivations, and significance of maritime diplomatic events.
   It assesses Malaysia's oil and gas explorations in the Luconia Shoals,
   informed by the analytical framework of Le Miere's maritime diplomatic
   properties. Utilizing secondary data from the Asian Maritime
   Transparency Initiative between 2020 and 2023 related to Malaysia's oil
   and gas project developments in the Luconia Shoals, this article
   concludes that the maritime diplomatic events consist of the following
   characteristics: (1) pre-emptive and sustainment, underlining Malaysia's
   long-term plan of fulfilling the growing domestic energy demand, (2)
   explicitness of the messages transmitted to Chinese officials in order
   to repel any possibilities of adversaries misconstruing Malaysia's
   actions at sea, and (3) moderate kinetic effect due to the lethal
   weaponry at the disposal of the hard power assets deployed to handle
   occurring crisis. Evaluation of Malaysia's maritime diplomatic
   properties also reveals two worrying conclusions: (1) the existence of
   reactive events, which can cause disruptions at sea due to the lack of
   planning related to the actions taken by the Royal Malaysian Navy, and
   (2) asymmetrical power relations between China and Malaysia, predicted
   to cause China to continue its power projections at sea and aggravate
   Malaysian policymakers.},

Title = {The Intersection between Islamic Populism and Radicalism in Indonesia:
   The Rise and Fall of Aksi Bela Islam Movement},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 16},
Abstract = {This article discusses the role of radical Islamist groups - the Islamic
   Defenders Front (FPI), Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), and the Salafis -
   in spearheading the populist Islamist 212 Movement. It examines why they
   were such effective forces in leading the movement and why their role
   diminished over time, which contributed to the decline of the movement.
   Drawing on political process theory and the literature on populism, this
   article argues that the movement faltered because they could no longer
   play an instrumental role due to the unsupportive structure of political
   opportunities, disorganized social movement, less relevant framing, and
   greater social and political pressure to the social movement.},

Title = {When do bureaucrats choose to unburden clients: A randomized experiment},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {102},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1210-1232},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Prior work refers to burdens in citizen-state interactions as
   administrative, even though most originate from the desk of politicians,
   not administrators. Even more, bureaucrats often act to unburden their
   clients via the discretionary powers they wield. This perspective has
   largely been overlooked in extant research. The present study asks under
   what conditions bureaucrats alleviate the burdens levied by elected
   officials on their clients. We propose that bureaucrats are more likely
   to use their discretion to unburden the most vulnerable groups. The
   study models vulnerability in terms of age and race, using two
   single-factorial randomized experiments on a sample of 580 U.S. public
   managers in a COVID-19 rental assistance setting. We find that client
   vulnerability drives bureaucrats' intent to unburden, but only in the
   context of age, not race. Also, the more administrators perceive
   themselves as public representatives, the higher their intention to
   unburden aid seekers. By contrast, bureaucrats with higher self-efficacy
   tend to unburden less (sic) (in Bulgarian)},

Title = {Does Increasing Ethnic Diversity Reduce Electoral Turnout? The Case of
   New Zealand 1957-2020},

Year = {2025},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {A diversifying population may affect electoral turnout when there is an
   increasing proportion of minorities with weaker voting habits than those
   of the majority. New Zealand provides an example to test this
   possibility, by way of growth in the indigenous Maori population and a
   high level of recent immigration. A large sample dataset provides better
   estimates of group turnouts than hitherto available. The authors
   estimate how much ethnic diversification may have affected turnout in
   New Zealand between the elections of 1957, 2014, and 2020. By adopting a
   theory that resists conceptualisation of not voting as deviation from
   `civic duty', the authors avoid ascribing `fault' to this behaviour.},

Abstract = {This article assesses two next-level questions in the study of
   democratic backsliding: democratic resilience and political
   polarization. It first advances a set of methodological decision points
   to improve clarity in contemporary debates surrounding democratic
   backsliding measurement and the possibility of identifying moments of
   democratic recovery. It then moves to a theoretical and empirical
   assessment of pathways by which democratic backsliding takes place,
   under what conditions, which specific actors are involved, and what
   opportunities exist for democratic recovery given sources of resilience
   and strategies of resistance. The authors examine the role of political
   polarization in backsliding and highlight the combined importance of
   political agency and institutional levers for regime outcomes. The
   authors argue that regime outcomes are not predetermined by antecedent
   conditions, and particularly not by the level of development.},

Abstract = {The introduction to the special section ``Who Cares for Families?
   Narrative(s) of Return in Postsocialist Europe{''} identifies and
   analyzes its core concept-the narrative of return. Families of today are
   talked about differently, and how they are narrativized matters. The
   narrative that stresses that family is under threat and in need of
   defense or a special form of care, figuring care as restitution of
   natural, traditional, or family proper, is termed the narrative of
   return. The trope of return is strongly normative and non-descriptive,
   as it relies on mythical temporalities that ought to be restored in our
   present. The article first defines the choice of concepts-narrative,
   return, care, and threat. Second, it applies this conceptual frame in
   the transnational context, particularly within the transnational
   anti-gender campaigns in the populist moment. Third, it focuses on the
   postsocialist part of Europe, where, as the entire special section aims
   to demonstrate, the narrative of return gained particular currency. In
   Eastern Europe, these narratives are integral to larger projects of
   restoration of national agenda and serve as a tool of double
   emancipation: from the Soviet past and from the European Union present.
   Political actors using narrative(s) of return advocate and successfully
   push through fundamental changes in the political frameworks and value
   systems of the postsocialist countries. In sum, the article aims to
   demonstrate the conceptual background of a political tool.},

Abstract = {Why do governments make concessions to some rebels but not others? We
   argue that the origins of rebel groups influence the bargaining process,
   and the government's willingness to make concessions in particular.
   Rebel groups inherit different resource endowments - community ties and
   military expertise - from pre-existing ``parent{''} organizations. These
   resource endowments are visible to the government, and they provide
   critical information about the likely durability of the rebellion. We
   expect that rebel group origins facilitating these endowments are
   associated with the state offering concessions earlier in the conflict.
   Employing original data on rebel group origins, as well as information
   on government concessions during post-Cold War African conflicts, we
   find general support for our expectations, although not all types of
   parent organizations are equally beneficial to rebel groups when it
   comes to extracting concessions from the state.},

Abstract = {A comprehensive examination of the evidence available, contained in U.S.
   government statements, English-language media accounts, and hacked
   Telegram chats among Brazilian prosecutors, indicates that the United
   States was closely involved in the ``long coup{''} that removed the left
   from power in Brazil in 2016 and secured the election of the far-right
   in 2018. Just as after Brazil's U.S.-backed 1964 coup, this evidence has
   largely been ignored by U.S. scholars. Latin Americanists would do well
   to return to the anti-imperialist tradition that established our field
   as a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy.Um exame abrangente das
   evidencias disponiveis, contidas em declaracoes do governo dos EUA,
   relatos da midia em ingles e bate-papos hackeados no Telegram entre
   promotores da justica no Brasil, indica que os Estados Unidos estiveram
   intimamente envolvidos no ``longo golpe{''} que removeu a esquerda do
   poder no Brasil em 2016 e garantiu a eleicao da extrema-direita em 2018.
   Tal como depois do golpe de Estado de 1964 apoiado pelos EUA, esta
   evidencia tem sido amplamente ignorada pelos academicos
   norte-americanos. Os latino-americanistas fariam bem em regressar a
   tradicao anti-imperialista que estabeleceu o nosso campo como um dos
   principais criticos da politica externa dos EUA.},

Title = {Responsibility and innovation for low waste and circular economy
   transitions: what roles for households?},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {579-599},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The need for waste policy to embrace CE principles through measures to
   avoid waste generation and improve recycling rates can be understood
   within the broader context of sustainability transitions. We analyze
   three Australian waste policies to understand how households are framed
   as framing policy actors. Using a governance rationalities framework
   inspired by Hajer (2005) and Dryzek's (2013) work on environmental
   governance, we identified four discursive structures, i.e. four
   different problem frames with suggested solutions, measures and
   responsibilities. These problem frames reveal an expanding role for
   government and industry in waste management, alongside a more passive
   role for households. While anticipating that households will undertake
   more sorting and will reduce the amount of waste they generate, the
   policies lack a coherent conceptualization of the role of households as
   actors in circular economy transitions in Australia. Our analysis
   highlights and helps to understand the discrepancy between high-level CE
   and zero-waste policy ambitions and their implementation in practice. We
   conclude with suggestions on how waste policy could benefit from
   deliberative approaches that engage with agency for social innovation
   and transformation in norms and practices at the household scale.},

Abstract = {Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, NATO
   embarked on an ambitious series of military reforms aimed at enhancing
   deterrence and defence of the Euro-Atlantic area. However, as the
   Alliance approaches its 75th anniversary, concerns are mounting
   regarding the ability of non-US allies to meet their expanded security
   obligations. The Alliance's updated regional-defence plans, and planned
   transformations to the NATO force and command structures, could pose
   considerable challenges for the European and Canadian allies who,
   following decades of cuts to their armed forces, lack the personnel
   required for implementing these reforms.},

Abstract = {Understanding the formation of and changes in citizens' extreme views on
   complex public policies is an important task in our increasingly
   polarized world. Behavioral sciences offer insights on cognitive
   processes and potential mechanisms to mitigate extremity in policy
   preferences and develop more realistic models that underprint political
   attitudes. About a decade ago, Fernbach et al. (2013) offered a simple
   cognitive intervention to reduce political extremism: Confront people
   with their lack of procedural policy knowledge such that their
   overestimation of knowledge is shattered. We conducted three high-value
   replications and extensions to examine the applicability of Fernbach's
   proposed theory among a sample of 5,139 citizens in postconflict Hong
   Kong. Our results suggest the opposite: Positional extremity is higher
   when citizens articulate their understanding of policy. Our study, which
   is larger in scale, draws on different time periods and extended
   interventions and examines more controversial policy issues has
   epistemological and cognitive implications for future research on the
   political psychology of extremism.},

Abstract = {The article advances the research on compliance negotiations in the
   context of the EU's external relations. It develops further the
   framework on EU compliance negotiations, introduced by Jonsson and
   Tallberg in 1998, and provides empirical evidence from a case study on
   the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement's implementation. The article
   suggests three arguments for the expansion of the original framework.
   Firstly, we add to the framework the case of pre-emptive compliance
   negotiations, i.e. negotiations in view of anticipated non-compliance.
   Secondly, it is suggested to supplement the original framework with the
   `object of negotiations' category, as the issue at stake influences
   other variables in compliance negotiations, such as the power relations
   between the parties and the conflictive vs. cooperative nature of the
   negotiations. Thirdly, the article unpacks the role of multistakeholder
   networks in the dynamics of compliance negotiations in the EU's external
   relations.},

Abstract = {The ongoing fight against the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the
   importance of adaptive policy change and the critical role of policy
   learning in responding to public health crises. This study utilizes
   policy change and policy learning theories to investigate how
   instrumental and political learning intertwined to explain the policy
   change decisions made by six U.S. states from May to December 2020. By
   employing a multi-value Qualitative Comparative Analysis, this study
   finds that the decision to impose stricter public gathering restrictions
   is primarily driven by instrumental learning, which is a response to the
   deteriorating pandemic situation. On the contrary, the decision to relax
   gathering restrictions is not only driven by the policymakers'
   perception of the improving pandemic situation but also influenced by
   the political motivations, such as the desire to suppress protests and
   address concerns for the decreased approval for the governor's handling
   of the crisis. The findings highlight the varied utilization of
   different policy learning types in response to different directions of
   policy change. Additionally, this study underscores the joint impact of
   instrumental and political learning in explaining changes in policy
   stringency. Overall, these findings contribute to a deeper understanding
   of policy change through learning activities in a complex and rapidly
   evolving policy landscape.},

Abstract = {Much has been written about the claim that the British National Health
   Service (NHS) is becoming more like the US health care system, something
   a number of commentators view as a form of ``Americanization{''}. Yet,
   that term is imprecise and unhelpful for rigorous analysis of what has,
   and has not, happened. This paper uses the lens of policy transfer to
   explore this issue, which provides a sharper insight into policy
   development. The paper examines the relevance of the Dolowitz and Marsh
   framework for the study of policy transfer from the US to the British
   NHS from 1979 onwards. In terms of the framework's main research
   questions, the discussion of the potential US influence on the NHS case
   stresses the role of policy entrepreneurs in policy transfer. In terms
   of policy success, however, commentators suggest a mix of uninformed,
   incomplete, or inappropriate transfer. We conclude that Dolowitz and
   Marsh do provide a useful framework that asks relevant questions about
   policy transfer, which provides a more nuanced account of policy
   transfer from the US to the NHS than the crude term
   ``Americanization{''}.},

Title = {The Ambivalent Effect of Autocratization on Domestic Terrorism},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 20},
Abstract = {This study asks if a decline of democratic regime attributes affects the
   volume of domestic terrorism. We argue that different forms of
   autocratization may stimulate or suppress terrorist activities.
   Democratic backsliding may dampen domestic terrorism, while autocratic
   consolidation may make autocracies more vulnerable to terrorism. This
   study empirically tests these assumptions on time-series cross-sectional
   data on domestic terrorism in 182 countries between 1970 and 2020 with a
   difference-in-differences design. We find that democratic backsliding
   reduces the amount of terrorism in the short to medium term. Autocratic
   consolidation increases the number of terrorist attacks in the short to
   medium term.},

Abstract = {This article argues that while nationalist discourses construct ``the
   people{''} through positive identity practices, populist discourses
   articulate it through negative identity practices. Nationalism
   emphasizes who ``the people{''} are, by identifying a number of core
   positive characteristics that they share, such as ethnicity, language,
   culture, history, religion, or political rights and civic traditions.
   Populism, on the other hand, defines ``the people{''} primarily in a
   negative fashion in opposition to the elites. Here, ``the people{''} do
   not share any positive characteristics beyond their oppression,
   exclusion, and marginalization by the elites. In order to empirically
   demonstrate the above distinction, I compare the political discourse of
   Rafael Correa in Ecuador during his first term in office (2007-2012)
   with that of Victor Orban in Hungary, primarily during his second term
   in office (2010-2014). The comparison between these two political
   projects not only spells out important differences between populist and
   nationalist articulations of ``the people{''} but also highlights
   different types of anti-system politics that have emerged in Latin
   America and Eastern Europe.},

Abstract = {This article locates Martin Frobisher's voyages to the North American
   Arctic in 1576, 1577 and 1578 in relation to the thought of Jamaican
   critic and theorist Sylvia Wynter. For Wynter, the post-Columbian
   settlement and colonisation of the Americas functioned as both a
   crucible and proving ground for a new, racialised understanding of the
   human, which she calls `Man'. Focusing on expeditionary narratives
   written by sailors on Frobisher's three voyages to Baffin Island, the
   article treats these narratives as examples of travel writing, a genre
   occupying the mobile, labile threshold between history and fiction which
   has often mediated the comprehension of difference, hierarchy and
   (international) order. Focusing on these texts' treatments of race and
   otherness, the article argues that the Arctic was a key site where the
   terms of relationality governing English interaction with the so-called
   `New World' and its people were hesitatingly, clumsily and often
   violently worked out.},

Title = {Regulating algorithmic discrimination through adjudication: the Court of
   Justice of the European Union on discrimination in algorithmic profiling
   based on PNR data},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {This article considers the Court of Justice of the European Union's
   assessment and regulation of risks of discrimination in the context of
   algorithmic profiling based on Passenger Name Records data (PNR data).
   On the June 21, 2022 the court delivered a landmark judgment in Ligue
   des Droits Humains pertaining to discrimination and algorithmic
   profiling in a border security context. The CJEU identifies and seeks to
   regulate several risks of discrimination in relation to the automated
   processing of PNR data, the manual review of the results of this
   processing, and the resulting decisions taken by competent authorities.
   It interpreted whether the PNR Directive that lays down the legal basis
   for such profiling was compatible with the fundamental right to privacy,
   the right to data protection, and the right to non-discrimination. In
   its judgment, the CJEU seems to insufficiently assess various risks of
   discrimination. In particular, it overlooks risks relating to data
   quality and representativeness, automation bias, and practical
   difficulties in identifying discrimination. The judges also seem to
   prescribe safeguards against discrimination without guidance as to how
   to ensure their uniform and effective implementation. Such shortcomings
   can be observed in relation to ensuring the non-discriminatory nature of
   law enforcement databases, preventing indirectly discriminatory
   profiling practices based on collected PNR data, and configuring
   effective human-in-the-loop and transparency safeguards. This landmark
   judgement represents an important step in addressing algorithmic
   discrimination through CJEU adjudication. However, the CJEUs inability
   to sufficiently address the risks of discrimination in the context of
   algorithmic profiling based on the PNR Directive raises a broader
   concern. Namely, whether the CJEU is adequately equipped to combat
   algorithmic discrimination in the broader realm of European border
   security where algorithmic profiling is becoming increasingly
   commonplace.},

Abstract = {Environmental conservation has become a key climate mitigation strategy
   in the last two decades. Through the multiplication of `conservation'
   projects, Africa is one of the main centres of this kind of
   intervention. While scholars have shown conservation to be a vehicle for
   the advancement of capitalist interests, scarce attention has been paid
   to agrarian labour and class dynamics in the African countryside
   sustaining this development. Drawing on the authors' research in West
   Senegal, this article develops a conceptual framework for integrating
   class and peasant labour in the study of capitalist conservation. It
   shows how conservation-related climate mitigation strategies in Africa
   nurture and are nurtured by neoliberal and imperialist processes of
   agrarian change, reinforcing the economic and political vulnerability of
   African peasants. Alternative, anti-imperial climate change mitigation
   strategies need to be centred around peasant environmentalisms and their
   liberation from labour oppression.
   La conservation de l'environnement est devenue une strategie cle
   d'attenuation du changement climatique au cours des deux dernieres
   decennies. L'Afrique est l'un des principaux centres de ce type
   d'intervention grace a la multiplication de projets de << conservation
   >>. Tandis que des chercheurs ont montre que la conservation etait un
   moyen au service d'interets capitalistes, peu d'attention a ete accordee
   a la main-d'oe uvre agraire et aux dynamiques de classe dans les
   campagnes africaines qui soutiennent ce developpement. S'appuyant sur
   les recherches menees par les auteurs dans l'ouest du Senegal, nous
   developpons un cadre conceptuel permettant d'integrer la classe et le
   travail paysan dans l'etude de la conservation capitaliste. Nous
   montrons comment les strategies d'attenuation du climat liees a la
   conservation en Afrique nourrissent et sont nourries par les processus
   neoliberaux et imperialistes de changement agraire, renforcant ainsi la
   vulnerabilite economique et politique des paysans africains. Des
   strategies alternatives et anti-imperiales d'attenuation du changement
   climatique devraient etre centrees sur les ecologismes paysans et leur
   liberation de l'oppression du travail.
   A conservacao ambiental tornou-se uma estrategia chave de mitigacao
   climatica nas ultimas duas decadas. africa e um dos principais focos
   deste tipo de intervencao, atraves da multiplicacao de projectos de
   `conservacao'. Apesar de varios estudos academicos terem demonstrado que
   a conservacao e um veiculo para o avanco de agendas capitalistas, pouca
   atencao tem sido dada ao trabalho agrario e as dinamicas de classe nas
   zonas rurais africanas que sustentam este desenvolvimento. A partir de
   investigacao no oeste do Senegal, neste texto desenvolvemos um quadro
   conceptual para a integracao de classe e trabalho campones no estudo da
   conservacao capitalista. Mostramos como as estrategias de mitigacao
   climatica relacionadas com a conservacao em africa alimentam e sao
   alimentadas por processos neoliberais e imperialistas de mudanca
   agraria, reforcando assim a vulnerabilidade economica e politica dos
   camponeses africanos. Estrategias alternativas e anti-imperiais de
   mitigacao das alteracoes climaticas devem centrar-se nos ambientalismos
   camponeses e na sua libertacao da opressao laboral.},

Abstract = {This research seeks to elucidate the role of two historical figures of
   Chilean Pentecostalism, W. C. Hoover and Manuel Umana, in the
   construction of patriarchadicy as the foundational and pervasive
   ideology of Pentecostalism. Our theoretical approach is based on the
   structuralist constructivism of Berger and Bourdieu. Berger allows us to
   consider religion from the standpoint of theodicy and Bourdieu from that
   of masculine dominance. Both of them have allowed us to generate a new
   conceptual proposal, which we have called patriarchadicy: an ideology
   vindicating the superiority of men and the inferiority of women as
   religious leaders. According to it, man's physical strength is
   interwoven with the moral strength of woman; man's moral weakness, with
   the physical weakness of woman. Thus, the socio-ecclesiastico-familial
   organicism is reinvented to generate an assumed ontological
   complementarity of man-head-leader and idoneous woman-hand-helpmeet. Our
   methodology has included a review of the two institutional publications,
   Chile Pentecostal: (1910-1927) and its second period (1933-1979), and
   Fuego de Pentecostes (1928-2019).},

Abstract = {Thailand established district-level collaborations to improve citizens'
   quality of life and promote self-governance. Despite successful
   district-level collaborations to improve the quality of life (QoL) of
   older people through long-term care (LTC) policies, a lack of analysis
   of the collaborative process across the country persisted. To address
   this gap in knowledge, this study aimed to analyze the collaborative
   process at the district level in implementing LTC activities in
   Thailand. In this study, qualitative research was employed to collect
   data through in-depth interviews and non-participating observations
   during collaborative meetings in four regions of Thailand. The findings
   of this study indicate that in Thailand, district level collaboration
   was overseen by the Committee for the Improvement of the Quality of Life
   at the District Level (CIQ), which comprised representatives from the
   public, private, and civil sectors. The CIQ was responsible for
   improving the QoL of older people and its activities included member
   selection, appointment, problem identification, problem prioritization,
   problem-solving planning, task delegation, joint operation, and
   monitoring. This collaboration was implemented in accordance with legal
   preferences for decentralization and has contributed to the effective
   and appropriate implementation of LTC operations. Furthermore, the
   collaborative approach utilized in this study may also be applicable to
   other collaborative operations.},

Abstract = {In the context of Russia's war in Ukraine, the status of neutrality or
   military non-alignment is facing deeper challenges since its expected
   demise in the post-Cold War period. This article explores the gendered
   and emotional politics of neutrality and its relationship to peace and
   security. Neutrality has consistently been conceived as an irrational
   security option for weak states that refuse to bandwagon. `Hegemonic' or
   `disciplining' discourses of neutrality have conditioned current debates
   about alliances and security threats, and are imbued with gendered
   binaries and logics. Such discourses - textual, visual and other - are
   important because they reveal how neutrality has been positioned in
   relation to war, peace, morality and agency, and how such positioning
   constrained the possibilities for thinking about the `peace potential'
   of neutrality. However, the gendered and emotive history of neutrality
   also contains a complexity that can be overlooked if simply understood
   in terms of binary discourses of weakness and irrationality. Inverted
   gender and emotional codings are also at work in discourses about
   neutrality. Seeing this complexity in terms of gender and emotions is
   critically important for conceptualising peace and security beyond
   narrow confines.},

Abstract = {In March 2019 the European Union adopted the first pan-European
   investment screening framework, thus joining the bandwagon of growing
   investment screening mechanisms around the world. This article explores
   why the European screening framework was adopted swiftly and with no
   politicisation, even as the negotiations unfolded against the background
   of heightened politicisation of trade and investment policy. The paper
   develops three expectations: (1) converging member state preferences;
   (2) securitisation of investment policy; and (3) Commission
   entrepreneurship. It then explores them empirically through
   process-tracing, drawing on extensive interviews with the actors
   involved. We argue that the European Commission played a pivotal role.
   To avoid falling into another strand of politicisation and to defuse
   political mines, the Commission engaged in a `pre-emptive
   depoliticization' strategy that shortened the policy process, limited
   the number of actors involved, and justified the policy options in a
   legalistic framing.},

Title = {The Key Role of Political Prisoners in Transcending Protracted Conflicts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {Resolving protracted, asymmetric, and ethno-national conflicts is a
   notoriously problematic process, and only a handful of such attempts
   have ended in success. This paper is the first comparative study
   examining the relevance of ``politically motivated violent offenders{''}
   (PMVOs) in propelling the shift from a long and bloody armed struggle to
   a negotiated agreement; indeed, they play an indispensable role in the
   ratification and the eventual implementation of any such agreement. We
   compare the role of PMVOs in three cases of protracted conflict
   resolution processes in the 1990s-Northern Ireland, South Africa, and
   the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo Accords. We argue that PMVOs constitute a
   distinguished socio-political actor characterized by high symbolic
   capital as the embodiment of the national struggle. This renders them a
   major source of political legitimacy, a necessary condition for
   attaining peace with hitherto sworn enemies and securing its
   implementation and stabilization. The paper analyzes the provisions
   within the respective agreements pertaining to prisoners' release as an
   incentive, or lack thereof, especially for organizations outside the
   peace process to cease violence. Whereas the British and South African
   governments fully recognized the PMVO issue, Israel's failure to
   recognize its importance was a major factor leading to the breakdown of
   the Oslo process.
   La resolucion de conflictos prolongados, asimetricos y etnonacionales es
   un proceso notoriamente problematico, y solo algunos de los intentos de
   resolverlos lo han conseguido con exito. Este articulo es el primer
   estudio comparativo que estudia la relevancia que tienen los <<
   delincuentes violentos por motivos politicos >> (PMVO, por sus siglas en
   ingles) en materia de impulsar el cambio desde una lucha armada larga y
   sangrienta a un acuerdo negociado. De hecho, los PMVO desempenan un
   papel indispensable en la ratificacion y en la eventual aplicacion de
   cualquier acuerdo de ese tipo. Comparamos el papel que juegan los PMVO
   en tres casos de procesos prolongados de resolucion de conflictos que
   tuvieron lugar en la decada de 1990: Irlanda del Norte, Sudafrica y los
   Acuerdos de Oslo entre israelies y palestinos. Argumentamos que los PMVO
   constituyen un agente sociopolitico distinguido caracterizado por un
   capital de alto nivel simbolico como es la encarnacion de la lucha
   nacional. Esto los convierte en una fuente importante de legitimidad
   politica, una condicion necesaria para lograr la paz con enemigos que
   habian sido jurados hasta ese momento y asegurar la implementacion y la
   estabilizacion de la paz. El articulo analiza las disposiciones de los
   respectivos acuerdos relativas a la liberacion de prisioneros como
   incentivo, o como falta de el, especialmente para que las organizaciones
   ajenas al proceso de paz cesen la violencia. Mientras que los Gobiernos
   britanico y sudafricano reconocieron plenamente la cuestion de los PMVO,
   el hecho de que Israel no reconociera su importancia fue un factor
   importante que condujo a la ruptura del proceso de Oslo.
   La resolution des conflits ethniques nationaux, asymetriques et de
   longue duree constitue un processus problematique notoire, et seule une
   poignee de ces tentatives se sont couronnees de succes. Cet article
   contient la premiere etude comparative qui analyse la pertinence des <<
   delinquants violents a la motivation politique >> (DVMP) quand il s'agit
   d'accelerer le passage d'une lutte armee longue et sanglante a la
   negociation d'un accord. En effet, ils jouent un role indispensable dans
   la ratification et l'application d'un tel accord. Nous comparons le role
   des DVMP dans trois cas de processus de resolution de conflit de longue
   duree dans les annees 1990 : les accords d'Irlande du Nord, d'Afrique du
   Sud et d'Oslo sur le conflit israelo-palestinien. Nous affirmons que les
   DVMP correspondent a un acteur sociopolitique distinct, caracterise par
   un capital symbolique eleve, car ils incarnent la lutte nationale. Aussi
   constituent-ils une source majeure de legitimite politique, une
   condition necessaire pour atteindre la paix avec des ennemis jures
   historiques et garantir son application et sa stabilisation. Cet article
   analyse les dispositions de chaque accord relativement a la liberation
   de prisonniers comme incitation, ou leur absence, notamment pour les
   organisations en dehors du processus de paix visant a mettre un terme
   aux violences. Quand les gouvernements britanniques et sud-africains
   reconnaissaient bel et bien la problematique des DVMP, le fait qu'Israel
   n'ait pas admis son importance explique largement l'echec du processus
   d'Oslo.},

Abstract = {Scholars increasingly emphasize personal biographical characteristics of
   leaders in explaining patterns of foreign policy behavior. This article
   extends insights from this agenda to study how (dis)similarities in the
   background characteristics of leaders at the dyadic level shape
   international conflict outcomes. Trust and uncertainty are central to
   explaining conflict via their connections to commitment- and
   information-related causes of war. Psychological research provides
   evidence that perceived similarities between individuals and groups can
   foment trust and cooperation. We hypothesize that leaders who share more
   similar backgrounds and life experiences form stronger social bonds and
   are more trusting of one another. As such, leaders who have more in
   common with one another should be able to better manage diplomatic
   disputes and avoid conflict. We test this hypothesis using a new measure
   of dyadic-leader-level similarity created with the Leader Experience and
   Attribute Descriptions (LEAD) dataset and data on international conflict
   onset in politically relevant dyads throughout the period 1946-2004. We
   find that pairs of leaders with more similar backgrounds are
   significantly less likely to experience militarized interstate disputes
   at all levels of hostility even after accounting for a variety of
   observable and unobservable determinants of conflict. The findings
   contribute to our understanding of the determinants of international
   conflict and help advance research on linkages between psychological and
   rationalist approaches to studying conflict.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe paper aims to explore the problems related to the financial
   management of municipal corporations in India and to suggest
   solutions.Design/methodology/approachThe study is based on primary data
   collected from a sample of 577 employees of municipal corporations
   working in four metro cities of India, namely Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata,
   and Delhi. Data were put through exploratory and confirmatory factor
   analysis for problem identification and inferences were classified and
   grouped to map the solutions for these problems.FindingsThe study found
   that municipal corporations in India face four major problems or issues
   in their financial management. These problems are mainly related to the
   four dimensions: Power, Interruptions, Finances, and Resources. The
   model used to explore these four types of issues is named as ``PIFR
   model{''} by the author.Originality/valueThe findings suggest that
   real-world problems can be represented through a conceptual model that
   helps in identifying practical suggestions which can be implemented by
   municipal corporations at the ground level for better financial
   management.},

Abstract = {The teaching and the learning of research fieldwork constitute an added
   value for novice researchers in social sciences. In African societies
   marked by colonial history, the presence of learners and researchers
   makes it possible for them to become more aware of the unequal social
   relationships appearing during field research. With the Covid-19
   pandemic, the teaching of field research took place remotely, generating
   several educational challenges among which the role of local
   facilitators, the implementation of the main ethical principles and the
   relationships between apprentice researchers and participants when
   conducting the research. Inequalities in social relationships while
   doing fieldwork appear more clearly since learners have an abstract
   understand-- ing of it. These different issues will be addressed based
   on the experience of a field research course taking place in Senegal
   during the 2020-2021 health crisis with students from a Canadian
   university.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to reveal the association between task conflict
   and job satisfaction with the mediating role of incivility and the
   moderating role of self-esteem. In addition, the data collected from the
   UK and Turkey were analyzed separately, and the aim was to contribute to
   the literature in this field by analyzing the research model in a
   cultural context. Design/methodology/approachThis research focuses on
   the relationship between managers and subordinates in organizations. In
   this study, a survey method was applied to 708 subordinates, both UK and
   Turkish citizens, working in nine different industries. The obtained
   data were first analyzed in combination; then, the data of both
   countries were analyzed separately, and the effect of cultural
   differences on the research model was investigated.> FindingsAccording
   to the results obtained, the relationship between task conflict and job
   satisfaction is negative, and subordinates' perceptions of incivility
   play a mediating role in this relationship. In addition, subordinates'
   self-esteem level has a moderating role in the effect of task conflict
   on job satisfaction through incivility. However, there is no evidence of
   an effect of culture on this model. Originality/valueThis study
   contributes to the literature by presenting new evidence on the
   antecedents of job satisfaction. In addition, it is one of the
   pioneering studies that provides evidence of the impact of the
   perceptions and personal characteristics of disputants in a task
   conflict on task conflict outcomes. Furthermore, this study contributes
   to the limited cross-cultural studies in the conflict and job
   satisfaction literature.},

Abstract = {Wartime violence and authoritarian repression against civilians take
   various forms. Past research has explored the causes and consequences of
   violence, but no previous work simultaneously assessed the long-term
   effects of different types of violence on political identities. This
   paper contends that indiscriminate attacks can reinforce ingroup
   identity, whereas the role of civilian agency in selective violence may
   have a detrimental impact. Equipped with original data capturing
   municipality-level exposure to both selective and indiscriminate
   violence during the Spanish civil war (1936-1939) in Biscay (Basque
   Country), this study examines its legacy on voting behavior (1983-2015).
   Results indicate that fascist airstrikes increased Basque nationalism
   while selective violence diminished the popularity of Basque parties.
   Individual and community-level evidence suggests that airstrikes
   fostered the intergenerational transmission of political attitudes.
   Violence can boost national identities, but it can also erode them: it
   depends on the type.},

Abstract = {Despite enduring prolonged skepticism, Africa's regional human rights
   has a complex architecture of institutions, norms, procedures, and
   jurisprudence. A major entity among these institutions is the African
   Court on Human and Peoples' Rights. In existence for over one and a half
   decades, the Court remains an institution in transition. With an
   identity defined mostly by its contentious jurisdiction, the
   significance of its advisory jurisdiction has been neglected. Three
   hundred eight cases (95.36 percent) of the 323 cases received by the
   court in its first fifteen years were contentious. The remaining fifteen
   (less than 5 percent) were advisory. Notwithstanding its relative
   rarity, the initial evidence suggests that advisory jurisdiction of the
   African Court could potentially play a significant role in shaping the
   trajec- tory of human rights norms in Africa. This article explores the
   mechanics and potential impact of the advisory jurisdiction of the
   African Court for the future of human rights in Africa.},

Abstract = {Regarding organizational justice, performance appraisal (PA) systems are
   among the most crucial mechanisms shaping the employee work experience.
   Nonetheless, research has mostly neglected to explain the relationship
   between the characteristics of PA systems, employees' perceptions of PA
   justice, and work engagement in the public sector. Based on a
   combination of observational and experimental data from 11 public sector
   organizations in Italy, this article aims to unfold the nature of these
   relationships. Following the recent calls for diversified methodological
   designs, a combination of structural equation modeling with a discrete
   choice experiment is provided. The results show that designing PA
   systems with rater-ratee feedback sessions and calibration mechanisms
   leads to fairer perceived PAs, with PA justice being associated with
   public employees' work engagement.},

Abstract = {Researchers and policymakers have increasingly recognized foreign
   fighter mobilization as a national security threat to foreign states and
   domestic populations. Yet, scholars remain divided on the motivations of
   foreign combatants, arguing that fighters may be motivated by
   grievances, opportunity, or material incentives. The motivations of
   foreign fighters may be especially complex, as they are engaging in a
   conflict outside of their state. I analyze how historical and
   present-day group exclusionary policies and opportunity shape
   mobilization. To do so, I leverage novel data consisting of individual
   fighter data of Islamic State volunteers fighting in Iraq and Syria.
   Consistent with my theoretical framework, I find that a higher rate of
   Islamic State fighters come from areas where Sunni Muslims were denied
   access to political power and have greater state capacity.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyse the working conditions of Venezuelan
   migrants, who participate in delivery work in Argentina, based on a
   conceptual discussion on the `precarisation' processes of migrant
   workers in the countries of the global south. The labour conditions of
   workers in South America have historically deteriorated for several
   decades, but its effects have intensified after the COVID-19 pandemic.
   This analysis is focused on the dynamics of Venezuelan migrant labour
   within digital platforms in Buenos Aires, contrasting data obtained
   between 2019 and 2020 from two surveys and interviews conducted with
   this population. Drawing upon contributions from the sociology of
   migration and the sociology of work, this article seeks to understand
   how irregularised migrants employed in the platform work, at the
   intersection of super-exploitation and super-exposure to contagion, have
   been brutally affected by the expansion of delivery work.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 has been unprecedented in many ways, including the drastic
   changes to the activities and behaviors that shape our everyday lives,
   particularly the practice of physical distancing and self-isolation.
   Moreover, the pandemic has highlighted the damaging effects of going
   ``stir crazy,{''} loneliness, and the restrictions on people's civil
   liberties, as demonstrated by the impact that self-isolation is having
   on people's mental health and well-being. However, the science behind
   self-isolation and quarantine is designed to prevent the spread of
   disease and to save lives. Meanwhile, prisoners and prisoner's rights
   advocates have long been arguing that the curtailment of civil liberties
   in prisons, especially the use of solitary confinement, is a human
   rights violation and is intentionally designed to be punitive and proven
   to have devastating effects on one's mental (and physiological) health.
   Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic has helped to highlight the need to
   revisit the practice of solitary confinement in prisons. In this
   article, by using Orlando Patterson's theory on social death, I will
   examine the practice of solitary confinement, and the detrimental impact
   it has on one's health amid this ``new normal.{''}},

Title = {When international rituals go wrong: How ritual failure undermines
   peaceful change in NATO},
Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {290-307},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recent International Relations scholarship has emphasized the
   significance of ritual and emotion in international politics. Much less
   attention has been paid to instances of ritual failure. Ritual failure
   refers to the occurrence of deliberate mistakes, errors or sabotage to
   contest the sociocultural boundaries, hierarchies and structures
   underlying international rituals. In this article, I argue that ritual
   is an emotion transformer that generates a sense of community among
   North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members. Successful ritual
   makes community members experience `we-feeling', which underpins
   peaceful change in a security community. NATO members carry the
   group-aroused emotions for a time and come out of the ritual encounter
   feeling strong and confident. Conversely, a failed ritual lowers the
   confidence of community members because they do not experience
   `we-feeling'. I suggest that this explains the internal divisions and
   anxieties when rituals go wrong, such as during Trump's infamous speech
   in front of the new NATO headquarters in 2017.y},

   episodes of regime transformation (ERT) from 1900 to 2019 and offers
   novel insights into regime change over the past 120 years. The ERT has
   three main advantages over other approaches. First, it avoids
   problematic assumptions of unit homogeneity and constant as well as
   symmetric effects. Second, it integrates key insights from qualitative
   studies by treating regime change as a gradual and uncertain process.
   Third, the ERT is based on a unified framework for studying regime
   transformation in either direction. The dataset differentiates between
   four broad types of regime transformation: liberalization in
   autocracies, democratic deepening in democracies, and autocratization in
   both democracies and autocracies (democratic and autocratic regression).
   It further distinguishes ten patterns with distinct outcomes, including
   standard depictions of regime change (i.e. democratic transition or
   breakdown). A minority (32\%) of ERTs produce a regime transition, with
   the majority of episodes either ending before a transition takes place
   or not having the potential for such a transition (i.e. further
   democratization in democratic regimes or further autocratization in
   autocratic regimes). We also provide comparisons to other datasets,
   illustrative case studies to demonstrate face validity, and a discussion
   about how the ERT framework can be applied in peace research.},

Abstract = {This article examines the influence of the renowned Indo-Pakistani
   thinker and activist Abu al-A'la al-Mawdudi (1903-1979) on the political
   thought of two contemporary Arab Islamist thinkers: Sheikh Yusuf
   al-Qaradawi (1926-) and Sayyid Qutb (1906-1966). In his extensive
   discourse on politics, Mawdudi resurrected and popularized two
   intersecting notions: the Islamic state and God's sovereignty
   (hakimiyyat Allah, or hakimiyya). Borrowing these two pivotal Islamist
   notions from Mawdudi, Qaradawi and Qutb utilized them to construct
   contending perspectives on politics and society in majority-Muslim
   states. The article argues that the divergent views of Qaradawi and Qutb
   can be attributed, at least in part, to the fluidity of Mawdudi's
   notions of the Islamic state and hakimiyya, and their pliability to
   different interpretations. This fluidity helps explain the different
   stances of Qaradawi and Qutb on whether, or not, hakimiyya is compatible
   with popular sovereignty and democracy. Furthermore, the article
   underscores the cross-fertilization of ideas between the Arab and
   non-Arab (in this case South Asian) parts of the Islamic World.},

Journal = {CRITICAL MILITARY STUDIES},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {This article develops our knowledge of war preparations in Critical
   Military Studies (CMS) by studying visual representations of the
   Romanian armed forces' military training. It draws on feminist and
   critical military geography to examine geopolitical imaginations that
   shape, and are shaped, by actors, places, and landscapes of military
   exercises. While arguing that war preparations are (geo)political
   practices of power that produce identity, space, and violence, this
   article opens two new directions in the CMS literature. Firstly, it
   explores the role of ethnicity in constituting militarized masculinity
   within military alliances. Specifically, this article shows that
   exercises envisage the Romanian military as an actor that blends ancient
   Dacian heroism with technological prowess. This image helps both the
   Romanian armed forces and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
   to present themselves as strong and credible military actors. Secondly,
   it develops our understanding of the spatial construction of
   militarization. Specifically, it shows that military preparedness
   animates discourses of Easternness and Westernness, whose coexistence
   constitutes Romania as a key NATO ally while erasing its past
   (Socialist) support for peace, anti-militarism, and anti-imperialism.
   The article contributes to our geographical knowledge of the
   intersections between militarism, postsocialism and postcolonialism in
   feminist and critical military studies.},

Abstract = {Rally-intensive campaigns have been one of the main characteristics of
   elections and political parties' communication and organising practices
   in Tanzania (Paget, 2019). However, due to a changing political
   landscape - intensified authoritarianism from 2016 - opposition
   political parties have had to think of new ways of mobilising and
   organising. These new ways of political mobilising and organising had an
   impact on opposition parties' election ground campaign. In this article,
   I explore and analyse the campaigns of Chadema, the main opposition
   party in Tanzania, in the 2020 general election. Through participant
   observation, personal experiences, interviews, and documentary sources.
   I examine the new campaigning activity, which I describe as a walking
   rally, deployed by Chadema's parliamentary candidates. The article
   contributes to the studies on electioneering and campaigning in
   sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, the study adds to relatively sparse
   analyses of African opposition parties' mobilisation, organising, and
   campaigning practices.},

Abstract = {Scholars tend to present either face-to-face or mediatised audiences as
   the principal target for election campaign rallies. However, a close eye
   on the staging of, and popular engagement with, campaign rallies during
   Kenya's 2022 elections reveals that they constituted a hybrid form of
   political communication that simultaneously targeted face-to-face and
   mediatised audiences with tailored messages. Not only were rallies at
   all levels characterised by such hybridity but also at the presidential
   level, rallies came to dominate candidates' diaries and the traditional
   and social media coverage of them leading to what I coin a rally-centric
   campaign. This paper analyses these empirical realities and the
   implications for how we should study and conceptualise election rallies
   and campaigns. It does so by focusing on the relationship between
   rallies, media coverage and popular engagement with a particular focus
   on social media.},

Abstract = {The present article advances a conceptual framework for the critical
   study of the representation of war and military violence. Essentially,
   it offers a conceptualization of dis/appearances of violence in public
   discourse, which combines the concepts of in/visibilization,
   de/naturalization, and dis/identification. Though they overlap and
   interweave in terms of what they capture, all three are considered
   relevant to fully elaborate how violence may dis/appear in narratives on
   war-like operations. Furthermore, the article exemplifies how one may
   make use of the conceptual framework, by exploring the representation of
   violence in Swedish public political debate at the time of active
   engagement in peace-enforcement and offensive military operations. More
   specifically, the empirical illustration critically examines the
   parliamentary debates on ONUC in Congo 1960-1964 and ISAF in Afghanistan
   2002-2014. The analysis reveals and details how violence continuously
   tends to disappear as a reality, as a dilemma and/or as Sweden's own
   practice and choice. At present, the scholarly debate mainly focuses on
   the US or the UK. To advance our understanding of the ways in which
   violence is normalized and made possible, we need refined conceptual
   tools that allow us to explore the complexity and political work of
   representations of war and violence in various contexts.},

Abstract = {What are the legacies of violence on women's political representation?
   This article examines the long-term effects of a watershed conflict of
   the twentieth century: the Khmer Rouge genocide, during which 50-70
   percent of Cambodia's working-age men were killed. Using original data
   on mass killings and economic and political conditions in Cambodian
   communes, the authors find that genocide exposure is positively
   associated with women's economic advancement and current-day indicators
   of women's representation in local-level elected office. The authors
   conduct in-depth, ethnographic interviews with genocide survivors to
   explore the mechanisms by which violence spurred women into elected
   office. A crucial finding emerges: In areas that suffered the genocide's
   worst killings, widows obtained economic autonomy, providing a template
   for the economic advancement of women in traditional households with
   surviving men. The shift in norms regarding the sexual division of labor
   and its transmission through intracommunal and intergenerational
   pathways allowed women to adopt larger public roles over time in
   communities more exposed to genocide violence.},

Abstract = {Policy makers have increasingly relied on performance ranking regimes
   based on information collected through public complaint systems to
   improve grassroots governments' accountability, transparency, and
   responsiveness. This article contributes to the existing literature by
   examining whether grassroots governments strategically adjust their
   responsiveness according to their ranking positions and the number of
   their peers that are supervised by the same superior government (i.e.,
   span of control). To test the theorized relationships, we built an
   original panel dataset consisting of monthly responsiveness information
   and socioeconomic and leadership characteristics of 333 grassroots
   governments in Beijing, China from February 2019 to December 2020. Our
   empirical findings consistently show that having a high/low ranking is
   associated with a decrease/increase in grassroots governments'
   responsiveness in the next period. Additionally, as the span of control
   increases, the effect of ranking position on responsiveness changes
   among grassroots governments weakens. A series of robustness checks were
   used to validate the theorized relationships.},

Abstract = {Why do authoritarian states sometimes play up dangerous international
   crises and embarrassing diplomatic incidents in domestic propaganda? Is
   it to mobilize, threaten, divert, or pacify? Recent studies in
   comparative politics have focused on regime legitimacy and stability as
   key drivers of authoritarian propaganda practices, leaving aside other
   possible motivations such as mobilization of the regime's domestic
   allies or strategic signaling aimed at foreign audiences. Foreign policy
   analysts, meanwhile, have emphasized international dimensions of the
   propaganda behavior of China-the contemporary world's most powerful and
   technologically sophisticated authoritarian state-but have often
   mistakenly framed complementary theories as competing alternative
   explanations. This article argues that once the multiple domestic and
   international audiences for authoritarian propaganda are brought into
   view, many supposedly competing explanations turn out to be logically
   compatible and, in many cases, mutually reinforcing. We identify four
   sets of explanations-mobilization, signaling, diversion, and
   pacification-first showing how they fit together logically, before
   illustrating their convergence in the PRC's otherwise puzzling
   high-intensity propaganda campaign in 2016 over the Philippines vs.
   China arbitration on the South China Sea.},

Abstract = {Since the end of the Cold War, the notion of global security, and
   presumed threats to it, has undergone considerable expansion and
   diversification. This process has been led by the United Nations
   Security Council (UNSC), where active deliberations concerning
   ``threat(s) to the peace{''} have taken place among major international
   actors. Despite a sizable accumulation of scholarly arguments, however,
   the defining features of the structure and dynamics of the post-Cold War
   security discourse remain ambiguous. To address these ambiguities, this
   study investigates the entire body of Council deliberations over the
   past three decades. Based on an original dataset consisting of policy
   statements delivered at the UNSC, the study employs quantitative text
   analysis tools, including word embedding, to examine how council members
   have conceived the notion of security threat in terms of the various
   issues and entities discussed. It shows the security discourse at the
   UNSC to be highly stratified and reveals the persistent and pervasive
   influence of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass
   destruction, which constitute the limited common grounds shared by the
   Council's permanent members. These findings caution against the
   unconstrained use of certain theoretical constructs widely employed in
   other works, most notably, ``securitization{''} and ``interpretative
   community.{''}},

Abstract = {In this article, I propose a return to Jacques Lacan, I develop a
   Lacanian discourse analysis (LDA) as one possible method in
   international relations and demonstrate its potential by sketching out
   the case of climate change policy within the European Union. Lacan's
   theory of the four discourses as conceptual ``mind maps{''} informs a
   method of discourse analysis enabling researchers to empirically
   investigate how a hegemonic discourse can be challenged and potentially
   subverted. A Lacanian perspective emphasizes the ``subject of the
   enunciation{''} and conceptualizes subjects as socially produced but
   lacking: Discourse provides an historicized socio-linguistic structure
   sustaining the subject's societal relations, but the speaking activity
   always produces a cut within subjectivity, which manifests as an
   excess-loss of meaning in the enunciation. Via the case study of the
   energy efficiency policy in the EU, I first illustrate how an LDA allows
   us to investigate climate knowledge and the authority of the discourse.
   Then, by looking at how energy efficiency is spoken in the enunciation,
   I expose the excess of meaning produced as an effect of language, which
   ``fractures{''} the discourse. Finally, I show how to leverage on these
   produced fractures to assess the transformative and empowering potential
   of the observed discourse.},

Abstract = {In this essay, I argue that any competent group agent must be a wanton.
   The impetus for this claim is an argument Arthur Applbaum makes in
   Legitimacy: The Right to Rule in a Wanton World that a formal
   institution (in this case, a government) can, under the right
   conditions, function as a free moral group agent. I begin by explaining
   Harry Frankfurt's classic account of wantonism-not just for the benefit
   of readers who might not be familiar with the concept, but also to
   emphasize aspects of the concept relevant for the consideration of group
   agency. I then draw on the contemporary literature on group agency to
   argue that any successful group agent will be a wanton. I then turn to
   Applbaum's account of group agency to argue that his proposed mechanisms
   for free moral group agency do not successfully overcome the challenge
   of wantonism. I close the essay by briefly addressing some of the
   ramifications of my argument for Applbaum's larger project in
   Legitimacy. I argue that, after rejecting the flawed account of free
   moral group agency, we can productively recover some of Applbaum's key
   insights within a revised account of political legitimacy.},

Abstract = {The politics of international finance for coal power plants have
   intensified since the 2015 Paris climate agreement was negotiated. Over
   the past few years, Japan and South Korea have signaled their intent not
   to fund new coal projects overseas, leaving China and its Belt and Road
   Initiative as the `financier of last resort.' In September 2021, China
   too announced its intent to stop providing finance for overseas coal
   projects. What accounts for their decision to cease financing overseas
   coal projects despite prominent differences in political systems, degree
   of internationalization of their financial systems, and economic size?
   Drawing on datasets of coal projects and financing supplemented by case
   material and interviews, this paper explores the dynamics of coal export
   finance and how the combination of international reputational pressures
   and declining demand for coal finance diminished the domestic support
   for incumbent coal exporters in all three countries.},

Abstract = {This paper reflects on Africa's new green revolution (NGR) movement by
   drawing data from Ghana as an illustrative case to assess the benefits
   and challenges of NGR and discuss the long-term environmental
   implications of NGR interventions. We draw insights from agrarian change
   theory to understand the complexity of local, national, and
   international factors that interact to produce changes in agricultural
   systems that affect smallholder farmers in poor settings. Data were
   collected using qualitative methods based on the lived experiences of
   farmers and analyzed to understand farmers' perspectives. We identified
   increased yield and income levels as crucial benefits of the NGR.
   Politicization and excessive bureaucracy resulting in perennial delays
   in the delivery of inputs emerged as critical challenges to the NGR.
   These findings have implications for the social environment (including
   the transformation of traditional gender roles and the erosion of
   traditional knowledge systems) and the physical environment (including
   forest degradation and the depletion of beneficial soil microbial
   organisms), which may erode short-term gains of the NGR and compromise
   broader scale environmental sustainability goals. Critical steps are
   needed toward consolidating actors and innovations for sustainable
   agriculture in Africa if global ecological management and poverty
   reduction objectives are to be achieved consistently with the principles
   of environmental sustainability.},

Abstract = {With the rise of China and the deepening of China-EU interactions, it is
   crucial for both China and the EU to know the Chinese public perceptions
   of the EU and what factors influence the formation of perceptions, to
   enhance mutual understanding. Given the increasing role of social media
   in the political process, this study hypothesizes that social media use
   is a strong predictor for Chinese public perceptions of the EU and
   China-EU relations. We analyze the effects by utilizing original public
   opinion survey data collected in China in 2020. Our findings show that
   social media use as well as socioeconomic factors together predict
   Chinese public perceptions of the EU and China-EU relations. However,
   social media use effects vary across different social media platforms.},

Title = {Caring is sharing: Why independent commissions in post-conflict
   societies have power-sharing arrangements},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {5},
Pages = {760-777},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The inclusion of conflict parties in independent commissions through
   power-sharing has been found to reduce the reoccurrence of conflict.
   Yet, the theoretical and empirical literature explaining why independent
   commissions include power-sharing is very limited. Previous publications
   have focused on in-depth case studies that explain how power-sharing
   prevents conflict recurrence in specific post-conflict societies but do
   not provide a general argument or widescale testing beyond individual
   case studies. This article provides a new systematic, general
   theoretical argument and novel empirical testing that explains why there
   is power-sharing on some commissions but not others. We argue that
   conflict parties adopt power-sharing provisions in independent
   commissions because doing so allows them to overcome significant
   credible commitments problems that are inherent to the ending of
   intrastate conflict. Using a new and comprehensive dataset, Independent
   Commissions in Post-Conflict Societies, which includes information on
   580 commissions (1990-2016), this article applies a combination of
   decision trees and regression analysis to test our hypotheses. The
   findings indicate that power-sharing is adopted where credible
   commitment problems are acute and show that commissions working on
   political or security issues and those with monitoring or verification
   roles, or that work on the implementation of peace agreements, are more
   likely to include power-sharing arrangements.},

Abstract = {Research frequently contends that support for democracy is a
   comparatively stable attitude. A previously neglected explanation for
   this finding is that regime preferences rest on deeply rooted
   psychological foundations. This article develops theoretical arguments
   about how the big five personality traits relate to democratic regime
   preferences in consolidated democracies, and presents empirical evidence
   using original survey data for six Western European countries. The
   results show that democratic regime support is substantively higher for
   more open, conscientious and agreeable individuals, but slightly lower
   for more extraverted and neurotic individuals. In addition, it
   highlights that it is important not to conflate support for democracy
   with authoritarianism, which the previous literature has frequently
   turned to for personality roots of anti-democratic sentiments. While
   authoritarianism also goes along with lower openness to experience,
   conscientiousness displays an opposite relationship, increasing
   pro-democratic attitudes but also individuals' levels of
   authoritarianism. Thus, findings on authoritarianism should not be
   automatically translated to regime preferences.},

Abstract = {The marketization of schools and of other public services is supposed to
   have changed the relationship of citizens to the state in many Western
   countries over the last 30 years. One explicit aim of marketization has
   been to increase citizen influence over public services. Yet, studies of
   its effects on citizens' willingness to address public decision-making
   remain scarce in general, and nonexistent as regards schools. In this
   study, a survey experiment taps the causal effects of both user choice
   and private provision. The results show that marketization significantly
   reduces respondents' intention to influence schools and related
   political and bureaucratic decision-making. The effects are robust and,
   in contrast to those of previous studies, driven by significant effects
   from the user choice introduced in connection with marketization. The
   pacifying effects recorded suggest that marketization potentially
   reduces public services' responsiveness to citizens' interests, thereby
   aggravating the problems it was meant to address.},

Abstract = {Recent studies of the preliminary reference procedure highlight that the
   Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) defers to national courts
   at higher rates than scholars initially expected. However, we know
   little about how the Court chooses which questions to leave for national
   courts to determine and which ones require its attention. I argue that
   the CJEU evaluates whether a referred question is representative of a
   broader set of cases nascent in European judiciaries. I expect that
   Member States expressing an interest in a reference signal that the
   Court's answer would have an impact on cases in European judiciaries
   beyond the dispute in the referring national court. Drawing on an
   original dataset covering more than 5,000 questions referred to the CJEU
   between 1995 and 2011, I show that the likelihood of the CJEU leaving
   legal questions unresolved decreases with the number of Member States
   submitting briefs to the Court.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on society and many
   governments and politicians were required to make quick decisions to
   protect public health. In reaching these decisions they needed to weigh
   advice from experts in many fields and then ``sell{''} these decisions.
   However little was known at the time about the desires and aspirations
   of their electorates. Here we identify one such source of public
   opinion, signatures to various COVID-19 related Parliamentary
   e-petitions Whilst there were over 1,500 such e-petitions, we identify
   27 common and meaningful topics and show how the strength of these
   topics varies between individual parliamentary constituencies. Using a
   measure of support for each topic in the constituencies we identify five
   constituency groupings. There are two Conservative voting groups,
   ``Middle England{''} and ``Equity of Support{''}, the former are located
   largely in southern England whilst the latter are in the midlands and
   northern England. The groups that show strong support in Labour voting
   constituencies are ones around education and funding issues. This
   article shows how a targeted range of e-petitions can be grouped into
   topics and the popularity of topics established, and thereby function as
   a useful way of augmenting democracy and democratic institutions.},

Title = {Polls of fear? Electoral violence, incumbent strength, and voter turnout
   in Cote d'Ivoire},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},

Abstract = {How, and under what conditions, does electoral violence influence voter
   turnout? Existing research often presumes that electoral violence
   demobilizes voters, but we lack knowledge of the conditions under which
   violence depresses turnout. This study takes a subnational approach to
   probe the moderating effect of local incumbent strength on the
   association between electoral violence and turnout. Based on existing
   work, I argue that electoral violence can reduce voter turnout by
   heightening threat perceptions among voters and eroding public trust in
   the electoral system, thereby raising the expected costs of voting and
   undermining the belief that one's vote matters. Moreover, I propose that
   in elections contested across multiple local rather than a single
   national voting district, the negative effect of electoral violence on
   turnout should be greater in districts where the incumbent is stronger.
   This is because when the incumbent is stronger, voters have lesser
   strategic and purposive incentives to vote than voters in localities
   where the opposition is stronger. I test the argument by combining
   original subnational event data on electoral violence before Cote
   d'Ivoire's 2021 legislative elections with electoral records. The
   results support the main hypothesis and indicate that electoral violence
   was associated with significantly lower voter turnout in voting
   districts where the incumbent was stronger, but not where the opposition
   was stronger. The study contributes new knowledge on the conditions
   under which electoral violence depresses voter turnout, and suggests
   that voters in opposition strongholds can be more resilient to electoral
   violence than often assumed.},

Abstract = {While the energy transition is needed more than ever, for some agents it
   brings significant losses. This article investigates whether fossil fuel
   owners could refer to promises to avoid having their assets stranded. It
   explains how authors, in the context of just transitions, have argued
   for the normative relevance of Rawlsian legitimate expectations, which
   refer to promissory entitlements. However, it argues that the normative
   relevance of promises towards fossil fuel owners is limited, because
   there are only few promises about what will be permissible in the future
   and because these promises should be just before they can lead to
   entitlements.},

Abstract = {In Westminster systems, governments enjoy a privileged position in the
   lawmaking process that they can use to deliver on their campaign
   promises and achieve their policy goals. What policy areas do
   governments seek to affect through lawmaking? How stable is the
   executive lawmaking agenda? How responsive is that agenda to changes
   triggered by elections or by transitions in prime minister? This study
   uses a dataset of 3982 Australian bills introduced between 2000 and 2017
   to answer these questions. While it finds considerable stability in the
   policy content of executive lawmaking agendas, the analysis also
   indicates that Australia's executive lawmaking agenda is more responsive
   to changes in prime minister than to changes in the party in power. As
   the first application of the comparative policy agendas approaches to
   government bills in Australia, this article offers new insights into
   executive lawmaking priorities during an especially turbulent period in
   Australian politics.},

Abstract = {Does the provision of state subsidies to political parties reduce their
   involvement in corruption? Existing research provides inconclusive
   evidence on this relationship, perhaps because cross-national studies on
   public funding and corruption are often limited by regulation-based
   indexes of political financing and by very general corruption measures.
   In this study, we use focused measures for both phenomena to investigate
   whether more generous public funding reduces party corruption. Our
   independent variable reflects the actual cash amount of budgetary
   subventions provided to parties in twenty-seven post-communist
   countries. Our dependent variable of party-centered corruption
   represents the share of firms considerably affected by the informal
   payments made by businesses to political parties and parliamentarians to
   influence their decisions. We find that a higher level of state
   subsidies is associated with a reduction in corruption; its effect
   diminishes as funding increases, and its impact on corruption is lagged.
   However, there is a wide interval of uncertainty around these results.
   In the context of the existing literature, our contribution reduces the
   estimate of the size of a public funding effect and increases the level
   of uncertainty.},

Abstract = {The article aims to analyze and evaluate current trends in the global
   efforts to suppress a unique field in the financing of terrorism -
   terrorist salaries. The study seeks to cast new light on the origins and
   implications of the terrorism economy that deals with salaries, rewards,
   and other benefits paid to terrorists. The purpose of the new policy to
   suppress terrorist salaries is to halt terrorism by disrupting the
   channels of funding and diminishing the economic viability of terrorist
   activity. The policy to suppress terrorist salaries include diverse
   consequences: Humanitarian, security, legal, and economic interests,
   which are contradictory and require a balance between them. The article
   argues that despite objections, the idea to suppress terrorists'
   salaries is established in the global community norms, including the
   International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terror,
   decisions of the Security Council, and domestic laws of Western
   countries. These global efforts are a turning point in the current
   strategies for counter-terrorism financing. This development shows a
   growing acceptance of the need for new and diverse tools to counter
   terror financing.},

Abstract = {The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves through Europe and
   led to rapid policy changes concomitant with variations in citizen
   perceptions. This article analyses how EU public opinion on security and
   defence matters has reacted to the war: what patterns of change and
   continuity can be detected, what differences are visible between Member
   States, and how might those be explained? Our analysis draws on big
   data-based sentiment analysis of news sources, reflecting a widely
   recognized connection between media coverage and public opinion -
   especially during crisis times - and complementing more traditional
   measurements of citizen perceptions such as opinion polls. Broadly
   speaking, we find that the invasion has heightened rather than
   fundamentally altered underlying trends. Our article contributes to a
   growing literature on the acceptability of European integration in
   security and defence, showing that publics are generally supportive of
   it, and regard it as complementary to NATO.},

Abstract = {In this article I share my experience of using William Blake's 1793 poem
   America a Prophecy as a lens to explore the mythic, subconscious and
   literary constructions of military interventions in the Indo-Pacific for
   my painting Australia a Prophecy. For this painting I invited Blake's
   18th century character Orc to travel forward in time to Australia to
   guide an alternative imaginary lens, rather than the conventional
   political, military or international intervention analysis that is
   currently shaping the region where I live. Along the way Blake's poem
   also inspired insights into the complex emotions and desires which seem
   to be driving the masculine messianic archetypal thinking of new global
   conflicts. Using poetry and literature has been part of my visual art
   practice throughout my 36-year artistic practice. I have not followed a
   formal or academic artistic pathway. Instead, I have chosen an
   experimental and experiential journey of self-learning by collaborating
   with artists and researchers on topics as I strive to understand the
   human condition. In my search to identify the hidden narratives that
   underpin our political and military decisions I have used various
   metaphors including Broadway and Hollywood musicals, medieval French
   epic poetry and literary and religious texts. I hope the story behind my
   painting will help to stimulate conversations between experts from
   completely different backgrounds to explore the hidden narratives that
   drive our political and military decisions.},

Title = {Popular Consultations in Colombia: Empowerment, Reaction, and Resistance},
Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {39-64},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Objective/context: This article reconstructs the history of popular
   consultations against extractive activities in Colombia. It aims to
   illustrate how constitutional law affects the repertoires of democratic
   participation available to social movements and resistances.
   Methodology: The article describes and critically analyzes how Colombian
   constitutional law has approached the use of popular consultations
   against extractive activities. This analysis focuses on three moments:
   citizen empowerment, institutional reaction, and informal resistance.
   Conclusions: The history of popular consultations in Colombia shows
   three types of relationship between constitutional law and the
   democratic participation of social movements and resistances: it can
   function as an instrument for the political empowerment of the
   citizenry, as an obstacle that contains democratic participation and
   contributes to political and social exclusion, or as a referent that
   guides informal resistance practices in the face of the closure of
   formal participation mechanisms by state institutions. Originality: This
   article contributes to a more comprehensive description of the uses of
   popular consultations in Colombia and how constitutional law affects the
   participation repertoires of social movements and resistances opposed to
   extractive activities.},

Abstract = {The debate about the effect of decentralisation on the improvement of
   human development still exists, which led scholars to investigate the
   role of government capacity. This study aims to examine the impact of
   local government capacity on human development in Indonesia during the
   decentralisation reform over the period 1996-2020. Multiple regression
   analysis illustrates the role of local government capacity during
   decentralization. In this study, several human development indicators
   has failed to improve during the decentralization process. The failure
   of human development was strongly related to local government capacity
   to produce education, health, and economic outputs and outcomes. Our
   study shows how government can stimulate human development during the
   process of decentralisation by strengthening local government capacity.},

Title = {EU and crisis management: Afghanistan and Ukraine on social media},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 27},
Abstract = {The European Union (EU) is a very relevant actor in the political scene.
   The EU's external action is inspired by the principles of peace and rule
   of law. However, the EU is composed of different institutions and
   leaders, making it difficult to find a single voice. This promotes a
   feeling of remoteness that threatens the legitimacy of the EU political
   system. In recent years, the EU has faced many internal challenges, such
   as the refugee crisis and Brexit, but recent events in Afghanistan and
   Ukraine reveal the need to further our understanding of the role of the
   EU as an international actor. Bearing these trends in mind, this
   research aimed to explore the management of crisis communication by the
   EU leaders regarding the two most recent international events:
   Afghanistan in 2021 and Ukraine in 2022. Specifically, we analyze the
   profiles of Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen), Josep Borrell
   (@JosepBorrellF), and Charles Michel (@eucopresident). Content analysis
   is manually performed on 479 tweets on military conflicts over a general
   sample of 661 messages. The strategies and specific topics are studied
   based on a pretest. In addition, we calculate the impact rate of the
   tweets. In this sense, the data were captured for a 2-month period (15
   August to 15 September 2021 and 24 February to 24 March 2022). As a
   result, we show the predominance of messages on Ukraine together with a
   significantly different action of von der Leyen in terms of strategies
   and employment of the tools of Twitter. Her impact rate is also higher.
   This study contributes to current discussions on the mission of
   communication to foster trust, since the anti-publicity bias of the EU
   requires better levels of coherence to more effectively disseminate
   messages.},

Abstract = {How does self-identification impact warring individuals' attitudes
   towards political compromise? How individuals from different parties to
   a protracted conflict self-identify is more often than not assumed
   rather than tested. This work remedies this deficiency by measuring how
   individuals living within protracted conflict self-identify and the
   implications for willingness to compromise. Based on two surveys (411
   and 2171 participants) conducted in two different periods, we test the
   impact of self-identification on attitudes towards compromise. The
   results problematize scholars' tendency to label dominant identities in
   a conflict in monolithic terms which may be a crucial impasse to
   conflict resolution. The results show a difference in the main
   self-identification that Palestinians, Jordanians, Tunisians and
   Israelis hold; Palestinians, Jordanians, and Tunisians adopt religious
   identification in the context of the conflict and Israeli Jews adopt
   civic-national identification. Religious identification in the different
   groups leads to decreased willingness to compromise, and civic
   identification in a conflict context increases it.},

   a failed progressivism, and therefore it makes no sense to conceptualize

Abstract = {Lessons learned in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis of 2008 include
   that long, punitive household insolvency regimes have a negative
   societal impact, increase the potential for financial instability and
   hamper national economic recovery. We propose the Socio-Economic
   Framework for Household Insolvency System Design as a regulatory
   mechanism that aims to control national household debt and productivity
   levels. The system facilitates an informal resolution of the conflict
   between over-indebted households and their creditors. When this is not
   possible, the system grants immediate relief to no-income, no-assets and
   `honest' households, that experienced over-indebtedness because of an
   external negative shock, such as a medical emergency. Finally, when the
   household does not qualify for immediate relief, the system allocates
   the costs of insolvency between the household and creditors, based on
   responsibility for the over-indebtedness. This reduces the moral hazard.},

Abstract = {This article tests the plausibility of an affect-centered framework for
   foreign policy analysis, using the 2014 annexation of Crimea as an
   illustrative case. It identifies questions left open by prevailing
   accounts based on international relations theory and shows how a
   supplementary conceptual lens can improve existing explanations. The
   affective perspective suggests that the Russian president deemed
   intervention in Ukraine without alternative. Otherwise, Russia would
   have surrendered any claim to relevance in European security. More
   saliently, the ouster of Yanukovych, as a possible precedent for Russia,
   frightened Putin and increased his resolve to take action. Also,
   contrary to the interpretation of the annexation as an improvised
   reaction to a political crisis, evidence suggests that the Russian elite
   welcomed the opportunity to break free from uncomfortable partnership
   dynamics with the West.},

Abstract = {Based on data sources systematically tracking government activity such
   as budgets and bill hearings, the Punctuated Equilibrium Theory
   literature has demonstrated that policy processes in both democracies
   and nondemocracies feature long periods of stasis interrupted by
   dramatic changes. However, there is a lack of research that
   systematically examines China's policy process. In response, this
   article introduces a new dataset drawn from China State Council Gazettes
   from 1980 to 2019 to measure policy punctuations and agenda diversity in
   China. We find that punctuations in China's policy process are more
   intense than those in democracies. The findings further show that
   China's policy process features more positive punctuations than negative
   punctuations. We also find an overall increasing trend of agenda
   diversity and a pattern of alternation between agenda expansion and
   concentration across the forty years analyzed in this paper. These
   findings provide new long-term evidence regarding patterns of policy
   stability and change in the Chinese context and contribute to our
   understanding of China's politics of attention and its linkage with
   information inefficiency and survival politics.},

Title = {Do women leaders of nonprofit public service organisations help to
   reduce the gender pay gap?},

Abstract = {It is often asserted that the representation of women in leadership
   positions within public service organisations is likely to result in
   improved outcomes for other women within those organisations. However,
   there has been little systematic research devoted to understanding
   whether this argument holds for the nonprofit organisations that now
   provide many public services. To cast light on this important issue,
   this article presents an analysis of the representation of women in
   leadership roles and the gender pay gap in Welsh housing associations -
   registered societies responsible for providing more than half of the
   social housing within Wales. The findings show that nonprofit service
   providers led by women in the most senior organisational positions may
   be more likely to have a lower gender pay gap, confirming arguments
   about the importance of actively representing female interests. At the
   same time, it seems that representation in the upper echelons in general
   is not likely to influence gender pay equality, which raises questions
   about whether a glass ceiling may be present, as has been observed in
   state-led public service provision. These findings suggest a need for
   more in-depth, multi-method research which systematically evaluates the
   way in which female leaders actively represent women's interests in the
   myriad organisations that provide public services. This article has
   important implications given a renewed period of austerity in the public
   sector, which, as in the past, may threaten further progress on equality
   for those women who provide and receive public services.},

Abstract = {In this article we look at how people's relations to the media shape
   their anti-establishment, people-centrist and exclusionist populist
   worldviews. We propose to establish the relation between the media and
   populist attitudes by measuring media consumption with citizen's
   attitudes towards a democracy-related function of the media, and we
   postulate that research should consider the peculiarities of political
   situations. The results of a representative public opinion survey in
   Slovenia confirmed a relation between tabloid media consumption,
   negative media attitudes and populist worldviews - however, with
   differences according to specific dimensions of populism, reflecting
   characteristics of an illiberal political landscape in the country.},

   pressure, variation in judicial independence, and asylum recognition

Abstract = {A rise in anti-immigrant pressure can reduce asylum recognition rates,
   irrespective of individuals' protection needs. Independent courts, which
   often act as a safeguard of migrant rights vis-a-vis such pressures,
   have been subject to increasing political interference. Yet, we know
   very little about how variation in the level of judicial independence -
   especially among lower courts - affects policy outcomes. In this paper,
   we assess the impact of anti-immigrant pressure and judicial
   independence on first and final instance refugee status determination
   decisions across 28 European Union member states over a ten-year period
   (2008-2018). We find that the relative independence of courts makes the
   biggest difference in asylum recognition rates at first and final
   instance when levels of anti-immigrant pressure are particularly high.
   This effect can be demonstrated not just regarding asylum appeals, but
   also for first instance decisions, suggesting that independent courts
   can have a liberal `foreshadowing effect' on national asylum agencies.},

Abstract = {The `hybrid warfare' concept had been coined years earlier, but became
   fashionable only when it was adopted and adapted by NATO in 2014, after
   which academic interest suddenly sky-rocketed. Academics often adopted
   NATO's understanding of the concept, took for granted its fit for
   Russian actions, and imported its political assumptions into the
   academic debate. The fashionability of the term also led to bandwagoning
   and thus superficial engagement with both the concept and the phenomenon
   it was applied to. This article outlines this process and its
   implications for the field of Strategic Studies.},

Abstract = {Interregionalism constitutes a main feature of EU external policy and
   unfolds specifically in Africa-EU-relations. However, research has
   merely focused on the EU as a coherent actor, although many EU
   institutions implement cooperation with African partners. Likewise,
   principal-agent research, a prominent path to unpack the internals of EU
   policies, on the EU ` s interregional relations is nascent. This paper
   seeks to fill these research gaps by applying a principal-agent
   framework to internal processes of the EU in its Africa relations. After
   analyzing acts of delegation, it analyzes the discretion of the agents.
   Pointing specifically to the EU-Africa Partnership on Peace and
   Security, the study investigates on principal-agent relations from a
   non-principal-related perspective that puts forward structure-induced
   and interest-induced factors for increased agent discretion. The results
   suggest that agents enjoy substantial discretion enabled by the specific
   environment and agent actions in a policy field of high importance to
   the principals.},

Abstract = {High levels of conflict among coalitions in a policy process are often
   attributed to belief divergence and may lead to policy gridlock. Thus,
   reducing belief divergence may facilitate negotiation and open the door
   for policy change. Beliefs are notoriously difficult to change, however,
   especially in high-conflict settings. Collaborative governance has been
   touted as one method for mitigating conflict to a level where
   negotiation is possible by means including but not limited to belief
   change. This study investigates the relationship between belief
   divergence as a driver of policy conflict and collaborative governance
   as a conflict mitigation tool by analyzing the beliefs of two opposing
   coalitions as they participate in a decade-long collaborative
   environmental governance process that ended in negotiated agreement.
   Using longitudinal survey and interview data, we find that coalitions'
   beliefs diverge more at a later point in the process, due primarily to
   the reinforcement and strengthening of one coalition's beliefs; however,
   we also identify aspects of the collaborative process that helped foster
   negotiated agreement amidst this growing belief divergence. These
   findings can inform scholarship on conflict mitigation in environmental
   governance as well as the design of more effective collaborative
   processes in high-conflict settings.},

Abstract = {The successful closure of arms control negotiations today is conditional
   on the commitment of many more states than during the Cold War. The
   question of what determines states' positions on arms control has
   therefore become increasingly relevant. Multiple scholars have
   identified external security threats by other states as the key
   explanatory factor of opposition to arms control, but empirical evidence
   hereof is so far limited to a small set of cases. Against this backdrop,
   this article carries out a global examination of the effect of external
   threats in the form of interstate disputes and rivalries on state
   support for arms control. This analysis is facilitated by a novel
   measure of arms control support that combines United Nations General
   Assembly voting data with manual coding of 1,178 resolutions. Across a
   variety of model specifications, the results do not show any significant
   effect of external threats on support for arms control. This article
   argues that this means either that the two variables are not related at
   all, or that two opposing mechanisms cancel out each other: arms control
   not only entails costs, but also benefits for states that face external
   threats, as it limits both states involved in a rivalry or dispute.
   Either way, this study challenges the notion that there is a strictly
   negative relationship between external threats and arms control support
   and thus contributes to our understanding of arms control and foreign
   policy making in general.},

Abstract = {In Fall 2014, frontline activists from Ferguson, Missouri traveled to
   Geneva, Switzerland to testify in front of the UN Committee Against
   Torture while the US government appeared before the body. The Ferguson
   to Geneva delega-tion participated in ``shadow reporting,{''} which
   describes opportunities for impacted people to confront the state in a
   multilateral forum and challenge the state's official account. Through
   this practice, ordinary people have an opportunity to shape
   international law based on their experience to suit their interests.
   Shadow reporting is a key platform for a critical form of transnational
   politics and contributes to an evolving view on the political nature of
   international law.},

Journal = {TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Incels ( ``involuntary celibates ``) are online communities of young
   men, broadly aligned by anti-feminism, concern over an inability to form
   sexual relationships with women, and a strong negative focus on their
   own appearance. Incels have been linked to violent misogyny and several
   mass killings. Using critical discourse analysis on data from nine
   different incel online forums, this article explores how incels
   discussed the Plymouth shooting in August 2021, often reported as an
   incel attack, looking at the discourses which are invoked to justify or
   delegitimize violence. As well as violent rhetoric, our research also
   pays attention to anti-violent rhetoric in incel communities, an area
   not yet discussed in the literature regarding incels, but which may be
   invaluable to those hoping to address the issue of incel violence. Our
   findings identify significant differences in the way the shooting is
   discussed across different incel forums, and reveal that both pro and
   anti-violence discourses frequently invoke lookism and mental health to
   justify victimhood.},

Abstract = {Agencification in the EU stretches the confines of the European
   regulatory state to the maximum by extending to policy domains that were
   formerly the exclusive terrain of national institutions. Although the
   challenge to legitimize EU-level agencies is widely acknowledged, scant
   empirical research has been done on the conditions under which EU-level
   epistemic authority prevails or fails. To fill this gap, we examine
   whether EU agencies are perceived as more legitimate when the scientific
   nature of their regulatory outputs is made explicit and whether they
   start facing grave legitimacy challenges when national-level
   stakeholders signal disapproval with their scientific recommendations.
   We draw on a survey experiment with Dutch local politicians to study
   their legitimacy perceptions about the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
   and its mandate to authorize vaccines in view of cross-border health
   security risks. Our data suggest that the EMA is regarded as a highly
   legitimate agency and that disapproval by national-level politicians and
   citizens does not undermine its epistemic authority in the eyes of local
   decision-makers. This study contributes to the scholarship on
   non-majoritarian institutions' legitimation imperatives by introducing
   novel research avenues and analytical tools to continue rigorous
   empirical testing of the well-established theoretical and normative
   claims.},

Title = {War Did Make States: Revisiting the Bellicist Paradigm in Early Modern
   Europe},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},

Volume = {77},

Pages = {324-362},
Abstract = {Charles Tilly's classical claim that ``war made states{''} in early
   modern Europe remains controversial. The ``bellicist{''} paradigm has
   attracted theoretical criticism both within and beyond its original
   domain of applicability. While several recent studies have analyzed the
   internal aspects of Tilly's theory, there have been very few systematic
   attempts to assess its logic with regard to the territorial expansion of
   states. In this paper, we test this key aspect of bellicist theory
   directly by aligning historical data on European state borders with
   conflict data, focusing on the period from 1490 through 1790. Proceeding
   at the systemic, state, and dyadic levels, our analysis confirms that
   warfare did in fact play a crucial role in the territorial expansion of
   European states before (and beyond) the French Revolution.},

Abstract = {W.E.B. Du Bois' theorization of the `wages of whiteness' has factored
   prominently into recent scholarship examining the roots of Trumpism and
   resurgent right-wing movements in the United States. How might the
   `wages of whiteness' shed light on contemporary anti-environmental
   politics? To provide insight into this question, I put Du Bois' Black
   Reconstruction in America, as well as more recent work in whiteness
   studies, into conversation with environmental and social histories of
   the mid-nineteenth century frontier. I observe that struggles over
   access to and control over land and natural resources, and anger over
   exposure to polluted air and water, were central to class and racial
   formation during an historical period that continues to weigh heavily on
   contemporary American politics. I argue that understanding the origins
   and evolution of the natural wages of whiteness can help us develop
   strategies for combating anti-environmentalism and mobilizing in pursuit
   of environmental justice.},

Abstract = {Although policy transparency is praised highly to promote citizen
   compliance, it sometimes loses its effect in practice due to the lack of
   scientific design. To better exploit policy transparency, this study
   examined how the usability of policy transparency promotes citizen
   compliance, and the role of perceived benefit and descriptive social
   norms in this mechanism. The results of an online survey experiment
   conducted in the urban renewal policy domain revealed that, in the
   implementation of the house expropriation policy, easy-to-understand
   policy transparency encourages citizen compliance better, since it
   promotes more perceived benefits. Furthermore, descriptive social norms
   were found to influence the way perceived benefits promote citizen
   compliance; more in detail, negative norms were found to increase, and
   positive norms to decrease, the role of perceived benefit, eventually
   influencing the effectiveness of policy transparency. This research is a
   breakthrough for the effectiveness of policy transparency, emphasizing
   the role of perceived benefit and descriptive social norms in policy
   compliance.},

Abstract = {Some representative bureaucracy literature has suggested that increasing
   the share of female bureaucrats, particularly in supervisory positions,
   would not have a substantial influence on producing policy outcomes in
   favor of female clients because of the potential impact of
   organizational socialization. However, there has been little empirical
   investigation into how passive female representation across hierarchical
   ranks and its interaction influence policy outcomes for women. By
   analyzing data on 360 local U.S. police organizations in 2013 and 2016,
   we found that a higher proportion of female officers in first-line
   supervisory level positions was negatively linked to arrest performance
   for rape offenses, while a higher share of female street-level officers
   was not significantly linked to arrest performance for the same
   offenses. However, we noticed a positive interactive effect of the
   proportion of female street-level officers and female officers at the
   intermediate-level on rape arrests. These results imply that promoting
   female representation across different hierarchical ranks in police
   organizations will help to ensure the benefits of representative
   bureaucracy.},

   An application of image restoration theory},

Abstract = {IntroductionThis study aimed to examine the tactics and strategies of
   Indonesian public officials to restore their reputation after making
   false claims and policies on coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). The
   significance of this study can be separated into two categories. First,
   the application of image restoration theory to public organizations and
   public officials is uncommon. Second, it is essential to analyze the
   application of this theory to diverse social, political, and economic
   contexts of emerging nations; as a result, these distinctions may lead
   to varied research conclusions. MethodologyA dataset of 2,000 Instagram
   posts by Indonesian public officials was generated to conduct the
   content analysis. ResultsThis study found that reducing offensiveness,
   evading responsibility, and taking corrective action are the three most
   commonly seen practices followed by Indonesian public officials. This
   study confirms that denial and mortification are employed exceedingly
   infrequently in non-Western countries because both these strategies are
   believed to diminish the image of public leaders in public view.
   DiscussionThis study presents the practical implications that public
   officials or public relations experts who represent them must be
   cautious since it can have severe implications on their reputation. This
   study also argues that erroneous claims when posted by public officials
   attract unwanted public attention and negatively affect their image.
   Furthermore, this study provides practical implications for public
   officials and their representatives to be more cautious while handling
   media accounts.},

Abstract = {I challenge Strong's findings that student employment is not related to
   attendance. I argue that the original analysis is guilty of controlling
   for a post-treatment variable. As a result, the coefficients in the
   regression model do not show how employment causes changes in
   attendance. I show that employment likely has a negative effect on
   attendance even given severe confounding. Academics should, if asked,
   tell students that their attendance will likely suffer the more paid
   work they do.},

Volume = {67},

Abstract = {In this article, we focus on the process of dis-embedded identification
   (the accentuation and prioritization of the identification with a
   particular subordinate ingroup relative to the identification with the
   relevant superordinate ingroup) among majority members and examine
   possible antecedents and consequences. To this end, we conducted
   research with Catholics in Poland. We hypothesized societal respect for
   Catholics would negatively predict dis-embedded identification, whereas
   intragroup respect would positively predict dis-embedded
   identification-especially under the condition of lacking societal
   respect. We further hypothesized dis-embedded identification to
   positively predict the pursuit of hegemony. These hypotheses are mainly
   based on Honneth's theory of recognition and Turner's
   self-categorization theory. Employing a longitudinal research design and
   latent variable modeling, we obtained supporting evidence for our
   hypotheses. The implications for further research, especially on
   intergroup relations and politics in pluralizing societies, are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Three decades of efforts to secure North Korea's denuclearisation failed
   to arrest Pyongyang's development of a nuclear arsenal. With growing
   dangers of conflict escalation and nuclear use, it is time to consider
   alternative policies that address the reality of North Korea as a
   nuclear possessor state. Comprehensive arms control is worth exploring
   as one potential approach to managing nuclear dangers on the Korean
   Peninsula. Previously, conventional arms-control and denuclearisation
   negotiations with North Korea proceeded in parallel. However, the
   increasing complexity of deterrence resulting from changes in military
   capabilities, especially in South Korea, now necessitates a
   comprehensive process that creates linkages across conventional and
   strategic domains to address not just North Korean and South Korean, but
   also US, capabilities. Though comprehensive arms control promises to be
   politically fraught and technically complex, policymakers and experts
   should debate whether it could yield a more secure Korean Peninsula than
   existing policies that have long since failed.},

Abstract = {It is often pointed out that African states were early and eager
   supporters of the international criminal justice regime. Yet the current
   international legal order is starkly different from the one African
   states had envisioned. By revisiting the archives of two pivotal moments
   in the establishment of the current international legal order-the work
   of the International Legal Commission (ILC) in drafting the Code of
   Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind and negotiations that
   led to the draft statute of the ICC-we find that Africa had proposed a
   different version of the international legal order. I contend that the
   visions African states held were reflective of their experience of
   colonial subjugation. Therefore, the Draft Code and establishment of the
   ICC were meant to provide an avenue for redress, amid a deep mistrust
   between Africa and ``international law.{''} This article offers a
   revisionist historiography of the international criminal justice regime,
   which ``writes Africa in,{''} and presents Africans as challengers and
   advocates of norms and a legal architecture borne out their experience
   of global marginality and the shadow of colonial domination.},

Title = {Less Conflict, More Food Security: A Case Study of Cauca, Colombia},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Number = {3},
Pages = {392-434},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between conflict and food
   security in Cauca, Colombia. We take advantage of a natural experiment
   generated by the 2014 ceasefire declared by the Revolutionary Armed
   Forces of Colombia (FARC), the largest rebel group in the country. The
   ceasefire resulted in a steep decline in FARC-related violence, which
   was further solidified when the Colombian government and FARC reached a
   peace agreement in 2016. We classify our study municipalities in Cauca
   into those highly exposed to FARCrelated violence at baseline (treated)
   and those with low exposure (control). Using difference-in-differences,
   we find that in the short run, households in treated municipalities are
   more food secure than those in control municipalities: the treatment is
   associated with a 51\% drop in the proportion of households experiencing
   hunger. The effects vary within members of the household, with children
   showing larger improvements in diet quality and quantity than adults. We
   also find suggestive evidence that the gains in food security seems to
   have persisted in the medium term, five years after the peace agreement.
   By conducting a case study of Cauca, this study fills an important gap
   in the literature, which has so far obscured local understandings of the
   food security- conflict nexus.},

Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE POLITICA INTERNACIONAL},

Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyze the feminist foreign policy as
   a modern phenomenon in light of the particular features and challenges
   of Brazil's reality. But first, the article contextualizes where the
   idea of a feminist foreign policy comes from. Even though womens make up
   half of the world's population, gender parity in many spaces of power,
   such as diplomacy, is still not a reality. Thus, the so called feminist
   foreign policies aims, among others, to increase the number of female
   diplomats, grant them more visibility and place them in positions of
   power. Since this situation is happening worldwide, the paper aims to
   contribute on how we can think of the possibility of engendering a
   feminist foreign policy specific to Brazil.},

Abstract = {The corporate social responsibility (CSR) landscape of Ukraine's retail
   sector underwent profound and global transformations during the COVID-19
   pandemic and the extensive Russian incursion into Ukraine in 2022. These
   transformations were precipitated by rapid changes in the operational
   activities of the retail sector's enterprises, resulting from
   significant external disruptions. Consequently, the primary objective of
   this study is to analyse the indicators of the CSR status of Ukraine's
   retail enterprises and ascertain the extent of the changes that occurred
   due to the pandemic and Russia's incursion. The study also aims to
   determine the influence of these transformations on CSR initiatives and
   identify key issues within the realm of corporate social responsibility
   in Ukraine's retail sector. To quantify these changes, indicators of CSR
   status encompassing key aspects of corporate social responsibility
   (economic, legal, environmental, and social indicators) were selected
   (Carroll, 1979). To achieve the set objectives, research methods such as
   analysis (measuring CSR indicators), comparison (relating the examined
   indicators chronologically), induction (identifying specific factors
   affecting the overall CSR status of retail enterprises), and deduction
   (determining the nature of the impact of the overall CSR status on its
   individual aspects) were employed. Throughout the investigation, the
   significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic along with the comprehensive
   Russian incursion into Ukraine on the CSR status of retail enterprises
   was revealed. It was observed that enterprises reduced nonessential and
   irrelevant activities at that time not only to support stakeholder
   interests and enhance working conditions for employees, but also to aid
   community support.},

Abstract = {Ine Eriksen Soreide was Norway's Minister of Foreign Affairs during four
   of the seven years between the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and
   the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. She had to develop the traditional
   Norwegian balancing act between rejection and accommodation under
   different conditions than those of her predecessors. Despite security
   challenges, worrying political developments internally in Russia and
   quite a few controversial incidents, the contact between the two
   countries gradually became more similar to what it had been before 2014.
   Soreide herself emphasised this when she resigned in 2021.},

   Threshold of the Twenty-First Century},
Series = {Central European Value Studies},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {381},
Pages = {245-262},
Abstract = {Karel Hruby identifies what motivated Masaryk to seek a political
   agenda. This agenda was an answer to The Czech Question. While the
   meaning of human existence given in The Czech Question is a timeless
   indicator of our journey through history, the political agenda is based
   on a specific state of the nation and corresponds to its needs,
   opportunities, desires, and limits at a given time. It establishes the
   basic tasks of society and its politics in order to enable a dignified
   material, mental, and cultural life in truth and moral purity. The Czech
   Question attempts to find a new idea to motivate political changes
   through a moral revival of the Czech Lands. The aim is to attain
   European maturity in all areas of life. The main thesis of Masaryk's
   Czech Question is humanism, which became a forceful argument for
   Masaryk's state building program particularly after the First World War.
   An essential prerequisite for ``external{''} politics was Masaryk's
   internal revival, which he wanted to use to the join the ranks of
   advanced modern nations. Internal revival here means working on oneself,
   in both politics and daily life.},

Title = {Class Voting and Ideological Polarization in the Presidential Elections
   of Colombia, 2006-2018},
Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {171-202},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Objective/Context: This article has two goals. First and foremost, it
   seeks to demonstrate an increase in class voting during the 2018
   presidential elections in Colombia compared to electoral years 2006,
   2010, and 2014. Second, the article aims to develop a possible
   explanation of this phenomenon. We hypothesize that class voting in the
   2018 presidential elections increased due to growing ideological
   polarization between the two presidential candidates, Ivan Duque and
   Gustavo Petro, both in the left-right and the populist-non-populist
   dimensions. Methodology: We use data from the National Registry of Civil
   Status and maps of socio-economic stratification to identify electoral
   results according to social class in five main Colombian urban centres:
   Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, and Cartagena. To measure class
   voting, we develop the Index of Voting Difference (IVD), which
   identifies the difference in electoral behaviour between two social
   classes. We also compare the difference between expected and observed
   voting for each presidential candidate in the upper, middle, and lower
   classes. Conclusions: There was an evident increase in class voting in
   the 2018 presidential elections in Colombia compared to those of 2006,
   2010, and 2014. Our analysis shows that such a phenomenon could result
   from an increased ideological polarization between the two principal
   presidential candidates, both in the left-right and
   populist-non-populist dimensions. Originality: This is the only article
   we are aware of that explores levels of class voting across different
   presidential elections in Colombia and the relationship between
   ideological polarization and class voting.},

Abstract = {This pioneering study endeavours to ascertain how the Covid-19 pandemic
   impacted on digitalisation in the European Union member states. The
   second objective is to elucidate the ties between digitalisation and
   security in terms of military spending, security threats, and the
   government effectiveness. Whilst using hierarchical clustering, it was
   detected that the era of pandemic had diversified the EU member states
   even more. The fixed-effect model confirmed that changes in
   digitalisation had been associated solely with government effectiveness.},

Title = {Political Dynamics in Ukraine After Russia's Full-Scale Invasion},
Journal = {STUDIA EUROPEJSKIE-STUDIES IN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {93-107},
Abstract = {This study examines the intricate shifts in political competition during
   the period of martial law in Ukraine, with a focus on alterations in
   dynamics and their potential implications for the post-war political
   landscape. Employing data from reputable institutions, parliamentary
   voting records, and analyses of current events, this study aims to
   provide insights into the extent of changes in political competition and
   its influence on the upcoming party system configuration. The analysis
   reveals noteworthy patterns, such as the shift in legislative focus
   towards foreign policy and defence post-full-scale invasion, and the
   increased parliamentary support for the Ukrainian president's
   initiatives, largely due to personal influence rather than party
   affiliations. The study also examines the evolving voting dynamics in
   parliament, characterised by two distinct periods, shedding light on the
   challenges of securing crucial votes for significant bills. In light of
   these findings, this study emphasises the importance of a
   well-thoughtout action plan to restore the electoral process in post-war
   Ukraine, taking into account the challenges posed by the current
   electoral system and regional variations in voter turnout. The study
   concludes by highlighting the need for intensive support for Ukraine's
   military efforts as the primary means of ensuring a quick return to the

Abstract = {Migration and asylum are two of the most challenging issues in Europe.
   With every crisis, new shortcomings are exposed. However, actions taken
   by the European Union and its Member States have proven that common
   migration and asylum policy remains a distant goal. In the presented
   paper, the author analyses developments in the European Union migration
   and asylum policy of 2022, stating that, despite the momentum caused by
   the support given to Ukrainians with temporary protection, hopes for
   comprehensive asylum and migration policy reform should be toned down,
   despite the end of the legislative period looming on the horizon.},

Abstract = {This article is a summing up of Ine Marie Eriksen Sereide's work as
   Norway's foreign minister in the years 2017-2021. The first part
   assesses Sereide's room for manoeuvre. Domestically, this was excellent,
   although Sereide's boss, the prime minister, broke one of her bats for
   domestic reasons and grounded her during the Covid lockdowns.
   Internationally, Sereide had to deal with Donald Trump, arguably the
   weakest and least engaged president the United States has had since its
   civil war. She also had to stand up to the increasingly aggres-sive
   policy of neighbouring Russia. Sereide steered the ship of state with a
   steady hand. She was, however, less than loyal to her employees, and
   demon-strated little creativity. Still, she must be ranked as the best
   foreign minister from the bourgeois side of the floor over the last half
   century.},

   Movement Is Reshaping Representative Democracy},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},

Pages = {1609-1631},

Abstract = {Many citizens are frustrated with their democracy, particularly with
   elected representatives and political parties. In some contexts,
   citizens have taken steps to disrupt the status quo and push forward
   their own novel democratic reforms. Research on these `citizen-led
   democratic innovations' has focused primarily on how political crises
   mobilise citizens to form social movements that then go on to devise or
   co-produce novel participatory institutions. This article expands these
   existing understandings in two novel directions. First, it challenges
   the assumption that for citizens to lead democratic reform they first
   need to mobilise a large protest movement. Second, it expands procedural
   understandings of `democratic innovation' by considering how citizens
   are innovating in and around the core institutions of representative
   democracy. The article draws empirical insights from extensive
   qualitative research into Australia's Community Independents Movement,
   which reveals a place-based, locally led political movement pursuing
   democratic change to improve local representation in national politics.},

Title = {Love, Money, or Fame? Determinants of Turkey's Leader Visits},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {High-level leader visits serve as credible signals in international
   relations, as they not only reveal the priorities of states in foreign
   relations but also convey messages to third parties. Observations of
   Turkey's elevated diplomatic encounters with Iran, China, and Russia
   suggest a potential deviation from the West, while visits to Middle
   Eastern capitals are interpreted as evidence of Turkey's Islamization.
   Beyond these individual cases, is it possible to identify a pattern of
   motivations that determine Turkey's visit dynamics? By constructing a
   novel dataset from primary sources like official state documents,
   ``Turkey Visits,{''} which spans the period from 1989 to 2022, this
   study aims to both characterize the distribution patterns of high-level
   leader visits and investigate the underlying factors that influence
   these patterns.
   Las visitas de alto nivel por parte de los lideres sirven como senales
   creibles dentro de las relaciones internacionales, ya que no solo
   revelan las prioridades de los Estados en materia de relaciones
   exteriores, sino que tambien sirven para transmitir mensajes a terceros.
   Las observaciones que se han llevado a cabo de los encuentros
   diplomaticos de alto nivel por pate de Turquia con Iran, China y Rusia
   sugieren un posible alejamiento de Occidente, mientras que las visitas a
   las capitales de Oriente Medio pueden interpretarse como una evidencia
   de la islamizacion de Turquia. Ademas de estos casos individuales, es
   posible identificar un patron de las motivaciones que determinan la
   dinamica de las visitas por parte de Turquia? Este estudio tiene como
   objetivo caracterizar los patrones de distribucion de las visitas de
   alto nivel por parte de los lideres e investigar los factores
   subyacentes que influyen en estos patrones mediante la elaboracion de un
   nuevo conjunto de datos a partir de fuentes primarias, tales como los
   documentos oficiales del estado, << Visitas por parte de Turquia >>, que
   abarcan el periodo entre 1989 y 2022.
   Les visites de dirigeants de haut niveau constituent des signaux
   credibles en relations internationales, car elles revelent les priorites
   des etats en relations etrangeres, tout en communiquant des messages aux
   tiers. Les rencontres diplomatiques de haut vol de la Turquie avec
   l'Iran, la Chine et la Russie laissent imaginer une potentielle
   deviation de l'Occident, tandis que les visites dans les capitales du
   Moyen-Orient sont interpretees comme des preuves de l'islamisation de la
   Turquie. Au-dela de ces cas isoles, est-il possible d'identifier un
   schema de motivations qui determine la dynamique de visites de la
   Turquie ? En elaborant un ensemble de donnees inedit a partir de sources
   primaires comme des documents officiels d'etats, << Turkey Visits >>
   (Visites de la Turquie), qui s'etend sur la periode 1989-2022, cette
   etude a pour objectif de qualifier les schemas de distribution des
   visites de dirigeants de haut niveau et d'enqueter sur les facteurs
   sous-jacents qui influencent ces schemas.},

Abstract = {Reputation systems promote cooperation in large-scale online markets for
   illegal goods. These so-called cryptomarkets operate on the Dark Web,
   where legal, social, and moral trust-building mechanisms are difficult
   to establish. However, for the reputation mechanism to be effective in
   promoting cooperation, traders have to leave feedback after completed
   transactions in the form of ratings and short texts. Here we investigate
   the motivational landscape of the reputation systems of three large
   cryptomarkets. We employ manual and automatic text mining methods to
   code 2 million feedback texts for a range of motives for leaving
   feedback. We find that next to self-regarding motives and reciprocity,
   moral norms (i.e. unconditional considerations for others' outcomes)
   drive traders' voluntary supply of information to reputation systems.
   Our results show how psychological mechanisms interact with
   organizational features of markets to provide a collective good that
   promotes mutually beneficial economic exchange.},

Abstract = {Contemporaneous theorizing of the Howard School of IR theory on the role
   of white supremacism in WWI implied a more general relationship between
   racial imperialism and global war, which we examine in this essay.
   Taking as its point of departure Rosenau's (1970) admonition that
   mainstream IR seemed to ignore issues of racism in world politics even
   as a `surfeit' of models existed that were applicable to the subject, we
   attempt to show how the `norm against noticing' racism in IR could've
   been addressed utilizing resources available to Rosenau's contemporaries
   more than a half century ago on an issue of major concern to mainstream
   IR at the time (and today): global war. Our analysis of global wars that
   were a major focus of mainstream studies of war during the Cold War era
   (e.g. the War of Jenkins' Ear, the Seven Years War, the Napoleonic Wars,
   WWI and WWII) reveals that racism was attendant to these wars with
   respect to the impact of racial imperialism in each of them.
   Nevertheless, the relationship between racism and global war has been
   largely absent in influential studies in IR; and this absence converges
   not only with the norm against noticing, but calls into question our
   ability to adequately, much less accurately, account for these wars, in
   particular, and to build theory that explains important phenomena in IR,
   more generally.},

Title = {The Women `Behind' the Mujahidin Eastern Indonesia: Negotiating Agency
   and Gender Dynamics},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 15},
Abstract = {Since 2015, the Mujahidin of Eastern Indonesia (Mujahidin Indonesia
   Timur, MIT), a Poso-based terrorist group, has had active female
   members. By July 2020, a total of seven women were convicted on
   terrorism charges. These include the country's first three female
   fighters, the wives of MIT's top leaders, who were trained to use guns
   and run guerrillas in Gunung Biru, a forested mountainous area above
   Poso City. By using the biographical narratives of four female MIT
   members, this article discusses how female jihadis negotiated their
   agency and navigated life pathways before and after joining the MIT
   group. This study employs an ethnographic approach, including
   participant observation and in-depth interviews with informants
   conducted in Poso (2019 and 2021) and Bima (2021). Our fieldwork found
   that most women grew up in moderate Muslim families, then turned to
   adopt extremist ideology in their late adolescence, and subsequently
   intensified their ideology before and after marriage. Although their
   `active role' within the MIT group was a consequence of their engagement
   with male jihadists through marriage, it does not mean the absence of
   agency. We argue that these women were not just passive `extensions' of
   their husbands but exercised their own agency by negotiating gender
   relations. They actively embraced a more radical Islamism, chose to get
   involved with MIT, and, after serving time in prison, they reshaped
   their own life trajectories. Two of them eventually started a new life
   by leaving Poso's extremist network, while the other two opted to stay
   but repositioned their roles within the group.},

Abstract = {The scholarship on green state transformation has harnessed debates on
   the empirical and ideal transformations of the state in the
   Anthropocene, but central banks have thus far been elided from analysis.
   In this article, we draw into focus central banks as pronounced, if
   ill-considered, features of green state transformations in both theory
   and practice. Central banks exemplify the intractability, incrementalism
   and limitations of actually existing green state transformations. Yet
   simultaneously, these institutions of economic governance are, at least
   theoretically, vital constituents of fully fledged green states. In
   addressing the central bank lacuna in the analysis of green state
   transformation, we propose a research agenda at the intersection of
   environmental and monetary politics that centres on (i) the
   institutional variation and convergence of central banks across the
   global economy, (ii) the political-economic and institutional
   constraints on green institutional transformation, and (iii) the
   theoretical constituents and operations of a truly `green' central bank.},

Abstract = {This article explores shifts in workplace festivities in Bulgaria as
   part of the transition from socialism to post-socialism and analyses how
   work celebrations are used to express and uphold the moral economies
   informing them. During the socialist period, labour was glorified and
   work celebrations were a key instrument in the ideological and cultural
   engineering efforts of the state. Since the 1990s, private business
   owners have been reinterpreting and (re-)inventing festive traditions to
   stage their identities and moral orientations in discursive and
   performative ways. Based on in-depth interviews and participant
   observation in industrial production and high-tech companies in
   2017-2019, I argue that highly mediated company celebrations are, in the
   wake of promotional cultures, an opportunity for employers to brand
   themselves as ``good.{''} Such events also model the expectations of a
   ``good employee,{''} for example, to be competitive not only regarding
   one's work but also in having fun, as part of work, which is a
   reflection of the general insistence on happiness in the neoliberal
   workplace.},

Abstract = {The evolution of transnational production in the Asia-Pacific over the
   past few decades has been a force for peace. Critics of globalization
   and proponents of US-China eco-nomic decoupling advocate policies that
   would not only harm the global economy but would increase the likelihood
   of military conflict. This article focuses on the national security
   benefits of US-China economic engagement and the regional economic
   inte-gration of East Asia. Government interventions to protect national
   security and build more resilience in supply chains are needed but
   should be limited in scope so as to avoid fundamental damage to the
   complex economic interdependence that has fostered growth and helped to
   deter war},

Abstract = {This essay focuses on eight reform episodes in the fields of better
   regulation and performance management which were enacted in Italy
   between 1993 and 2018 in the context of four cycles of administrative
   reform. In doing so, the empirical analysis unveils the configuration of
   the network of political advisors who contributed to the design of
   administrative reforms. It also tracks the influence of the context of
   the policy subsystem on the relationship between the configuration of
   the network of political advisors and policy design features. Findings
   reveal that networks of political advisors tend to exhibit a medium
   level of institutionalization and political neutrality. Furthermore,
   policy design has been more sophisticated in the field of better
   regulation under the influence of international organizations and
   domestic stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Climate change is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to
   conflict and instability worldwide, including in conflict-ridden Yemen.
   The article hypothesizes that the complex relationship between conflict
   and climate action obstruction in Yemen is mutually reinforcing, thus,
   forming a vicious cycle. Yemen already faces many difficulties,
   including a lack of food and water, displaced people, and a
   deteriorating economy, all of which have been made worse by the
   conflict. Climate change could make these issues worse, resulting in
   more competition for resources and greater tensions between groups. The
   ongoing conflict in Yemen has been impeding climate action, increasing
   the state's prospects of climate change-induced conflict in the future.
   The article highlights the risk of neglecting the consideration of
   climate change in decision-making and peace efforts in Yemen. Our
   findings underscore the dire necessity to equip Yemen to include climate
   action in state-level peace efforts to break the self-reinforcing
   vicious cycle.},

Title = {Narrative(s) of Return and the Gendered Memory Politics of Post-1989

Abstract = {This article has two main objectives. First, it proposes an analytical
   framework on how to explore ``narratives of return{''} as policy
   proposals and tools of memory politics. Second, it reveals coexisting
   versions of ``return{''} advocated by three Polish political actors: the
   populist right-wing Law and Justice party ({''}Return{''} to the
   Nation), Catholic activists ({''}Return{''} to Religion), and
   representatives of liberal feminism ({''}Return{''} to Women's Rights).
   The case material consists of four policy proposals relating to either
   family or women's reproductive rights. The article shows that all
   analyzed political narratives of return have used some variation of the
   discourse on victimhood, and all of them mean to terrify and raise fear.
   The policy proposals draw on Polish collective memory and, specifically,
   on the politics of memory of the post-1989 transformation.},

Abstract = {This study is among the first to examine the defining characteristics of
   Chinese authoritative experts and their roles in crisis policy response
   by integrating both institutional and multiple-streams framework. The
   study argues that the defining characteristics of authoritative experts
   in China include standing as role models for the public, being
   adaptively embedded into the policy-making system, and usually engaging
   in policy process by becoming a member of a formal experts group.
   Authoritative experts can act as problem brokers in the problem stream,
   as policy advocates in the policy stream, and as legitimacy enhancers in
   politics stream, depending on the nature and dynamics of the crisis and
   the socio-political context. The theoretical argument was based on and
   supported by empirical evidence from China's COVID-19 policy response in
   the early stage.},

Title = {The Double-Edged Sword of State Media Credibility: Experimental Evidence
   from China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 22},
Abstract = {Existing research has shown that pubic trust in state-aligned media
   facilitates political persuasion. However, little is known about how
   media credibility interacts with political trust when governments
   exercise control over media outlets acting as watchdogs. This study
   addresses this research gap by conducting a survey experiment among
   university students using ``real-world{''} scenarios. We investigate
   students' trust preferences when presented with two allegedly detained
   journalists-one affiliated with state media and the other an independent
   citizen reporter. Our experimental findings first confirm the existence
   of a ``state media credibility premium{''} as students reported higher
   trust in the state-affiliated journalist. More importantly, we uncover a
   significant erosion of trust in government bodies when students
   perceived restrictions over state media compared to citizen reporter.
   These results underscore the double-edged implications of state media
   credibility for regime resilience: while aiding political persuasion, it
   can also undermine political support when mouthpieces deviate from state
   directives and trigger media control. By investigating multifaceted
   government-media relations beyond simplistic propaganda assumptions,
   this study provides novel empirical evidence on the complex interplay
   among media credibility, government control, and political trust in the
   Chinese context.},

Abstract = {Despite a growing number of studies on how prior beliefs distort
   citizens' interpretation of performance information for service
   providers, little is known about whether prior beliefs matter equally
   across different services and types of providers. In this study, we
   provide a wide replication and extension of the experimental design used
   in Baekgaard and Serritzlew (2016) with three types of providers
   (public, non-profit, and for-profit) across two services (nursing homes
   and refuse collection). Based on two large-N nationally representative
   experiments (N = 3018 and N = 3020), we find that citizens' sector
   preference does indeed impact their interpretation of performance
   information, corresponding to the original study. However, public sector
   preference plays a substantially different role in the two services. Our
   findings strengthen the external validity of previous research and
   simultaneously identify theoretical boundaries to its application across
   various services and providers. This, we argue, underlines the
   importance of replicating and extending pivotal studies on performance
   information.},

Abstract = {Most of the areas which are beyond national jurisdiction have
   increasingly become contested, not least because of their growing
   importance and the recent `return' of geopolitics. Their boundaries are
   blurred, and their governance has not been settled. The European Union
   (EU) is developing strategies to contribute to the governance of these
   areas: the high seas, the polar regions, the atmosphere, outer space,
   and cyberspace. Its roles remain, however, under-researched. This
   article sets the scene for a special issue that contributes to closing
   that gap. First, it problematizes existing concepts such as Global
   Commons and instead advocates the broader and more neutral analytical
   concept of Global Spaces. Second, it formulates guiding questions that
   the individual contributions subsequently address with different
   theoretical approaches. Third, it offers an overview of the relevant
   major international treaties and EU strategic policies that identifies
   the EU as a latecomer to the governance of Global Spaces.},

Abstract = {While policy transfer remains a widely used approach for understanding
   public policy formation, several conceptual shortcomings limit the
   approach's capacity for explanation. Notably, the concept of ``transfer
   pathway{''} lacks a precise conceptual definition and empirical
   specification, limitations reflecting broader gaps in the policy
   transfer literature. This article contributes to the study of policy
   transfer by explicitly defining transfer pathway and demonstrating how a
   more expansive transfer pathway conceptualization can increase
   analytical granularity. Conceptual insights developed here are
   empirically applied to U.S. State Department announcements in late 2020
   to sell armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), first to the United Arab
   Emirates and then Morocco. Such cases illustrate two novel transfer
   pathways, the tortuous pathway and the foreign policy pathway, offering
   a sketch of how governments transfer policies in the foreign and
   security policy domain. By employing process tracing, specific causal
   process observations associated with the arms transfer processes in each
   instance can be identified to better understand specific transfer
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {In his essay, Errol Henderson argues that bringing race and racial
   supremacism into explanations for war enables us to better generalize
   about the causes of war. He focuses in particular on realist theorizing,
   which, in all its variants, has tended to dominate the study of war in
   mainstream IR. He uses Waltz's and Gilpin's theorizing about the
   function of anarchy and power distributions in accounting for war to
   show how the ``norm against noticing{''} leads to an incomplete
   understanding of great power war. I look at another key concept in
   realist (and contractual liberal theorizing) about the origins of
   conflict - the security dilemma - to theorize how racism can generate
   insecurity spirals between countries. The security dilemma has typically
   been characterized as an insecurity spiral between two security-seeking
   states, generated by uncertainty about the intentions of others which,
   in turn, is generated by anarchy. To get from anarchy to uncertainty to
   insecurity spirals, however, requires fear of Other, an emotional and
   social psychological state. But, in fact, as Jennifer Mitzen and Randall
   Schweller have argued, security dilemmas are mainly characterized by
   inaccurate certainty about Self and Other's intentions. Perhaps the most
   inaccurate certainties that groups can have about Self and Other are
   beliefs about racial supremacy, and expressed in racial stereotypes.
   Racism is a worldview that is certain and incorrect about the allegedly
   inherent traits and characteristics (including malign intent) of a
   racialized Other. Re-conceptualizing security dilemmas as rooted in
   Self's development of inter-group identity difference, and certainty
   about these differences, opens the theoretical door to examining how one
   such source of perceived identity difference - racism - affects the
   probability of war. This essay, draws on social psychological and social
   neuroscience theories, and on empirical evidence of concepts of racial
   and ethnic difference in the United States and the People's Republic of
   China to explore how racialized identity differences may drive the
   life-cycle of a security dilemmas.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to debates on business power, noisy politics,
   and right-wing populism. The populist right weakens strategies of quiet
   politics, which many suggest has led to a steep decline of business
   power. I challenge this view and argue that a combination of innovative
   strategies and ample financial resources allow business associations to
   exercise power in this environment. Drawing on new empirical evidence,
   the article makes three central contributions. First, I suggest that the
   failure of Remain business advocacy in the 2016 Brexit referendum
   resulted from the constraints of administrative legislation (the PPERA),
   weaknesses in campaigning strategies, and the CBI leadership's decision
   to not register as a campaign organization. Second, while my regression
   analysis provides some support for Culpepper's quiet politics argument,
   the Swiss business federation Economiesuisse has won 90\% of the
   referendum campaigns it has led, including many referendums with high
   issue salience against right-wing populists. Third, Economiesuisse shows
   that business strategies of `loud voice' can be successful. With money
   and innovative public-facing campaigning strategies, business
   organizations can win in noisy environments and against right-wing
   populists.},

Abstract = {This article examines the ways in which ethnic and cultural diversity is
   concretely managed in the city of Marseille, a metropolitan area located
   in France, a country that academic literature defines as
   assimilationist. Based on a series of 26 semi-structured interviews and
   on the analysis of municipal archives, it reveals that ethnic, cultural
   and religious organizations are essential actors in local political life
   in Marseille. On one hand, in order to manage their culturally
   heterogeneous city, municipal officials rely on alliances with community
   leaders to maintain legitimacy among the local population. On the other
   hand, community leaders demand symbolic gestures of cultural recognition
   from the mayor in exchange for their political support. This paper,
   inspired by conceptual tools developed by Pierre Bourdieu, builds an
   innovative theoretical framework for analysis of the `social field of
   multiculturalism.' In the process, it sheds light on strategies of
   negotiation and competition among different local actors in the daily
   management of diversity.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Multiparty elections can reduce the likelihood of conflict and help
   dictators secure their rule, but when does a dictator create electoral
   institutions? Existing research finds that one of the major reasons
   regimes introduce multiparty elections is to gain information about
   opposition demands. This article builds on that argument to explain that
   a regime's finances determine whether or not it is able to benefit from
   creating electoral institutions. Dictators use the revenue of the regime
   to invest in different means of deterring opposition rebellion. A
   regime's first priority is to build repressive capacity, after which it
   invests in public spending to buy the support of its winning coalition.
   Regimes only benefit from multiparty elections when they have sufficient
   revenue to fund repressive capacity but lack the finances to also buy
   regime security through massive public spending. Low-revenue regimes
   cannot benefit from elections and high-revenue regimes do not need
   elections to help secure their rule. I test the implications of the
   argument for regime spending and the creation of multiparty electoral
   institutions using a global sample of dictatorships between 1972 and
   2014. The results of the hypothesis tests indicate that as revenue
   increases regimes decrease their shares of spending on repressive
   capacity but increase shares of spending on the public. The results also
   indicate the probability that a regime introduces elections rises as
   revenue increases from a low level, but the probability declines as
   revenue increases from a high level. The study builds upon the
   literature for how regime resources and state capacity influence
   authoritarian strategies of political survival. The findings for
   spending patterns are consistent with recent research on late modern
   regimes, and the results for the emergence of electoral institutions are
   consistent with research that finds dictators must have sufficient
   resources to survive holding elections.},

Abstract = {Several governments in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) have used
   pandemic measures to silence opposition voices and curb human rights.
   This article delvers deeper into this dynamic in Algeria and Tunisia by
   systematically analyzing regime use of preexisting authoritarian legal
   frameworks to target perceived regime opponents. Notably, unlike other
   regimes in the MENA, COVID-19 pandemic-specific laws (such as curfew
   violations) were not heavily relied on to arrest and prosecute prominent
   opponents. Instead, foundational laws that restrict free speech and
   assembly with intentionally vague language, which often date back
   decades, were reused. Several of these laws were enhanced during the
   pandemic to grant the executive more leeway in their use and expanded
   fines and prison sentences. Interestingly, despite the very public use
   of these laws, regimes in both countries have maintained relatively high
   public approval ratings. This is remarkable, given that past autocrats
   were overthrown for similar abuses. This demonstrates that pandemics
   grant aspiring authoritarian regimes greater leeway in the use of
   general legal mechanisms to restrict free speech and assembly. These
   kinds of crises can help maintain approval ratings despite extensive
   oppressive action by the state. This was especially true for Tunisia,
   where it appears that the pandemic created a rally-'round-the-flag
   effect that allowed the executive to consolidate his power in a dramatic
   democratic backslide.},

Abstract = {A consensus seems to exist around physically attractive candidates
   winning elections more often. Unfortunately, we have limited
   understanding of how voters assess candidates with socioeconomically
   (dis)advantageous physical appearances. To bridge this gap, we studied
   the electoral consequences of candidates looking upper class, middle
   class, or working class. Using official electoral data for the 2017
   Finnish municipal elections and a novel data set based on a
   representative sample of the Finnish population (N = 7,920), we found
   that Finnish citizens systematically vote for candidates who look like
   they have (and do have) upper-class occupations. Furthermore, the data
   strongly suggest that a systematic electoral penalty exists,
   particularly for female candidates who look like they have (and do have)
   working-class occupations.},

Title = {The International Recognition of Governments in Practice(s): Creatures,
   Mirages, and Dilemmas in Post-2011 Libya},

Abstract = {The international (non)recognition of governments is a composite macro
   practice that has grown in visibility in recent years in response to
   contentious domestic political processes such as coups d'etat,
   revolutions, and civil wars, yet it remains understudied in
   international relations. Doctrinal debates in international law and
   foreign policy reveal the normative vacuum and normative competition
   that have long surrounded this phenomenon, but say little about its
   specific operation and effects. This article brings together insights
   from recognition theory and international practice theory, and uses
   post-2011 Libya as an in-depth case study, drawing on elite interviews
   with diplomats, international officials, and other practitioners. The
   aim is to sketch a new research agenda by building a generalizable
   typology of smaller-scale government recognition micro practices
   (declaratory, diplomatic, informal engagement, intergovernmental
   cooperation, and support practices), and uncovering their guiding logics
   and consequences. I argue that, first, the international
   (non)recognition of governments is endowed with a distinct generative
   power, as it produces its own creatures through a range of micro
   practices that have identity formation and change, material empowerment,
   political legitimation, and sovereignty line-drawing effects. Secondly,
   it is geopolitically inevitable, as external actors involved in a
   country cannot ultimately avoid engaging with territorially grounded
   domestic political actors. Thirdly, it is not a black-and-white
   situation, as it involves a broad variety of practices guided by
   different, often contradictory logics. Finally, international government
   recognition practices are likely to run into three dilemmas stemming
   from three tensions: international versus domestic recognition,
   legitimacy versus effectiveness, and coherence versus inclusivity in
   conflict mediation.
   El (no) reconocimiento internacional de los Gobiernos es una practica
   compuesta a nivel macro que ha ido creciendo en visibilidad en los
   ultimos anos como respuesta a procesos politicos internos de caracter
   contencioso, tales como golpes de Estado, revoluciones y guerras
   civiles. Sin embargo, esta practica sigue siendo poco estudiada en el
   ambito de las RRII. Los debates doctrinales existentes tanto en el campo
   del derecho internacional como en el campo de la politica exterior
   revelan el vacio y la competencia normativos que han caracterizado
   durante mucho tiempo a este fenomeno. Sin embargo, estos ofrecen poca
   informacion acerca de su funcionamiento y sus efectos especificos. Este
   articulo reune ideas procedentes de la teoria del reconocimiento y de la
   teoria de las practicas internacionales, y utiliza un exhaustivo estudio
   de caso relativo a la Libia posterior a 2011, basado en entrevistas de
   elite con diplomaticos, funcionarios internacionales y otros
   profesionales. El objetivo es esbozar una nueva agenda de investigacion,
   mediante la creacion de una tipologia generalizable de micropracticas en
   materia de reconocimiento gubernamental a menor escala (practicas
   declarativas, diplomaticas, de contacto informal, de cooperacion
   intergubernamental y de apoyo), asi como llegar a descubrir sus logicas
   rectoras y sus consecuencias. Argumentamos que, en primer lugar, el (no)
   reconocimiento internacional de los Gobiernos esta dotado de un poder
   generativo caracteristico, ya que produce sus propias criaturas a traves
   de una serie de micropracticas que tienen efectos de formacion y cambio
   de identidad, de empoderamiento material, de legitimacion politica y de
   trazado de lineas de soberania. En segundo lugar, esto resulta
   geopoliticamente inevitable, ya que los agentes externos involucrados en
   un determinado pais no pueden, en ultima instancia, evitar comprometerse
   con los agentes politicos nacionales territoriales. En tercer lugar, no
   se trata de una situacion de extremos (o blanco o negro), ya que implica
   una amplia variedad de practicas guiadas por logicas diferentes, a
   menudo contradictorias. Por ultimo, es probable que las practicas
   internacionales en materia de reconocimiento gubernamental se enfrenten
   a tres dilemas derivados de tres tensiones: reconocimiento internacional
   frente a reconocimiento interno, legitimidad frente a efectividad, y
   coherencia frente a inclusividad en la mediacion de conflictos.
   La (non-)reconnaissance internationale des gouvernements est une
   macropratique composite qui a gagne en visibilite ces dernieres annees
   en reponse aux processus politiques internes contestes comme les coups
   d'etat, les revolutions et les guerres civiles. Pourtant, elle reste
   sous-etudiee en RI. Les debats quant a la doctrine en droit
   international et en politique etrangere revelent le vide et la
   concurrence normatifs qui ont longtemps entoure ce phenomene, mais en
   disent peu sur le fonctionnement ou les effets specifiques. Cet article
   rassemble des enseignements issus de la theorie de la reconnaissance et
   de la theorie des pratiques internationales, et utilise la Libye
   d'apres-2011 comme etude de cas approfondie, en se fondant sur des
   entretiens avec les elites : diplomates, fonctionnaires internationaux
   et autres professionnels. Il vise a esquisser un nouveau programme de
   recherche en construisant une typologie generalisable de micropratiques
   de reconnaissance de gouvernements de petite echelle (declaratoires,
   diplomatiques, interactions informelles, cooperation
   intergouvernementale et pratiques de soutien) et en revelant leurs
   logiques directrices et consequences. D'abord, j'affirme que la
   (non-)reconnaissance internationale de gouvernements est dotee d'un
   pouvoir de generation distinct, car elle produit ses propres creatures
   par le biais d'un eventail de micropratiques qui possedent des effets de
   formation et de modification de l'identite, d'emancipation materielle,
   de legitimation politique et de fixation de limites de souverainete.
   Puis, elle est inevitable sur le plan geopolitique, car les acteurs
   externes qui interviennent dans un pays ne peuvent pas en dernier
   ressort eviter d'interagir avec les acteurs politiques nationaux et
   ancres territorialement. Ensuite, il ne s'agit pas d'une situation <<
   tout blanc ou tout noir >>, car elle implique un large eventail de
   pratiques, orientees par des logiques differentes, et souvent
   contradictoires. Enfin, les pratiques internationales de reconnaissance
   de gouvernements rencontrent souvent trois dilemmes issus de trois
   tensions : reconnaissance internationale ou nationale, legitimite ou
   efficacite, et coherence ou inclusivite en mediation des conflits.},

Title = {An Analysis of Micro-scale Conflict in Collaborative Governance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 2},
Abstract = {Conflict is the forgotten sibling of collaborative governance. Variably
   framed as an alternative to collaboration, a contextual feature shaping
   interpersonal interactions, or an obstacle to be overcome via
   deliberation, conflict lurks in the background of discourse about
   collaboration. However, few theories of collaboration directly address
   the role of conflict, and those that do focus on conflict as a
   macro-scale phenomenon, characteristic of a governance forum or
   participating organizations. Given the importance of short term,
   person-to-person interactions in shaping the overall trajectory of
   collaborative dynamics and outcomes, a micro-scale analysis of
   collaborative conflict is warranted. This article develops a framework
   for evaluating the role of micro-scale conflict in collaborative
   governance, drawing on the case of negotiations to relicense hydropower
   dams in the Central Valley of California, USA. Data sources include 4
   years of meeting observations, interviews with participating
   stakeholders, and written comments submitted during the process. The
   work first classifies all instances of disagreement observed during the
   negotiations to develop a typology of micro-scale conflict. It then
   compares differences in the frequency, type, and management of
   disagreements in high and low collaboration relicensings to explore the
   interaction between conflict dynamics and overall collaborative
   approach. In the high collaboration case, interpersonal disagreements
   occurred frequently, were more dynamic and mutable over time, and served
   to elaborate and refine management approaches. By evaluating conflict
   dynamics that occur at the scale of an individual interaction and the
   positive and negative roles they play in shaping collaborative outcomes,
   this research moves conflict from being a static barrier or contextual
   factor to a dynamic ingredient that can be managed to shape policy
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {During COVID-19 politics was radically transformed. Even though
   parliaments, parties, and parliamentary groups continued working, they
   did so mainly through digital means. Our aim is to investigate how
   political parties and their elites reacted to those changes. For this
   aim, we launched a pilot survey among party elites in Spain and Italy.
   We use descriptive statistics and multivariate OLS regressions to answer
   to our research questions. Our results point out that parties quickly
   adapted to executive online meetings, but meetings of other
   (representative) organs were far less frequent. As for the elites'
   adaptation and in particular privacy concerns, we find that
   socio-demographic characteristic of the elites matter and being member
   of a digital party are not crucial determinants, as we expected.
   Ideology, on the contrary, play a much relevant role, with right-wing
   elites being more concerned about privacy. Finally, younger and more
   educated respondents are more favorable toward moving some parties'
   activities in the on-line sphere.},

Abstract = {Friedrich Hayek presents a demarchic conception of democracy as a
   solution for what he takes to be the inherently corrupt and totalitarian
   nature of liberal democracy. While still preserving the label `liberal
   representative democracy', this Hayekian demarchy precludes
   parliamentary and governmental institutions from providing positive laws
   and policies on behalf of their constituents where this would require
   the transfer of the private property of individuals. Such laws and
   policies would, on this demarchic conception of liberal democracy,
   undermine individuals' free usufruct. I argue that demarchy's detachment
   from any concern with the well-being of many of its citizens is an
   illiberal and anti-democratic (sub)version of liberal democracy that
   increases populism and risks crushing liberal democracy between the
   pseudo- and anti-liberal support of a totalitarian majoritarian people's
   sovereign power and a minoritarian anti-democratic elite. As such,
   liberal democracy conceived of in Hayekian demarchic terms is itself an
   oppressive totalitarian political theory incapable of preventing an
   increase in illiberal and anti-liberal political forces. Moreover, I
   argue that it is imperative that we acknowledge and appreciate the
   extent to which demarchy undermines, rather than strengthens, liberal
   democracy.},

   during the Cold War. Although Skynet inaugurated a communications
   revolution, it was the product of the longstanding British priority of
   possessing global information networks under sovereign control. In the
   Space Age, however, Britain had to reconcile its desire for an
   autonomous satellite communications network with the reality that
   American assistance was vital.},

Abstract = {Much of the gender pay gap is generated within workplaces, making it
   paramount to understand which workplace policies effectively address
   gaps. Our article asks when policies limit gender pay gaps across
   employee tenure to identify potential temporal weak points. We analyze a
   representative panel of 10,000 establishments with over 850,000
   employees using the 2005-19 waves of German-linked employer-employee
   data (LIAB). Two key findings emerge. First, a temporal perspective on
   workplace policies reveals that no policy under study-formalization,
   identity-based career programs, and child care assistance-reduces gender
   pay gaps at hire. Instead, policies only address additional disparities
   that accumulate after hire. Second, only identity-based career programs
   narrow gender disparities for all women. In contrast, seemingly
   gender-neutral formalization is insufficient, while providing
   employer-sponsored child care has mixed effects depending on employees'
   education. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings
   for organizational policy and future research.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate the role of trust,
   informational support and integrative behaviors in the effective
   outcomes of peer conflict in the
   workplace.Design/methodology/approachDeidentified secondary data were
   provided by a human resource management company that offers conflict
   resolution training. The authors studied a sample of 815 supervisors and
   middle-level managers (51\% female; average age = 40) who reported their
   primary work experience was in the USA. Each respondent described a
   workplace conflict with a peer. A regression-based bootstrapping
   technique was used to test the hypothesized relationships between the
   constructs of trust, informational support, integrative behaviors and
   effective outcomes in peer conflict.FindingsThe relationship between
   trust and the use of integrative behaviors during peer conflict is
   conditional on the availability of informational support, such that
   those who solicit a third party's views are more likely to exhibit
   integrative behaviors during the conflict under study, even at
   relatively lower levels of trust in the conflict
   relationship.Originality/valueIn this study, the authors add to social
   interdependence theory and the role of integrative behaviors by
   proposing the importance of interpersonal trust and informational
   support, which may reduce uncertainty during peer conflict. The authors
   also extend existing literature on cooperation, cooperative approaches
   to managing conflict and integrative behaviors in the workplace by
   examining peer-to-peer organizational conflict.},

Title = {The Role of Social Forgiveness and Non-Forgiveness in Shaping the
   Political Discourse Around Gustavo Petro during the 2022 Colombian
   Presidential Elections},
Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},

Volume = {116},

Abstract = {Objective/context: This article examines the use of emotional
   argumentation patterns of social forgiveness and non-forgiveness
   regarding Gustavo Petro's past in the M-19 movement in the context of
   the 2022 Colombian presidential elections. Methodology: An inductive
   media framing analysis of selected Colombian newspapers was carried out.
   The frames analyzed exemplify the relevance different newspapers have
   attributed to Petro's past in their pre-election coverage. Conclusions:
   This analysis demonstrates that those frames that project a negative
   view of Petro's past carried especially marked patterns of
   non-forgiveness and an accompanying delegitimization of his person and
   political ambitions. The negative portrayal in a particular newspaper
   presented clear patterns of emotional argumentation of politically
   ideological opposition to Petro in contrast to the media landscape in
   general. The other newspapers analyzed, however, revealed a
   predominantly neutral pattern of argumentation that paid attention to
   Petro's past but did not use it judgmentally against him. In relatively
   few cases, the argument of social forgiveness was even used in his
   favor. The results show that, especially for the ideological opposition
   to Petro, reference to his past in the M-19 was considered a legitimate
   means to undermine his political ambitions. However, considering the
   general overall coverage of the newspapers, Petro's past was of marginal
   importance. Originality: This analysis provides insights into how
   Colombian media framed the past of the current Colombian president in
   the M-19 during the 2022 presidential campaign, potentially influencing
   public opinion-making processes. The results can serve as a reference
   for more comprehensive analyses to better understand the role of
   forgiveness and non-forgiveness in the context of political discourses
   in post-conflict states.},

Abstract = {Russia's invasion of Ukraine has not only deeply challenged Russia's
   international standing but has also endangered its fragile domestic
   order. Data from the 2022 Berggruen Governance Index reveals that
   overall state capacity has been stagnating at a fairly low level since
   the beginning of the millennium, while democratic accountability has
   been declining steadily and profoundly. In contrast, the provision of
   public goods has strongly increased during the same period. This puts
   the assumption of the `autocratic fallacy'-the idea that sustained
   public goods delivery relies on democratic accountability in the long
   run-to the test. We argue that Russia's resource abundance allowed for
   the maintenance of a regime-supporting social contract with the
   population. However, the basis of that contract has changed
   significantly due to economic decline, fired by, among other factors,
   several waves of sanctions and the costs of war and will press the
   Russian government to find urgent solutions to sustain a high level of
   public goods provision under such unfavourable conditions.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we explore the relationship between regional powers and
   security norms by examining the influence of the liberal international
   order (LIO) on regional security dynamics in East Asia. In examining the
   influence of the LIO on East Asian nonproliferation norms, the USA and
   its partner nations have displayed a great deal of inconsistency
   regarding nuclear nonproliferation. We contend that this inconsistency
   offers opportunities for regional powers like China to reinforce or
   contest expectations associated with international nuclear norms. Often
   perceived as a stable pillar of the international order, variations in
   nuclear nonproliferation norms from the global to those in East Asia
   suggest a need to reconsider the influence and nature of the ILO on
   regional orders more broadly. Due to the role regional powers play in
   this relationship between the global and regional levels, this research
   also reinforces the continued importance of the Regional Powers Research
   Program.},

Abstract = {Russia's war in Ukraine directly speaks to a core theory in nuclear
   politics: the theory of the nuclear revolution. Whereas this theory
   argues that nuclear weapons inhibit conflict and competition in
   international politics, skeptics of the nuclear revolution argue that
   competition endures in a nuclear world, and that nuclear weapons can
   even enable such competition. This article argues that the
   Russia-Ukraine war challenges expectations of the theory of the nuclear
   revolution, while largely supporting arguments made by the nuclear
   revolution skeptics. Specifically, the article argues that the theory of
   the nuclear revolution cannot explain Russia's use of nuclear threats to
   enable its conventional aggression, nor can it explain the ways in which
   Russia has developed its nuclear posture to provide a bargaining
   advantage in competitive risk-taking scenarios. These findings challenge
   the leading theory in the field of nuclear politics and yield policy
   implications for maintaining nuclear stability during crises.},

Abstract = {What does morality require of individuals in their dating and sex life?
   In this article I challenge recent outlines of antidiscrimination duties
   in the dating sphere and present a plausible alternative: the
   deliberative duty. This duty avoids the risks and limitations of earlier
   outlines: it is time-sensitive regarding the malleability of intimate
   preferences, it avoids being too demanding on the duty-bearer and
   minimizes the risk of generating mere dutiful attraction behavior
   towards right-holders. In addition, it is better suited for universal
   action guidance in the dating sphere than earlier outlines of individual
   antidiscrimination duties.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 21},
Abstract = {The development of the internet has enabled a novel channel for citizens
   to express their opinions and needs, and governments have become more
   responsive to citizens' messages as a result. We performed a
   two-dimensional classification of 3,900 citizen messages from 13 cities
   posed on the Message Board for Leaders platform between 2011 and 2017.
   We then created a hierarchical linear model for cross-level analysis.
   These analyses indicated that local government responses, which was
   found to be highly selective, was significantly influenced by micro- and
   macro-level factors: message characteristics, institutional provision of
   online message processing, and internet penetration rate. In addition,
   macro-level regional variables were found to play a moderating role in
   the impact of each type of citizen message on government responsiveness.},

Abstract = {Much of policy-making involves prioritization-deciding not only what to
   do but also when-and uncertainty-not knowing exactly how the choices
   made will affect actual policy outcomes. I present a theory of dynamic
   prioritization within a hierarchical organization. The model illustrates
   how notions such as an agency's performance, mission, and critical tasks
   are linked with details such as institutional structure and the
   preferences of both front-line bureaucrats and their overseers. The
   theory highlights some reasons why even sincere, representative
   policy-making decisions might appear irrational, inconsistent, or
   ``captured{''} to outside observers. This is in contrast to classical
   ``spatial models{''} of policy that abstract from the more quotidian
   details of how policy is actually made as opposed to simply being
   ``chosen.{''} The theory also generates traditional comparative
   static-style predictions about the features of the policy-making tasks,
   the preferences of bureaucrats and political overseers, and agency
   structure that affect the substance and quality of policy-making.
   Finally, the theory offers a general explanation for why real-world
   agencies employ widely varying processes to organize and implement
   policy-making: optimal policy-making is-in a precise
   sense-{''}sufficiently complicated{''} to render a succinct and robust
   summary of optimal management impossible.},

Abstract = {How does labor emigration affect state-society relations across
   postcolonial states? We argue that the opportunity to pursue employment
   abroad alters a fundamental component of postcolonial states-the
   post-independence social contract. Such states' inability to sustain
   post-independence levels of welfare provision first leads to the
   development of ``emigration management institutions,{''} which seek to
   encourage and regulate citizens' labor emigration, and second, to the
   widening of the ``remittance-welfare gap,{''} where labor emigration and
   remittances outpace state-sponsored welfare provision. These mark the
   emergence of a ``transnational social contract,{''} as states leverage
   access to employment abroad in exchange for social and political
   acquiescence. This de-territorialization of the postcolonial social
   contract leads to de jure and de facto forms of state coercion toward
   its citizens/migrants, who are commodified by the market-based logic of
   transnational neo-patrimonialism. We test this argument through a paired
   comparison and within-case analysis across two postcolonial states in
   South Asia and the Middle East: Nepal and Jordan. We offer an
   interregional, South-South migration analysis and a novel framework of
   understanding the politics of mobility across non-Western states as
   ``migration from below,{''} which acts as a corrective to the dominance
   of South-North migration research in international studies.
   Como afecta la emigracion laboral a las relaciones entre el Estado y la
   sociedad en los Estados poscoloniales? Argumentamos que la oportunidad
   de buscar empleo en el extranjero altera uno de los componentes
   fundamentales de los Estados poscoloniales: el contrato social posterior
   a la independencia. La incapacidad por parte de estos Estados de poder
   mantener el nivel de provision de bienestar posterior a la independencia
   conduce, en primer lugar, al desarrollo de << instituciones de gestion
   de la emigracion >>, que buscan alentar y regular la emigracion laboral
   por parte de los ciudadanos, y, en segundo lugar, a la ampliacion de la
   << brecha entre bienestar y las remesas >>, donde tanto la emigracion
   laboral como las remesas recibidas superan la provision de bienestar
   proporcionada por el Estado. Todo esto provoca el nacimiento de un
   ``contrato social transnacional,{''} debido a que los Estados aprovechan
   este acceso al empleo en el extranjero a cambio de una aquiescencia
   tanto social como politica. Esta desterritorializacion del contrato
   social poscolonial crea nuevas formas, tanto << de iure >> como << de
   facto >>, de coercion estatal hacia sus ciudadanos/migrantes, que son
   mercantilizadas por la logica basada en el mercado del
   neopatrimonialismo transnacional. Demostramos este argumento mediante
   una comparacion pareada y un analisis dentro del caso en dos Estados
   poscoloniales en el sur de Asia y en Medio Oriente: Nepal y Jordania.
   Ofrecemos un analisis interregional de la migracion Sur-Sur y un marco
   novedoso para la comprension de la politica en materia de movilidad
   entre los estados no occidentales como una << migracion desde abajo >>,
   que actua como una medida correctiva al predominio de la investigacion
   sobre la migracion Sur-Norte dentro de los estudios internacionales.
   Comment l'emigration des travailleurs affecte-t-elle les relations entre
   etat et societe chez les etats postcoloniaux ? Nous affirmons que la
   possibilite de chercher du travail a l'etranger modifie une composante
   fondamentale des etats postcoloniaux : le contrat social d'apres
   independance. L'incapacite de ces etats a maintenir le niveau de
   prestations sociales apres l'independance conduit d'abord au
   developpement d'<< institutions de gestion de l'emigration >>, dont le
   but est d'encourager et de reguler l'emigration des citoyens en quete de
   travail. Ensuite, cette situation decoule aussi sur l'elargissement de
   << l'ecart paiement-allocations >> : l'emigration du travail et les
   paiements depassent les prestations sociales de l'etat. Un << contrat
   social transnational >> apparait alors : les etats promettent un travail
   a l'etranger en l'echange d'un assentiment social et politique. Cette
   deterritorialisation du contrat social postcolonial aboutit sur des
   formes de coercition de jure et de facto a l'encontre des
   citoyens/migrants, consideres comme des objets selon une logique de
   marche de neopatrimonialisme transnational. Nous testons cette hypothese
   par le biais d'une comparaison jumelee et d'une analyse interne au cas
   dans deux etats postcoloniaux d'Asie du Sud et du Moyen-Orient : le
   Nepal et la Jordanie. Nous proposons une analyse de la migration Sud-Sud
   interregionale et un cadre inedit de comprehension des politiques de
   mobilite dans les etats non occidentaux comme << migration par le bas
   >>, qui sert de correctif a la domination de la recherche sur la
   migration Sud-Nord dans les etudes internationales.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the Tunisian uprising in 2010-2011, the IMF vowed to
   support democratisation efforts, promising a novel approach attuned to
   the needs of the nation's most marginalised people. However, IMF loan
   agreements garnered controversy for their conditionalities, raising
   doubts about the Fund's `new' strategy and its austerity-focused plans
   for economic restructuring. At the centre of the debt-critical movement,
   the country's leading trade union organisation - the UGTT - positioned
   itself as a fierce opponent to the IMF. Against the backdrop of current
   talks for a new bailout, this briefing revisits the UGTT's stance on two
   major loan agreements that Tunisia entered into after 2010.},

Abstract = {In federal presidential democracies, discretionary transfers are often
   mentioned as a tool used by the national executive to build and
   strengthen subnational support, typically governors. Funds to local
   mayors, however, have been much less studied. With original data, in
   this study we analyze the distribution of a particular discretionary
   transfer (ATN) to the Argentine municipalities during two periods:
   1997-2000 and 2016-2019. We show that the main driver for transfers is
   the mayor's political alignment. Indeed, the president is more likely to
   reward loyal mayors, but especially when both the latter and the
   President oppose the provincial governor. By this token, we highlight a
   nested political game, in which the President considers the loyalty of
   both mayors and governors combined to decide when to reward (or when not
   to reward) municipalities. Furthermore, we find that the Executive
   provides aid to smaller municipalities to circumvent the possibility of
   funding mayors from larger cities who may pose a threat as political
   rivals in the future. Since this pattern is more evident in localities
   with aligned mayors, we can infer that the President's strategy is aimed
   at preventing future challengers from within their own coalition.},

Abstract = {Military doctrine is a form of organisational knowledge. Scholars argue
   that beneath written doctrine lies a set of deeply held beliefs about
   war and warfare that do not change even if the written doctrine does.
   This article explores the relationship between written military
   doctrine, the underlying beliefs about doctrine that govern its
   interpretation and application, and ultimately how militaries operate.
   The analysis is based on fieldwork at a NATO division and 33 interviews
   with commanders and senior staff officers. It suggests a typology that
   can be used to understand variances in doctrine and operational
   differences.},

Abstract = {The impact residents of violence-affected communities can have on
   addressing insecurity is underexplored, particularly amid criminal
   violence. In non-conflict contexts, can non-violent actions by committed
   individuals transform their violent environments given criminal groups'
   social control and capacity to exert violence? Investigating two urban
   neighbourhoods in post-accord Guatemala, the article evidences how
   residents engage in violence disruption, breaking generalised
   self-protection strategies - silence, avoidance and displacement - to
   proactively address local violence. In doing so, residents can attain
   tangible security improvements and foster cohesion, social capital and
   informal leadership - facilitating further collective action. The
   article draws on 47 interviews, triangulated with police data and
   documentary evidence. The article contributes novel empirical evidence
   on the underexplored phenomenon of non-violent engagement with criminal
   groups. Conceptually, the article advances the emerging concept of
   violence disruption as a distinct form of agency and a useful framework
   to neither overlook nor overstate the impact of grassroots strategies.},

Abstract = {Many public services are co-produced through networks of governmental
   and non-governmental organizations that choose to or are obliged to
   contribute resources, a trend that has been reinforced through
   decentralization reforms. We utilize original data for 826 organizations
   across 65 local governance networks to assess how decentralization
   affects resource contributions while accounting for municipality
   context, network environment, and organizational attributes. Drawing on
   a quasi-experimental design in the context of health sector reform in
   Honduras, we find that decentralization is associated with a slight
   reduction in the number of resource ties an organization contributes to
   other organizations in its network. This association is most prominent
   where municipal governments, rather than non-governmental organizations
   (NGOs) or associations, are lead intermediary organizations under
   decentralization. Additionally, NGOs contribute more resource ties
   relative to community associations or public organizations, and
   consistent with a crowding-out dynamic, we find that this relationship
   is attenuated under decentralization. Our results suggest that
   administrative reforms can influence resource contributing behavior by
   organizations and the structure of inter-organizational networks, which
   are important but underemphasized mechanisms potentially linking
   decentralization to service delivery outcomes. This is particularly
   relevant for policymakers working to support network governance for the
   joint production of public services in under-resourced settings.},

Abstract = {While most literature on federal climate change policies has focused on
   failures to adopt broad policies, this article describes and explains
   successes in two important sectors. Regulations to improve the fuel
   economy of motor vehicles and efficiency standards for appliances and
   equipment have produced substantial reductions in greenhouse gas
   emissions, although they largely have other goals and hence can be
   considered implicit climate policies. We synthesize the existing
   literature with our analyses of case studies to offer three explanations
   for the adoption of effective policies in these two sectors. First, the
   policies delivered politically popular co-benefits, such as reducing
   consumers' energy bills, enhancing energy security, and promoting public
   health. Second, they gained business acceptance because they were narrow
   in their scope, avoided longterm economic costs, and helped industry
   cope with state-level regulations; industry often strategically tried to
   influence these policies rather than resist them. Third, the legislation
   that initiated and expanded these policies received bipartisan support,
   which was aided by co-benefits and business acceptance; more recently,
   these laws have been strengthened through the actions of Democratic
   administrations. We conclude by comparing these policy areas to the
   passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to examine the extent to which organizational
   dissent predicts perception of workplace bullying. As previous studies
   have reported inconsistent and sometimes contradictory results regarding
   the interaction between the reporting of bullying and demographic
   variables, these variables are examined in the New Zealand context.
   Organizational communication research provides considerable insight into
   the ways individuals make sense of and resist workplace bullying through
   juxtaposition with the concepts of dissent and intragroup conflict.
   Design/methodology/approachA nationally representative sample of
   managers in New Zealand (n = 239) was conducted. Surveys included
   demographic questions and the following measures: Organizational Dissent
   Scale and Negative Acts Questionnaire Revised Scale. FindingsKey results
   and indications for further research are highlighted by the third model
   in this study. First, workers who reported they engaged in either
   articulated dissent or latent dissent were more likely to perceive
   workplace bullying. Second, workers who are more likely to express
   contrary opinions in the workplace are more likely to recognize,
   acknowledge and tolerate less positive interactions in the workplace
   such as bullying. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors'
   knowledge, this study is the first to analyze dissent and bullying in
   the New Zealand context. Second, this research raises the question of
   whether there is a conflation of work-related bullying behaviors and bad
   leadership styles that may not be targeted (e.g. authoritative
   leadership and micromanaging). Finally, communication research provides
   a distinctive contribution by exploring the narrative form of worker
   responses to perceived bullying. In this manuscript, the authors examine
   potential predictors on the perception of workplace bullying in the
   context of New Zealand, particularly focus on the relationship between
   dissent and the perception of workplace bullying.},

Abstract = {This study explores how urban cultural environments, and particularly
   their cultural provision and forms of participation, can foster cultural
   sustainability in urban communities, namely neighbourhoods.
   Conceptually, the article situates cultural sustainability within the
   concept of community resilience to facilitate an understanding of the
   everyday lives of residents and concerns residents' expectations of the
   cultural environment and opportunities for cultural participation in two
   case neighbourhoods in Jyvaskyla Finland. Drawing on the mixed-methods
   approach of the study our findings show that different cultural
   activities and communities can be central to promoting sustainable urban
   development. Community resilience as a sense of belonging like
   neighbourhood-related identity and also as a sense of ownership of place
   seems strong in various ways, and relation to the cultural participation
   can be identified. However, from urban cultural policy perspective, the
   low-threshold participation and opportunities for grassroots cultural
   activity seem an underexploited resource in the cities, especially when
   the concept of sustainability is under consideration. Moreover, the
   negotiation and communication between community actors and public
   officials deserves a lot of attention while the implementation of urban
   cultural policy is on focus. From urban cultural policy perspective, it
   is important to find new ways to measure the direct and indirect impacts
   of policies. According to findings of the study holistic analysis of
   residents, actors and institutions viewpoints helps us to understand the
   practises and processes related to community resilience. All this
   deserves multidisciplinary research and joint reflection. This approach
   assists to make sense of how urban cultural policy and cultural
   participation can support community resilience at community level.},

Abstract = {Foundations are one of the oldest organizational forms globally; their
   number and resources, as well as their socio-political and economic
   importance, have steadily continued to grow. Yet, foundations'
   attributes, activities, and actual achievements remain underexplored and
   poorly understood. This is particularly noticeable in the context of
   global policy and transnational administration, an area where
   foundations tend to be subliminal players, acting as a widely
   unrecognized socio-political undercurrent. Addressing the resulting need
   for better and alternative conceptualizations of foundations, our paper
   uses French pragmatic sociology of critique (FPSC), a non-structuralist,
   post-Bourdesian, approach to sociology, to theorize philanthropic
   foundations within the policy agora. Through FPSC, we present
   foundations as a composite setup of activity, where critically reflexive
   actors bring normative ideologies and knowledge to policy, providing a
   new avenue for how scholarship can interpret and critique foundations
   and their influence.},

Abstract = {The centralization of decision-making is a common consequence of crisis.
   The academic literature has already highlighted that Italian regions
   were marginalized by the central government during the pandemic crisis,
   despite their competences in the health sector. The article aims to
   further explore the role of regions during the crisis to better
   understand vertical and horizontal intergovernmental relations. The
   research focuses on the analysis of normative sources adopted at the
   central level; agendas, minutes, and documents of the Conferenza
   Stato-Regioni and Conferenza Unificata; agenda and press release of the
   Conferenza delle Regioni. We argue that three factors were needed for
   regions to play a role in decision-making: a regulatory arena, the
   openness of the central government to dialogue, a certain degree of
   regional coalitional capability.},

Abstract = {The growth of the online `manosphere' has raised significant concerns
   regarding the movement's highly misogynistic discourses and related lone
   offender attacks perpetrated by incels. This article employs a digital
   ethnography approach to examine r/IncelExit and r/ExRedPill, two forums
   dedicated to assisting individuals leave the manosphere. Utilizing a
   gendered perspective, this study delves into narratives from these
   forums to engage with theoretical debates on the conceptual need to
   recognize masculine agency. Key focus areas include exploring the
   radicalization and deradicalization processes, along with examination of
   narratives from individuals who use these subreddits to divert from
   joining the manosphere.},

Abstract = {We contribute to the policy trade-offs literature by focusing on a
   principled trade-off that juxtaposes a widely desired objective with a
   moral belief and by examining how education conditions voters' responses
   to this trade-off. Through survey experiments in Indonesia and Tunisia,
   we examine how voters respond to a liberal initiative to relax alcohol
   restrictions to raise revenue for social security and a conservative
   initiative to tighten alcohol restrictions even if it decreases social
   security revenue. We find that voters opposed the liberal initiative and
   that more educated voters supported the conservative initiative more
   than their less educated counterparts. These findings highlight the
   powerful constraints of moral beliefs even in the context of a trade-off
   with a common good and support the socialization perspective of
   education that portrays education as an institution that socializes
   individuals in the society's dominant values-whether liberal or
   conservative-as opposed to simply a force for liberalization.},

Abstract = {In modern urban life, people encounter strangers at every turn. How do
   they negotiate being thrown together into a society of strangers-to be
   among people they do not know and with whose cultures they are
   unfamiliar? Widespread acceptance of informal rules of daily behavior
   enables the acceptance of others-of strangers-as partners in everyday
   social and economic transactions. The term `public' denotes a collective
   of people, linked loosely through acceptance of the primacy of these
   informal rules, shared concern for the general welfare, and a sense of
   which others are rightful members of this collective (and which not).
   Any public set of rules apportions respect in a society. It lays out who
   defers to whom, creating tensions between those respected and those not,
   between those included in the public and those excluded. In the United
   States in the period after World War II, a series of economic and social
   changes brought those tensions to a head and subverted the unity of the
   public.},

Abstract = {This paper builds on an implicit assumption of resource mobilisation
   theory in order to explain why civil society organisations stay on
   policy bandwagons. It demonstrates that, after the initial decision to
   engage with a policy issue, organisational maintenance explains ongoing
   contestation better than the structural factors which encourage them to
   get involved. It also adds three new findings which contribute to the
   existing literature on attention cascades: (1) at the actor level, the
   effect of salience on contestation is often short-lived; (2)
   organisational maintenance encourages factionalisation within groups of
   like-minded policy opponents; and (3) that survival strategies adapted
   to domestic political opportunity structures can limit CSOs' capacity to
   participate in European policy debates. The argument is tested using
   measures of network centrality from an online forum (Twitter) as a
   predictor for ongoing participation in campaigns against the
   Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The findings are of
   immediate relevance to trade scholars seeking to understand the
   reactions of civil society organisations to contestation; interest group
   scholars focused on the determinants of issue prioritisation; and EU
   integration scholars seeking to explain variation in the domestication
   of EU policy issues.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the puzzling case of the unsolicited rocket: a
   Norwegian research establishment successfully developed a weapon system
   that no one wanted or had asked for that was later widely adopted. We
   argue that the `Terne' weapon existed not because it was needed based on
   rational calculations about efficiency, but because of the narratives,
   coalitions, and competitive dynamics that surrounded it and made it
   useful. Conventionally, war and technology are often considered distinct
   `things' with immutable essences, used as variables to explain other
   phenomena, rather than being examined on their own terms. In this case,
   we focus empirically on the configuration of sociotechnical imaginaries,
   and the capacities for action that arise out of it. In foregrounding
   sociotechnical systems, this is not a case of the `militarization' of
   civilian society and research in peacetime. Rather, agency lay in
   competitive networks of narratives and coalitions between technologies,
   individuals, professions, technological communities, military
   organizations, and funding bodies, together shaping how ideas and
   technologies become authoritative and dominant.},

Abstract = {What factors affect the likelihood that violent nonstate actors pursue
   and use chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) weapons?
   What factors make a country at-risk for a CBRN terrorist attack? We
   argue that widespread repressive practices, also termed human rights
   abuses, are especially problematic in the fight to stop the pursuit or
   use of CBRN weapons. Repression by government forces severs ties between
   civilians and their government, leading those with knowledge of attacks
   to refrain from turning over necessary information. We test our argument
   quantitatively using data from the Big Allied and Dangerous Project and
   the Global Terrorism Database. Our results highlight how efforts taken
   to limit the use of repression may be an effective strategy to reduce
   risks of CBRN terrorism.},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes Malay-Muslim insurgents' attacks in the three
   southern provinces of Thailand between the years of 2010-2021 and
   identifies the role of public holidays on the level of violence. The
   existing literature suggests terrorists consider holidays during attack
   planning. However, there is a lack of agreement on the effect direction.
   Some studies have found that holidays are a force for peace while others
   have found they can act as trigger for more violence. Applying
   environmental criminology to the timing of terrorist attacks, we argue
   that the type of the holiday matters. Therefore, we analyze public
   (secular), Islamic, and Buddhist holidays separately. We show that
   Islamic holidays witness increased violence while Buddhist and public
   holidays see reductions. We discuss that Islamic holidays increase the
   Malay-Muslim insurgents' motivation to attack by assigning to those
   dates a higher symbolic value. On the other hand, on Buddhist and public
   holidays, insurgents may hesitate to attack to avoid the adverse effects
   of losing public support and triggering a backlash. The results
   demonstrate the necessity to analyze the temporal dynamics of terrorist
   attacks.},

Abstract = {In the literature, the debt burden in local governments is considered as
   a main predictor of the fiscal distress. The growing indebtedness of the
   municipalities may also negatively affect the business sector.
   Therefore, this paper examines the significance of key financial and
   non-financial debt drivers of local governments based on the example of
   the municipalities functioning in Poland in 2010-2021. The article
   studies the whole population of the above public units and the influence
   of the financial, economic, demographic, institutional and spatial
   factors on their indebtedness. Due to the data, methodology and the
   robustness check, the fixed effects panel models, Arellano and Bond's
   two-step generalized method of moments and the Moran I and LISA
   statistics were applied. Therefore, the final regressions include
   significant explanatory variables and might contribute to more efficient
   debt management and its control. The paper also reveals spatial
   associations in the field of the indebtedness of local governments.},

Abstract = {Recent trends in corporate venture capital (CVC) activities have added
   to the size and complexity of the financial system. Intuition suggests
   that in a period marked by spectacularly increasing start-up valuations,
   the opportunity to earn large capital gains increases the importance of
   corporate investors' financial motivations. Drawing on interviews with
   12 Silicon Valley-based CVC units of global industrial companies, we
   examine if new trends in CVC investment represent a diversion from
   incumbents' traditional focus on improving the competitive advantage of
   their core businesses. Building on the theory of the financialization of
   non-financial companies, we investigate the relationship between the
   strategic and financial motivations of CVC investing. We extend theory
   by distinguishing between developments at the extensive and intensive
   margins. We argue that the commonly applied quantitative measures
   capture financialization only at the extensive margin. Qualitative data
   indicate that the hypothesis of financialization does not hold at the
   intensive margin.},

Abstract = {This article examines how politicians' conflict framing strategies in
   online campaign advertisements affect citizens' political participation
   in a multi-party context. We rely on a unique combination of innovative
   research methods to do so, including a four-wave panel survey, a content
   analysis of Facebook browser-tracking data and a mobile experience
   sampling survey with data donations. All data were collected during the
   2021 Dutch general elections. We find that conflict framing can
   discourage citizens from engaging in low-effort forms of political
   participation, such as discussing politics, signing a petition and
   visiting political websites. The results show that conflict frames can
   demobilize citizens because they lower enthusiasm and are perceived as
   less informative. Our study provides insights into the potential
   unintended consequences of using conflict framing as a campaign strategy
   in a multi-party setting.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the first-ever full kinship network of an
   upper-class population in a US city (n = 12 273). Multigenerational
   class transmission models tend to conceptualize families as father-son
   chains, especially for the upper class, but I systematically include
   women, finding that nearly 70\% of Dallas high society from 1895 to 1945
   was related in a single web encompassing most of the city's wealthy,
   powerful, and high-status people. Because elites did not always have
   sons, nearly three times more families persisted over the 50-year period
   than patrilineal measures would suggest. Almost all persistent families
   connected to the web, and they connected more deeply than non-persistent
   families. Three case studies demonstrate that women and kin ties beyond
   the patrilineage frequently drove elite family persistence. Upper-class
   populations are best understood not as collections of distinct dynasties
   that live or die with the success of sons, but as complex, durable
   family webs.},

Abstract = {The topic of policy integration has become an important component of
   several distinct lines of policy research. However, the concept of
   policy integration is notoriously difficult to specify and observe. This
   article provides valuable insights that explore the subjectivity of
   responses by political and administrative officials at the local level
   charged with policy integration. In response to its central question:
   `How do local politicians and civil servants perceive
   politico-administrative barriers facing policy coordination and
   integration?' the study reveals political and managerial perceptions of
   key politicians and civil servants in local governments about the
   barriers to achieving policy integration. By contrast with other studies
   involving politico-administrative relations, it draws on a broader
   institutional context, inclusive of the complex and dynamic environment
   and local level environment. Its findings show that significant barriers
   to coordination and integration continue to limit the policy
   coordination and integration needed to address complex societal
   challenges. Using Q methodology, three perspectives emerge which provide
   crucial insights into the main barriers preventing integration. These
   findings adeptly depict the complex relationship between vertical,
   hierarchical relationships between politicians and bureaucrats, and the
   requirement for a more horizontal, consensual relationship in order to
   meet crosscutting societal challenges. In this way, the article offers a
   significant contribution to the scholarship on policy integration.},

Abstract = {Public service providers increasingly encourage users to actively
   coproduce as a means to enhance public service provision. But what
   drives users to coproduce? Using a unique combination of survey and
   actual behavior log-data of 9992 smart public service users who reported
   service-related issues, we examine the extent to which users'
   self-centered and community-centered motivations are associated with
   their actual reporting behavior as well as the effort intensity of such
   behavior. Our findings suggest that users' self-centered motivations are
   positively related to their actual reporting behavior and effort
   intensity, while community-centered motivations do not show a
   significant association. Our study highlights the importance of
   self-centered motivations in (digital) coproduction and co-assessment.
   It also showcases the potential of using log data from public services
   to measure actual coproduction behavior instead of relying solely on
   self-reported behavior.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},

Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Does state ownership limit the liberalizing effects of the WTO? We
   examine the case of China, which is not only the largest exporting state
   but also lends active support to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that
   could distort global trade. Using data on import purchases disaggregated
   by ownership from 1993 to 2012, we analyze how WTO entry affects the
   commercial orientation of state-owned and private imports. We
   demonstrate that after WTO entry, tariff cuts have a larger effect on
   private compared to SOE trade. We then show that state ownership alone
   does not block the WTO's liberalizing effects. For most industries, SOEs
   and private firms are alike in their commercial orientation. However,
   where strategic goods targeted by industrial policy hold a large share
   of bilateral trade, lowering tariffs has no impact on SOE trade. These
   findings highlight the tensions between state-led economic models and
   global trade law premised upon market principles.},

Abstract = {In October 2020, President Donald Trump sought to convert many US
   federal civil servants to at-will employees by executive order. Trump's
   initiative, referred to as Schedule F, has stimulated a partisan debate
   about dismantling the merit system in the US federal government. A
   substantial international body of evidence has developed during the last
   three decades about the effects of administrative practices associated
   with meritocracy and the likely consequences of changes to civil service
   systems, such as those embedded in Schedule F. This article employs
   guidelines established under the Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to conduct a systematic
   review of the evidence to address the question: What does the evidence
   tell us about merit principles and government performance? This
   systematic review summarizes what empirical research tells us about
   effects of civil service practices, such as meritocratic appointments,
   meritocratic advancement, and tenure protection, for government
   performance and the quality of government. The findings indicate that
   factors such as meritocratic appointments/recruitment, tenure
   protection, impartiality, and professionalism are strongly associated
   with higher government performance and lower corruption. We conclude by
   discussing implications of our findings for public policy and management
   and for future research.},

Abstract = {This paper examines support for media freedoms in Anglophone African
   countries, focusing on the national and individual-level determinants of
   such support. Leveraging a unique dataset capturing anti-media rhetoric
   from political leadership across 15 African countries, we explore
   whether such rhetoric drives down support for media freedoms. Our
   findings offer only modest support for this, indicating that only
   certain types of rhetoric diminish support for media freedoms and, at
   that, only among executive supporters. By contrast, we find that
   anti-media rhetoric may actually drive up support. Moreover, we find
   that higher comparative levels of media professionalism significantly
   increase support for media freedoms. This suggests that media
   professionals may have substantial say in patterns of popular support
   for the media. More generally, our findings point to the need for more
   research on the impacts of both rhetoric and professionalism on support
   for the media.},

Abstract = {Brexit has significantly altered the trajectory of UK government policy
   towards Northern Ireland. The peace process was implicitly built on a
   presumption of continued joint EU membership by the UK and Ireland. The
   EU model of interdependence and cooperation was explicitly stated to be
   an inspiration by its key architect John Hume. However, the history of
   British-Irish cooperation over Northern Ireland is long and complex and
   cannot solely be understood through the lens of Europeanisation. Despite
   this, the aftermath of the 2016 referendum has seen a retreat by the UK
   government from a bilateral and consensual approach towards Northern
   Ireland to unilateralism and a `muscular' unionist ideology. This has
   affected their governance there, hampering their relationship with local
   parties and undermining the agreed role of the Irish government. The
   impact of Brexit on UK government policy towards Northern Ireland has
   undoubtedly contributed to the destabilisation of the political
   settlement.},

Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Hierarchical accountability often proves insufficient to control
   street-level implementation, where complex, informal accountability
   relations prevail and tasks must be prioritized. However, scholars lack
   a theoretical model of how accountability relations affect
   implementation behaviors that are inconsistent with policy. By extending
   the Accountability Regimes Framework (ARF), this paper explains how
   multiple competing subjective street-level accountabilities translate
   into policy divergence. The anti-terrorism ``Prevent Duty{''} policy in
   the United Kingdom requires university lecturers to report any student
   they suspect may be undergoing a process of radicalization. We ask: what
   perceived street-level accountabilities and dilemmas does this
   politically contested policy imply for lecturers, and how do they affect
   divergence? An online survey of British lecturers (N = 809), combined
   with 35 qualitative follow-up interviews, reveals that accountability
   dilemmas trigger policy divergence. The ARF models how street-level
   bureaucrats become informal policymakers in the political system when
   rules clash with their roles as professionals, citizen-agents, or
   ``political animals.{''}},

Abstract = {Much of the literature on victimization looks at the effect of organized
   violence (OV) on civilian perceptions and behaviour. Yet citizens in
   countries experience quotidian crime (QC) on a daily basis. QC differs
   from OV, the former being more isolated, while the latter is more of a
   collective experience. As such we develop a theoretical framework that
   explores the effects of both types of violence on preferences for public
   goods. Victims of OV may prefer welfare public goods for the entire
   community, whereas victims of QC may prefer security for themselves. We
   also test the effects of compound victimization on public goods'
   preferences. We use original survey data from rural Liberia to test our
   hypotheses and find support for our argument. Our results show the
   importance of a disaggregated approach to understanding the effects of
   violence on preferences.},

Abstract = {During the last years, coinciding with the rise of non-Western IR theory
   and Global IR, IR scholars have become interested in the study of the
   `Chinese School of IR'. Mainstream literature on its advent primarily
   focuses on its development as the result of a revisionist China that
   seeks to challenge the liberal international order in the material and
   ideational spheres. This article seeks to question this narrative.
   Through a critical IR approach that considers the nexus between the
   production of IR theory, geopolitics and the development of state
   ideology in China after 1979, I contend that the CSIR should be
   understood as a complex, and sometimes contradictory, group of Chinese
   IR scholars that seek to provide depoliticised IR theories to legitimise
   non-Marxian views of the Chinese state and protect its political
   autonomy in global politics, whilst contributing to the reimagination of
   what means to advance IR theory from China.},

Title = {Bias mitigation in empirical peace and conflict studies: A short primer

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Posttreatment variables are covariates that are preceded by the main
   explanatory variable. Their inclusion in a statistical model does not
   `control' for their influence on the relationship of interest, and it
   does not substitute for a mediation analysis. Likewise, a coefficient
   estimate of an appropriate `control variable' cannot be interpreted as a
   causal effect estimate. While these facts are well-established in
   various fields across the social sciences, their recognition in the
   field of peace and conflict studies is more limited. Originally
   collected data on recent publications from leading peace and conflict
   journals reveal that a large majority of evaluated articles condition on
   posttreatment variables, demonstrating how a review of these fallacies
   can help to substantially improve future research on peace and conflict.
   Drawing on a broad set of literature and using graphical approaches, I
   offer an intuitive explanation of the logic of posttreatment variables
   and clarify common misconceptions. Building on recent developments in
   methodology and software, and by deriving conditions for bounding using
   analytical bias expressions, I discuss avenues for dealing with
   posttreatment variables in observational studies. The article concludes
   with a discussion of implications for applied research.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a critical approach to implementation studies and
   seeks to challenge the current uniform facade of the concept of
   ``implementation.{''} Inspired by Latour's actor-network theory, it
   argues that implementation can be perceived as an assemblage of
   constantly shifting interactions. Thus, instead of seeking to identify
   the factors that affect the implementation process, as is the focus of
   most implementation research, it proposes seeking to understand what
   goes on in implementation, thereby moving away from looking for
   variables that influence implementation to instead discuss
   implementation analysis and implementation types. This shift in focus,
   which has received limited attention in the literature, holds potential
   for both theory and practice. For theory, it introduces an understanding
   of implementation as an independent concept, composed of multilayered
   components that can be categorized into different types, in different
   contexts and at different times. And for practice, as well as for
   theory, it opens up another route for implementation analysis and
   design, which has not been articulated until now.},

Abstract = {This article examines the practice of using aid to control migration,
   which we refer to as `inducement aid'. We examine two potential
   objections to inducement aid, each of which concerns a message that the
   practice communicates to two corresponding audiences: would-be migrants
   and other developed states. We suggest that the first objection has
   intuitive force but is undermined by a powerful reply. This finding
   seems to bolster the intuitive appeal that inducement aid might exhibit
   as a non-compulsory and apparently option-enhancing form of migration
   control. However, we argue that the second objection, which targets
   inducement aid in its capacity as a form of development assistance, has
   greater power. Developing the second objection, we argue that inducement
   aid threatens the establishment and maintenance of important
   international norms, thereby risking degrading the options of the
   world's poorest people and setting back the cause of cosmopolitan
   morality.},

   variables, responses were drawn from 419 frontline hotel employees at
   two-time points and the hypothesised relationships were tested using
   structural equation modelling.Findings The structural equation modelling
   analysis proved that family incivility is negatively related to service
   delivery. It was also found that family incivility is positively
   associated with negative rumination and an inverse relationship between
   negative rumination and service delivery. This study also found support
   for the mediating role of negative rumination and the moderating roles
   of psychological capital and perceived organisational support.Practical
   implications This study findings extend the theory and provide
   guidelines for managers to mitigate the adverse effect of family
   incivility on employees and their service delivery. Employees and
   managers can use psychological capital and POS as strategies to prevent
   the spill-over effect of family incivility on service
   delivery.Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, no
   prior studies have examined the effect of family incivility on service
   delivery. By establishing the mediating mechanism and boundary
   conditions, this study adds value to the theory and practice.},

Abstract = {We study how economic crises relate to the likelihood of experiencing
   regime changes `from within'; that is, transitions brought about, in
   part or fully, by actors in the incumbent regime. While historically
   common and influencing the political trajectories of many countries,
   such processes are far less studied than regime transitions forced by
   non-incumbent actors, such as coups or revolutions. We synthesize
   previous arguments and further specify how crises can incentivize
   leaders to change the regime from within due to two mechanisms. First,
   crises create windows of opportunity for leaders to pursue transitions
   they inherently prefer, for instance through self-coup. Second, crises
   sometimes allow opposition actors to mobilize and threaten the regime,
   forcing incumbents to liberalize. We leverage new data on timing and
   mode of regime change for more than 2000 regimes from about 200
   countries, during the period 1789-2018. Employing different measurement
   strategies, estimators, control variables and other specification
   choices, we find fairly robust evidence that economic crises are related
   to transitions from within. However, when we distinguish between
   liberalizing and non-liberalizing guided transitions, we only find that
   economic crises systematically relate to the latter, suggesting that the
   window of opportunity mechanism may be especially pertinent in many
   contexts.},

   weapon state after Brexit},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 8},
Abstract = {The UK's status as a nuclear weapon-state has been an integral part of
   the UK's role in international affairs. This article traces several role
   conceptions associated with the UK's nuclear status, and analyses role
   adaptation and contestation before and after Brexit. While EU membership
   (and then Brexit) had little direct impact on the UK as a nuclear-weapon
   state, we can observe a growing tension between the UK's role
   conceptions of a `responsible nuclear weapon state' and `nuclear-armed
   power with a global reach' since around the time of the 2016 Brexit
   referendum. The 2021 Integrated Review indicates that the UK's role
   conception has shifted towards the latter. At the same time, domestic
   role contestation, also exacerbated by Brexit, has further challenged
   the UK's nuclear status, deepening divisions between the UK and Scottish
   governments, and placing the UK's reputation, as well as its future as a
   Union, on the line.},

Title = {ISSUE-IMAGE TRADE-OFFS AND THE POLITICS OF FOREIGN POLICY How Leaders
   Use Foreign Policy Positions to Shape Their Personal Images},
Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {75},
Number = {2},
Pages = {280-315},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article explains how leaders can use foreign policy issues to shape
   their personal images. It argues in particular that presidents and
   presidential candidates can use hawk-ish foreign policies to craft
   valuable impressions of leadership strength. This dynamic can give
   leaders incentives to take foreign policy positions that are more
   hawkish than what voters actually want. The article documents the causal
   foundations of this argument with a preregistered survey experiment; it
   presents archival evidence demonstrating that presidential candidates
   use unpopular foreign policies to convey attractive personal traits; and
   it uses observational data to show how those trade-offs have shaped
   three decades of presidential voting. The article's theory and evidence
   indicate that democratic respon-siveness in foreign policy is not as
   simple as doing what voters want. Leaders often need to choose between
   satisfying voters' policy preferences and crafting personal images that
   voters find appealing. Aligning foreign policy with voters' preferences
   is thus easier said than done, and it is not always the best way for
   leaders to maximize their public standing.},

Abstract = {How do policymakers respond to crises? The Narrative Policy Framework
   (NPF) answers this question by focusing on the contest over policy
   narratives. This paper focuses on the individuals constructing those
   policy narratives, conceptualizing them as policy narrators. Using a
   case study approach, we analyze seven counties located in a major oil
   and gas formation in Texas, which in early 2020 faced both an oil bust
   and the onset of COVID-19. We explore four sets of propositions about
   how policy narrators source, synthesize, and share their policy
   narratives. We find that while their narratives vary, the structure of
   those narratives is similar; their backgrounds shape how they source
   narratives, and they tailor their levels of narrative breach to the
   action (or inaction) they hope for. They avoid casting other local
   actors as villains, place their audience as the hero, and situate
   themselves as either supporting or a member of that audience, stressing
   their common ties. From these findings, we put forward a working
   definition of policy narrators, identify how they fit into the NPF, and
   discuss how they relate to other types of policy actors, including
   policy entrepreneurs.},

Abstract = {Politicians and scholars alike have advocated for land reform as a tool
   to address political instability and poverty. Yet in many cases of land
   reform, governments provide land but withhold property rights. Why do
   leaders withhold these rights, and when do they grant previously
   withheld rights? The authors argue that land rights are a distributive
   good that leaders relinquish conservatively and selectively to build
   popular support. Using microlevel data from Kenya-a country in which
   successive governments have distributed most of the country's arable
   land through land reform-the article finds that leaders under
   dem-ocratic regimes are more willing to formalize rights than those
   under autocratic regimes. Further, the logic of land formalization
   changes with regime type. Whereas autocrats pri-oritize land
   formalization among core supporters, elites facing elections prioritize
   pivotal swing voters. The article demonstrates how the provision of
   property rights is primarily a function of political calculations rather
   than state capacity.},

Abstract = {This study is a critical discourse analysis of the misogynistic
   narratives shared by three incel violent extremists: Elliot Rodger, Alek
   Minassian, and Scott Beierle. Utilizing Kate Manne's give/take model,
   which suggests a wider cultural pattern of misogyny serving to uphold
   patriarchy, this study finds that incel men expect women to provide
   feminine-coded services while men are entitled to assume masculine-coded
   privileges. Feminine-coded services that ``she{''} is expected to
   provide to ``him{''} are emotional, social, and reproductive. As incels
   assume masculine-coded privileges related to authority, power, and
   status, ``she will give{''} and ``he will take{''}; otherwise, ``she
   will be punished.{''}},

Abstract = {When it comes to domestic terrorism (DT), state capacity matters in `the
   middle.' Our article aims to bring together two apparently separate
   strands of terrorism research: one concerning the effects of regime
   type; and another concerning the effects of state capacity. We argue
   that state capacity can reduce DT in anocracies, but not so much in full
   dictatorships and democracies. Terrorists seek to maximize the reach of
   their attacks by exposing themselves to a larger audience. As a result,
   regimes with higher audience costs tend to be more vulnerable to
   domestic terror attacks. In anocracies, there is room for state capacity
   to influence the audience costs of a domestic terrorist attack. In full
   democracies and dictatorships, on the other hand, state capacity has
   little influence on the audience costs of DT. Consequently, if previous
   studies have purported linear, U-shaped, and inverted-U-shaped links
   between democracy and terrorism, we argue that the shape of the
   relationship is contingent on the level of state capacity.
   Theoretically, we substantiate our argument with a two-player
   simultaneous game between a terrorist group and a government. On the
   empirical side, we conduct a series of negative binomial panel
   regressions upon a time-series cross-sectional dataset of no less than
   108 countries from 1970 to 2007.},

Abstract = {Tolerating others' opinions, even if disliked, is a cornerstone of
   liberal democracy. At the same time, there are limits to political
   tolerance as tolerating extremists and groups who use violence would
   threaten the foundations of tolerance itself. We study people's
   willingness to set limits to tolerance in case of violence and extremism
   (scope of tolerance)-under different conditions regarding ideological
   groups (left-wing, right-wing, religious) and offline/online contexts of
   free speech. Using data from a large-scale survey experiment conducted
   in Germany, we show that citizens clearly set limits to tolerance of
   different groups, especially if the latter have violent intentions, and
   that people tend to be more tolerant online than offline. Moreover, we
   find that citizens are more tolerant toward groups that are closer to
   their own ideological stance. However, violence disrupts such an
   ideological bias as respondents across the ideological spectrum exhibit
   low levels of tolerance toward violent groups-irrespectively of their
   political stance. Our findings highlight the importance of situational
   factors as foundations of judgments on the limits to tolerance.},

Abstract = {The European Union has made the development of a circular economy one of
   the central ambitions of its Green Deal, in which plastics are a defined
   priority. Current policies, however, have drawn criticism that the
   narrow focus on techno-innovation opportunities and economic growth
   falls short of addressing multifaceted socio-ecological challenges,
   overlooks trade-offs between proposed solutions, and conceals conflicts
   of interest among different actors. This paper contributes to opening-up
   the critical political debate on the circular plastics economy using
   discourse analysis. Looking at how arguments are framed, which
   priorities are defined, and how actors take positions, we identify three
   circular plastics economy discourses in Europe: `Plastic fantastic'
   (material-focused), `Circular economy will fly us to the moon' (plastics
   economy-focused), and `Even plastic flowers are dead in this system'
   (socio-ecological systems-focused). Our paper demonstrates that the
   circular plastics economy is inherently political and is actively
   imagined, built, and created through discursive mechanisms.},

Abstract = {In 2021 the ruling party in Poland proposed a reform to reverse the
   regressivity of the Polish tax system. Although the number of potential
   beneficiaries significantly exceeded the number of sufferers, the media
   coverage of the reform was strongly negative. This pushed the government
   to introduce reform adjustments, all of which benefited the high-income
   self-employed, increasing the cost of the reform and reducing its
   redistributive effect. To explain this, we analyze articles on the
   reform published in the three most opinion-forming newspapers. We
   demonstrate that the negative media coverage stemmed from successful
   incorporation of business narratives in the public debate by the
   business lobbying associations. It was supported by the weakness of
   workers' organizations and a low level of citizens' trust in government.},

Abstract = {This article introduces an analytical framework to trace and compare
   leaders' different types of behaviours to the health crisis posed by
   COVID-19, following the analytical benefits of Leadership Trait
   Analysis. It examines Boris Johnson's and Nicola Sturgeon's diverging
   initial responses to the pandemic's onset. We employ the Leadership
   Trait Analysis to shed light on three main differences in their
   respective leadership styles: risk-proneness versus risk-aversion;
   flexibility versus rigidity and rule advocacy versus rule ambivalence.
   Crises are one of the more fruitful situations in which to study leaders
   as their personal characteristics become central to the decision-making
   process. Thus, we employ an agent-centred and political psychology
   approach to analyse leaders' behaviour and make sense of their divergent
   management styles. The results show that the differences between these
   leaders' approaches to handling this global health crisis can be partly
   explained by their level of openness to information and their task
   versus relationship focus.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {How do authoritative international bodies decide that states have
   complied with their orders? Compliance research has mostly focused on
   how states react to rulings and how interest groups mobilize for and
   against compliance. Less has been said about how international bodies
   certify compliance with their orders in contexts of conflicting
   interests and incomplete information. Because in theory the seal of
   compliance could be given to different types and volumes of state
   actions, we argue that when nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) monitor
   implementation closely, international adjudicators will be more
   demanding in compliance certification, resulting in more protracted
   compliance monitoring processes. We test our expectations in the case of
   the Inter- American Commission of Human Rights and find that
   recommendations take longer to reach status of full compliance when more
   NGOs act as petitioners and when they have more experience with
   monitoring compliance. If NGOs help that more effective implementation
   receives an international organization's seal of approval, large numbers
   of orders without full compliance might not necessarily be bad news
   about human rights on the ground.},

Abstract = {In this article, the interrelatedness of contemporary populism and fear
   is analysed. It is argued that contemporary populism is burdened with
   the uncertainties and contingencies of late modernity. Therefore, it is
   not capable of merely ``instrumentalizing `` fear (i.e., relying on fear
   as an instrument of ideological goals). Instead, populism is forced to
   ``juggle `` with fear in a continuously changing, unpredictable
   constellation. In the first section, the ideal type of instrumentalizing
   fear is introduced. In the second section, this ideal type is developed
   into the model of juggling with fear based on theories of late
   modernity: the impact of the narrowing of political agency, the
   reconfiguration of the public sphere, and the interiorization of
   uncertainty are analysed. In the third section, this ideal type is
   further explored through a case study of illiberal Hungary: the
   empirical patterns of juggling with quotidian and virtual fears reveal
   the micro-mechanisms and the broader consequences.},

Abstract = {How does social media facilitate deliberation and collective remembering
   of past revolutions amid protests in democratizing contexts? To explore
   this question, I performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis of a
   unique archive of tweets posted during Moldova's Twitter Revolution in
   2009. The research revealed that Twitter enabled users living in Moldova
   and Romania to connect online, share information, and chat about the
   meanings of revolution, civil society activism, and resistance to state
   oppression, all while providing updates to Western media and warning the
   public about human rights abuses. Also, the research uncovered that the
   \#pman audiences from Moldova and Romania framed the protest
   differently. Whereas the Moldovans regarded it as a demonstration
   against election fraud, the Romanian twitterers framed the events as an
   anti-communist uprising analogous to the 1989 Revolution, which they
   mythologized to extract useful strategies for action communicated to the
   Moldovan activists. Moreover, twitterers from both countries engaged in
   a transborder conversation about unionism and national identity. Despite
   Twitter's documented positive impact on political engagement and Western
   media reporting, it simultaneously contributed to misinformation through
   the circulation of rumors, conspiracy theories, and calls for violence.},

Abstract = {This study aims to explore international policy transfer (IPT) through
   examining educational reforms in Kazakhstan. Literature on policy
   transfer lacks cases between Western countries and post -communist
   states with a Soviet legacy. This study used the IPT framework as a
   heuristic device to analyze the Bologna Process (BP), an
   intergovernmental higher education process. Empirical data included
   semi-structured interviews with BP stakeholders and thematic analyses of
   official documents to examine the stages of accession transfer. The
   findings demonstrated that a Soviet legacy constrains the policy
   transfer process during accession stages, limiting the policy transfer
   process from the West and leading to incomplete transfers.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the realization of official government
   regulations of egalitarianism policy in secondary technical schools,
   especially on the informal practice that was ``quietly{''} tolerated by
   the communist regime. The research is based on the historiographical
   approach of the history of everyday life. The primary research method is
   the oral history method based on interviews with witnesses- teachers who
   worked at secondary technical schools in the period under review.
   Research using the oral history method is further supplemented by the
   study of period legislation, periodicals, and the study of archival
   materials obtained in the National Archives in Prague and the Brno City
   Archives. The study provides a unique illustration of the application of
   the policy of egalitarianism in the everyday life of secondary technical
   schools in the normalization period in Czechoslovakia. In particular,
   the witnesses' recollections reveal a practice toward some students that
   went beyond government regulations and influenced their studies in
   various ways, including admission procedures, dealing with disciplinary
   offenses, graduation, and obtaining a school-leaving certificate.},

Abstract = {Since 2016, many protests in support of abortion rights have occurred
   across Poland. What emotions drove people to begin participating in
   these protests? What emotions encourage them to continue protesting for
   abortion rights over time? To answer these questions, I conducted
   semi-structured interviews with 50 activists who have protested in
   support of abortion rights since 2016 in nine Polish cities and towns. I
   asked activists what emotions were important when they decided to
   protest and what emotions remain important as they continue to protest.
   Anger and fear emerged as key emotional drivers of their initial and
   continued pro-choice protest participation.},

Abstract = {Advocacy intelligence is a critical organizational resource fostering
   long-term survival and policy success. Policy-active interest groups
   such as non-profits, business associations and labor unions, seek to
   maintain their competitive advantage among peers and therefore have
   incentives to remain secretive about the details of their lobbying
   strategies and membership mobilization. We empirically evaluate this
   argument based on knowledge sharing interactions in 12 focus group
   interviews with approximately 50 representatives of interest groups in
   the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark. Our research design manipulates
   the composition of the focus groups to vary the level of competition for
   political influence and membership among the participants. Strikingly,
   we find no evidence that either type of competition hampers knowledge
   sharing. Instead, our novel data point to three fruitful alternative
   explanations: the importance of socialization, mentorship and
   personalities of interest group leaders.},

Abstract = {Protests against coronavirus policies have occurred in all European
   countries. The intensity of protest varies strongly, however. We explain
   this variation by strategic choices that protest organizers make to
   maintain the protest movement. Specifically, we argue that protest
   organizers pay heed to the dynamics of the pandemic in their country:
   the number of protest events is higher when and where mortality rates
   are lower and containment policies are more stringent. At the same time,
   the number of protest events is influenced by political factors. Despite
   the fact that civil liberties facilitate trust in government, these two
   variables exert opposite effects: while higher trust in government and
   public administration reduces the number of protest events, stronger
   civil liberties increase the number of protest events. We find evidence
   for these hypotheses in an analysis of the number of monthly protest
   events based on information from ACLED, the Armed Conflict Location \&
   Event Data Project, in 28 European countries between March 2020 and
   August 2021.},

Abstract = {The concept of decolonization was originally proposed as an epistemic
   project that focused on anti-hegemonic endeavors to counter power
   imbalances. However, in recent years, it has become a buzz word across
   different fields in the Global North, often slipping into a tokenistic
   exercise. This paper argues that the decolonizing promise of moving
   beyond power asymmetries and acquiring the ability `to think from and
   with' others will not be fulfilled unless we take seriously the need for
   a radical shift in recognizing global others' epistemic status. Drawing
   on empirical case studies of China's and India's rises in the life
   sciences and their respective impacts on Anglo-American policy
   discussions, this paper demonstrates what decolonizing our temporal and
   spatial (or relational) assumptions of contemporary science could mean
   in practice. More importantly, it argues that decolonization in the
   pluriverse of contemporary science should simultaneously be a radical
   and prudent project. As such, decolonizing is not only a challenge for
   the Global North but also for the Global South. The decolonization
   project argued for in this paper is conducive to a fresh ontological
   attention of critical policy studies and a recalibrated relational focus
   of governing practices.},

Abstract = {How can powerful states best extract domestic concessions from their
   junior allies? What are the conditions under which the powerful state is
   more likely to succeed in inducing such domestic policy change? This
   article explores the link between US security commitments and
   Washington's ability to attain favourable policy outcomes within the
   allied domestic arena. It provides an illustrative case of how the USA,
   using security guarantees as leverage, can enter allied domestic space
   and shape its decision-making process. After it was revealed that Latvia
   had served as a key node through which North Korea attempted to evade
   the sanctions regime, the USA, by playing its security guarantor card,
   pressured Riga to carry out substantial policy reforms in relation to
   its financial system. This approach yielded considerable results. In
   order to preserve the existing security arrangements with the dominant
   alliance member, Latvia offered significant policy concessions. This
   finding demonstrates that US security alliances come with side benefits
   that are often underrated or neglected in the scholarly literature.},

Abstract = {The meaning of ``youth{''} is changing among young Tzeltal migrants from
   Chiapas, Mexico, living in the U.S. state of California. Migration
   improves young people's condition in terms of work, leisure time, and
   cultural consumption. A study based on ethnographic data, interviews,
   questionnaires, and participant observation undertaken in 2011, 2013,
   and 2016 shows how the material resources to which these migrants have
   access are directed toward building a unique youth style based on
   aesthetics and language that can be called the ``Tzeltal jungle
   cowboy.{''} El significado del concepto ``juventud{''} esta cambiando
   entre los jovenes migrantes tzeltales de Chiapas, Mexico, que viven en
   el estado de California en Estados Unidos. La migracion mejora las
   condiciones de vida de los jovenes debido a su acceso al trabajo, tiempo
   libre y consumo cultural. Un estudio hecho en base a datos etnograficos,
   entrevistas, cuestionarios y observacion participante realizado en 2011,
   2013 y 2016 nos muestra como los recursos materiales a los que tienen
   acceso estos migrantes se dirigen a construir un estilo juvenil unico
   basado en la estetica y el lenguaje que podria denominarse el ``vaquero
   Tzeltal de la selva{''}.},

Abstract = {In recent years, a series of right-wing populists has ascended to power
   in both the Global North and the Global South. While these leaders
   frequently have provided challenges to liberal democracy, neoliberal
   modes of economic governance have often been part of their agendas.
   Analysis of the economic policy narrative of the Brazilian President
   Jair Bolsonaro's electoral campaign in 2018 through the theoretical lens
   of authoritarian neoliberalism reveals that it has worked by the
   relegation of economic matters to technocratic management outside the
   sphere of democratic debate and the instrumentalized estrangement of
   groups and institutions opposed to his political views. Recentemente,
   uma serie de populistas direitistas tem chegado ao poder tanto nos
   paises do norte como naqueles do sul. Enquanto estes lideres
   frequentemente apresentam desafios as democracias liberais, modos
   neoliberais de governanca economica muitas vezes desempenham um papel
   nas suas agendas. Uma analise da narrativa da politica economica na
   campanha presidencial do Presidente Jair Bolsonaro no Brasil em 2018
   mediante uma visao teoretica de neoliberalismo autoritario indica que
   ela funcionou pela relegacao de assuntos economicos a gestores
   tecnocraticos que ficam fora da esfera de debate democratico e pelo
   afastamento instrumentalizado de grupos e instituicoes que se opoem as
   ideias politicas de Bolsonaro.},

Abstract = {Episodes of mass political violence, such as genocide and civil war,
   have been thought to both encourage and discourage future political
   mobilization. We square these competing hypotheses by disaggregating
   between protest onset and resilience. We argue that exposure to mass
   violence decades ago should on average decrease protest onset, by
   heightening fears of repression and retribution. However, conditional on
   protesting, prior exposure to violence should increase protest
   longevity, by generating greater political grievances that fuel
   commitment to the cause. We find evidence of both effects in Algeria
   during the 2019-20 Hirak protests that toppled President Abdelaziz
   Bouteflika. Pairing an original dataset on massacres during the 1990s
   civil war with a rolling online survey of 18,000 Algerians in 2019-20,
   we find that areas exposed to greater violence in the 1990s had on
   average fewer, but more committed, protesters in 2019-20.},

Abstract = {Whereas previous research shows that peace agreements which include a
   broad segment of society are more likely to lead to sustainable peace,
   little effort has gone into explaining inclusion itself. We address this
   gap in the literature by providing the first large-N study to examine
   the causes of inclusive peace negotiations across civil wars. We argue
   that civil society actors can gain leverage through mobilization of
   civilian protest, or build trust through dialogue efforts, thereby
   enhancing the chances of inclusion of non-warring actors at the
   negotiation table. The argument is examined by analysing unique and new
   monthly data on peacemaking efforts in all intrastate armed conflicts in
   Africa and the Americas, 1989-2018, including measures beyond mere
   nominal participation, such as whether civil society actors or political
   parties had substantive roles as either mediators or full participants
   at the peace talks. Our findings show that protests by civil society
   actors increase the likelihood that non-warring actors will have a seat
   at the negotiation table, whereas we find no such effect concerning
   dialogue efforts. The article contributes by providing new insights into
   how nonviolent action can shape peace processes by opening the doors to
   negotiations and is thus part of an emerging research agenda that seeks
   to bring together the fields of civil resistance and inclusive peace
   processes.},

Abstract = {With the rise of populism, we frequently witness how elected governments
   try to limit judicial power by using different means. Comparing the
   court-curbing policies used by the Fidesz government in Hungary and the
   PiS government in Poland, this study has two objectives. First, it aims
   to explain whether different court-curbing policies effect judicial
   independence differently. Using synthetic control method, I find that
   the predominant use of informal court-curbing policies erodes judicial
   independence much more extensively compared to the predominant use of
   formal court-curbing policies. The second objective is to provide and
   empirically test the causal explanation for this effect. I argue that
   when the incumbent tries to weaken the judiciary mostly through informal
   court-curbing, this might instigate public discontent and jeopardize the
   judiciary's legitimacy in the short run. However, when the government
   tries to restructure the judiciary via constitutional reforms, the
   legitimacy of the `new' judicial system might not be questioned by the
   public. Supporting these hypotheses, the empirical results show that
   while the court-curbing attempts of the PiS government reduced public
   confidence in the judiciary by almost 15 percent, we do not see a
   significant decline in the Hungarian case where mostly formal
   court-curbing was used.},

Abstract = {This article introduces repetition as a sui generis temporal pattern
   that is central to the politics of inclusive institutional reform.
   Pushed by crises or leadership changes, inclusive reform initiatives
   spring up in moments of high salience only to die back again and be
   relaunched later, in a seemingly endless cycle. Drawing from public
   policy, historical and feminist institutionalist scholarships and the
   in-depth case studies of Birmingham and Turin city governments'
   equalities offices, this article identifies (a) four drivers of
   repetition, to do with the nature of the problem, the nature of the
   institution, the nature of the change agents, and repetition's
   self-reinforcing nature, and (b) two sets of effects (sedimentation and
   erosion) which follow concurrent logics of increasing and decreasing
   returns. Understanding repetition as a specific, non-linear pattern of
   change eschews teleologies of hope or doom, advancing theories of
   institutional change and serving as a useful guide for action for
   equity-driven reformers. It invites other scholars to engage with a new
   research agenda to systematically identify alternative types of temporal
   sequence and study their distinct logics and effects.},

Abstract = {Autonomous systems are often lauded as revolutionary. However, what
   makes them revolutionary is still up for debate. We identify assumptions
   about the revolutionary effect of autonomy and draw on historical work
   to examine how these characteristics have affected past conflicts. Our
   look at the past suggests where these systems may be most revolutionary
   is in cost mitigation-both political and economic. Mitigating economic
   cost helps create mass, firepower, and resiliency while mitigating
   political cost allows states to control force with escalation risks and
   domestic support. This balance is key for states that rely on autonomous
   systems to win competition strategies.},

Abstract = {Since 2018, US foreign policy elites have portrayed China as the gravest
   threat to their country. Why was China predominantly cast as an
   ideological threat, even though other discursive formulations, such as a
   geopolitical threat, were plausible and available? Existing major IR
   theories on threat perpcetions struggle to address these questions. In
   this article, we draw from rhetoric and public legitimation scholarship
   to argue that the mobilization of adjacent policy debates was key to
   mainstream the representation of China as an ideological threat. By
   mobilizing debates on Russia and the soft power and sharp power
   concepts, a minority view in US foreign policy with a longstanding
   ambition to get tough on China established a seemingly natural link
   between liberal internationalism and an ideologically threatening China.
   Liberal foreign policy elites who originally opposed a realpolitik view
   of China could now subsume a geopolitical threat into an ideological one
   reminiscent of US-Soviet Cold War rivalry. This constituted a necessary
   catalyst to align most foreign policy elites to understand China as the
   gravest threat to the United States, at a time when China's capabilities
   and behaviour, coupled with a deep sense of insecurity regarding
   America's place in the world, provided the necessary backdrop.},

Abstract = {One of the most significant changes in West European politics in the
   past 40 years is the emergence of the new cultural divide. However,
   there is substantial variation in how the issues comprising this new
   divide have manifested themselves in party systems. This raises the
   question of what mechanisms bring these issues into established party
   systems. The literature has so far focused on new political parties and
   critical junctures. This article argues that the left-right structure is
   a key condition for the integration of new political issues into party
   competition. Rather than seeing their integration as a matter of the
   emergence of a new, second conflict, it argues that new issues become
   central to party competition if the existing conflict structure presents
   established mainstream parties with vote-seeking or coalition-building
   incentives to focus on them. The article uses Ireland as a `negative
   case study' to develop the argument.},

Abstract = {People with disability are an at-risk group in the COVID-19 pandemic for
   a range of clinical and socioeconomic reasons. In recognition of this,
   Australians with disability and those who work with them were
   prioritized in access to vaccination, but the vaccination targets were
   not met. In this paper, we analyze qualitative data generated from a
   survey with 368 disability support workers to identify drivers of
   COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy and why the implementation of this policy
   may have experienced challenges. We identify a range of themes within
   these data but ultimately argue that a major driver of vaccine hesitancy
   in this group is a mistrust of government and an erosion of employment
   terms and conditions. Drawing on the policy capacity literature, we
   argue that the ``Achilles' heel{''} for the Australian government in
   this case is the critical policy capacity of political legitimacy. This
   finding has important implications for where the government needs to
   increase/build policy capacity, strengthening its efforts and better
   relating to organizations that can be helpful in terms of developing
   public health messaging for disability support workers.},

Abstract = {PurposeWorkplace bullying generates various emotions, including shame in
   the target; these emotions can induce employee silence. However, the
   role of shame in the relationship between workplace bullying and
   employee silence, and the individual differences in how victims
   experience shame and silence, has not yet been explored. The present
   study aims to fill this gap in the literature, using the effect of shame
   as a mediator and core self-evaluation (CSE) as a moderator.
   Design/methodology/approachTwo thousand faculty members working in
   different colleges in India were invited to participate in the online
   survey. The participants were invited to fill in the questionnaire only
   if they had experienced shame by bullying during the preceding two
   weeks. Three hundred and twenty faculty members responded to the survey.
   FindingsThe results showed that shame mediates the relationship between
   workplace bullying and diffident silence. In addition, CSE moderates the
   relationship between shame and diffident silence but not the
   relationship between workplace bullying and shame. That is, diffident
   silence induced by shame was noted to be weaker for employees with high
   CSE. Importantly, the study could not find any individual difference in
   experiencing shame by bullying. Practical implicationsImproved CSE can
   effectively influence diffident silence through shame, helping the
   management to recognize workplace bullying. Originality/valueIt is a
   unique attempt to address diffident silence among Indian academicians,
   and study the role of targets' shame and CSE while adopting silence on
   workplace bullying.},

Abstract = {The media is increasingly blamed for inflaming political animosity, but
   it may also bridge partisan divides-with the right strategies. Past
   research highlights the outgroup-experience effect: Sharing personal
   experiences (and not facts) helps to reduce partisan animosity. However,
   sharing facts is a pillar of good journalism and is essential for
   mediated political communication. Across four studies in two countries,
   we show that journalists, and citizens on social media sites, can share
   facts about contentious political issues (gun and climate policy), while
   simultaneously increasing tolerance and reducing dehumanization of
   political opponents. We extend the outgroup-experience effect by
   introducing factual content alongside personal experiences of political
   adversaries (i.e., a combination approach). These effects are replicated
   in both the United States and Germany although in Germany the personal
   experience intervention is only beneficial for people with more extreme
   attitudes.},

Abstract = {The article examines the post-government career moves of 521 former
   British special advisers who served from 1997 to 2017. Analysis of an
   original dataset mapping the first job each special adviser `landed-in'
   after leaving government shows the vast majority land in corporate
   lobbying and policy advocacy roles. A minority become politicians,
   although many continue to work in political organisations. The least
   popular choice is public service. The findings challenge the `lure of
   power' hypothesis and lend weight to increasing concerns about former
   political staff revolving to shadow lobbying. The findings point to
   potential lobbying regulation loopholes first raised by the UK Committee
   of Standards in Public Life. A multi-nominal logistic regression shows
   how party affiliation and occupational path dependency constrain career
   moves. Labour special advisers are less likely to become corporate
   lobbyists than Conservative and Liberal Democrat ones. Special advisers
   also tend to revolve back to similar professional roles held before an
   appointment.},

Title = {Nahu-kparilim (cattle caretakership): understanding the
   persistence of unfree Fulani labour and the (non)violent renegotiation
   of power relations in agrarian economies in northern Ghana},
Journal = {REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {175},
Pages = {49-70},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {This article focuses on how Fulani outsider status, often maintained
   through several generations, constitutes the basis for unequal labour,
   land and associated relations. It discusses how static forms of `fixed'
   citizenship and socioeconomic immobility both maintain and intensify
   labour precarity, rendering the Fulani more vulnerable to the whims,
   caprices and avarice of their native `overlords', as evidenced by the
   practice of nahu-kparilim in Ghana. The article's main interest is thus
   land and labour injustice rather than pastoral production and related
   livelihood activities. Integrating the theories of unfreedom, social
   reproduction and subalternity, the article contributes to unfree labour
   studies by demonstrating that despite being constrained in complex ways,
   unfree labourers have the agency to renegotiate power relations. This
   advances the idea of unfree labourers' agency which, in comparison to
   their immiseration, receives less attention in scholarship on unfreedom.},

Abstract = {The idea that the Nazis dictated (retrospectively) who should be
   considered a Jew in the State of Israel is widespread. Apparent
   similarities between Nuremberg and Israel's Law of Return have
   reinforced the claim that anti-Semitism is the basis for defining
   Israel's Jewishness. This study's primary goal is to refute this
   prevailing false understanding by demonstrating how Israel's Jewishness
   was not based on the reversal of Nazi laws but on positive organic
   Jewish outlooks. The second goal is to present the original narratives
   and show how the fallacious Nuremberg myth has evolved. During the
   1950s, Israel's founding fathers addressed the `Who is Jew' question in
   terms of positive secular Jewish nationalism. The next generation (1970)
   adopted more religious definitions while being attentive to the evolving
   inter-marriage reality. In both cases, policy makers saw neither
   anti-Semitic persecution nor the Holocaust as the basis for defining
   Jewish affiliation. Only from the 1990s on, due to the need to
   legitimize the massive immigration of non-Jews, did the `Nuremberg myth'
   begin to take root. In addition, the emergence of the Holocaust as a
   global moral imperative icon and a major source of Jewish and Israeli
   identification, contributed to the acceptance of the myth.},

Abstract = {What happens to a public, domestic institution when its authority is
   delegated to a privately run, transnational institution? I argue that
   outsourcing traditionally national legal responsibilities to
   transnational bodies can lead to the stagnation of domestic
   institutional capacity. I examine this through a study of international
   commercial arbitration (ICA), a widely used system of cross-border
   commercial dispute resolution. I argue that ICA provides commercial
   actors an ``exit option{''} from weak public institutions, reducing
   pressure on the state to invest in capacity-enhancing reform. I find
   that the enactment of strong protections for ICA leads to the gradual
   erosion of the capacity of domestic legal institutions, particularly in
   countries with already weak legal systems. I test the mechanism driving
   this dynamic using dispute data from the International Chamber of
   Commerce. I find that pro-arbitration laws increase the use of
   international arbitration by national firms, suggesting that firms use
   ICA as an escape from domestic institutions. This article contributes to
   debates on globalization and development as well as work on the
   second-order effects of global governance institutions.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to analyse the double-layered
   diversification of the European integration system represented by the
   countries of Central Europe (CE). Here exemplified by the Visegrad Four
   (V4) states (Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Czechia), the region offers
   a unique laboratory of European differentiated integration (DI). The V4
   positions itself on the outer-core of the European Union hemispheres. At
   the same time, the bloc itself is internally diversified in various,
   important aspects of integration (conflicting trajectories with
   Brussels, monetary integration, energy policy, relations with Russia,
   etc.). Unpacking this intra-V4 diversity will be accompanied by an
   exploration of the economic and institutional factors possibly affecting
   it. The political-economy perspective allows us to capture the
   determinants intersecting at the crossroads of economic and political
   dimensions. The authors will explore the selected building blocks of the
   system of differentiation inside the V4 group.},

Abstract = {In Latin America, formal workers (labor insiders) and informal workers
   (outsiders) tend to be enrolled in distinct welfare programs, so
   scholars generally assume that a fundamen-tal political cleavage pits
   insiders against outsiders. According to a meta-analysis reported in
   this article, however, survey-based studies have hitherto shown the two
   groups to have relatively similar social policy preferences. The article
   seeks to reconcile these two strains by arguing that the
   insider/outsider binary oversimplifies the reality of Latin American
   labor markets. Workers' frequent movement between the two sectors as
   well as marriages between informal and formal workers endow many
   individuals with mixed policy inter-ests. Using an original and
   nationally representative poll of Mexican adults, this article shows
   that an insider/outsider attitudinal cleavage does exist but is widest
   between infor-mal and formal workers without mixed interests. The
   article also shows how new survey questions that improve on previous
   measures produce stronger relationships between labor traits and
   attitudes. The findings have implications for the study of social policy
   coalitions and insider/outsider politics in Latin America and beyond.},

Abstract = {This paper delves into Brazil's attempt to mediate global conflicts to
   enhance its international status, focusing on the case of the Tehran
   Declaration. Drawing on interviews with the foreign policy community of
   the United Nations Security Council's permanent members (P5), the study
   underscores the perception of major powers regarding Brazil's mediation
   attempts. The findings suggest that while Brazil's mediation could
   enhance its prestige, it is viewed as lacking significant influence in
   high-stake global security conflicts. The Tehran deal episode
   exemplifies Brazil's overextension. These perceptions may provide
   lessons for the Brazilian attempt to mediate the war in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {This chapter draws attention to political situation of Bosnia and
   Herzegovina as post-conflict state. Tensions continue to exist in
   Bosnian society and institutions, including the armed forces. The
   state's consolidation following the Dayton peace agreements and the
   effective peacebuilding process run into obstacles. This is expressed in
   the separatist tendencies that are still present. Activity at the local
   and regional levels, cooperation with international organizations (NATO,
   EU), neighboring states, bilateral relations with other states are
   crucial. This chapter examines the content, determinants and evolutions
   of international and Bosnian institutions in peacebuilding process.
   However, the effects of weak statehood and civil war led to threats
   (e.g., political instability, terrorism, organized crime).},

Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Objective/Context: The article describes the role of Colombia inthe
   Korean War between 1951-1954, proposing an analysis that links the
   context of the Cold War in Latin America, the violence in Colombia, and
   the features of the Korean conflict. Methodology: Based on new
   historiography of the Cold War and the concept of global history, the
   text exposes an analysis of primary and secondary sources to identify
   synchronicities between Internal Policies, the international context and
   the practices of military and political Colombian elites to participate
   in the Korean conflict. Conclusion: The text describes how political and
   military elites in the middle of the twenty century in Colombia
   understood the context of global polarization in the postwar and how in
   the middle of an economic, military and diplomatic dependency, justified
   the presence of more than 5 thousand people in the field of combat in
   Korea. Originality: The approach from this perspective let us understand
   some global and local interdependencies in the country in the fifty'
   decades.},
