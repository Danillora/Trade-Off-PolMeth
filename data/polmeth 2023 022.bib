Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Number = {4},
Pages = {562-574},
Abstract = {Austria's 1995 accession to the European Union has brought significant
   changes to the country's political, economic, social and cultural
   fabric. To assess the implications of an EU membership, this article
   first provides a brief overview of the EU's governance system to assess
   Austria's leeway to pursue its interests. This is followed by a
   discussion of how Austria's EU membership has impacted selected areas
   including economic, agriculture and security policies but also with
   regard to democracy and the role of national parliaments. We show that
   Austria's membership in the Single Market and the Eurozone has
   significant implications for the country's monetary and even fiscal
   sovereignty, the involvement in EU foreign affairs and security policy
   have been more modest given the intergovernmental character of this
   policy domain. However, the level of adaptational pressure also depends
   on the relationship between the EU and national policy structures
   (objectives, principles, procedures, and financial instruments). In
   institutional terms, EU membership has also decreased the role of the
   Austrian legislature in the policy-making and strengthened the role of
   the government and other executive actors.},

Series = {Central European Value Studies},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {381},
Pages = {168-186},
Abstract = {Masaryk's concept of democracy is based on the legacy of the humanist
   ideals of Western civilisation. According to Masaryk, these ideals are
   rooted in ancient philosophy, Christianity, and the Enlightenment. As a
   representative of enlightened reason, Masaryk emphasises the role of
   education in the development of humanity: the Czech question is, in his
   view, a question of application of scientific knowledge. Masaryk views
   this task with optimism and derives the ideals of humanism from the
   Czech tradition of Reformation. This pitted him against those
   intellectuals who interpreted Czech humanism in relation to Catholicism
   and Western influences. In the spirit of Auguste Comte, Masaryk later
   became convinced that the key task of his times was to politically
   overcome the shift from theocracy to democracy. That point, in his view,
   came with the First World War, which Masaryk called the `world
   revolution'. Its outcome was supposed to be an era of humanism and
   science-based democracy. Prazny shows that to Masaryk, democracy is a
   task that has not yet been fully realised, which is why schooling and
   education remain a task of a prime political importance.},

Abstract = {Europe is changing and we are now seeing an emerging discussion about
   Norway's relationship with the EU. This is necessary, since Norway's
   agreements with the EU were negotiated at a time when the world looked
   very different. The current government decided in the spring of 2022 to
   put together a committee to assess experience with the EEA agreement
   over the past ten years (the last time a comprehensive
   investigation/evaluation of Norway's agreements with the EU was
   conducted was in 2012). In addition to being tasked with assessing
   Norway's experience with the EEA agreement, the committee was asked to
   assess the experiences of Great Britain (since Brexit), Switzerland and
   Canada in regards to their agreements with the EU. The government did
   not asked the committee, however, to carry out a corresponding
   assessment of what a possible Norwegian EU membership would mean for
   different sectors. Although it is not difficult to find a political
   explanation for why the membership option was not included in the
   mandate the government granted the committee, there are no good
   research-based justifications for this, as membership is indeed an
   option. With this special issue, we therefore wish to supplement the
   committee's report, which is scheduled to be published in the spring
   2024, with an analysis of the membership option.},

Abstract = {This article examines foreign minister Ine Eriksen Sereide's European
   pol-icy in the period 2017-2021. Based on the foreign minister's own
   statements to the Norwegian Parliament, the article demonstrates how
   European pol-icy under Sereide contained elements of both continuity and
   rupture. Like her predecessors, Sereide presented Norway's relationship
   with the EU as an interest-driven relationship based on common values,
   but at the same time she added greater importance to the relationship
   with the EU than other foreign ministers have done in the past. The
   article also shows that Sereide's portrayal of Norway's room for
   maneuvering in this relationship differed markedly from the Stoltenberg
   II government's emphasis on the right of reservation. We also show how
   ideas of the EU and maneuvering room can help shed light on the social
   security scandal.},

Abstract = {This study firstly examines the causal effect of environmental
   information disclosure on political trust and then provides a novel
   psychological mechanism through which the effect occurred. Exploiting
   the staggered rolled-out implementation of a national program in China
   that provides real-time air-pollution information to the public, we find
   that air pollution adversely moderates the positive effect of
   information disclosure on political trust. Notably and surprisingly,
   this ``adverse moderation{''} is concentrated in less polluted areas,
   where the lack of visible smog led citizens to remain unaware of the
   actual pollution levels until information is disclosed. Heterogeneity
   analysis shows that the adverse moderation is more pronounced among
   urban residents using Internet, an important source for pollution
   information. Furthermore, we establish that the causal effect operates
   through the channels of citizens' mental well-being, demonstrated by a
   large and statistically significant increase in the risk of mild
   depression due to heightened concern over pollution.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the politics of expertise in the European
   Parliament (EP). We aim to understand how MEPs and political group staff
   discursively construct expertise, its role in parliamentary work, and
   how expertise is politicized in the EP. The qualitative analysis is
   based on an extensive interview dataset (n = 133) from the 8th and 9th
   legislative terms. It builds on a constructivist approach that sees
   expertise as constructed, legitimized, and institutionalized in
   discourses and practices and shaped by struggles and power relations.
   The article shows that expertise in the EP is a political rather than a
   technical question. Understandings of expertise and its role are
   constituted and contested, and political ideologies shape understandings
   of expertise. Although the role of technical policy expertise in the EP
   is broadly accepted, it is approached through a political lens, and
   political groups value and use expertise in different ways in internal
   policymaking.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of decompression as a specific process
   of differentiation. Decompression can be anchored as one of the
   phenomena of non-compliance, representing a distinctive phenomenon,
   however. Governments or leaders acting in a decompression way are not
   Eurosceptics and they do not want to reverse the course of integration.
   We define decompression as a sudden violation of an EU rule by a member
   state, which leads to immediate disruption of shared trust in a basic EU
   policy or principle. In the case of a crisis, we can see a
   `compression', an unexpected crisis-driven demand placed on domestic
   institutions. Decompression is a relaxation of this pressure triggering
   the non-application of an EU policy or principle in reaction to changes
   external to the political equilibrium. It sheds new light on the
   persistent power of individual politicians to compromise European
   integration in an unintended way, so far under-reported by the
   literature.},

Abstract = {This study addresses a critical gap in our understanding of how the
   employer and workplace context influences the working career of older
   employees. Leveraging linked employer-employee data, this study examines
   the impact of workplace retention practices on an early labour market
   exit for employees aged fifty-five to sixty-four in Denmark. The
   findings reveal that, for those eligible for early retirement, work
   environment adaptation, re-employment of retired employees, and positive
   views of older employees' productivity significantly contribute to
   avoiding early retirement. However, these workplace retention practices
   do not influence unemployment, emphasizing their effectiveness in
   postponing early retirement rather than mitigating job loss. Moreover,
   the analysis shows that employees with managerial roles and high skill
   levels benefit more from workplace retention practices in terms of
   avoiding both early retirement and unemployment. This finding highlights
   the employer's key role in shaping inequalities in an ageing workforce
   by selectively providing opportunities to extend working lives.},

Abstract = {In my contribution, I want to show that Henderson's essay opens a
   crucial reexamination of the nexus between histories of racial violence,
   genocide and the social imaginary of the West. Rather than taking for
   granted the idea that the formation of, and institutionalization of, the
   modern European/Western state-system constituted as a rational political
   and legal order-insofar as it circumscribed violence within a certain
   juridical framework-we need to better understand the consequences how
   such an order founded on white supremacy unleashed a racialized
   genocidal violence within itself. My argument here focuses on the
   concept of race war as way of making intelligible how state strategic
   action comes to be racialized in what I've called, the ``global racial
   imaginary.{''} I conclude with a gesture towards Afro-pessimism
   structural understanding of modernity and anti-Blackness.},

Abstract = {This article argues that differences in sociopolitical reputation can
   explain why interest groups fail or succeed in influencing policymakers
   and that therefore sociopolitical reputation is a useful addition to the
   conceptual toolbox of interest groups scholars. Focusing on pharmacies
   and their associations in Greece and Portugal between 2005 and 2021,
   this article uses the concept of sociopolitical reputation to explain
   why reform attempts to reduce pharmaceutical spending and increase
   competition in the pharmacy sector were successful in Portugal but not
   in Greece, even though pharmacists are a much stronger interest group in
   Portugal than in Greece and even though both countries were under
   significant exogenous pressure to introduce structural reforms in the
   wake of the Eurozone crisis.},

Abstract = {Deliberative policy analysis (DPA) has fallen short and has been far
   from reaching its potentials as an alternative to traditional policy
   analysis. As a response, DPA has been reframed toward a methodological
   orientation. This article is a follow-up to the two special issues on
   DPA in 2019 and 2020. It begins by outlining the methodological
   framework of DPA, introducing its key considerations, the process, and
   the proposed organizational solution. Two DPA cases, conducted in China
   and Europe, are presented to showcase how the framework has been used in
   practice, and in authoritarian and democratic context, respectively.
   Then, the article brings up our discussions of and reflections on the
   two cases from a comparative perspective, regarding their different
   political contexts, foci on conflicts of interests or values/worldviews,
   and the design of the processes. We end the article by proposing some
   topics for further exploration.},

Abstract = {How do women navigate traditional and informal governance structures to
   influence matters of communal peace and security? We leverage focus
   group discussions with around 180 participants and 10 key informant
   interviews from five different villages in the Segou region to provide a
   case study of women's contributions to peacebuilding in Central Mali.
   Our research aims to understand which women are able to influence
   communal dynamics regarding peace and security in Mali and assess which
   identities and relationships women leverage as they seek to influence
   these dynamics. One of our key findings underscores the obvious: women
   are not a homogenous demographic; other facets of their identity shape
   what roles they can play in conflict management and what appeals they
   can make in doing so. We find compelling evidence that women's age,
   lineage, and their position in the home affect their degree of
   influence. We find that women are adept at leveraging customary
   governance mechanisms and their interpersonal networks to exercise
   influence. Overall, our findings point to the importance of an
   intersectional analysis, as well as a focus on informal and customary
   avenues of influence when considering women's involvement in matters of
   communal peace and security.},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {The public-elite policy feedback mechanism of the Social Construction
   Framework (SCF) postulates that the public rewards policymakers for the
   appropriate distribution of benefits and burdens to target populations.
   In this article we test a key part of this dynamic by examining public
   receptivity to policy design features as a function of target population
   choice. We conduct a national survey experiment of approximately 3350
   Americans. Our instrument asks respondents to indicate support or
   opposition to a range of policy tools in a suite of six climate change
   policies, but varies who would be responsible for options based upon
   Schneider and Ingram's idealized types. Our research design tests the
   independent effects of deservingness and power foundational to the
   construction of target populations in the SCF. We find, in general,
   deservingness to be a stronger predictor of support for policy tools
   than notions of power. We also identify situations where deservingness
   acts independently of power in ways not anticipated by the SCF-notably
   public favor for burdens on powerful groups. Our findings offer
   implications for theoretical and empirical development of the SCF
   regarding the influence of policymakers' perceptions of public
   acceptance of policy design in crafting public policies.},

Pages = {1884-1908},

Abstract = {A growing line of research examines causes and consequences of militant
   group competition. However, empirical work on these topics has
   limitations. Most quantitative research uses relatively rough proxies
   for competition, such as counts of groups in a country. Other work uses
   dichotomous indicators, ignoring the intensity or degree of rivalries.
   Additionally, many studies examine either terrorist organizations or
   rebel groups, overlooking cross-type rivalry (e.g., terrorist vs.
   rebel). We address these issues by introducing time-varying dyadic
   rivalry data on hundreds of groups - rebels, terrorists, and
   pro-government militias - in Africa and Asia, 1990-2015. Rivalry levels
   include denouncements, threats, and violence. After presenting the data,
   we test the ``outbidding{''} hypothesis: the notion that
   inter-organizational competition leads to more terrorism. This argument
   has found support in qualitative analyses, but quantitative tests using
   rivalry proxies show mixed results. Using our data we find support for
   the hypothesis. We conclude with research questions that could be
   addressed with the data.},

Abstract = {Various processes in recent years have brought about trends of
   polarization within democratic societies, challenging political
   stability. Against this backdrop, policy patterns that are being adopted
   regarding controversial issues are significantly affected by these
   countries' aspiration to create and maintain a consensus, which may have
   implications not favoring the public. One such issue is human
   experiments in medicine (clinical trials), which has been regulated by
   most countries through primary legislation. As a deeply divided society,
   Israel has been addressing this issue through regulation and secondary
   legislation, despite several attempts to have it regulated through
   primary legislation. This article employs the consociational model
   alongside Public Choice Theory to explain the adoption of this policy
   pattern on the issue of human experiments. Based on thematic analysis of
   semi-structured interviews and existing sources, it sheds light on the
   normative choice that weighs the merits of primary legislation against
   the virtues of accommodation and consensus.},

Abstract = {Street harassment renders countless women, girls and others insecure in
   their everyday lives. Over the past two decades a global grassroots
   movement developed to combat street harassment and its attendant
   insecurities. But neither phenomenon has excited the attention of
   Security Studies, critical or otherwise. In this paper, we focus on the
   global anti-street harassment movement, conceptualising its activists as
   `everyday security practitioners' who, like privileged security
   practitioners in the state or the academy, theorise street harassment
   and devise and implement strategies to tackle it. In so doing we argue
   that Security Studies should pay more attention to the everyday, to
   insecurities like street harassment, and to such `everyday security
   practitioners'. To illustrate this argument we first define street
   harassment. We then consider Security Studies and its exclusion of the
   everyday. To argue for its inclusion in Security Studies, we explicate
   the diverse insecurities produced by street harassment, conceptualise
   `everyday security practitioners', and provide some illustrations of
   strategies deployed by the global anti-street harassment movement both
   to bring street harassment to wider public attention as a pervasive
   everyday insecurity and to combat it. We conclude with two suggestions
   for Security Studies.},

Abstract = {Interest group literature suggests reformer advocacy groups, seeking
   policy change and innovation, are more likely to secure policy victory
   in local government. Entrenched advocacy groups, favoring current
   policies, are better suited to win policy battles at the state level.
   Consequently, entrenched groups have pushed state legislatures to limit
   local governments' decision authorities through preemption across a wide
   range of public-interest issues including tobacco use, gun control,
   marriage rights, and climate change. Yet few studies have considered how
   competing advocacy groups strategically frame their agenda in preemption
   debates. We draw on the ``scope of conflict{''} literature to show that
   opposing camps vary in their issue definition, relational strategies,
   and institutional frames. For example, while entrenched advocates focus
   on the main issue under debate, reformer advocates link multiple issues
   together. Our study case is preemption legislation that prohibits local
   governments from banning energy fuels like natural gas in new buildings.
   We use computational text analysis and descriptive inference to analyze
   state committee testimony of 117 advocacy groups. Results raise
   important questions about the effectiveness of conflict expansion
   strategies in venues like committee systems and provide considerations
   for reformer advocates in their efforts to secure state support and
   build clean energy campaigns.},

Abstract = {Objective/context: In this article, we explore the determinants of voter
   preference for Gustavo Petro in the first round of the 2022 presidential
   election in Colombia. Methodology: Using a series of quantitative tools,
   we explore the variables associated with a preference for Gustavo Petro.
   We establish two groups of variables: personal and contextual, and
   preferences on economic and social issues (issues), and establish their
   relative weight as determinants of the closeness between Petro and his
   voters. Conclusions: We found that voters chose candidate Petro based on
   the satisfaction of their most important preferences, particularly
   regarding economic issues, and downplayed their differences with the
   candidate on issues related to individual liberties. Originality: This
   work presents original data collected during the 2022 presidential
   campaign and uses a combination of quantitative tools to estimate the
   determinants of preferences for Petro.},

Abstract = {The countries of the Sub-Saharan region have, on average, made
   significant progress in governance performance, especially in terms of
   democratic accountability and public goods provision-findings that seem
   to contradict patterns of state fragility and economic underdevelopment
   common in the region. This article explores this seeming contradiction
   and presents in more detail findings from the Berggruen Governance Index
   regarding the governance performance of five countries, namely Ghana,
   Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa. Lagging state capacity and
   growing sovereign debt emerge as critical factors, and the article
   suggests that they may be responsible for the inability of many
   countries in the region to consolidate gains in governance as well as
   economic performance.},

Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},

Volume = {75},
Number = {4},
Pages = {779-825},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Why would a supranational law enforcer suddenly refrain from wielding
   its powers? The authors theorize the supranational politics of
   forbearance-the deliberate underenforcement of the law-and explain how
   they arise from cross-pressures between prosecutorial discretion and
   intergovernmental policy-making. The article then traces why an
   exemplary supranational enforcer-the European Commission-became
   reluctant to launch infringements against European Union member states.
   While the Commission's policy-making role as engine of integration has
   been controversial, its prosecutorial role as guardian of the Treaties
   has been viewed as less contentious. Yet after 2004, infringements
   launched by the Commission plummeted. The authors demonstrate that the
   Commission's political leadership grew alarmed that aggressive
   enforcement was eroding intergovernmental support for its policy agenda.
   By reining in the bureaucrats managing enforcement and embracing
   conciliatory dialogues with governments, the Commission sacrificed its
   role as guardian of the Treaties to safeguard its role as engine of
   integration. The article's findings highlight the consequences of
   politicizing international institutions and the tradeoffs facing
   executives double-hatting as prosecutors and policymakers.},

   processes different to those experienced by the countries of the EU-15.
   Consolidation of their democratic status presents challenges. This
   historical and institutional legacy of the East includes specific
   characteristics which are observable in the make-up of the political
   groupings of the European Parliament and the European Council, where
   they trend more to the right wing.Their presence has been highly
   favorable for the dominance of the of the current led by the European

Abstract = {The topic of the e-government e-skills of Serbian citizens has been
   largely unexplored. Thus, the study aims to explore the citizens'
   current level of e-government e-skills competencies. The data were
   collected from 2,894 citizens through a paper survey and analyzed using
   ANOVA and EFA. The empirical results suggest that there are significant
   differences between the regions, with the citizens of the Belgrade
   region being significantly more proficient than citizens in other
   regions of Serbia in all areas except digital certificate skills. The
   empirical results also suggest that women are more proficient than men,
   that the 65+ age group's digital skills are completely inadequate, and
   that education level is a key factor.},

   experiments in Japan, a critical U.S. ally in Asia. The results show the
   Japanese citizens' strong Not-In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) sentiment: They
   value the U.S.-Japan alliance per se but do not want those advanced arms
   (specifically, Osprey and F-35 fighter jets) to be deployed in their
   vicinity, particularly when the U.S. military operates them. Our study
   contributes to the literature on alliance politics and civil-military
   relations by emphasizing the importance of paying close attention to
   local public opposition as a potential source of instability in global
   military alliances.},

Title = {Rethinking International Order in Early Modern Europe: Evidence from
   Courtly Ceremonial},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {77},
Number = {4},
Pages = {691-720},
Abstract = {Once the object of consensus, every aspect of the traditional account of
   early modern Europe as an anarchic system of sovereign states is now
   debated-from the existence of sovereign states to the notion of anarchy,
   and even the European limits of that system. In the context of these
   disagreements, I develop a new account of international order in early
   modern Europe grounded in the perceptions of historical actors. I first
   argue that this can be achieved by studying the tools that practitioners
   relied on to describe and organize political authority in the world. I
   subsequently delve into a common, though seldom-studied, tool developed
   by a group of practitioners known as masters of ceremonies: courtly
   ceremonial (or ius praecedentiae). I make three substantive claims.
   First, the political authorities identified in manuals on courtly
   ceremonial were primarily crowns and republics, but in the later
   eighteenth century, all eventually came to be described as ``states.{''}
   Second, all political authorities stood in a hierarchy determined by a
   specific set of criteria I identify, but new criteria-power and
   sovereignty-emerged over the course of the eighteenth century. Third,
   the scope of international order was not self-evident, and it certainly
   did not have clear ``European{''} limits in the eyes of masters of
   ceremonies; non-European political authorities could easily be
   integrated into their orders of precedence. Ultimately, I suggest that
   IR scholars should reconsider why they study early modern Europe and how
   they study international orders.},

Abstract = {Since its Joint Communication on Hybrid Threats, the EU has publicly
   recognized the risks to its security posed by non-traditional means
   aimed at undermining its legitimacy. The propagation of disinformation
   including misleading political advertising serves as a key example of
   how the Commission's perception of the EU's vulnerability to hybrid
   threats in times of geopolitical instability is shaping its regulatory
   policies. This article uses the framework of regulatory mercantilism,
   which argues that in conditions of perceived vulnerability, a state-like
   actor will reassert regulatory control based on a security logic in
   areas previously characterized by self-regulatory regimes. This article
   considers the Commission's 2019-2024 priorities, and how the spheres of
   technology, security, and democracy policies are intersecting as a
   response to hybrid threats. As a result, online platform governance in
   the EU is being substantially restructured with a move from systems of
   self-regulation to co-regulation backed by sanction as a means of
   combating hybrid threats online. The Commission's ``taking back
   control{''} from platforms in the context of a digital sovereignty
   agenda serves as an example of regulatory mercantilism in digital
   policy, which sees the Commission seek to promote regulatory strength in
   response to perceived vulnerability.},

Abstract = {Why do some actors possess more leverage to diffuse norms than others?
   Although it is often assumed that norm diffusion simply `happens'
   through the interaction of political and cultural systems, we argue that
   individuals and institutional flexibility play a crucial role in the
   success and failure of norm diffusion. Analyzing the contending
   interpretation and diffusion of the Common but Differentiated
   Responsibilities (CBDR) norm between the Independent Alliance of Latin
   America and the Caribbean (AILAC) and the Association of Southeast Asian
   Nations (ASEAN) within the UNFCCC, we illustrate how larger political
   mandates, the use of informal negotiation platforms and the skills and
   connections of negotiators played a crucial role in the respective
   success and failure of norm diffusion. While the more flexible and
   ad-hoc AILAC was able to effectively diffuse its interpretation of CBDR
   into the climate regime, the strictly intergovernmental ASEAN was unable
   to do the same. These findings advance the literature on norm
   entrepreneurs from the Global South and support several assumptions of
   the informal institutions theory. They also show, however, the
   importance of individuals as a defining condition of both norm
   entrepreneurship and the functioning of institutional platforms.},

Abstract = {How does residing in the proximity of surveillance infrastructure-i.e.,
   checkpoints, the separation barrier, and military installations-affect
   support for cooperative and confrontational forms of collective action?
   Cooperative actions involve engagement with outgroups to advance the
   ingroup cause (e.g., negotiations, joint actions, and peace movements),
   whereas confrontational actions involve unilateral tactics to weaken the
   outgroup (e.g., boycott, armed resistance). In the context of West Bank
   and Jerusalem, we combine geo-coded data on the surveillance
   infrastructure with a representative survey of the adult population from
   49 communities (N = 1,000). Our multilevel analyses show that
   surveillance does not affect support for confrontational actions but
   instead decreases support for cooperative actions. Moreover, we identify
   a new, community-level mechanism whereby surveillance undermines
   cooperative actions through weakening inclusive norms that challenge
   dominant us-versus-them perspectives. These effects are empirically
   robust to various individual- and community-level controls, as well as
   to the potential of reverse causality and residential self-selection.
   Our findings illustrate how cooperative voices and the fabric of social
   communities become the first casualties of exposure to surveillance.
   They also speak to the importance of considering structural factors,
   with broader implications for the socio-psychological study of
   collective action.},

Abstract = {Using data from the Afrobarometer surveys, this paper finds that people
   living in regions in which police corruption is more prevalent are more
   likely to report that they or someone in their family have been victims
   of physical assault. People living in more corrupted regions are also
   more likely to report that they or someone in their family has had
   something stolen from their home. We find no statistically significant
   gender differences in the average marginal effects. Controlling for the
   incidence of corruption in other domains reduces the size of the
   estimated association but does not render it insignificant in terms of
   statistical significance or magnitude. Non-police corruption is also
   strongly associated with an increased risk of crime. For both types of
   crime, the evidence points to ``transactional{''} police corruption
   (having to pay bribes to get help) rather than ``predatory{''} police
   corruption (having to pay bribes to avoid problems) as driving the
   relationship. Finally, we show that, controlling for whether the
   respondent reports being a victim of either type of crime, police
   corruption predicts an increase in the probability that the respondent
   reports feeling unsafe while walking in their own neighborhood thus
   imposing a cost even on those who have not been victims.},

Abstract = {A growing body of public policy and governance scholars recognise the
   importance of learning in supporting adaptive and responsive governance
   systems. Fostering learning within policy processes and governance
   systems, however, can be challenging. Collectively, we often ignore or
   misinterpret relevant policy information, or we may be incapable of
   translating new information into policy. Despite significant scholarly
   attention to learning, knowledge of the barriers to learning remains
   underdeveloped. To advance theoretical insights, this article integrates
   research on individual cognitive biases with literature on learning to
   identify barriers that can block learning or lead to non-learning in
   policy and governance processes. It also explores how these barriers can
   be mitigated or exacerbated by different governance contexts. Based on
   these insights, this paper provides guidance for researchers on how to
   empirically assess learning barriers across different governance
   contexts.},

Abstract = {The theoretical evolution of punctuated equilibrium theory (PET) and
   empirical expansion of its research agenda to non-democratic countries,
   demonstrate that democratic nations feature less punctuated policymaking
   than autocracies, owing to informational advantages. However, can these
   differences be identified cross-sectionally across numerous political
   systems facing a common policy problem? To assess this, we present a
   broad and robust empirical analysis of PET dynamics across 166 countries
   over three years for a single policy issue that affected all nations:
   the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we theoretically link PET with the
   concepts of policy learning and bounded emulation and propose the
   emergence of mini cycles of punctuated equilibrium during a crisis.
   Then, using weekly data, we examine univariate distributions of
   COVID-19-related policy changes to better understand how punctuated
   policy dynamics have differed between political systems. Using multiple
   approaches, we demonstrate (1) the emergence of PET mini cycles during
   crises and (2) an absence of macro-level differences in PET dynamics
   across democratic, partially democratic and autocratic countries. Our
   evaluation of policy change distributions across a wide range of
   political systems in a crisis context offers notable insights into the
   generalisability of PET dynamics. Thus, our article offers novel
   advancements to PET scholarship both theoretically and empirically.},

Title = {A mindfulness perspective on the link between abusive supervision
   climate and team conflict},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Pages = {907-930},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to examine whether and how abusive
   supervision climate impacts team conflict from a mindfulness
   perspective. Prior research has identified serious dysfunctional effects
   of abusive supervision climate in teams. Team conflict, which is often a
   signal for dysfunctional relationships in teams, has however received
   limited attention. To contribute to this line of research, this study
   develops and tests a theoretical model on the role of team mindfulness
   in understanding the link between abusive supervision climate and task,
   process, and relationship conflict. Design/methodology/approachTo test
   the theoretical model, this study collected and analyzed two-wave
   time-lagged data from 499 employees in 92 teams. FindingsThe results
   showed that abusive supervision climate aggravated task conflict and
   process conflict via diminishing levels of team mindfulness. Abusive
   supervision climate also exacerbated relationship conflict, but the
   effects did not occur via a decrease in team mindfulness. Practical
   implicationsWhile it may not always be possible to prevent the
   development of an abusive supervision climate in workplaces, other
   interventions may prevent conflict in teams with abusive leaders. As
   indicated by the findings, task conflict and process conflict may be
   reduced if teams are high on mindfulness. Interventions that stimulate
   team mindfulness might thus improve collaboration in teams with abusive
   leaders. Originality/valueThis research offers novel insights regarding
   how abusive leaders might instigate conflict within teams. Specifically,
   through the unique perspective of mindfulness, the authors are able to
   offer new insights into how abusive supervision climate affects task,
   process and relationship conflict. This study offers a novel, yet
   important, lens to examine how conflict occurs in teams.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the European Commission's
   trade and sustainable development discourse from 1993 to 2022. By
   employing a discursive institutionalist framework and examining a
   comprehensive corpus of over 1,400 press documents, this study traces
   the discursive process that has created both significant changes to, and
   persistent elements in, the Commission's trade-sustainability agenda.
   The analysis reveals noteworthy shifts within the discourse, notably a
   transition from a primary concern with labour and human rights during
   the 1990s to an increased focus on economic development and poverty
   reduction in the early 2000s. This was followed by a discernible move
   towards more stringent differentiation among developing countries and an
   amplified emphasis on reciprocity. In recent years, we are witnessing a
   strong focus on environmental and climate protection, labour rights, and
   enforceability. The findings underscore the enduring presence of
   trade-sustainability ideas within EU trade policy and their gradual
   evolution over time, while contributing to the literature on the role of
   ideas in shaping the Union's external policies.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates news portrayals of resilience in the newly renewed
   Education for Sustainable Peace in Rwanda initiative. There remains a
   gap in understanding about how Rwanda's education approaches are
   portrayed and disseminated to the public by news media. This research
   uses an inductive coding analysis and layers Entman's framing theory to
   evaluate new media portrayals of resiliency in the reporting of domestic
   and international media outlets. This research demonstrates that there
   has been little media attention paid to Rwanda's education system
   outside of Rwanda, despite the newly revised programming. This research
   also finds that in media sources which do discuss Rwanda's education
   system, portrayals of approaches to resilience that have the potential
   for inclusivity are far more common than approaches which are top-down
   and exclusive. These findings serve to contribute to literature in both
   the context of Rwanda's place in global governance and the broader
   discussions of educational resiliency.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the importance of civic engagement during
   emergencies. We consider various individual-level factors such as trust,
   risk cognition, fears about the emergency and cost-benefit analyses of
   engagement as factors that motivate citizens to become engaged. We argue
   that governments should recognise the value of community initiatives and
   civic engagement in coping with emergencies. Our empirical investigation
   uses data collected in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results
   demonstrate that trust in government and interpersonal trust may
   influence citizens' perceptions of engagement during emergencies but
   have no effect on engagement behaviour. However, risk cognition and
   cost-benefit analyses are better predictors of future engagement
   intentions during emergencies. These insights may improve our
   understanding of community resilience and the ability of individuals to
   bounce back after emergencies.},

Title = {Deterrence through Inflicting Costs: Between Deterrence by Punishment
   and Deterrence by Denial},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {The strategy of deterrence by denial is widely used by different actors.
   Despite its prominence, however, the scholarship on deterrence by denial
   stands to be developed further. It lags behind scholarship on deterrence
   by punishment on two points: in identifying the conditions under which
   the strategy works and in examining elements affecting its adoption.
   Deterrence by denial also carries some conceptual ambiguity since its
   employment takes many significantly different forms and also because it
   overlaps with deterrence by punishment. Despite the emphasis in current
   scholarship on ``inflicting costs{''} as a defining element of
   deterrence by punishment, costs arguably also play a significant role in
   deterrence by denial. To address these challenges, I distinguish between
   deterrence strategies by focusing on two main elements: the means the
   deterrer actor threatens to use (offensive or non-offensive) and the
   timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the
   unwanted activity). This offers a more nuanced distinction between
   deterrence strategies and better encompasses the role of inflicting
   costs in deterrence by denial. I suggest that this research offers a
   useful point of departure to further theorize about deterrence by
   denial, and it sets a promising research agenda that is pertinent given
   the growing interest in deterrence by denial, especially in its
   application to cyber deterrence.},

Abstract = {The Wagner Group's revolt against Russian President Vladimir Putin's
   regime, though contained, holds important implications for Russia and
   lessons for the West. The revolt was a full-scale crisis for the regime,
   reflected Putin's extraordinary misreading of domestic realities,
   undermined his rule's core rationale of bringing stability and security
   to Russia, exposed the brittleness of the Russian state, revealed weak
   support of Russian elites, demonstrated his need for mediation from a
   despised foreign leader, and brought to the surface the strains that the
   Russia-Ukraine war has imposed on the Russian polity. The two main
   takeaways for the West are that Putin chose compromise rather than
   escalation to deal with the crisis, and that over time the war is likely
   to impose deeper strains on Russia. It is now less clear than ever not
   only that Russia can win the war, but also that the regime that launched
   it will survive intact.},

   rights for more societal security. Structural, cultural, and demographic
   features explain variations in the civil servants' views. Position and
   perceptions of crisis management capacity make a difference. Officials
   responsible for crisis management are more willing to prioritize
   security. Low conflict, high trust, and a strong identification with
   central government creates support for security measures. Furthermore,

Journal = {COMMONWEALTH \& COMPARATIVE POLITICS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Prior research determines whether politicians at rallies make
   programmatic, clientelist or personalist appeals. We argue that this
   reductive approach obscures the variety of meaning-making at rallies. We
   offer a vision of rallies as complex communicative events, at which
   multiple actors co- and counter-produce messages in numerous ways.
   Nonetheless, we argue that there are patterns in meaning-making at
   rallies. Rallies are produced in accordance with a genre which guides
   what components are included in them and how they are interpreted. We
   argue that rallies produced in that genre fashion and foreground three
   constructs above others: candidates, collectivities and contests. They
   fashion them, among other things, through representative claims.
   Altogether, we show that rallies are significant sites of political
   communication in Africa and worldwide.},

Abstract = {In the long run, economic policy in advanced industrial states has
   historically alternated between favoring price competition and favoring
   the market power of domestic firms, across such disparate areas as
   antitrust, intellectual property, and trade. This article presents a
   theory of long-term policy change, based on the interaction of
   accumulating economic costs and staff turnover within the state,
   explaining multiple policy alternations during the twentieth century.
   Policy regimes of competition or market power endogenously generate
   diminishing returns, manifested as unintended economic costs intrinsic
   to competition or market power. And yet policy regimes endure because
   established cadres of government officials remain committed to existing
   policy approaches. Even as diminishing returns become apparent, it is
   only after the removal or circumvention of these established
   policymakers, through staff turnover and learning by uncommitted
   officials, that policy eventually changes course. The article supports
   this argument with extensive evidence from government archives in the
   United States and France.},

Abstract = {Dashed hope leads to potentially destabilising anger. I highlight
   examples of the link between dashed hope and anger/unrest in Kosovo,
   before focusing on the post-independence period. The hopes raised
   following the 2008 declaration of independence were subsequently dashed
   leading to despondency and anger. Anger was manifested, however, in a
   primarily constructive way resulting in increased support for
   Vetevendosje. The international community's approach towards Kosovo,
   however, restricts Vetevendosje's capacity to realise people's hopes. If
   Vetevendosje is unable to realise people's hopes, this will likely
   precipitate ``hopeless anger{''} and support for illiberal/violent
   movements with ominous implications for stability in Kosovo and the
   region.},

Abstract = {This article adds to a growing literature explaining driving forces
   behind Muslim foreign fighters in Jihadist conflicts. Employing
   quantitative analyses, we examine counts of Muslim foreign fighters from
   non-Muslim majority countries in Iraq and Syria from 2011 to 2015. We
   find that greater numbers of foreign fighters come from countries where
   Muslim minorities are politically organized, excluded from policymaking
   processes, and engaged in peaceful mobilization than countries where
   these conditions are otherwise absent. These results contribute to a
   more nuanced understanding of the mechanisms by which aggrieved
   individuals tend to be recruited in larger numbers to participate in
   foreign wars.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {The increase in divorce rates over the past decades challenges the
   traditional image of the two-parent family, as new family forms are
   increasingly more common. Yet, the traditional view of the family has
   remained central to political socialization research. Therefore, we
   propose and empirically test a theoretical framework regarding the
   consequences of parental separation for processes of political
   socialization. While the impact of parental divorce has been studied
   extensively by sociologists, the political implications of this
   impactful life event have remained largely uncovered. We identify two
   mechanisms that we expect to predict more leftist political orientations
   in children of separated parents compared to those from intact families:
   experiences of economic deprivation and single-mother socialization.
   Multi-level analyses using the European Values Study (2008) and
   two-generational analyses with the Swiss Household Panel (1999-2020)
   support our expectations, indicating that in case of parental separation
   offspring tends to hold more leftist political orientations, controlling
   for selection into parental separation and the intergenerational
   transmission of political ideology. We find empirical support for
   mechanisms of economic deprivation and single-mother socialization
   across our analyses. The implications of our findings are that in the
   family political socialization process, offspring's political
   orientations are not only influenced by their parents' ideology, but

Abstract = {Drawing from four electoral models for the election of Bosniak and Croat
   representatives to the collective Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
   this article proposes a set of favorable conditions for the application
   of territorial distribution requirements in deeply divided societies. It
   shows that it is possible to deliver stable consociational outcomes
   using territorial distributive requirements for bi-national polities.
   Territorial distributive requirements result in stable democracy only
   under appropriate consociational conditions for the election of
   multi-person presidencies in dyadic societies with a demographic
   imbalance of power, whereas centripetal techniques prevent minority
   groups from choosing their most-preferred representatives.},

Title = {Lacanian Biopolitics of COVID-19},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {A public debate has raged in Europe and the Americas for the last year,
   almost as predictable in its substance as in its form: Has the
   suppression of individual liberties, in the form of lockdowns, curfews,
   imposed mask-wearing, and vaccination justified by and indeed
   legitimated by the sanitary crisis? On virtually all levels of public
   debate, positions have been formulated on the right (or responsibility)
   of public authorities to require citizens to take measures in the name
   of their own personal health and the health of others. In International
   Studies, biopolitics has become the go-to concept for both analyzing and
   politicizing the COVID-19 pandemic. Three variants of biopolitical
   analysis dominate, overlapping, and mutually dependent: those stemming
   the insights of Foucault's late work, those inspired by Agamben's Homo
   Sacer, and those that extended the global analysis of Hardt and Negri.
   In a recently published book, The Inverse of Biopolitics, Laurent
   interprets biopolitics in an alternative vein, finding in the final
   phase of Lacan's teaching, beginning around 1970, a preoccupation with
   the ``speaking body,{''} condensed in the hybrid term parletre, both
   speaking-being and being-speaking. This article draws out the
   implications of this alternative conceptualization of biopolitics for
   the analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Title = {Trauma, Home, and Geopolitical Bordering: A Lacanian Approach to the
   COVID-19 Crisis},

Abstract = {In this article, we read the COVID-19 pandemic from a Lacanian
   perspective, in which trauma and ontological insecurity are at the heart
   of the analysis. Using a psychoanalytical approach allows us to grasp
   why the most common response to the pandemic consisted of intensified
   commitments to home, nationalism, and exclusionary bordering practices
   and, in effect, a return to geopolitical notions of ``sovereignty.{''}
   This can be read in light of Lacan's discussion of memory as a form of
   repetition, implying that any attempt to construe history in terms of a
   coherent narrative misses the unconscious, traumatic compulsion to
   repeat. In light of this, we consider populist responses to the pandemic
   as well as how the pandemic has worked as a ``great unequalizer.{''}
   Such developments, we argue, must be read as representing a
   fragmentation of the national body and as heightening the
   vulnerabilities and asymmetric structures of power that inhere in what
   Lacan refers to as the symbolic order. Here, we propose that a
   postcolonial re-conceptualization of Lacan's understanding of the mirror
   image and the Real is necessary if we wish to establish how the pandemic
   has reinforced existing patterns of abjectification and marginalization.},

Abstract = {Religious-secular clashes have contributed to the structure of political
   competition into the twenty-first century. Yet subnational regions did
   not experience the secular-clerical cleavage as states did. Historical
   experience with overlapping secular-clerical and centre-periphery
   cleavages has shaped how (sub)national communities approach the
   relationship between religion and territorial identity today. This essay
   builds a theory of the strategic use of religion to strengthen
   subnational identity using the cases of Alsace-Moselle and Catalonia. I
   argue that historical alignment of secular-clerical and centre-periphery
   cleavages has evolved to create a contemporary political opportunity
   structure for subnational elites to leverage religion to strengthen
   community identity and obtain authority devolution. As a result, I
   observe intrastate differences in religious pluralism policies and the
   framing of their links to community identity.},

Title = {We Protect Us: Cyber Persistent Digital Antifascism and Dual Use
   Knowledge},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 6},
Abstract = {Beginning in 2018, US cyber defense architects began promoting the
   doctrinal strategy of Persistent Engagement (PE), amending a 2015 cyber
   policy based on deterrence. The PE doctrine encourages cyber soldiers to
   be quick, nimble, and aggressive-not waiting for an attack to defend
   against, and instead, maintaining a posture of constant agitation,
   infiltration, presence, and persistence. Although unintentional (and
   highly contentions), this cyber approach mirrors the strategic logic of
   contemporary, digital, antifascists in their efforts to disrupt and
   deplatform far-right activists online. The proactive, `defend forward'
   approach offered by PE shares notable similarities to antifascists'
   efforts to `go where they go', and to confront the enemy in all venues
   and on all platforms where they are present. Through interrogating
   digital antifascists' online efforts through the lens of cyber
   persistence and a whole-of-nation-plus approach, the cooperative
   proximity between State prosecutors and anti-State leftists has fostered
   a palpable tension deserving of serious inquiry and consideration. The
   purpose of this intervention is to critically probe these parallel
   functions, and the interplay between the State and non-State. Although
   such a comparative analysis shines an unacknowledged and often
   undesirable light on activists' efforts, the incorporation of their
   research in intelligence efforts and State prosecutions is undeniable,
   and begs the question: How can we critically interrogate the unintended
   role anti-carceral, abolitionist, antifascists' dual use knowledge plays
   in intelligence gathering and law enforcement?},

Abstract = {What explains civilian victimization during civil war? Existing
   scholarship claims that violence against civilians is driven primarily
   by competition between armed actors. We argue that this explanation
   neglects a crucial cause of civilian victimization: in communities they
   rule, armed groups employ systematic violence against civilians to
   establish and sustain social order. Drawing on original microlevel
   quantitative data from Colombia, we show that areas controlled by a sole
   armed actor experience high levels of victimization, while places where
   multiple actors jointly govern exhibit significantly less violence. To
   explain this pattern, we draw on evidence from original interviews,
   focus groups, and secondary sources. We show that armed groups employ
   violence to govern areas they control and enact social order. But this
   violence is checked when multiple groups rule jointly: the factors that
   sustain pacted rule disincentivize victimization. These results have
   implications for theories of political order, violence, and governance
   by non-state actors.},

Title = {Reflections: the UK after Brexit},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 3},
Abstract = {The articles in this issue have explored the effects Brexit has had on
   the UK's international role, identity, and status. In doing so they
   touch on the wider question of how significant a change Brexit has been
   for the UK. Most answers to that question point to effects on the
   constitution, unity, identity, political economy of the UK, and the
   country's place in Europe and the wider world. This concluding article
   highlights processes of both change and continuity. It explores how
   Brexit has triggered a critical juncture but this has not yet
   significantly changed the ideas (especially those held by the British
   elite) about the UK's role, identity, and status. Such a change may
   happen in time because the Brexit critical juncture is still happening,
   with the wider political fallout, especially to the UK's territorial
   integrity, still unfolding. Although even here, the potential for
   continuity should not be underestimated.},

Abstract = {This interview realized by Etudes internationales with two experts of
   Ukraine shows that the position of France over the conflict in Ukraine
   has evolved since the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Although the French
   diplomacy has refused to acknowledge the annexation of Crimea, it has
   first relied on the mediation of the conflict through the ``Normandy
   framework{''} and took some time to distance itself from Putin's Russia.
   The all-out war declared by Russia in 2022 has prompted Emmanuel Macron
   to overtly support Ukraine and to firmly condemn the Russian invasion.
   However, the French political class and the media are not always wholly
   in tune with a resolute support to Ukraine and a clear condemnation of
   Russia.},

Abstract = {Prevailing accounts of alliance formation emphasize either external
   threats or domestic politics, without an explicit consideration of how
   the two factors might interact. Instead, this paper theorizes about a
   specific type of interaction: coup-prevention strategies in
   nondemocratic regimes and external threats. Through quantitative
   analyses using the Alliance Treaty Obligations and Provisions (ATOP) and
   the State Security Forces (SSF) data, we find that ``coup-proofing{''}
   reduces the probability of alliance formation when potential allies are
   under high external threat and that this effect is driven by the
   coup-proofing regime's reduced capability to defend their allies, rather
   than the regime's increased vulnerability to aggression. Furthermore, we
   find evidence for the interactive relationship at the negotiation stage
   of alliance formation. Upon entering an alliance, a coup-proofing regime
   facing a higher level of external threat offers more policy concessions
   to the ally, whereas an ally under higher threat could make fewer
   concessions to the coup-proofing regime. Our study highlights the way
   nondemocratic domestic political institutions can interact with external
   threat to shape states' alliance behavior.},

Abstract = {Foreign exile has often served as an important solution to high-stakes
   standoffs between opposition forces and beleaguered autocrats. I assess
   the moral status of autocratic exile, by focusing on the tension between
   exile's contribution to domestic peace and its threat to global
   deterrence against autocracy. I begin by contending that transitioning
   societies normally have the moral prerogative of accepting an exile
   arrangement for their autocrat, even though such an arrangement harms
   global deterrence against autocracy. I then suggest that, in the absence
   of clear evidence of majority opposition to an exile arrangement within
   the transitioning society, foreign countries who have been entangled in
   an autocrat's rule will normally have a decisive duty to facilitate his
   exile, despite exile's repercussions for global deterrence. I explain
   why such foreign entanglement, particularly on the part of affluent
   Western democracies, is inevitable in the case of kleptocrats. But I
   also show that the entanglement argument for exile extends even to
   murderous autocrats, whose crimes fall under the purview of the
   International Criminal Court. Countries entangled in a murderous
   autocrat's rule ought to prioritize their particular duties toward his
   victims over their general moral reasons to advance international
   criminal justice.},

Abstract = {While it is widely recognized that energy injustices are prevalent in
   the clean energy transition process, there has been limited research
   attention on policy efforts aiming to mitigate these inequities. In this
   paper, we use solar equity policies as an empirical case study to
   understand how social equity considerations are conceptualized and
   operationalized in energy policy content. We build upon the policy
   design literature and code institutional statements of 54 solar equity
   policies adopted between 2001 and 2021 in the United States. In our
   comparative analysis, we focus on three levels of policy design elements
   that can be directly observed in written policy language: macro-policy
   goal construction, meso-policy instrument choices, and micro-level
   policy settings and calibrations. We find that the policy goal of energy
   justice is multifaceted, with a great emphasis on solar energy
   accessibility and provision of economic benefits and security for
   disadvantaged communities. There is a dominant preference by
   policymakers to use redistributive policies and community solar programs
   to advance energy justice-related goals. Solar equity policy instruments
   on-the-ground measures have also been calibrated to target specific
   disadvantaged populations in the energy system, which focus mostly on
   income-based vulnerability.},

Abstract = {Under what circumstances do paramilitary groups place limits on their
   use of political violence? This article considers why one of the most
   prominent paramilitary groups active during the ``Troubles{''} in
   Northern Ireland, the Provisional IRA (PIRA), exercised restraint and
   limited their use of political violence, both in the lead up to, and in
   the wake of the Good Friday Agreement. It applies Busher, Holbrook, and
   Macklin's ``internal brakes{''} typology to understand why despite the
   PIRA's proven capacity to sustain a campaign of armed violence for more
   than thirty years, they reined in on paramilitarism during the 1990s
   peace process. Through the lens of various brakes, the analysis
   identifies seven developments that were particularly salient in limiting
   the PIRA's use of armed violence. These developments included: a
   weakened capacity to continue their armed campaign, waning popular
   support, an opening of political opportunities, the need to maintain
   ties with strategically important non-violent allies, the gradual
   softening of out-group boundaries, the decommissioning process, as well
   as the creation of spaces for non-violent activism within the wider
   movement. This study's findings contribute to the scholarly debate on
   understanding how militant groups manage the parameters of their
   violence, highlighting several factors that may mitigate the risk of
   extremist views escalating to political violence.},

Abstract = {Despite the massive amount of data and sophisticated computing capacity,
   Big Tech has evolved into the new data sovereigns that governments must
   accept in the data era. Data mining and application determine the true
   value of data; in this regard, Big Tech is tough to replace. The
   so-called ``Fourth Industrial Revolution{''} is reshaping the emerging
   global order, and at its core are Big Tech firms. They not only express
   their concerns and spread their values and ideologies but also make
   their strong presence felt in international affairs, as Big Tech appears
   to be transforming into a new type of Leviathan. With access to
   significant amounts of data, the rise of Big Tech poses a challenge to
   sovereignty's exclusivity and superiority, assuming the position of de
   facto data sovereign. The article holds that the Big Tech firms, by
   virtue of their technical advantages, have not only deconstructed the
   traditional concept of sovereignty, but also formed a complex symbiotic
   relationship.},

Abstract = {Western democracies are experiencing a widespread shift towards greater
   recognition of transgender rights in public policy, yet the timing of
   change differs across states. To explain this variation, I present a
   novel theoretical framework called ``policy momentum.{''} Unlike
   existing work on policy diffusion, which typically emphasizes domestic
   or international processes, I theorize how the combined pressure from
   each level creates the conditions for policy change to occur.
   Empirically, I contrast the creation of national human rights policies
   to protect transgender individuals in Canada (2017) and Australia
   (2013). Using process-tracing and within-case analyses, and drawing on
   elite interviews, primary documents, and Hansard records, I demonstrate
   the decisive interaction of subnational legislative changes with an
   emerging global norm to produce transgender policy change. This paper
   thus contributes to our understanding of LGBTQ+ public policy while also
   providing a framework for explaining the conditions for cross-national
   policy change more broadly.},

Title = {Deliberating Like a State: Locating Public Administration Within the
   Deliberative System},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {72},

Pages = {924-943},

Abstract = {Public administration is the largest part of the democratic state and a
   key consideration in understanding its legitimacy. Despite this,
   democratic theory is notoriously quiet about public administration. One
   exception is deliberative systems theories, which have recognized the
   importance of public administration and attempted to incorporate it
   within their orbit. This article examines how deliberative systems
   approaches have represented (a) the actors and institutions of public
   administration, (b) its mode of coordination, (c) its key legitimacy
   functions, (d) its legitimacy relationships, and (e) the possibilities
   for deliberative intervention. It argues that constructing public
   administration through the pre-existing conceptual categories of
   deliberative democracy, largely developed to explain the legitimacy of
   law-making, has led to some significant omissions and misunderstandings.
   The article redresses these issues by providing an expanded
   conceptualization of public administration, connected to the core
   concerns of deliberative and other democratic theories with democratic
   legitimacy and democratic reform.},

Title = {Enabling African loots: tracking the laundering of Nigerian kleptocrats'
   ill-gotten gains in western financial centres},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 24},
Abstract = {This paper aims to provide evidence and analysis of the conveyor belt
   that allows Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) to rehabilitate their
   money in western financial centres, while inserting Nigerian material
   into debates about transnational kleptocracy. It fleshes out the chain
   of service provision going from developing countries to western boutique
   firms or `rogue' providers, ultimately reaching out to the large
   blue-chip firms that are instrumental for the validation of PEP wealth
   and reputations. We use an interpretive practice tracing methodology to
   elucidate the steps leading to money-laundering, relying on data from a
   wealth of primary and secondary sources as well as a wider dataset of
   residential real estate purchases. On the basis of these empirical
   insights, we find that enabling practices cannot be neatly situated in a
   dichotomy of lawful and unlawful behaviour. Given that the current
   assumptions lack nuance, the policy response is likewise skewed, often
   looking to identify the `exception to the rule' rather than appreciating
   the more systemic nature of the problem. Consequently, we argue that
   there is a need for a conceptual shift in the way professional enablers
   are framed and analysed, suggesting that their environment can be more
   helpfully divided into upstream and downstream roles.},

Abstract = {The financial haemorrhaging of lower income countries in the form of
   capital flight is a leading cause of global economic inequality. On an
   annual basis, trillions of dollars bypass the already starved fiscal
   spaces of nations mired in poverty, making their way instead to
   lucrative offshore bank accounts governed by secrecy jurisdictions. The
   present article relates this phenomenon to the institutional
   architecture of the global financial system and provides causal evidence
   that structural adjustment programmes implemented at the behest of
   international financial organizations amplify such capital flight. In
   particular, by isolating exogenous variation in policy conditionalities
   through the use of instrumental variables, we find that trade
   liberalization, financial sector reforms and privatization measures
   mandated by the International Monetary Fund in developing contexts
   substantially increase financial outflows occurring via current and
   capital account transactions. Our findings thus document the
   contribution that structural adjustment makes to an underappreciated
   facet of contemporary global inequality.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) in
   trade and development theory and outlines the resulting implications for
   economic policy. We propose an alternative model of international trade
   and development based on absolute, not comparative advantages of firms,
   which are nested in countries but compete internationally. Applying a
   Schumpeterian theory of dynamic development, we consider how firms can
   either increase their competitiveness through productivity gains at a
   given wage level, or by combining the existing high level of
   productivity with lower wages in low-income countries. We argue that the
   aim of competition policy must be to improve the quality of economic
   competition in international markets, limit monopoly rents and
   disincentivise rent-seeking activities through the mere outsourcing of
   production. To that end, we propose that economic policy must reinstate
   rigorous wage bargaining regimes and make FDI subject to wage
   conditionality, obliging foreign companies to increase their wages in
   the host economy in line with average national productivity growth and
   the national inflation target.},

Title = {Traveling AI-essentialism and national AI strategies: A comparison
   between South Korea and France},

Year = {2023},

Abstract = {In this paper, I investigate what common discourses National AI
   Strategies (NAISs) share and how they have unfolded differently in
   diverging national contexts. For this purpose, I compare the South
   Korean and French cases by relying on the notions of sociotechnical
   imaginary and future essentialism. I analyze (1) the emergence of the
   common discourses, which I call AI-essentialism, over the past decade;
   (2) the development of imaginaries around IT in Korea and France in the
   twentieth century, namely technological developmentalism and the
   American challenge, respectively; and (3) the integration of the
   traveling AI-essentialism and nationally embedded imaginaries of IT into
   each country's NAISs. The analysis indicates that: (1) AI-essentialism
   incorporated discursive strategies, enabling political and industrial
   leaders to naturalize AI development, hence justifying increased
   investments in the field; (2) two countries' imaginaries of IT diverged
   due to the successes and failures throughout the second half of the
   twentieth century; and (3) while two countries' NAISs share
   AI-essentialism's discursive instruments, their specific measures and
   unfolding have varied in relation to each case's existing imaginaries of
   IT.},

Abstract = {The Northern Ireland peace process has been long and tumultuous, yet 20
   years after the Good Friday Agreement, peace has not become a reality
   for many Northern Irish citizens. For those who have been excluded from
   the state and the institution-led peace process, grassroots methods of
   peacebuilding are needed to create an everyday peace that is owned by
   and includes all Northern Irish citizens. A narrative approach to
   peacebuilding is one that addresses many of the challenges to everyday
   peace following the ``Troubles.{''} By exploring the use and impact of
   storytelling and narrative on everyday experiences, the narrative
   approach proves to be a viable tool for elevating and giving ownership
   of the peace process to marginalized members of Northern Irish society.},

Title = {Post-colonial gaslighting and Greenlandic independence: When ontological
   insecurity sustains hierarchy},

Abstract = {This article proposes the concept of `post-colonial gaslighting' to
   analyse subtle forms of colonialism and domination in international
   relations and the persistence of hierarchies in the international
   system. It asks why Greenland, despite electoral majorities for
   independence, remains a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Going beyond
   existing materialist explanations focusing on lack of economic
   development, the article deploys the framework of ontological insecurity
   to show how Danish elites through techniques of gaslighting challenge
   the post-colonial status of Greenland and prevent agency. The
   Greenlandic colonial experience is rejected and delegitimised, in turn
   providing the foundation for blaming Greenlanders for failing to live up
   to the criteria of statehood. The article thus breaks with widespread
   assumptions of voluntarism in the literature on non-sovereignty, as well
   as introducing mechanisms of contestation to the literature on
   ontological security. The theoretical contribution of the article is the
   conceptual marriage of the hierarchy and ontological security
   literatures through the concept of post-colonial gaslighting.},

Abstract = {Actors rarely approach institutional design choices with a blank slate
   but are influenced by design choices made at earlier stages. How does
   institutional design evolve over time and are there specific paths to
   deepening cooperation? We investigate the institutional design paths of
   subnational cooperation that are chosen to address increasingly complex
   and interconnected policy problems. We theorize that besides the
   substantive problem, earlier choices matter to explain what
   institutional design mechanism is chosen; that is, the design of
   existing institutions between two subnational governance units, called
   substates, influences the design of subsequent institutions. Using a
   semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards model, we show that the design
   paths of subnational cooperation in the Swiss water governance sector
   correlate with earlier design choices. Our results indicate that not all
   cooperation is self-reinforcing and path-dependent, but they show which
   specific design choices are more likely to follow each other in repeated
   formal federal intergovernmental cooperation.},

Abstract = {The notion that scholars should reduce consumption of workrelated flight
   travel as a form of climate action has become common in academia.
   Proponents of this idea have coalesced into a sectoral movement seeking
   to have a more significant impact. This article critically reflects on
   the case of the Academic Flying Less Movement (AFLM) to conceptually
   explore how the environmental concerns of individual scholars might
   cohere and coalesce into something more powerful. We draw lessons from
   the AFLM's existing efforts to change common academic practice through
   norm diffusion, while also interpreting lessons for the AFLM by
   developing a spiral model of strategic multi-scalar climate action,
   wherein the limitations of various modes of action compel scalar shifts
   towards different forms of action. Our analysis contributes to ongoing
   efforts in the field to develop more nuanced understandings of the value
   and limitations of small-scale, demandside actions within the broader
   constellation of climate action.},

Title = {Holiday planning in Indian families: a dual path model linking family
   type and conflict resolution},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {668-691},
Month = {JUL 18},
Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to investigate the effect of parent-adolescent
   conflict in step versus biological families on family communication
   patterns (FCPs) and the conflict resolution strategy adopted by
   adolescents during family destinations or holiday planning (where to
   visit?). Design/methodology/approachThe literature on family conflict
   (i.e. parent-adolescent conflict) and the different types of families
   (step vs nuclear) supported the proposed framework. The survey was
   conducted in the Indian subcontinent with a sample size of 437
   adolescents. SPSS 22.0 was used for factor analysis (exploratory and
   confirmatory factor analysis) and structural equation modelling was used
   through AMOS 26.0 for data analysis. FindingsSignificant relationship
   was observed between the types of families (step and biological), FCP
   and the resolution strategy chosen by Indian adolescents. Adopting a
   resolution strategy by adolescents in both families depends on the type
   of FCP in the family. Adolescents in stepfamilies have socio-oriented
   FCP and use ``positive problem-solving{''} and ``conflict withdrawal{''}
   as a resolution strategy. In contrast, adolescents in biological
   families have concept-oriented families and use ``conflict
   enhancement{''} as a resolution strategy. It has also been found that
   adolescents who fall into high-stress categories used conflict
   enhancement strategies. In contrast, those who fall under low-stress
   categories used positive problem-solving and withdrawal strategies.
   Practical implicationsThis study will add a new chapter to adolescents'
   decision-making literature in line with the previous research. It has
   practical implications for tourism marketers, academicians/researchers
   and policymakers. Marketers can segment adolescents into step versus
   biological families, and the choice of resolution strategies may
   introduce efficient and competent marketing strategies and promotional
   campaigns. Originality/valueThis study favours that family type is a
   robust construct to predict adolescents' choice of resolution strategy.
   So, it is one of the most influential variables in adolescents'
   resolution strategy adoption.},

Abstract = {The paper explores the long-term trajectory and the recent acceleration
   of the conflict over the rule of law in the EU. It focusses on the
   motivation of the two governments in Hungary and Poland to challenge
   European core values increasingly aggressively even directly at EU level
   despite the threat of significant material costs to both countries.
   Putting forward a Gramscian understanding, we argue that this
   radicalization is the result of a counter-hegemonic strategy that aims
   at replacing the liberal order with a new, nationalist,
   ultraconservative, Christian order on domestic and European levels. The
   paper traces core elements of this strategy which are either disputed or
   underestimated in existing literature, most importantly the pursuit of a
   core ideology and the massive and long-term investment into winning
   moral and cultural leadership through the penetration of civil society
   which precedes and complements electoral strategies and autocratic
   institution building.},

Abstract = {Environmental justice (EJ) issues commonly include contestation over
   knowledge claims. EJ scholarship tends to theorize these as issues of
   participation or recognition. Drawing on a long-term ethnography of
   community-led air monitoring, I show that frontline communities
   experience distinctly epistemic injustices, even in situations
   characterized by participation and recognition. These epistemic
   injustices, which include exclusion from judgment, inadequate epistemic
   resources, and denial of status as knowers, point to the need to expand
   definitions of EJ to include an account of epistemic justice. Departing
   from virtue-based accounts, I propose `careful knowing,' or practices of
   empirical investigation and meaning-making responsive to the needs of
   marginalized knowers, as a remedy for epistemic injustices that occur in
   EJ settings. Context-specific by definition, careful knowing may include
   grounding epistemic judgments in the need for community health
   protection, expanding epistemic resources, and bolstering the confidence
   and status of marginalized knowers.},

Abstract = {Reputational theory holds that an agency's reputation is a valuable
   political asset. However, since Daniel Carpenter's influential
   contributions, reputational studies have focused on reactions to
   reputational threats, rather than on reputation as such. Therefore,
   there is a curious lacuna at the heart of reputation studies: A lot is
   known about reactions to reputational threats, but fundamental questions
   about reputation per se are left unexplored. This paper investigates the
   dimensionality of the reputational concept, its variation across types
   of audiences, and its consistency across agency subunits. This is done
   in the context of the EU Commission, the core executive institution of
   the European Union. While this case is interesting in itself, its main
   value is to suggest what a research agenda focusing on the core building
   blocks of reputational theory might look like. Our survey of actors in
   the EU's Transparency Register provides mixed, but mostly supportive
   evidence.},

Abstract = {If alleged corruption helps populists get elected, as extant research
   suggests, do they later address the problem effectively? This study
   seeks systematic cross-national evidence for the link between populist
   parties in government and malfeasance by analysing evidence from Eastern
   Europe. The central argument is that once in power, populist parties
   fail to eliminate corruption because (i) they also resort to
   clientelistic practices to secure re-election, and (ii) they weaken the
   mechanisms of accountability. The results from regression analysis of
   panel data and qualitative case studies confirm that ruling populist
   parties have not been successful in fighting corruption mostly because
   of their deliberate encroaching on state institutions.},

Abstract = {Targeted attacks on journalists are internationally condemned crimes,
   which not only undermine freedom of expression, but also symbolize an
   utter disregard for basic human rights. Yet, murders of journalists
   occur in all types of regimes, whether autocratic or democratic. This
   article explores the conditions that enable journalists to be subject to
   deadly attacks by state officials and unknown perpetrators. The typology
   of monitoring coercive agents is useful for the distinction between
   private and public information. External monitors, which share the
   information they gather with the public and hold the coercive agents
   accountable, are crucial for a safe working environment for journalists.
   The results of the multivariate regressions demonstrate that three main
   indicators of external monitoring, (1) robust-ness of civil society, (2)
   independence of media, and (3) strength of the judiciary are all
   associated with the occurrence of murders of journalists in a country.
   While a robust civil society and a strong judiciary decreases the
   probability of journalists being murdered by state officials and unknown
   perpetrators, a more critical and independent media structure appears to
   be associated with a higher probability of murders of journalists. The
   risks of such murders are especially higher for scenarios where the
   critical media outlets are abundant, but civil society and the judiciary
   are particularly weak and ineffective.},

Abstract = {An analysis of more than 2,000 speeches and social media posts on
   foreign policy issues from four members of Jair Bolsonaro's government
   from January 2019 to December 2020 suggests that a conspiracy theory
   called ``globalism,{''} which explains current events using a series of
   intrigues and stratagems carried out by fictitious enemies to undermine
   the national order, has not only taken root in Brazil's foreign policy
   narrative but consistently been used over time by the cabinet members
   responsible for that policy. It also indicates that the use of
   ``globalism{''} is not just a political strategy to persuade voters but
   a worldview embedded in Bolsonaro's far-right cabinet. Uma analise de
   mais de 2.000 discursos e posts provenientes de redes sociais sobre
   questoes da politica externa do Brasil por quatro membros do gabinete do
   governo de Jair Bolsonaro de janeiro de 2019 a dezembro de 2020 indica
   que a teoria de conspiracao denominada ``globalismo,{''} que explica
   atualidades em termos de uma serie de intrigas e estrategias
   implementadas por inimigos ficticios para minar a ordem nacional, nao se
   arreigou apenas na narrativa exibida na politica exterior brasileira mas
   tambem se utilizou ha anos pelos mesmos membros do gabinete que sao
   responsaveis por sua elaboracao. Isso significa que o uso do
   ``globalismo{''} nao e so uma estrategia politica para convencer
   eleitores mas e tambem uma visao do mundo que e enraizada no gabinete de
   Bolsonaro cuja origem reside na extreme direita.},

Abstract = {The study of global politics is frequently organized around fields, but
   the boundaries of these fields are little understood. We explore the
   relationship between two proximate fields, human rights (HR) and
   democracy promotion (DP), in order to understand the emergence and
   maintenance of field boundaries. The two fields are closely linked in
   international law and practice, yet they have remained largely separate
   as fields of action, despite vast changes in global politics over four
   decades. The disjuncture has been largely maintained by HR organizations
   who police the boundary to keep DP out. We identify differences in
   anchoring norms as the key factor driving boundary maintenance. Actors
   in the two fields hold different foundational ideas about how to protect
   and advance rights, norms that we describe as cosmopolitan and statist.
   This account is superior to alternate explanations that emphasize
   functional demands or resource flows, and complements historical
   institutionalist accounts. Our research offers a theoretical
   contribution to the study of fields and practical insight into two
   important areas of global practice. Our qualitative research is
   supplemented by digital annotations, supported by the Qualitative Data
   Repository.},

Abstract = {The Universal Credit reforms of the 2010s were a crucial turning point
   in the UK's social security system. The reforms have been widely
   criticized in the literature for placing too much responsibility on
   welfare recipients, for using cultural explanations of poverty, and for
   prioritizing incentive-based solutions. This article argues that these
   common points of criticism actually point to demonstrable contradictions
   in the formation of Universal Credit, contradictions that are
   problematic regardless of the strength of the aforementioned criticisms.
   The focus is on ``ontological contradictions{''}, which derive from
   fundamental assumptions about how individual agents relate to their
   material and ideational contexts. To make this argument, a critical
   realist framework is developed in a dialogue with existing
   poststructuralist approaches.},

Abstract = {Attitudes to climate-friendly policies often align with individual
   political leaning and associated media consumption patterns, but the
   mechanisms explaining this relationship are not well understood. This
   study presents an in-depth qualitative analysis of portrayals of
   political actors from 229 articles published in six German and US news
   outlets during May-July 2019. The results show that the outlets consumed
   by left- and right-leaning audiences emphasise oppositional identity
   portrayals, portraying features that are likely to trigger a negative
   response towards political identities typically opposed by their
   recipients. The outlets with a more balanced or centrist audience offer
   a wider array of identity portrayals and emphasise policy questions over
   fundamental beliefs. Observed patterns differ considerably between
   Germany and the US, reflecting political and media system differences.
   The results offer insight into how media reporting can contribute to
   political polarisation and consensus-building regarding climate change.},

Abstract = {How does war affect states' tolerance toward foreign culture? It is well
   documented by historians that democratic countries, despite their
   heralded values of liberty and diversity, acquiesce and even promote the
   practice of cultural intolerance in wartime. The available evidence,
   however, remains either anecdotal or limited to a specific context, and
   the extent to which war-induced cultural intolerance persists has so far
   rarely been examined. In order to investigate the short- and long-term
   effects of war on the degree of foreign cultural acceptance, this
   article focuses on patterns of classical music performances before,
   during, and after the two World Wars, based on a novel dataset assembled
   from concert program notes of ten renowned symphony orchestras from five
   countries (Austria, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United
   States) between 1900 and 1960, covering 29,135 concerts and 125,530
   pieces. Quantitative analysis suggests that the rate of performing
   pieces originating from belligerent countries in wartime declines
   markedly for music written in relatively modern times and that the
   defeat in wars led to a swift recovery of the exclusionary tendency
   against former enemy music. These findings demonstrate that states'
   security concerns and relative power, rather than political regime
   types, dictate international transaction patterns, including cultural
   flows across sovereign state borders.},

Abstract = {The first decade of the 21st century had annual United Nations (UN)
   resolutions on the defamation of religion, followed by a shorter period
   with resolutions on promoting human rights and fundamental freedom
   through a better understanding of traditional values of humankind.
   However, in 2011, the strongest promoter of the defamation of religion
   resolutions, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), chose to
   shift the focus in the UN on individual victims, not the religions as
   such, resulting in the Istanbul Process. Moreover, the exploration of
   links between Articles 18, 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on
   Civil and Political Rights resulted in the Rabat Plan of Action. Other
   progress within freedom of religion or belief include the Faith4Rights
   resources, acknowledging the right to change one's religion and stopping
   violations in the name of ``honour,{''} as well as other approaches,
   that so far have inadequate impact on the domestic level.},

Abstract = {The traditional relationship between the Brazilian state and indigenous
   peoples is based on the state's ``protection.{''} Under the
   ultraconservative Bolsonaro government, the state has been taken over by
   elites with rural and extractive capital who plan on exploiting the
   Amazon rain forest at any cost and see indigenous peoples as an obstacle
   to their goal. The military also has a noteworthy position in this
   offensive, which strikes at the heart of what are considered human
   rights. The legislative and judiciary branches continue to confront this
   ambiguous policy, which is accompanied by laws, statutes, national
   agreements, and international conventions that lack clarity and
   precision. If Bolsonaro were to be reelected it might mean the
   extinction of surviving indigenous ethnicities. A relacao tradicional
   entre o Estado brasileiro e os povos originarios e baseada na
   ``tutela{''} do Estado. O governo ultraconservador de Bolsonaro reflete
   a captura do Estado pelas elites do capital agrario e extrativista que
   pretendem dispor da floresta amazonica a qualquer custo, considerando os
   povos originarios como obstaculo a sua agenda. Os militares tem posicao
   de destaque nesta ofensiva que afronta as nocoes elementares de direitos
   humanos. Ora, os poderes Legislativo e Judiciario lidam com essa
   politica de maneira ambigua, acompanhando leis, estatutos e convencoes
   nacionais e internacionais de forma pouco precisa e pouco clara. Se
   Bolsonaro for reeleito, isso podera acelerar a extincao das etnias
   indigenas sobreviventes.},

Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Despite the significant body of literature on migrations after the 2004
   and 2007 enlargements of the European Union, including on social
   remittances, a subcategory-political remittances-is only now starting to
   receive attention. This article, based on thirty-four interviews with
   Poles active in the transnational space between Poland and Ireland,
   supplemented by a survey of Poles in Ireland (n = 503) and a press
   query, aims to investigate (broadly defined) political remittances. It
   explores the conditions in the country of origin and destination which
   facilitate or hinder political remittances, the areas of political
   remittances Polish migrants to or from Ireland transfer, and how these
   are transmitted. The remittances are found to concern three main areas:
   (1) the perception of minorities (ethnic, national, sexual); (2) the
   transparency of government and closeness of representatives to citizens;
   and (3) the cooperation between the authorities and other actors to
   achieve local economic development. The article argues that political
   remitting in the Polish-Irish transnational space can be treated as an
   example of much broader phenomena taking place between countries of the
   European Union, especially those linked by large migration waves. It
   demonstrates that, contrary to what much of the literature suggests,
   political remitting does not only take place between countries at very
   different stages of economic and political development.},

Abstract = {Understanding how preferences for public policy instruments shape policy
   support helps policymakers to design policies that begin to tackle
   large-scale and complex problems, such as climate change. Climate change
   policies generate both local and global costs and benefits, which affect
   the public's policy preferences. In this article we investigate the role
   of perceived conditional cooperation and distributive concerns on
   climate policy attitude formation. We identify a range of climate
   policies and test public opinion for adoption of these policies at
   different scales of government. The important theoretical distinction is
   the scale-driven distributional nature of policy costs and benefits as
   well as concerns regarding the cooperation of other actors. We use data
   from Sweden and a conjoint experimental design where we vary level of
   government, type of policy, and the targeted group. We find evidence
   that people support policies when costs are shared broadly. We also find
   that support for climate policy is conditional on expected policy
   adoption by other units of government at various scales. This implies
   that unpopular climate policies might be more popular if the funding
   structure of the policy allows for binding policy and that the
   cost-sharing is taking place at higher levels of government.},

Abstract = {As the energy crisis triggered by the Russian war against Ukraine
   vividly demonstrates, the EU suffers from inconvenient external
   dependencies. The trade dependence on China, the European Union's main
   source of imports, could be an acute source of strategic vulnerability
   for the EU economy. Given the evident risks in maintaining close
   economic relations with authoritarian regimes, a policy change is needed
   to address the EU's trade dependence, aimed not only at shifting
   economic incentives for businesses but also at reconciling
   sustainability goals with geopolitical priorities.},

Abstract = {European Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs are
   so-called ``frontliners{''} in European Union transitions and strategies
   while also implementing the EU Resilience and Recovery Plan, which
   requires an increase of business effectiveness. Business-negotiation
   management brings confidence in the achieving of business goals. The
   negotiation phase model ensures accuracy in monitoring progress and also
   in the evaluation of possible outcomes. The aim of this article is to
   map the cumulative scientific knowledge and evolutionary nuances of
   well-established fields in business negotiation management from a
   corporate perspective, uncover emerging trends in journal articles and
   research constituents as well as to explore the intellectual structure
   of a specific domain in the extant literature of the ex-post phase in
   the negotiation phase model and its linkages to business objectives of
   both business entities and SMEs. Based on an inductive and deductive
   approach, the author presents a description of linkages of the business
   negotiation process phase model and business objectives. Such a
   description is useful for practitioners in identifying the literature
   relevant to their business activities based on negotiations, and
   worthwhile for academics to navigate further research.},

Abstract = {According to EU law, proper water management is to ensure enduring and
   sustainable development taking into account the economic use of water
   resources and the availability of water in adequate quality and
   quantity. Within the framework of proper water management in the EU
   Member States, the use of local water resources for economic purposes
   involves state intervention in the form of granting of a permit
   (water-law permit or licence) for the exploitation of water intakes
   located in a given geographical area. However, obtaining such a permit
   does not entitle the undertaking to market the extracted waters as
   natural mineral waters or spring waters. To be able to use groundwater
   in bottling industry, national authorities must assess and classify the
   water. Of crucial importance are full water tests, which include the
   analysis of organoleptic, chemical and physico-chemical properties and
   microbiological examination of the water. As for natural mineral waters,
   the undertaking must also apply for official recognition of the water.
   The recognition procedure does not apply to spring waters.},

Title = {Cautious State Feminist? National Traditions and Global Developments
   During Soreide's Term as Minister of Foreign Affairs},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-37},
Abstract = {The appointment of Ine Eriksen Soreide in 2017 was a historic first:
   Norway's first female foreign minister. In terms of nation branding this
   was a significant change for Norway; it demonstrated gender equality in
   foreign affairs as a form of practice and not just as good intentions.
   Traditionally, the Norwegian peace engagement has overridden other
   priorities for Norwegian foreign policy. This could also be seen in the
   campaign to win the election for a non-permanent seat in the UN Security
   Council in 2018, which was led by Soreide as foreign minister. In fact,
   the conservative politician did little to deviate from establis-hed
   priorities in foreign policy and appeared as a cautious state feminist.
   By extension, Norway is a country which prioritizes gender equality when
   it ser-ves the country's reputation and international importance,
   otherwise Norway is first and foremost a peace nation.},

Title = {Trading Sovereignty for Self-Determination},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {Weak or dependent states, especially those with histories of colonial
   and imperial domination, have traditionally been among the strongest
   advocates for strict institutionalization and observance of the norm of
   non-interference. These states are vulnerable to international pressure,
   and they have sought to limit this pressure by ``jealously{''} guarding
   their sovereignty. Yet, after decades of advocating for strict
   non-interference, many have begun to delegate extensive interventionist
   authority to their regional organizations. What explains this change? I
   explore this question in the case of the decision by Latin American
   leaders to compromise on non-interference by delegating authority to
   enforce human rights to the Organization of American States. I argue
   that they were motivated by attempts to maintain self-determination and
   resist the imposition of authority. In making this argument, I extend
   the definition of self-determination to incorporate self-determination
   over international rules. I show that existing explanations for this
   development that emphasize norm diffusion or democratization cannot
   account for important dynamics. These findings offer evidence that the
   expansion of regionalism in the Global South has been, in part, a subtle
   strategy to mitigate the undesirable effects of hierarchy and to create
   an international system based on respect for self-determination.
   Los Estados debiles o dependientes, especialmente aquellos que han
   sufrido una historia de dominacion colonial e imperial, han estado
   tradicionalmente entre los defensores mas fuertes de la norma de no
   interferencia. Estos Estados son mas vulnerables a la presion
   internacional, y han tratado de limitar esta presion protegiendo <<
   celosamente >> su soberania. Sin embargo, despues de decadas de estar
   abogando por una estricta no interferencia, muchos de estos Estados
   comenzaron a hacer concesiones con respecto a la norma de no
   interferencia, al delegar una amplia autoridad intervencionista a sus
   organizaciones regionales. Que es lo que explica este cambio? Exploramos
   esta cuestion usando el caso de la decision de por parte de los lideres
   latinoamericanos de delegar en la Organizacion de los Estados Americanos
   la autoridad para hacer cumplir los derechos humanos. Argumentamos que,
   haciendo esto, estaban tratando de mantener su autodeterminacion y
   resistir la imposicion de la autoridad. Mediante este argumento,
   ampliamos la definicion de autodeterminacion incorporando la libre
   determinacion sobre las normas internacionales. Las conclusiones de este
   articulo ofrecen evidencia de que la expansion del regionalismo en el
   Sur Global ha sido, en parte, una estrategia sutil para mitigar los
   efectos indeseables de la jerarquia y crear un sistema internacional
   basado en el respeto a la autodeterminacion.
   Les etats faibles ou dependants, notamment ceux aux histoires de
   domination coloniale et imperiale, se positionnent traditionnellement en
   fervents defenseurs de la norme de non-interference. Ces etats sont
   vulnerables a la pression internationale, et ils cherchent a limiter
   cette pression en gardant << jalousement >> leur souverainete. Pourtant,
   apres des decennies de defense d'une non-interference stricte, nombre
   d'entre eux ont commence a faire des compromis quant a cette norme, en
   deleguant une autorite interventionniste importante a leurs
   organisations regionales. Comment expliquer cette evolution ? J'analyse
   cette question en m'interessant au cas de la decision des dirigeants
   d'Amerique latine de deleguer leur autorite d'application des droits de
   l'Homme a l'Organisation des etats americains. Ce faisant, j'affirme
   qu'ils tentaient de conserver une certaine autodetermination tout en
   resistant a l'imposition d'autorite. Par cet argument, j'elargis la
   definition d'autodetermination pour incorporer l'autodetermination en
   matiere de regles internationales. Les conclusions de cet article
   presentent des preuves que l'expansion du regionalisme dans l'hemisphere
   sud a ete en partie une subtile strategie visant a attenuer les effets
   indesirables de la hierarchie et a creer un systeme international base
   sur le respect de l'autodetermination.},

   widen inequality},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {Policy responses to the challenges associated with environmental change,
   including more frequent and severe climatic events, have interlinked
   environmental and social impacts. Less attention has been afforded to
   the latter, and specifically to the question of not just whether but how
   such responses create or entrench inequality. This paper examines policy
   responses to drought events in California, United States, and the
   Western Cape Province, South Africa, in terms of their effects on
   inequality, revealed in relationships to water access networks. We use
   concepts of water justice and hydraulic citizenship to evaluate how and
   why these policy responses reproduced water injustices in the two
   settings. We focus particularly on two mechanisms linking responses to
   widened inequalities: values-reinforcement and strategic communication.
   Using interviews, policy documents, and media reports, we employ process
   tracing methods to illustrate these mechanisms through which drought
   policy impacts hydraulic citizenship experiences, manifesting water
   injustice. We contribute to emerging examinations of environmental
   policy responses and maladaptation by demonstrating how concepts of
   hydraulic citizenship and an emphasis on mechanisms can help us better
   understand and identify experiences of water injustice. We note policy
   implications and areas for future research, highlighting droughts as
   consequential policy sites for advancing social and environmental
   justice.},

Title = {Speaking Volumes: Introducing the UNGA Speech Corpus},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {Many theoretical conclusions core to the study of international politics
   rely on having access to, and understanding, the rhetoric of
   international actors. One important development in advancing the
   empirical study of international relations (IR) theory, therefore, is
   the availability of machine-analyzable speech data. A collection of
   fine-grained textual representations of states' speeches in the context
   of an important international organization, such as the United Nations
   General Assembly (UNGA), is needed to understand the ideas, preferences,
   and values that states put forth in their statements. An especially
   promising use for such a corpus of texts would be to measure states'
   preferences based on their statements. In an effort to add to the
   burgeoning field of text-as-data in IR, I present the UNGA Speech
   Corpus, a collection of over 34,000 speeches delivered by states in the
   UNGA from 1993 to 2018. I use it to improve on recent work that links
   text to preferences in IR by combining a structural topic model with
   locally trained word embeddings to estimate the policy positions of
   states on specific topics. I then show how these ``topic scores{''} can
   help scholars to improve their analyses of exigent international issues,
   such as global climate change governance.
   Muchas de las conclusiones teoricas centrales en el estudio de politica
   internacional radican en tener acceso a la retorica de los actores
   internacionales y comprenderla. Por lo tanto, un avance importante en el
   estudio empirico de la teoria de las RRII es la disponibilidad de datos
   discursivos analizables por maquinas. Hace falta un conjunto de
   representaciones textuales refinadas de los discursos estatales en el
   contexto de una organizacion internacional importante, como la Asamblea
   General de las Naciones Unidas (AGNU), para comprender las ideas, las
   preferencias y los valores que los estados presentan en sus
   declaraciones. Un uso especialmente prometedor de dicho corpus de textos
   podria ser el de medir las preferencias de los Estados en funcion de sus
   declaraciones. En un esfuerzo por aportar al prolifero campo de textos
   como datos en las RRII, presento el Corpus de Discursos de la AGNU, un
   conjunto de mas de 34 000 discursos pronunciados por los Estados en la
   AGNU desde 1993 hasta 2018. Lo utilizo para mejorar trabajos recientes
   que vinculan textos con preferencias en las RRII mediante la combinacion
   de un modelo estructural tematico con la incorporacion de palabras
   entrenadas localmente para valorar las posiciones politicas de los
   Estados en determinados temas. Luego, muestro como estos << puntajes
   tematicos >> pueden ayudar a los academicos a mejorar sus analisis de
   cuestiones internacionales delicadas, como la gobernanza del cambio
   climatico global.
   De nombreuses conclusions theoriques au c oe ur de l'etude de la
   politique internationale reposent sur l'acces a la rhetorique des
   acteurs internationaux et sur sa comprehension. La disponibilite de
   donnees sur les discours analysables par machine constitue donc une
   evolution importante dans le progres de l'etude empirique de la theorie
   des RI. Une collection de representations textuelles detaillees des
   discours des etats dans le contexte d'une organisation internationale
   importante, telle que l'Assemblee generale des Nations unies (AGNU), est
   necessaire pour comprendre les idees, les preferences et les valeurs que
   les etats mettent en avant dans leurs declarations. Une utilisation
   particulierement prometteuse d'un tel corpus de textes serait de mesurer
   les preferences des etats d'apres leurs etats. Dans un effort d'enrichir
   le domaine du texte en tant que donnees en plein essor en RI, je
   presente le Corpus des discours a l'AGNU (UNGA Speech Corpus), une
   collection de plus de 34 000 discours prononces par des etats a l'AGNU
   entre 1993 et 2018. Je l'utilise pour apporter une amelioration aux
   travaux recents qui associent texte et preferences en RI en combinant un
   modele thematique structurel avec des integrations de mots entrainees
   localement pour estimer les positions politiques des etats sur des
   themes specifiques. Je montre ensuite comment ces << scores thematiques
   >> peuvent aider les chercheurs a ameliorer leurs analyses des questions
   internationales urgentes, telles que la gouvernance du changement
   climatique mondial.},

Abstract = {Does leader age matter for the likelihood of interstate conflict? Many
   studies in biology, psychology, and physiology have found that
   aggression tends to decline with age throughout the adult lifespan,
   particularly in males. Moreover, a number of major international
   conflicts have been attributed to young leaders, including the conquests
   of Alexander the Great and the ambitious military campaigns of Napoleon.
   However, the exact nature of the relationship between leader age and
   international conflict has been difficult to study because of the
   endogeneity problem. Leaders do not come to power randomly. Rather, many
   domestic and international factors influence who becomes the leader of a
   country, and some of these factors could correlate with the chances of
   interstate conflict. For instance, wary democratic publics might favor
   older leaders when future international conflict seems likely, inducing
   a relationship between older leaders and interstate conflict. This
   article overcomes such confounding by using a regression discontinuity
   design. Specifically, it looks at close elections of national leaders
   who had large differences in age. It finds that when older candidates
   barely defeated younger ones, countries were much less likely to engage
   in military conflict. Its sample is also fairly representative of
   democracies more broadly, meaning that the findings likely hold true for
   cases outside the sample. The results demonstrate the important role
   that individuals play in shaping world politics. They also illustrate
   the value of design-based inference for learning about important
   questions in the study of international relations and peace science.},

Abstract = {This special section aims to shed light on moral milieus and agencies in
   contemporary capitalist Central and Eastern Europe. Drawing on case
   studies from Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Russia, it
   offers insight into changing perceptions of proper economy and practice
   amongst a broad range of actors-from landfill workers to business
   managers and the super-rich. The contributors explore how actors at
   various scales morally construct, contest, and defend ideas of justice,
   (re-)distribution, and social worth, as well as socio-economic
   hierarchy, inequality, and harm. They analyse the capitalist moral
   transformation and order in the region and examine the local
   appropriation of and buy-in to (as well as critique of) aspects of
   neoliberal moral orders-a topic sidelined in much of the existing moral
   economy scholarship. Exploring a broad range of moral economic
   phenomena, the contributors move beyond the conventional definition of
   morals as prosocial norms and action, approaching morals as a broader
   empirical phenomenon of economy and politics. They examine the actions,
   practices, and reasoning of different actors in relation to shifting
   notions of acceptable and unacceptable, just and unjust, and
   praiseworthy and blameworthy behaviour. As such, this collection makes
   the case for widening the empirical object and analytical purchase of
   moral economy to include the study of not only moral critiques and
   resistance to capitalism but also the diverse moral agencies, milieus
   and orders of capitalism, and the ways in which the advancement and
   embedding of the capitalist moral order has shaped economic life in the
   region.},

Abstract = {In this article, we aim to discuss how manifestations of American
   identities have been reproduced in Somalia by diverse US diplomacy
   actors in the 2000s. Following a knowledge/power nexus, we argue that
   Orientalist discourses establish alterity politics in global South
   countries by managing and controlling post-colonial bodies. We explore
   different expressions of the American self's reflection by comparisons
   to Somalia in discourses on terrorism and ethnicity. To do this, we
   understand American identity based on the notions of Americanity and
   Puritanism. This article contributes to debates on identity/difference
   among foreign policy, critical security, and terrorism studies by
   combining academic, journalistic, and political sources as expressions
   of US discourse.},

Abstract = {We define tribalism as a mode of articulation that draws an antagonistic
   frontier between societal groups. Unlike populism, tribalism does not
   have a hegemonic character. It articulates groups through a horizontally
   oriented shared value system; whereas populism is an essential part of a
   democratic system, tribalism disregards democracy. To conceptualize
   tribalism as a separate theoretical frame from populism or
   (ethno)nationalism, we used discourse theoretical analysis to analyze
   the Facebook pages of four political party leaders in Slovakia (Marian
   Kotleba, Krisztian Forro, Igor Matovic, and Boris Kollar). Kotleba's
   page showed tribalistic features by articulating an antagonistic divide
   between ``us,{''} the people, linked by shared values and identities,
   and anyone who does not share those values, or ``them.{''} His
   representation of his party's fight against oppressive forces combined
   with their apathetic stance toward democracy makes them a prime example
   of a tribalist party. While populism is an ever-expanding area of
   research and a framework widely used to analyze political entities and
   events, it is a word often thrown around and thus overused. Tribalism
   offers an alternative approach to analyze political instances in a
   national and transnational context in a more nuanced way and gain a
   better understanding of previously overlooked phenomena.},

Abstract = {Economic security is going to occupy an increasingly important role in
   global politics. While the EU should aim to avoid a fragmentation of the
   global economy and support multilateralism, it needs to prepare for
   protectionism, a global subsidy race and weaponisation of
   interdependencies. First, the EU must take geopolitical risks seriously
   and use stress tests and a data-driven approach to identify
   vulnerabilities. We propose creating a European Economic Security
   Committee to advance coordination between national security and European
   economic policymaking. Second, the EU must increase its resilience to
   better withstand economic coercion and be less affected by shocks.
   Resilience cannot be increased by protectionism but by keeping markets
   open and concluding trade agreements. Industrial policy has some role to
   play, but the EU should apply the `narrow yard' principle in industrial
   policy and enhance cooperation to reduce the risks and costs of a global
   subsidy race. Third, economic security will require investments in
   European public goods such as R\&D for defence, decarbonisation,
   technology and the reconstruction of Ukraine, which will be cheaper to
   procure at EU level. Strengthening the international role of the euro
   would add to Europe's economic security and financial power.},

Abstract = {Bureaucratic career incentives play a critical role in shaping how
   government officials influence local resources within their
   jurisdictions. This study suggests that the career incentives of
   subnational officials are instrumental in determining whether the
   government manages resources in a manner that either mitigates or
   exacerbates regional inequality in localities. Using a unique dataset of
   Chinese provincial officials from 1995 to 2019, this study measures an
   official's career prospects as a predicted probability of promotion. The
   empirical results demonstrate that Chinese provincial governments were
   likely to promote more investments and channel them into wealthier
   sub-regions when composed of a greater proportion of officials facing
   intense competition. On the other hand, a higher proportion of
   provincial officials who had reached the end of their careers prompted
   the government to prioritize poorer sub-regions. Interestingly,
   political rising-stars, whose career prospects are significantly higher
   than others, promoted less investment because they are risk-averse and
   prefer to maintain their current status.},

Abstract = {Both the Russian Federation and the United States and its allies have
   avoided taking actions carrying the greatest risk of escalation to
   nuclear-weapons use. Left uncertain is whether specific contingencies
   might yet prompt nuclear use. But the Russo-Ukrainian war has now been
   going on long enough to ground the debate in what has been said and done
   during its course. Russian nuclear decision-making requires the most
   attention, and Russian President Vladimir Putin's statements about it
   have been the most authoritative. He has defined Russia's nuclear red
   line consistently and relatively restrictively, reserving the threat of
   nuclear use for an existential threat to the state. He has focused on
   deterring the West from fighting alongside Ukraine, disregarding those
   who wanted to punish the West for the support it was providing. So long
   as NATO continues to respect Putin's red line, there is no reason to
   believe Putin would authorise nuclear use.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war has affected
   the valuation of five European Union currencies: the Polish Zloty,
   Hungarian Forint, Czech Koruna, Swedish Krone, and Romanian Leu. Using
   high-frequency time series data and advanced statistical models, we
   analyze a 522-week period from 1 January 2013, to 24 February 2023, with
   24 February 2022, as a key focal point. The Russia-Ukraine war had
   varying effects on the currencies of non-Eurozone countries. Poland,
   Hungary, and Sweden experienced significant impacts, while Czechia and
   Romania remained relatively stable. Our research also highlights the
   stability of the Euro as a reserve currency, which attracts investors
   during times of crisis and protects participating economies from
   currency fluctuations. Additionally, our analysis underscores the
   distinct impact of war on these currencies, influenced by their unique
   political, economic, and financial structures and strengths.},

Abstract = {International organisations have become increasingly contested resulting
   in worries about their decline and termination. While international
   organisation termination is indeed a regular event in international
   relations, this article shows that other institutions carry the legacy
   of terminated international organisations. We develop the novel concept
   of international organisation afterlife and suggest indicators to
   systematically assess it. Our analysis of 26 major terminated
   international organisations reveals legal-institutional and asset
   continuity in 21 cases. To further illustrate this point, the article
   zooms in on the afterlife of the International Institute of Agriculture
   in the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Refugee
   Organization in the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and
   the Western European Union in the European Union. In these three cases,
   international organisation afterlife inspired and structured the design
   of their successor institutions. While specific international
   organisations might be terminated, international cooperation therefore
   often lives on in other institutions.},

Abstract = {One cannot easily situate the Gulf Arab states homogenously within the
   literature on Arab nationalism in the scholarship of the International
   Relations of the Middle East (IRME). Despite the recent historiography
   of `other histories' of Arab nationalism in the Gulf, the extant
   research on the international relations of the Gulf has rarely
   theoretically interrogated how Arab nationalism derived from and evolved
   through the progression of rentier economy in the Gulf under British
   Colonialism as a peculiar historical process of late-capitalist social
   formation. To advance such a theoretical endeavour, this paper applies
   the concept of uneven and combined development (UCD) to the case of
   Bahrain under British colonialism. It argues that combined capitalist
   development in the Gulf under British colonialism fully activated Arab
   nationalism through the social mechanism of oil commodification. This
   historical process of combination created a vector for Bahrain's early
   capitalist development and generated changing class relations and
   internal contradictions associated with the origins of Bahrain's Arab
   nationalism. Most importantly, `combination' transformed an early
   diffused national consciousness in the era of al-Nahda into a
   nationalist ideology in modern times, of which its agenda presents
   Bahrain's peculiar experience among other non-peculiar cases in the
   Middle East.},

Abstract = {Policy piloting has become a popular form of organization in
   implementing public policies. However, the current literature
   surprisingly discusses little about its management. This study
   investigates how two policy-pilot attributes - ambiguity and
   compatibility - shape policy-pilot management. To accomplish this, we
   developed an analytic framework consisting of four management
   strategies: experimentation, refinement, upscaling, and
   institutionalization. We chose a representative policy pilot in Chinese
   health governance, the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme, to examine
   the adoption of these four strategies. Our finding that, at various
   junctures, the Chinese state adopted these four strategies to manage
   policy piloting demonstrates the applicability of the analytic framework
   constructed in this study. This study contributes to the existing public
   policy literature by providing new insights into policy implementation
   in temporary organizing settings.},

Abstract = {An individual's political attitudes have been documented as the most
   important predictor of acceptance of government measures against the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Their effect, however, is somewhat unclear and cannot
   be reduced to one dimension. In this article, we test whether general
   attitudes toward policy instruments might, together with left-right
   orientation, authoritarianism, social liberalism, and attitudes to state
   intervention, explain attitudes to policy instruments used to combat
   COVID-19. The predictiveness of models of attitudes toward three
   different types of policy instruments to address the COVID-19 pandemic
   was tested using a study of Czech university students). We found that
   individuals' general attitudes toward policy instruments are best
   measured by posing direct survey questions. Structural equation modeling
   was used to estimate the independent effects of general attitudes toward
   three different types of policy instruments on attitudes toward specific
   policy instruments for combating COVID-19. We found that an individuals'
   general tendency to prefer an information, regulatory, or economic
   instrument significantly affects their attitude toward specific policy
   solutions, even after controlling for political orientation. These
   results provide novel empirical evidence for the autonomy of policy
   instruments attitudes (APIA) theory. The general attitudes toward policy
   instrument types are reflected in individuals' attitudes toward specific
   policy instruments, such as those used to combat COVID-19.},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown how terrorist attacks attract media
   attention and influence public opinion and decision-makers. However, we
   lack a comparative assessment of the extent to which extremist
   ideologies matter and how they matter. Therefore, this paper compares
   mass media debates over extreme right and Islamist terrorist attacks.
   Theoretically, it innovates by linking research on discursive critical
   junctures and issue-specific discursive opportunity structures,
   emphasising the systematic differences between the two ideologies.
   Empirically, the study is based on an original, large-scale content
   analysis of mass media debates on all seven fatal attacks in Germany
   since 2015 (N = 9047). It combines relational quantitative content
   analysis with frame and network analyses. The results show how
   ideologies behind terrorist attack shape political reactions and the
   framing of the key security threat. Notably, both types of attacks
   provide favourable conditions for the far right, and political elites
   play a central role in the diffusion of far-right frames. In contrast,
   victims and ethnic or religious minorities have little voice in public
   debates. Overall, the study contributes to a better understanding of the
   impact of terrorist attacks on Western democracies by emphasising the
   impact of ideology and distorted threat perceptions in public debates.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between social policy reforms and issue
   salience in public opinion? Extensive research analyses policy feedbacks
   on policy preferences and the influence of policy preferences on policy
   change. Scant research, however, considers the link between reforms and
   issue salience - i.e., the perception of importance citizens attach to a
   topic. We address this gap in the literature through the comparative
   study of the salience of the `pension issue'. Drawing on a novel dataset
   covering 2010-2020 and 28 European countries, we argue that the passage
   of pension reforms shapes pension salience. Multilevel fixed effects
   models indicate that pension reforms that include either contracting or
   expansionary provisions are positively related to pension salience. In
   contrast, expansionary and contracting reforms, by themselves, are not
   robustly associated with pension salience.},

Title = {Food oppression in the United Kingdom: A study of structural race and
   income-based food access inequalities},

Abstract = {In 2007, Freeman pioneered the phrase ``food oppression{''} to capture
   the state's perpetuation of socioeconomic and racial disparities in
   nutrient consumption and diet-related diseases in the United States.
   Amid an increasing awareness of the impact of intersecting identities in
   all facets of life, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and
   the Black Lives Matter movement, this article argues that food
   oppression is an equally applicable, and necessary, characterization of
   the unequal enjoyment of the right to food in the United Kingdom.
   Patterns of food insecurity-chiefly, the overrepresentation of Black
   households among food bank users-are tied back to the austerity measures
   enacted by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition Government in
   response to the 2007/2008 financial crisis. These findings illuminate
   the race- and class-based barriers to access to adequate food in the
   United Kingdom that predate the pandemic as a manifestation of racial
   capitalism yet have increased in prominence. The article concludes that
   the adoption of a rights-based approach to household food security by
   the state is necessary to formulate policies that target the
   commodification of food and ensure a nutritious diet is available to all
   without discrimination.},

Abstract = {Governance is at the heart of how well governments meet public needs and
   manage a wide array of common problems. Why do some countries perform
   poorly in delivering healthcare, reducing inequality, providing a clean
   environment or delivering some other public good to their populations
   even while they have the resources to do so? Does the capacity of states
   to provide the basics for societies to thrive depend on forms of
   democratic accountability that represents different interests, or are
   systems under technocratic control that impose solutions and disregard,
   even suppress, many voices better at meeting public needs? Existing
   indices do not systematically examine the relationship between the
   components that contribute to governance performance. In our
   understanding of governance, depicted as the Governance Triangle, public
   goods provision is a function of state capacity and accountability.
   Rather than focusing on a single composite performance measure, the
   Berggruen Governance Index examines the interactions among these
   dimensions. We find that the key to good governance is achieving a
   balance among the three dimensions on an upward and sustainable
   trajectory. This article introduces the Index and the conceptual and
   methodological framework that underpins it and then outlines the content
   of this special issue.},

Abstract = {E-government technology (EGT) is the cornerstone of efficient government
   offices, which can streamline their work to enhance service quality for
   government employees. Thus, it is essential to examine the determinants
   of EGT implementation by government employees. Guided by the Unified
   Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 3 model, this research
   explores critical determinants that affect EGT adoption. Results from
   questionnaires completed by 207 Chinese government employees indicated
   that EGT adoption intention is positively affected by facilitating
   conditions (FC), habit (HB) and personal innovativeness (PI). Moreover,
   it partially mediates the relationship between HB and EGT adoption
   behavior, as well as PI and EGT adoption behavior. EGT adoption behavior
   is significantly affected by HB and PI. Surprisingly, research found
   other factors not significant for EGT adoption intention. This research
   contributes to the theory in the area of e-government and provides
   valuable insights for government agencies, with theoretical and
   practical significance.},

Title = {The paradox of civic education in Malawi's education system: regaining
   the missed opportunities},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {There is a common assumption that the removal of civics from the
   curriculum between 1995 and 2002, when Malawi became a democracy might
   have deformed citizenship and civic education (CE). This narrative
   assumes that civics, as a discipline, was critical for instilling
   democratic and civic values among Malawians. This then prompted the
   Tonse Alliance Government (TAG) to change the Ministry of Civic
   Education and Culture (MoCC) to the Ministry of Civic Education and
   National Unity (MoCENU) as the first step. Additionally, the then
   Minister of MoCENU proposed a policy change to reintroduce civics in
   schools arguing that, it is only through this subject that democratic
   citizenship can be realized. Accordingly, this paper sought to argue
   that mere changing of MoCC to MoCENU, and reintroducing civics in
   schools may add nothing toward the creation of democratic citizenship
   when we consider global trends. This paper therefore utilized
   qualitative research design especially Critical Hermeneutics to analyze
   available literature on citizenship and CE trends, its conceptions and
   common issues around the globe. In doing so, the paper sought to explain
   whether Malawi's CE projects have been on the right trajectory or not,
   and how power-relations and political interests have shaped its
   development. Mainly, we ascribed to the epigram that, straightening a
   tree is better done in its sapling. In other words, the best spaces for
   behavior change and habit formation remain the schools because they are
   naturally designed to prepare children for such roles and functions.
   While our arguments might not be final, we still understand that many
   researches have held a fragmented view of citizenship and CE. We thus
   sought to analyze these two concepts in the lenses of Critical Pedagogy
   as suggested by Paulo Freire and Henry Giroux who understood schools as
   political spaces where the hegemony captures the curriculum to oppress
   society while protecting their interests. By advocating for a democratic
   model of education anchored in humanization, problem-posing, and
   critical conscientization, Critical Pedagogy molds students into future
   citizens who values critical thinking, transparency and democratic
   values.},

   rights as (1) mockery of morality encompassing practice flying in the
   face of human rights' emancipatory promise, (2) manifesting morality
   encompassing practice embodying human rights' emancipatory promise, and
   (3) moral maze, the morally fractured space in between where human
   rights politics increasingly play out. Through the typology and its
   application, I argue that popular dispositions toward, and meanings
   accorded to human rights in marginalized contexts are varied, complex,
   and stem not just from popular evaluations of the human right
   framework's content (the values, moral claims, or rhetorical promise),
   but also from these populations' experiences of, judgements on, and
   emotional reactions to the morality of the practice of human rights
   unfolding around them. The research presented demonstrates that contrary
   to assumptions underlying both mainstream and critical scholarship, the
   content of human rights can be highly resonant to marginalized
   non-Western populations, yet they may choose to keep a distance from the
   framework because in its practice, is not persuasive to them.},

Title = {Opening the ``black box{''} of public administration: The need for
   interpretive research},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {102},
Number = {3},
Pages = {953-968},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Important research questions in public administration and management
   cannot be studied through the scientific method. A fundamental example
   is how public administrators utilize their discretion and judgment in
   their everyday work. Inquiring into the process of administrative
   practice has been characterized as ``opening the black box{''} of public
   administration and policy implementation-that is, how people in public
   administration and management situations do what they do. This paper
   argues that expanding the menu of worthwhile research approaches from
   quantitative empiricism, the current ``gold standard{''} in public
   administration, to include interpretivism makes it possible to view
   inside the black box of administrative process. After a brief narrative
   describing how the field lost the balance between quantitative and
   interpretive approaches it once had, the discussion lays out the
   philosophical grounding and methodology of interpretive research and
   offers phenomenology as illustration of how such an expansion will
   benefit both administrative theory and practice.
   El metodo cientifico de investigacion basado en la logica empirico
   cuantitativa no siempre permite comprender a fondo temas importantes de
   la administracion y gestion publicas. Un ejemplo fundamental es como los
   administradores publicos utilizan su discrecionalidad y juicio critico.
   Indagar sobre el proceso de la practica administrativa equivale a
   ``abrir la caja negra{''} de los procesos de gestion, o de que manera
   los agentes publicos llevan a cabo sus labores diarias y toman
   decisiones en situaciones especificas. Este articulo aboga por la
   utilizacion de la epistemologia interpretativa para poder develar la
   ``caja negra{''} de la gestion publica. Tras una breve descripcion
   acerca de como la disciplina perdio el equilibrio entre los enfoques
   cuantitativos e interpretativos que alguna vez tuvo, la discusion
   establece las bases filosoficas y metodologicas de la investigacion
   interpretativa. La fenomenologia se presenta para ilustrar como tal
   expansion epistemologica beneficiaria tanto a la teoria como a la
   practica administrativa.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of state and non-state actors, along with increasing
   institutional complexity, has led to a qualitative shift in Global
   Development Governance (GDG) towards what we term `GDG 2.0'. Realising
   accountability in this context presents challenges due to growing actor
   diversity, institutional plurality and a lack of formalised
   accountability structures. Building on the introduction to this special
   section, we explore the potential of `forward-looking' approaches to
   accountability, notably collective deliberation, learning and
   competition. Despite the importance of these mechanisms for GDG
   processes, conceptualising them as accountability tools may have limited
   gains and indeed reinforce the preferences of established actors, dilute
   useful monitoring approaches and divert attention from longstanding
   agendas. We argue that prioritising enabling environments for more
   circumscribed `backward-looking' accountability-with a focus on
   standard-setting and monitoring-may be more feasible and effective
   towards holding decision-makers to account within the GDG 2.0 context.},

Abstract = {What factors have driven the dramatic depletion of fishery resources in
   the South China Sea, and how have states responded? This article
   demonstrates that a complex mix of political, economic, and security
   drivers has led to the fishing crisis in the South China Sea in the
   fashion of a classic ``tragedy of the commons.{''} Although states have
   attempted to solve this problem by cooperating through bilateral,
   regional, and international arrangements, the article argues that states
   have also sought to exploit the situation as part of ``hybrid{''} or
   ``gray zone{''} strategies that blur the lines between private and
   public actors and between law enforcement and military activities. It
   identifies four mechanisms through which the conditions associated with
   the tragedy of the commons enable states to put fishers and fishing
   regulation on the frontlines of defending their territorial claims in
   the South China Sea.},

Title = {Interactive Leader Psychology and the Ebb and Flow of Interstate Rivalry},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {A great deal of scholarship links leaders' psychological traits to their
   monadic tendency to use force abroad, but virtually no work considers
   how the interaction of leadership psychology influences the systematic
   likelihood of dyadic interstate conflict. We develop and test several
   competing explanations of how the interactive conceptual complexity of
   leaders-a psychological trait that consistently predicts monadic
   conflict propensity-might affect the ebb and flow of conflict within
   rivalries. Our time-series analyses of the US-Soviet Cold War rivalry,
   utilizing the leadership trait analysis coding scheme, demonstrate that,
   in accordance with the monadic logic, increases in the interactive
   conceptual simplicity between US presidents and Soviet premiers predict
   a significantly higher incidence of militarized interstate dispute
   initiation and a greater volume of conflictual dyadic (COPDAB, conflict
   and peace data bank) behavior. At the same time, however, the least
   conflict-prone pairing is one in which a conceptually complex leader
   interacts with a conceptually simplistic counterpart. This suggests that
   the presence of even one complex leader can increase empathy and
   diminish the aggressive misperception and retaliatory ``downward
   spirals{''} that haunt rivalries.
   Existe un gran numero de trabajos academicos que establecen vinculos
   entre los rasgos psicologicos de los lideres y su tendencia monadica al
   uso de la fuerza en el extranjero, pero no existe, practicamente, ningun
   trabajo que considere como influye la interaccion de la psicologia del
   liderazgo sobre la probabilidad sistematica de un conflicto interestatal
   diadico. Desarrollamos y probamos varias explicaciones contrapuestas
   acerca de como la complejidad conceptual interactiva de los lideres, que
   es un rasgo psicologico que predice de manera consistente la propension
   al conflicto monadico, podria afectar los cambios frecuentes que se van
   produciendo con relacion al conflicto dentro de las rivalidades.
   Realizamos analisis de series temporales con relacion a la rivalidad
   entre Estados Unidos y la Union Sovietica dentro del marco de la guerra
   fria utilizando el esquema de codificacion del analisis de rasgos de
   liderazgo (LTA, por sus siglas en ingles). Estos analisis demuestran
   que, de acuerdo con la logica monadica, los aumentos en la simplicidad
   conceptual de la interaccion entre los presidentes de los Estados Unidos
   y los primeros ministros sovieticos predicen una incidencia
   significativamente mayor de inicio de conflictos interestatales
   militarizados (MID, por sus siglas en ingles) y un mayor volumen de
   comportamiento diadico conflictivo (datos obtenidos de COPDAB, Conflict
   and Peace Data Bank). Sin embargo, al mismo tiempo observamos que el
   emparejamiento menos propenso a conflictos es aquel en el que un lider
   conceptualmente complejo interactua con un homologo conceptualmente
   simplista. Esto sugiere que incluso la presencia un lider complejo puede
   aumentar la empatia y disminuir tanto la percepcion erronea agresiva
   como las \& DLANGBRAC;espirales descendentes \& drangbrac; de
   represalias que persiguen a las rivalidades.
   Nombre de travaux de recherche etablissent un lien entre les traits
   psychologiques des dirigeants et la tendance monadique d'utilisation de
   la force a l'etranger. Aucun, pratiquement, ne s'interesse a
   l'interaction entre les influences de la psychologie des dirigeants et
   la probabilite systemique de conflits dyadiques entre etats. Nous
   elaborons et testons plusieurs explications possibles de l'effet
   potentiel de la complexite conceptuelle interactive des dirigeants-un
   trait psychologique qui predit invariablement la propension au conflit
   monadique-sur le flux et reflux du conflit au sein des rivalites. Nos
   analyses des donnees chronologiques de la rivalite entre les etats-Unis
   et l'URSS lors de la guerre froide qui s'appuie sur le schema de codage
   Analyse des traits des dirigeants (ATD) demontrent que, conformement a
   la logique monadique, une augmentation de la simplicite conceptuelle
   interactive entre les presidents americains et les chefs du gouvernement
   sovietique se traduit par une montee importante de l'initiation de
   conflits interetatiques militarises (CIM) et un volume plus significatif
   de comportements dyadiques conflictuels (COPDAB). Dans le meme temps,
   neanmoins, un dirigeant complexe sur le plan conceptuel qui interagit
   avec son homologue simpliste sur le plan conceptuel constitue la
   combinaison la moins encline au conflit. Ainsi, la presence d'un seul
   dirigeant complexe augmenterait l'empathie et reduirait les perceptions
   erronees et les \& DLANGBRAC; spirales descendantes \& drangbrac; de
   represailles qui hantent les rivalites.},

Abstract = {Think tanks and their roles in rendering expertise in policy advice have
   been the subject of historical and ongoing research in policy sciences.
   However, the widening trend of digital behaviors of think tanks in the
   social media era is yet to be investigated. While social media is
   reshaping the political ecology and challenging conventional sources of
   knowledge, it also serves as a potential channel for think tanks to
   publicly share their expertise and policy advice with the public and
   decision-makers, thus evolving into ``digital advocators.{''} Based on
   social media big data methods, this paper has constructed two sets of
   new think tank indicators with ``network centrality{''} of social media
   accounts and ``ripple effect{''} of social media citations from Facebook
   and Twitter to capture and observe the digital activities of 207
   prominent think tanks in 62 countries or regions. We have concluded that
   think tanks have displayed their opinion and values and increased
   visibility as digital advocators by spreading expertise on social media
   platforms with online marketing skills. With various values and ideas,
   social media not only is hosting massive policy advocacy activities and
   being an expertise spreading arena for think tanks but has also been
   changing the ecology of the think tank industry and expertise markets.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of Iran
   and G7 countries in the management of the COVID-19
   crisis.Design/methodology/approachThe indicators and statistics provided
   by the Oxford Government Response Tracker are used in this research.
   Sixteen indicators and their related items have been analyzed for eight
   countries including Iran, Canada, Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy,
   Japan, and the United States. For data analysis, Multivariate analysis
   of variance (MANOVA) and Tukey's post hoc test were applied, and
   structural equation modeling performed with the help of SPSS and
   Smart-PLS software.FindingsThe results show that 8 indicators of closing
   schools, cancellation of public events, restriction of gatherings,
   restriction of domestic travel, restriction of international travel,
   reduction of household debt, testing policy, and contact tracing, have
   an effect on the number of deaths in the countries under review. The
   results also showed that the countries exhibit behaviors outside their
   normal culture during the crisis.Originality/valueThis paper will be
   helpful for scholars, as well as policymakers when making policies on
   the appropriate responses to COVID-19 and similar pandemics.},

Abstract = {PurposeMeasuring research's policy influence is challenging, given the
   complexity of the policy process, the gradual nature of policy
   influence, and the time lag between research investment and impact. This
   paper assesses measurement approaches and discusses their merits and
   applications to overcome various
   hurdles.Design/methodology/approachRelevant articles and studies were
   selected and analyzed. First, the research-policy interface was
   revisited to understand their link and how research influences policy
   making. Second, the most common approaches for measuring policy
   influence were reviewed based on their features, strengths, and
   limitations.FindingsThe three approaches reviewed - pyramid,
   influencing, and results chain - have their respective strengths. Thus,
   research organizations planning to design a program for monitoring and
   evaluation (M \& E) of policy influence have to adopt the best possible
   features of each approach and develop a customized method depending on
   their objectives and overall M \& E framework.Originality/valueThis
   paper fosters a deeper understanding of leveraging the three approaches.},

Abstract = {How is the term `strategic' used today within the US Department of
   Defense? To address this question, the article explores the evolution of
   the term `strategic' from the interwar period to the end of the Cold War
   era, when Strategic Air Command was responsible for anything deemed
   strategic. The contemporary use of the term is a manifestation of a
   growing need to integrate the activities of various commands,
   capabilities and operations across the Defense Department that can
   produce significant military or political effects. Several problems
   could emerge due to a lack of clarity, integration and synchronisation
   across the US defence establishment. The Pentagon should and could
   establish greater clarity in defining strategic threats, operations,
   systems, command relationships and deterrence.},

Abstract = {International partnership research has undergone profound changes during
   the Covid-19 pandemic, which has forced international research teams to
   make methodological and strategic choices to ensure the continuity of
   projects. As part of a research project on trans- formative and gendered
   social policies in post-Covid-19 Africa, a team of two researchers from
   Canada and France and three researchers from Mali, Mauritania and
   Senegal conducted a research in partnership during the Covid-19
   pandemic. The effective presence of researchers in the three West
   African countries targeted by the project allowed the achievement of
   research results despite the constraints related to mobility. In the
   end, the lessons learned from this North-South collaboration focus on
   interactions between team members, thus demonstrating the need to
   recognize and value the mutual skills of stakeholders in international
   development projects.},

Abstract = {This article uses the gender perspective to compare the 2020 Belarus
   protests and the Arab Spring and its aftermath in Egypt ( 2011-13). It
   argues that in both cases authoritarian militarized hegemonic
   masculinities, articulated through authoritarian body politics,
   attempted to suppress the protest movements. The latter, in turn, drew
   on a number of gendered images and symbols to perform its
   counter-hegemonic practices of resistance. The study employs discourse
   analysis and visual analysis methods and draws on a broad selection of
   data from Egyptian and Belarusian online newspapers and social media for
   the respective periods. The article concludes that, despite historical
   and cultural differences between the two countries, there are notable
   similarities in the ways gender is politicized and performed by both the
   regimes and the protest movements. These findings suggest a close
   connection between authoritarianism and militarized hegemonic
   masculinities, which can be established cross-regionally and
   cross-culturally.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic was a global shock. In the field of global health,
   particularly in the Sahel region of Africa, research teams quickly
   mobilized to participate in the collective effort to better understand
   the situation to strengthen responses to the pandemic. In a context of
   dependence on international aid, in that region, global health research
   is carried out through international partnerships often marked by power
   issues and strategies detrimental to responsible conduct. Using
   empirical examples from the Sahel, this article shows the permanence of
   these practices, which the pandemic has not changed. Although the
   pandemic was an opportunity for certain (more agile and resilient)
   research teams to create new scientific collaborations, the absence of a
   paradigm shift, despite the power of the shock, shows that there is
   still much to be done to decolonize global health.},

Abstract = {This article describes the impact of the national issue in the
   contemporary context of Basque social movements. Feminist,
   socio-ecology, pro-migrant and pro-language activists participated in
   this qualitative research. Our analysis indicates that a disposition
   towards collaboration can be observed within the social movements
   investigated. While this represents a shift as compared to decades past,
   different and sometimes conflicting national imaginaries are still
   present in activist discourses. These are reflected in debate around a
   number of issues, but especially the centrality of Basque identity in
   general and the Basque language in particular.},

Abstract = {This article offers a comparative-historical perspective on the moral
   economy of land. We reconstruct the moral economy of the popular land
   reform movement that opposed the illegitimate income streams of rentiers
   and speculators in the early 20th century, tracing the movement's legacy
   through a long-run analysis of political party platforms since 1880 in
   the USA, the UK, Germany and Sweden. We find that the land reformers'
   conceptualization of land as a moral good was a key topic in early
   20th-century party politics. Parties across the political spectrum
   called for wide-ranging interventions in unregulated land markets. But
   despite the movement's relative success, the new ideal of the ownership
   society soon gained ground as an alternative to the more radical
   politics of land decommodification. We find growing multipartisan
   support for small property owners over time, culminating in the rise of
   a new moral conceptualization of land as capital. With the recent
   comeback of the land question, both rural and urban, we conclude that an
   understanding of historical land reform debates should inform future
   research toward a much-needed sociology of land.},

Abstract = {This contribution focuses on Adam Watson's concept of `marcher states'
   used in The Evolution of International Society. With origins in the
   historical sociology literature on state formation, marcher states are
   distinguished by their innovative nature and have characteristically
   exerted a significant influence on another international system in
   history. I trace this concept across Watson's work and discuss it in
   relation to the themes of culture and upward mobility, economy and
   ethical values. I turn to the Ottomans at the intersection of
   culture-upward mobility, and to aid dependency and the rise of illiberal
   states to consider the other two themes. While reviewing Watson's
   discussion of marcher states, I also compare his ideas with the main
   concepts in world-systems theory. Overlaps between the English School
   and world-systems theory have so far not been examined thoroughly.
   Initiating this comparative research agenda is one of the main
   contributions of this article.},

Abstract = {The institutional design of the Czech Republic's flexible-list PR system
   with optional preference voting allows us to examine not only who casts
   preference votes, but also how voters allocate preference votes to
   candidates on the party ballot. Drawing on the resources, proximity and
   identity models, we first examine how these voter attributes impact the
   decision to cast preference votes or not. We then extend our analysis to
   theorise and test the heterogeneous impacts of these factors on voting
   only for the list puller, for candidates other than the list puller, or
   for both types of candidates.},

Abstract = {The concept of policy advisory systems (PAS) has been applied almost
   exclusively at national level. This article demonstrates that it can
   also be employed to analyse the development and dynamics of policy
   advice in a subnational government. Our empirical study of the
   externalisation of policy advice by the Welsh Government shows that it
   has been shaped by distinctive historical, institutional and political
   factors, and its impacts are different to those reported by studies of
   out-sourcing national policy advice. In our case study, external policy
   advice was seen as complementing rather than competing with the civil
   service. Instead of deinstitutionalising policy advice - that is,
   dislocating it from the usual sites where knowledge for policy is
   produced - new formal routes have been established for external sources
   of expertise to influence policy decisions. Contrary to the findings of
   some previous studies, externalising policy advice has not been a
   centralising force. Nor has it fundamentally challenged existing
   assumptions and values or increased politicisation of the policy
   process. These findings demonstrate that the PAS concept is useful
   across a range of settings, not just at national level. We show that
   applying it to a broader range of contexts, including subnational
   polities, can challenge, strengthen and expand existing theories of
   policy advice and policymaking.},

Title = {Global capitalism crisis fueling coups and instability in Africa},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {In this paper, I try to show that the recent surge of coups in Africa,
   like past surges, rather than resulting from cultural factors, is
   closely linked with the cyclic crisis of capitalism to which Africa is
   especially vulnerable, compounded by inadequate decolonization and by
   structural adjustment programs imposed by the leaders of economic
   globalization. Looking into the instances of coups in the African
   continent over the past 50 years and the history of global capitalism, I
   try to show that there is a pattern of coups matching capitalism crisis.
   I will look into the example of Guinea-Bissau to show this linkage
   between crisis and coups and the incidental and adaptive role of the
   military and political elites in the context of economic globalization.
   Political instability and violent takeover of political authority in
   Africa and beyond- are, therefore, a symptom of what has gone wrong with
   neoliberal globalization. Like Rodrik, I conclude that this has placed
   humanity before the trilemma: economic globalization, democracy and
   national sovereignty cannot be achieved simultaneously. To overcome it,
   there is a need for unfettered public debate on what form of global
   governance we want.},

Abstract = {The United Arab Emirates (UAE) joined the BRICS-led New Development Bank
   (NDB) as part of its first expansion in terms of membership. Questions
   regarding the interests and rationale of the UAE in joining the Bank, on
   the one hand, and the NDB's logic in granting membership to the UAE, on
   the other, immediately jump out. This article sheds light on the BRICS'
   cautious move away from exceptionality via the expanded NDB in the
   context of its membership criteria and approach. It does so by also
   highlighting the UAE's exceptionality, with a focus on the combination
   of fiscal resources and strategic geography, in the context of shifting
   global distributions of power. It finds that the UAE's membership in the
   NDB dovetails with its memberships in other MDBs, which, in turn, are
   part of the country's ambition to be seen as a globally influential
   actor. In turn, the NDB was attracted to the UAE fiscal acumen, credit
   rating and its carefully cultivated culture of cutting-edge,
   sustainable, infrastructure and connectivity projects, as well as
   innovation.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 26},
Abstract = {Since the 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union (EU), the United
   Kingdom (UK) government has been keen to persuade commentators and
   stakeholders that Brexit will not be bad for the UK's environment.
   Rather in line with the role of Britain as a great power, the government
   has suggested that when it comes to the environment the UK can be a
   global superpower, leading other nations in its pursuit of ambitious
   environmental policy goals. This new environmental foreign policy role
   orientation has been articulated through the concept of `Green Brexit'
   and showcased via the chairing of a major Climate Change Conference (the
   United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Conference of the
   Parties (COP) 26) in Glasgow in 2021. However, whilst there was a flurry
   of policy activity around COP26, overall `Green Brexit', has yet to be
   underpinned by coherent and credible domestic policy commitments
   necessary for effective international environmental leadership.},

   Missions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {International organizations (IOs) dispatch fact-finding missions to
   establish epistemic authority by objectively and impartially assessing
   contested facts. Despite this technocratic promise, they are often
   controversial and sometimes even fuel international disputes that
   challenge the epistemic authority of the dispatching organizations.
   Although the twenty-first century has witnessed a proliferation of
   United Nations (UN) commissions of inquiry, they have received
   surprisingly little attention in international relations (IR)
   scholarship. How can we explain this trend and the successes and
   failures of fact-finding missions, which sometimes even backfire on the
   IO authority? Drawing on IR theories of delegation, epistemic authority,
   and IO field operations as well as public international law scholarship
   on commissions of inquiry, this article develops an analytical framework
   for studying the delegation, implementation, and dissemination of
   fact-finding missions. It theorizes how and under what conditions
   international fact-finding missions close or widen credibility gaps and
   thus help to establish, maintain, or weaken the epistemic authority of
   IOs. The article illustrates this framework with a case study of the Ad
   Hoc Working Group on the Human Rights Situation in Chile, sent by the UN
   Commission on Human Rights in 1974 to investigate allegations of human
   rights violations and torture. The conclusion outlines a comparative
   research agenda on international fact-finding missions for IR that
   contributes to the study of knowledge production in IOs and the
   enforcement of international norms.},

Abstract = {April 2015, Burundi. What started as peaceful demonstrations against
   another term of president Nkurunziza, quickly turned into violent
   confrontations between mostly young male civilians and government
   forces. The demonstrations signalled the beginning of a new political
   crisis after a decade of peace. In this paper, we draw on eye-witness
   accounts of civilians to understand the escalation of violence. We argue
   that legacies of conflict informed the understanding and escalation of
   the violence. For instance, memories and skills learned by adults and
   older peers during the civil war were passed on to novices to organise
   protests and neighbourhood defence. Yet the legacies of conflict also
   juxtaposed with protesters' ideals on `civil' non-violent political
   dialogue. The ambivalence towards violence experienced and narrated by
   protesters and witnesses points to intergenerational change, but may
   also be understood as contradictions in how political dialogue and
   competition is generally envisioned in Burundi.},

Abstract = {In this article, a modest attempt is undertaken to connect the rational
   choice theory mechanism with the sociological theory of voting, as
   efforts to juxtapose both theories are still rare, although some cited
   accomplishments offer interesting insights. Our dependent variable is
   participation in a local election in Poland. The local government
   elections in Poland seem to offer a setting particularly well-suited for
   a test of the rational choice hypothesis and its relation to
   sociological explanations of voting behavior. The essential contribution
   of the article derives from our conviction that social embeddedness and
   rooting into the social milieu and local community matter for both the
   cost of participating in a local election and the cost of deciding
   whether to participate. In the world of post-cleavage politics,
   individualization of political behavior and involvement in (new) social
   networks play an increasingly important role. The general finding can be
   summarized as follows: the social embeddedness of citizens does enhance
   the probability of participation in an election; however, it does not
   substitute for the impact of the rational motivation factors, nor does
   it significantly decrease the latter's net impact on our dependent
   variable.},

Abstract = {Communal violence is a major source of insecurity within and across
   borders, sparking significant displacement flows and disturbing
   livelihoods. While conflict literature has shed light onto its causes,
   the existing research has paid little systematic attention to the
   spatial dynamics of communal violence. We distinguish between spillover
   of violence and spillover of predictors. Spillover of violence is
   defined as conflict incidences occurring as a direct response to
   communal violence in a nearby location. Spillover of predictors
   describes instances of communal violence that occur due to nearby
   conflict-inducing factors. We clarify theoretical pathways for both
   spillover processes, focusing on drought exposure affecting not locally
   but in nearby areas. Applying spatial models, we test the expectations
   regarding nearby violence breeding violence and nearby drought
   increasing violence with data on incidences of communal violence for
   sub-Saharan Africa (1990-2014). Our results demonstrate that communal
   violence explains nearby communal violence through different spillover
   processes. We also find evidence for an increase in violence due to
   exposure from neighborhood droughts as well as other conflict-inducing
   factors.},

Abstract = {Whether or not immigration negatively affects the labor market outcomes
   of natives is an ongoing debate. One challenge for empirical evidence is
   the simultaneity of supply- and demand-side effects. To isolate the
   demand side, we focus on refugees in Germany who are exogenously
   allocated to districts and excluded from the labor market. We leverage
   quasi-random variation in the local refugee share as an instrument to
   show that an influx of 1000 asylum-seekers creates almost 300 jobs in a
   district, on average. This effect is mainly driven by a demand for
   additional (female) labor in service, public administration and social
   work. The results are robust to various sensitivity checks and an
   alternative difference-in-differences identification strategy. Moreover,
   we show that employment effects largely offset the financial burden on
   the public. Quantifying the demand side of immigration adds to our
   understanding of local labor market dynamics in an increasingly mobile
   world.},

   former FARC-EP women guerrilleras in the post-peace agreement, with a
   particular emphasis on the country's northeastern region. Based on their
   narratives, I inquire about the transformation from armed struggle to
   feminist combat, as well as the tensions and challenges that arise in
   this path. Methodology: I focus on three particular methods: the
   feminist fieldwork diary, biographical interviews, and participant
   observations in two fieldworks conducted in 2019 and 2022 in
   northeastern Colombia. Conclusions: The article confirms the need to
   understand post-peace agreement militancy as a continuum between armed
   struggle and different feminist, women, and gender combats. It also
   demonstrates the importance of analyzing the militancy of the
   ex-guerrilleras of the FARC-EP, starting from the insurgent identity.
   Finally, it concludes that insurgent feminism, despite the political
   tensions it entails, is a practical example of this continuum of
   militancy. Originality: The article has three main contributions: it
   theorizes the conceptual elements of the continuum of militancy; it
   brings knowledge about the construction of insurgent feminism in
   northeastern Colombia; and it contributes to the understanding of the
   political tensions surrounding the transformation of armed struggles
   into nonviolent feminist actions.},

Abstract = {Objective/context: Based on the Colombian case, an interpellation of the
   concept of sovereignty in contemporary critical political theory is
   proposed from a feminist, queer, and decolonial perspective through the
   analysis of the role of cruelty against LGBTIQ+ people in establishing a
   form of para-institutional sovereign power in neoliberal wars.
   Methodology: This theoretical research is supported by documentary
   analysis of the reports of the National Center of Historical Memory of
   Colombia. Conclusions: The colonial and cisheteropatriarchal circulation
   of cruelty is shown to be an essential element in installing a
   disciplinary power that affects society as a whole and establishes a
   specific form of sovereign power. In the neoliberal stage of capital,
   this form updates a government of bodies that distinguishes between
   citizenship and colonial subjects and is constitutive of the
   nation-state. Originality: Demonstrating this hypothesis has the
   consequence of unveiling a specific form of exercise of power that
   produces bodies through the establishment of what I call the government
   of suffering, which I define as control, rationalization, and
   administration of suffering. This form of power goes beyond the reading
   framework suggested by the paradigms of biopolitics and necropolitics;
   thus, to encompass this dimension of the political, I propose the
   concept of pathospolitics, understood as the form of power that turns
   suffering into an object of government and is deployed through this
   government.},

Abstract = {Objective/context: More than twenty years after the adoption of the
   Security Council Resolution 1325, which highlights the importance of
   women's participation in peacebuilding, they continue to be excluded
   systematically from the negotiating table. This article examines how
   women manage access points to negotiations in intractable contexts and
   fragile peace processes that have not resulted in a peace agreement and
   how this affects their ability to articulate demands and influence such
   processes. Methodology: The case of the UN peace process for Syria is
   examined. Data used for the analysis comes from sixteen semi-structured
   interviews conducted between January 2019 and August 2022. Conclusions:
   The results demonstrate how the combination of bottom-up women-led
   activism processes with top-down institutional efforts facilitates
   breaking the boundaries operating at different levels (macro, meso, and
   micro) to masculinize peace negotiations and hinder women's access.
   Although the fragility of the process compromises their participation,
   Syrian women circumvent these obstacles through strategies and attitudes
   of resilience that allow them to value their actions in the future.
   Originality: The article reviews the literature on women's participation
   and contributes to situating it in the increasingly common framework of
   fragile negotiations and contexts of intractability through a barely
   explored case with unique data drawn from interviews with the political
   actors involved.},

Abstract = {The article looks at civil society as an entity that often reflects a
   country's contextual realities. More specifically, it focuses on
   socio-political structures, showing how weak institutions,
   consociational principles, as well as formal and informal elite dynamics
   in Lebanon have created a perfect atmosphere for sectarian leaders to
   expand their clientelistic networks into civil society. By creating
   their own service-providing sectarian organizations; indirectly pushing
   civic organizations to become players in the system; and infiltrating
   interest groups that may pose a threat, sectarian leaders have been able
   to neutralize the impact of civil society in the country.},

Volume = {62},

Pages = {170-196},

Abstract = {Adam Watson is one of the classical figures of the English School (ES).
   Scholarly appreciation of his contributions, however, has almost
   exclusively focused on his comparative work on historical regional
   `systems of states,' the role of `hierarchy' within an anarchical
   society, and the `evolution'/'expansion' of international society. The
   concept of `raison de systeme,' for its part, although widely
   acknowledged as one of Watson's main conceptual contributions, has
   received comparatively little attention from fellow members of the ES.
   In this context, this article reassesses the relevance of raison de
   systeme in Watson's overall thinking by rooting it in a number of
   earlier intellectual influences emanating from the collaborative efforts
   of the British Committee. Watson's raison de systeme, therefore, must be
   understood as a richer concept giving substance to how all classical ES
   thinkers collectively came to conceive of international society, thus
   giving this theoretical tradition its distinctiveness in the larger
   spectrum of international thought.},

Title = {Strategic Ontologies: Narrative and Meso-Level Theorizing in
   International Politics},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {This paper offers a theory of incremental theoretical evolution
   connecting the practice of international politics with disciplinary IR.
   It theorizes how international political actors engaged in strategic
   local decision-making exert productive power over dominant scientific
   ontologies of the international system. We refer to the narratives
   emerging from these processes as strategic ontologies, defined as
   gradual reformulations of the subjects, objects, and relational logics
   of the international system according to positionally determined
   priorities. As strategic ontologies gain acceptance, their innovations
   endure beyond the context of their utterance, leading to meso-level
   theoretical evolution. We substantiate this account with comparative
   case studies of contested strategic ontologies that have yet to become
   dominant in either the international arena or IR theory. Without
   strategic ontology as an analytical lens, scholarship might miss
   embryonic theoretical innovations in the process of gaining traction.
   First, we examine how Israel and West Germany engaged in strategic
   ontological contestation when negotiating a reparations agreement
   following the Holocaust. Second, we analyze how states have used
   vulnerability in climate negotiations in 2020-2021 to recast global
   policy priorities. Recognition of strategic ontologies across contexts
   illuminates theoretical innovations in real-time and opens a path for
   dynamic new bridges between the academy and policymaking.},

Title = {From Norm Violations to Norm Development: Deviance, International
   Institutions, and the Torture Prohibition},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {How do violations affect international norms? This article demonstrates
   that violations develop norms by analyzing how international
   institutions determine the meaning of deviant behavior and the breached
   norm. Decisions by courts, ad hoc tribunals, commissions of inquiry, and
   expert committees influence formal and informal lawmaking and drive the
   contested and often ambiguous development of international norms. To
   illustrate the impact of these norm applications and lawmaking efforts,
   the article compares two institutions with different mandates to oversee
   the international torture prohibition. In the 1960s and 1970s, the
   European human rights institutions defined torture for human rights law
   and found that Greece and the United Kingdom had violated the torture
   prohibition, but created ambiguity regarding the threshold of torture.
   In 1984, the UN Convention against Torture (CAT) adopted this
   definition, which was informed by earlier norm violations. In the 1990s
   and early 2000s, the UN Committee against Torture (CmAT) applied the
   torture prohibition to interrogation techniques used by Israel and the
   United States in counterterrorism operations. CmAT's decisions that both
   countries had deviated from the norm led to General Comment No. 2 on
   CAT, which reaffirmed and specified the absolute and non-derogable
   nature of the torture prohibition.},

Abstract = {Employing two alternative measures of state failure, we investigate how
   state weakness influences resident terrorist groups' survival.
   Theoretically, state failure favors resident terrorist groups' survival,
   while state territorial control fosters resident groups' termination
   until some control threshold. Empirically, we uncover a robust negative
   relationship between a country's weakness and its control of terrorism
   through the lens of the resident terrorist groups' survival prospects.
   The discovered relationship withstands a host of robustness tests -
   e.g., alternative estimates and samples. We apply an instrument designed
   to address endogeneity concerns. In particular, our novel instrument for
   failed states consists of the interaction between natural disasters and
   ethnic fractionalization. As a state's percentage of territorial control
   increases, resident terrorist groups are more prone to ending until some
   threshold control percent. Our analysis can guide counterterrorism
   policy by exploiting the nuanced theoretical determinants identified
   here that foster resident groups' termination in failing states.},

Abstract = {One mark of the rising research field of secularism and religion is that
   the field itself moved from area studies towards mainstream social
   science. This move can be traced through the increasing significance of
   Turkey. Turkey's AKP was presented as a liberal and moderate challenge
   to radical Kemalist secularism in Turkish Studies, then analytical
   pillars of research in comparative politics and political theory relied
   on this presentation. After AKP's authoritarian turn, how can we reflect
   on its past narration as liberal and moderate? As opposed to the thesis
   of rupture between the early and the late AKP, this article develops the
   thesis of confiscation. First, I resituate Kemalist secularism
   vis-a`-vis French secularism with comparative history. I argue that
   institutionally it's a limited, not a radical, secularism. Then, I
   examine gradual institutional changes during the AKP with statistics,
   court decisions, legislation and parliamentary discussions, and
   demonstrate that limited Kemalist secular institutions ease the way for
   AKP's will to religionize society and the state. My analysis tackles a
   central thesis in the literature: secular institutions can make
   reasonable accommodations of religion without losing their own core. I
   show that in Turkey, accommodations of religion turn into confiscation
   of secular institutions.},

Abstract = {PurposeExtant research on workplace ostracism has investigated a
   victimization perspective to understand ostracism at the cost of
   examining the perpetrator-centric view of ostracism. This study aims to
   draw on the self-categorization theory and the social exchange theory to
   investigate the harmful effects of workplace romance in cultivating
   workplace ostracism from the perspective of perpetrator to combat
   concerns for victim blaming. This study further proposes that workplace
   ostracism triggered by workplace romance provokes interpersonal
   conflict. Besides, this study investigates the moderating role of
   prosocial behavior in the underlying linkages.
   Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a multisource, time-lagged
   research design to collect data from employees working in the service
   sector organizations in Pakistan. This study analyzes 367 responses
   using SmartPLS (v 4.0). FindingsThe findings of this study reveal that
   workplace romance elicits workplace ostracism, which, in turn, fosters
   interpersonal conflict among coworkers. In addition, this study finds
   that ingroup prosocial behavior strengthens the associations between
   workplace romance and workplace ostracism, and workplace romance and
   interpersonal conflict, mediated by workplace ostracism such that the
   associations are more potent at higher levels of ingroup prosocial
   behavior and vice versa. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors'
   knowledge, this is the first study that examines workplace romance as
   the perpetrator-centric antecedent of workplace ostracism, and ingroup
   prosocial behavior in exaggerating the outgroup ostracism and
   interpersonal conflict.},

Abstract = {Reminiscing during foreign state visits serves as a discursive means for
   building interstate relationships. When political leaders strategically
   narrate their states' historical legacies, they construct a collective
   memory that serves as a resource for creating and sustaining amicable
   relations between states. Studying evocations of past events in 455
   speeches delivered during foreign state visits between 2010 and 2020, we
   demonstrate the prevalence and significance of the practice of
   reminiscing in interstate politics. We suggest bonding narratives as a
   device through which a connection is generated between two collectives
   to create and sustain positive relations. Despite the unique nature of
   bonding narratives, the constructed collective memory mostly relies on
   shared memories of wars, once again underlining the link between nations
   and violence.},

Abstract = {Militant right-wing extremists frequently victimize Islam and Muslims,
   who are denigrated as violent criminals and terrorists. Muslim
   immigrants are primary targets of hate crimes committed by right-wing
   extremists. Surprisingly and counter-intuitively, some right-wing
   extremists admire jihadists and seek inspiration from jihadism. The
   extant literature explains it by focusing on the ideological
   overlapping, fusion, and fluidity between various extremist beliefs.
   However, such concepts fail to explain why some right-wing extremists
   endorse jihadi propaganda and violence while others do not. The article
   introduces the concept of intra-extremist outbidding-borrowing concepts
   and imageries from diametrically opposed types of extremism and belief
   systems to outbid competing groups from their own milieu-as a valuable
   explanation of why some most extreme right-wing groups compete for
   devoted membership by endorsing jihadi violence and jihadism.},

Abstract = {How did geo-economic and technological competition between the United
   States and China arise? And what is the Chinese perspective on the
   US-China rivalry? In this forum article, we analyze the conflict from a
   critical political economy perspective. We argue that the US has
   mobilized its structural power as the leading high-tech country in
   global value chains to curtail China's ascent. By elucidating Chinese
   responses to American structural power, we shed light on the development
   and complexities of this conflict, thereby contributing to a more
   profound comprehension of the US-China geo-economic competition. We
   conclude that the intensifying US-Chinese rivalry has the potential to
   foster a new era of public policies characterized by global statism.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the migration agreements between the European
   Union (EU) and Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. These international policy
   frameworks were negotiated in tandem with one another, and all were
   announced in 2016. Drawing on fieldwork conducted in the three
   countries, the article argues that they fuse humanitarian elements with
   a bloc-based security logic in an ad-hoc mix that lacks substantive
   legitimacy in the three states, rendering the frameworks unstable. The
   article introduces the idea of hybrid migration governance which we have
   developed inductively to conceptualise the empirical findings from our
   fieldwork, building on existing work on hybridity in the conflict and
   security studies literature and Nora Stel's conception of governance as
   the ability to shape the field of action of others. In our usage, hybrid
   migration governance refers to the efficacy of EU intervention in the
   institutional management of migration in the three case study countries
   ('shaping the field of action'), the `frozen' character of the societal
   relations formed through this process and their underlying lack of
   domestic legitimacy. In conclusion, we argue that hybrid migration
   governance poses problem for the EU's `Barcelona' conception of human
   security, because rather than expanding the bloc's `zone of security' to
   the international neighbourhood, these policies have generated
   downstream security-risks.},

Abstract = {Studies on voters have shown that emotions are an important factor in
   politics. However, less is known about emotions experienced by
   adolescents in the context of civic education. Applying the
   control-value theory to a cross-curricular context, we analyze the
   relations between two types of emotions experienced in civic education
   and their antecedents and effects on learning: achievement emotions
   experienced during in-class political discussions and epistemic emotions
   experienced during individual processing of political information in
   school. We hypothesized both types of emotions relate to control and
   value appraisal antecedents (e.g., internal political efficacy, personal
   importance). Further, we expected-depending on the specific
   emotion-positive or negative relations with academic outcomes (e.g.,
   motivation, engagement, and knowledge). Data were collected with an
   online questionnaire in Austrian upper secondary schools with students
   (N = 594, M-age = 17.1) from grades 10 to 13. Bivariate latent
   correlations broadly support the expectations: We found mainly positive
   associations of antecedents and outcomes to enjoyment, hope, pride,
   curiosity, and surprise and negative associations to hopelessness,
   confusion, and boredom, but more complex correlation patterns for
   anxiety, anger, and shame. The results provide first insights into which
   emotions are experienced during political learning and underscore the
   importance of acknowledging the role of emotions in civic education.},

Abstract = {Political hostility is a pervasive problem in American politics,
   producing dangerous consequences for individuals and society. Recent
   research in social psychology suggests that intellectual humility may be
   able to reduce political hostility, but the underlying causal
   relationship remains unclear. The purpose of this article is to examine
   how intellectual humility lowers hostility toward people who disagree
   (dissenters) about specific political topics. Results from a national
   survey indicate that those holding political beliefs with humility feel
   less negativity toward dissenters. Fixed-effects regression models also
   show that intrapersonal variation in intellectual humility predicts
   issue-specific hostility across political topics. Furthermore, a survey
   experiment priming intellectual humility caused a corresponding decrease
   in hostility toward dissenters without impacting underlying opinions.
   Altogether, these results suggest that fostering intellectual humility
   may be a fruitful avenue for alleviating the hostility and anger that
   often accompany political disagreement.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis article analyzes the challenges of infectious disease
   control under a super-aged society through Japan's experience with
   COVID-19.Design/methodology/approachThis article provides an overview of
   Japan's COVID-19 measures and their characteristics, discusses their
   successes and failures, and identifies future challenges.FindingsJapan's
   basic strategy for COVID-19 consists of three parts: the border defense
   (Stage 1), slowing down the spread (Stage 2), and damage control (Stage
   3). One key policy feature in Stage 2 and Stage 3 is based on
   ``voluntary restriction{''}. It had a certain effect, but it was
   prolonged with each recurring ``wave of infection{''}, resulting in
   economic exhaustion and people's dissatisfaction. Thus, the effect of
   the voluntary restriction has weakened, while the percentage of people
   who have been vaccinated is improving, making it difficult to predict
   the damage of the next ``wave{''}. Under the hyper-aged society, it was
   necessary to identify and protect particularly vulnerable areas, i.e.,
   psychiatry hospitals, chronic care hospitals, and long term care (LTC)
   facilities. On the other hand, secondary impacts extend to young people.
   The most serious one is the decrease in births which further accelerates
   the aging of society.Originality/valueThis study is original as it
   investigated why Japan's unique countermeasures against COVID-19 without
   mandatory lockdown worked well for a considerable period. It also
   revealed that secondary impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic are broader and
   more significant than the direct loss of life, and that the social
   system, especially super-aged society with many vulnerable areas should
   be reformed in consideration of the threat of infectious diseases.
   Lessons from the Japanese case may contribute to other countries.},

Title = {The political theory of technological change: Lessons from the
   liberalism-ecologism debate},
Journal = {POLITICS},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Little consideration has been given to the process of technological
   change in political theory. Given that ideas about this process play an
   important role in many strands of normative political thought, and are
   especially crucial to climate change politics, this is a remarkable
   oversight. It risks political theory being irrelevant to climate change
   mitigation. The implications of this oversight for political theory are
   explored here through an analysis of the liberalism-ecologism debate.
   The article argues that attempts to green liberalism - to move it beyond
   environmentalism - cannot succeed while liberalism is silent about
   technological change. More broadly, given that most political theory
   traditions make claims about technological change, claims crucial to
   their worldviews and normative goals, it argues that much more
   theorisation of the concept is necessary. Especially now that they shape
   how the world understands climate change mitigation, contests over the
   meaning of technological change are intensely political contests.
   Political theory needs to get much more involved.},

Abstract = {We argue that a taken-for-granted category gives way to a new category
   when strategic behavior becomes stigmatized. As a result, even bystander
   firms that have engaged in similar strategic behavior, such as lobbying,
   will be penalized by their association with the culpable strategic
   behavior. The extent of their association with the culpable behavior
   will determine the level of punishment they receive. However, if a
   trustworthy third party administers a corrective measure, the affected
   firms can regain their lost legitimacy. The extent of their restoration
   is proportional to the amount of legitimacy that was lost. We provide
   empirical evidence for this argument by analyzing the Jack Abramoff
   case, one of the most notorious corrupt lobbying cases in US history. We
   find that bystander firms were penalized by shareholders when the
   corrupt lobbying was revealed. Furthermore, the penalty was more severe
   for bystander firms that engaged in more lobbying activities and hired
   more revolving-door lobbyists. We also find that the subsequent legal
   remedy helped the bystander firms that were penalized the most to
   recover the most from their losses. We confirm the theoretical notion
   using the Enron case as well.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyse the archival collection of the
   memoirs of officers of the Polish security forces (Security Office and
   Citizens' Militia) on their service in the Warsaw voivodeship in the
   late 1940s and early 1950s. Entangled in political violence, they were
   chief actors of the top-down ``revolution in the county{''} and
   bottom-up ``county revolution{''} that overlapped in Central Europe
   after the Second World War. This article presents their accounts as
   examples of fulfilment of a ``narrative command{''} to present a vision
   of the past in line with the official ideological scripts of the Polish
   People's Republic. At the same time, though, the approach employed here
   does not deprive the authors of their authorial subjectivity, and
   highlights their agency in attempting to express their individual
   agendas, interpretations, and emotions. This article distinguishes two
   types of accounts with reference to their perspective, structure, and
   language: ``from a bird's-eye view{''} and ``a frog's-eye{''} narrative,
   as well as one peculiar case of ``an aspiring writer.{''} Then, in its
   main part, the article analyses how veterans reconstructed and
   interpreted various experiences related to their service in the 1940s
   and 1950s. The issues are the following: becoming an officer and
   transformation from ``peasant{''} to ``guardsman,{''} participation in
   violence and coercion, alcohol drinking, and possible fields of
   political criticism expressed by the officers.},

Abstract = {Replacing banned American social-media applications and boasting
   encryption and other privacy protections, Telegram has become the social
   media of choice in Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Its
   popularity and the growth of a new community of amateur military
   correspondents ('milbloggers') communicating directly with users have
   made Telegram an increasingly important part of the war effort and the
   political narrative of the war. Criticism of the Russian military and
   the Ministry of Defence has become commonplace on the social-media
   platform, increasingly affecting narratives discussed on Russian
   television. The lack of a cohesive government strategy with respect to
   Telegram has led to an uncoordinated approach, with some officials
   trying to censor Telegram and others - including Russian President
   Vladimir Putin - seeking to co-opt milbloggers by integrating them into
   mainstream discourse. As the war drags on, however, the government is
   exercising increasing control over the platform, which will impact the
   reach and content of milbloggers, dissidents and other users.},

Abstract = {This study provides insight into the current evolution of the New
   Development Bank (NDB). It examines the role of the agency of the global
   South reshaping intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) in the case of
   Brazil's influence on the NDB to expand its membership. In that process,
   this article homes in on the admission of Uruguay to the NDB as a
   prospective member in September 2021, the first case of NDB expansion
   into Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The study shows that the
   membership negotiations between Montevideo and the Bank were less rigid
   and formal than the procedural norms of multilateral development banks
   (MDBs) of the North, thanks to the collaborative agency by the various
   LAC actors involved. It makes the case that Uruguay's accession to the
   NDB will produce numerous win-win benefits for both the country and the
   Bank. It also argues that the membership will inspire the future
   accession of other countries in the LAC region to the Bank. The study
   adds to the scant literature which conceptualizes the mechanics of
   membership expansion by small or new IGOs. The piece also adds to
   existing studies investigating how LAC agency has previously shaped and
   continues to shape MDBs.},

Abstract = {The right to property is part of International Human Rights Law (IHRL).
   However, the right is conspicuously missing from some fundamental
   trea-ties, and there are important inconsistencies in its interpretation
   by regional and global human rights bodies. In light of the
   indeterminacy and polysemy of IHRL in relation to property, this paper
   articulates a proposal to rethink this right taking Economic, Social,
   and Cultural Rights (ESCR) seriously. The proposal contains four
   propositions. Firstly, property is a human right. Secondly, it includes
   private property as one of its forms, but this is not the only one.
   Thirdly, property has a social function. And fourthly, as a matter of
   proportionality, fulfilling ESCR is one of the most important objectives
   that may justify the limitation of private property.},

Abstract = {Administrative style is a central concept in public policy and
   administration research. Despite the developments in the field, less is
   known about the effect different administrative styles have on policy
   output. To contribute to filling this gap, the article offers an
   original framework to explore the link between administrative styles and
   policy output based on the consolidated distinction between functional
   and positional orientations as constitutive elements of administrative
   styles. This framework is applied to an under-investigated case of
   public organization in the Italian context, that is, the administrative
   apparatus headed by the Extraordinary Commissioner for the Covid-19
   Emergency, to test the general hypothesis that what makes the difference
   in determining output performance is an administration's positional
   orientation, not only its functional one. Doing so, the article
   contributes to ``second generation{''} administrative style research and
   provides a theoretical and analytical framework to be tested in future
   cross-national and cross-sectoral comparisons.},

Volume = {61},

Pages = {711-725},

Abstract = {Alliances are often presumed to serve the dual purpose of restraint and
   deterrence, though few existing studies examine their relationship and
   the connection with defense burden-sharing. This research employs a
   three-player game-theoretic model, which endogenizes the process of
   alliance formation and arms buildups, to demonstrate how intra-alliance
   burden-sharing allows the alliance to preserve the status quo. The
   results suggest that alliance burden-sharing may exert the deterrence
   and restraining effects, while at most one effect is observable at a
   time because the effects occur in separate parameter spaces. If a
   prospective ally's cost of arms buildups is relatively low, a
   status-quo-oriented superpower may form an alliance even by shouldering
   a disproportionately heavy burden to dissuade the ally from overturning
   the status quo (the restraining effect). Conversely, if the cost is
   relatively high, the superpower may form an alliance to protect the ally
   from external threats (the deterrence effect). However, to prevent being
   exploited by this ally, the superpower provides only the units of armed
   forces that are sufficient to incentivize the ally to bolster its
   military capabilities to deter the threats. Their alliance entails power
   aggrandizement, but it does not provoke a non-signatory as the ally
   remains too weak to act unilaterally.},

Abstract = {The Border Crossings of the World (BCW) dataset explores state authority
   spatially by collecting information about infrastructure built where
   highways cross internationally recognized borders. This geolocated
   information is recorded using high-altitude imagery from 1993 to 2020.
   We describe how the data were collected, demonstrate the dataset's
   utility, and offer advice and best practices regarding use of the data.
   These data present clear evidence of visible and long-term state
   investments in authoritative displays of states' intention to `filter'
   entry into and exit out of their national jurisdiction. Researchers can
   use these data to test theories on the causes and consequences of border
   hardening for security outcomes, border management cooperation,
   political violence, terrorism, trade and migration flows, transnational
   crime patterns, and human rights conditions. Because the data are
   precisely geolocated, they are easy to combine with existing spatial

   Australia, India, and Japan have adopted new ``Indo-Pacific{''}
   strategic narratives to promote and defend the ``rules-based order.{''}
   These narratives use China's maritime disputes with smaller neighbors in
   the South China Sea as a key example of Beijing's revisionist
   intentions. Yet such narratives expose ``rules-based order{''} advocates
   to risks of ``rhetorical entrapment{''} as other actors compel them to
   abide by the standards they have set. To what extent have Indo-Pacific
   powers been forced to follow the rules in their own asymmetrical
   maritime disputes? This article examines three Indo-Pacific cases: Timor
   Sea Compulsory Conciliation between Australia and Timor-Leste, the
   Chagos Island Marine Protected Area Arbitration between the United
   Kingdom and Mauritius, and the Bay of Bengal Maritime Boundary
   Arbitration between India and Bangladesh. To varying degrees, this
   article finds that strategic narratives constrained the policy options
   of all three Indo-Pacific powers.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 20},
Abstract = {The statist focus of comparative politics has withheld from view the
   ability of powerful actors such as transnational corporations to engage
   in authoritarian practices on their own initiative, in different
   alliances, regardless of the national regime type in which they find
   themselves. Focusing on plantation-level interactions, this article
   analyses how the United Fruit Company and its successor companies could
   control and exploit its workers, using silencing, secrecy and subterfuge
   so as to sabotage accountability, from the 1900s to the early 2000s.
   Over time, the company's practices evolved from violent repression and
   mass dismissals to manipulating trade unions to a mix of engagement,
   deception, and outsourcing to evade accountability. This corresponded to
   scalar shifts: the company always operated transnationally, but workers
   moved from local to national and finally transnational organising,
   curtailing the company's room for manoeuvre. Spatially, the company's
   physical control over its plantation workers could be as forceful as
   that of a national state, but its `territory' has been one of
   shape-shifting network nodes, becoming even more `porous' in the
   twenty-first century. This spatial mobility and ambiguity has in turn
   been deployed by the company to sabotage accountability to its workers.},

Abstract = {This article pushes the work of Bourdieu to more ethnographic directions
   within international social sciences, particularly studies of everyday
   (in)security. Thematically, it looks at how transformations in global
   politics towards increased xenophobia and the normalisation of
   `far-right' politics can be examined through mobilising `Bourdieu the
   ethnographer' (Blommaert, 2005). Using the example of Sweden, and an
   ethnography of everyday life around a refugee resettlement facility in
   2013 and 2014, the article argues that Bourdieu the ethnographer
   provides important conceptual tools for understanding the way in which
   logics of (in)security shifted ever further into everyday life. This
   thus offers an interesting way to think about the normalisation of
   far-right and xenophobic politics more broadly. Through conducting this
   specific type of Bourdieu-inspired ethnography, the article empirically
   grounds the `habitus' of the so-called `far-right' voter. Taking
   seriously the temporal dimension of habitus, Bourdieu the ethnographer
   orients analysis towards transformation, evolution and flux, allowing
   `far-right' to be conceived relationally. In the Swedish case, we are
   thus able to trace the shift from a `welcoming' to an `exclusionary'
   type of politics.},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that elected officials are more responsive
   to the opinions of high-income citizens than to those of middle and
   working-class citizens in the United States. This is often explained by
   the fact that economic elites make campaign contributions to political
   elites, leading to decision-making that aligns with the preferences of
   the affluent. This paper examines the opinion-policy link in Swedish
   politics, where campaign contributions are relatively low. Despite this,
   the study finds that high-income citizens still receive the most policy
   responsiveness. Three alternative possible explanations are discussed.
   Do high-income citizens receive more responsiveness because (a) they are
   better able to put issues on the political agenda, (b) because they are
   easier to satisfy and prefer `cheaper' symbolic policy reforms, while
   low-income citizens prefer more costly policies or (c) because the
   status quo bias works to the advantage of high-income citizens?},

Abstract = {Russia's war on Ukraine has upended the European security order. Ukraine
   has requested EU membership, unprecedented sanctions have been imposed
   on Russia, European countries have shipped weapons and munitions to
   Ukraine and NATO has shored up its military presence. Despite such
   action, is it possible to speak of a transformative moment or
   `Zeitenwende' for EU security and defence? This article analyses the
   state of EU integration in defence since the war on Ukraine. Drawing on
   hypotheses developed under `new intergovernmentalism', this article
   analyses how EU Member State preferences in defence and
   intergovernmental-supranational dynamics are being shaped by the war. In
   particular, the article probes how supranational and intergovernmental
   institutions have reacted to the war and how domestic preferences have
   fed into recent EU defence efforts. In doing so, the article provides a
   preliminary assessment of the state of EU integration in defence since
   Russia's invasion of Ukraine.},

Abstract = {This article is conceptually motivated. By drawing on cases from the
   U.S. and Israeli militaries, it aims at demonstrating the existence of
   two separate systems of legitimacy of military violence - extra-military
   and intra-military - and mapping the gaps between them. It
   conceptualizes the legitimacy of violence and then maps seven conditions
   under which gaps are created between the two systems, as follows: the
   uniqueness of military culture, the extent to which the military does
   not mirror society, field command's broadening improvisation and
   interpretation, ambiguous political directives, the extent to which the
   military leverages a legitimacy dispute, troops' resistance, and the
   diachronic systems of legitimacy. The appearance of these gaps is more
   likely to present with weakening of civilian control and the break-up of
   military hierarchy.},

Abstract = {After the seventeenth century, rulers across Europe attempted reforms to
   replace ama-teur administrators with professional bureaucrats. The
   success of administrative reforms hinged on whether rulers could
   compensate entrenched officeholders and recruit salaried employees. The
   author demonstrates that the extent to which these conditions were met
   at the time of reforms depended on whether states had experienced a
   Protestant Refor-mation in the sixteenth century. This article shows how
   the Reformation, which involved the expropriation of the Catholic
   Church's assets, set in motion two processes. First, to finance their
   wars, Protestant rulers used revenue from confiscated assets instead of
   sell-ing proprietary offices, leading to fewer venal officeholders who
   resisted administrative reforms. Second, expropriations made churches
   poorer and reduced the number of plum jobs in the clergy, incentivizing
   a reallocation of educational investments from religious knowledge to
   secular skills more useful for state administration. This distinctive
   Protes-tant developmental path hastened the demise of the patrimonial
   state. By 1789, the only major territorial states that were bureaucratic
   were Protestant.},

Abstract = {This article examines the ideational dimension and political performance
   of American grand strategy since `9/11' and explores to what extent the
   strategic assumptions, ideological dispositions, and security practices
   of the Bush Doctrine have endured since the 2001 terrorist attacks. It
   advances a constructivist understanding of American grand strategy as a
   nexus of national identity discourses and security practices. The
   article will first explore the significance of American exceptionalism
   in the ideational dimension of the Bush Doctrine and its practical
   impact in the pursuit of US national security. The article will then
   focus on the Obama Doctrine, arguing that its embrace of cooperative
   engagement and multilateralism represented a limited strategic course
   correction within the paradigm of liberal hegemony. Finally, the article
   will contrast grand strategy discourses under Bush and Donald Trump,
   exploring their shared foundations in Jacksonian nationalism and
   unilateralism that demonstrate the continued relevance of Bush's
   strategic vision of US primacy.},

Abstract = {This article addresses whether perceived goal agreement matters for
   cross-sectoral collaboration outcomes. Using original survey data from
   Lebanon that compares the perceptions of local governcment and nonprofit
   leaders, the findings indicate perceived goal agreement is salient and
   linked to judgments that collaboration meets its objectives. The article
   also examines perceptions of goal agreement as it relates to social
   (trust) and process (power-sharing) collaboration outcomes and find it
   to be associated with higher trust between collaborators. While this is
   the case for nonprofits more than local governments, we find no
   corresponding sector differences for the relationship between
   perceptions of goal agreement and effectiveness. In addition, agreeing
   on goals seems to be linked to perceptions of unequal decision-making
   authority for local governments. The results highlight implications for
   the relationship between goal agreement and cross-sector collaboration
   outcome, particularly in the context of developing countries.},

Abstract = {What explains the explosion of coup activity in Africa over the last few
   years? To answer this question, this article presents narrative
   summaries-a current history-of all eleven coups attempts in Africa
   between August 2020 and November 2022. We then discuss the most relevant
   causal explanations for the observed increase in coup frequency in
   Africa in this period. Though we find relatively little evidence of
   direct coup diffusion or democratic backsliding as coup triggers, our
   findings suggest that coup-struck African countries over the last few
   years are disproportionately poor, have a recent history of coups, and
   face ongoing dilemmas of democratic consolidation. Ongoing Islamist
   insurgencies may have helped precipitate recent coups in West Africa but
   not elsewhere.},

Abstract = {This article applies a new investigative technique called `equity
   mapping' to the corporate structure of two big Chinese state-owned
   banks, Bank of China (BOC) and China Construction Bank (CCB), to advance
   our understanding of the way they use their Hong Kong subsidiaries and
   holding companies to support their global and domestic strategies. We
   show that Chinese state-owned banks typically set up a `sandwich'
   structure of holding whereby a Hong Kong subsidiary holds a British
   Virgin Islands or Cayman subsidiary which, in turn, holds a publicly
   listed subsidiary in Hong Kong. The subsidiary holding company in Hong
   Kong serves as the bank's face to the world. Indeed, these subsidiaries
   often control subsidiaries in mainland China, and in that way,
   state-owned Chinese banks operate as foreign banks on the mainland. This
   structure can be used to avoid taxation in different regions despite
   restrictive mainland financial regulations. In addition to creating a
   formal structure that emulates the legal and corporate governance
   structure of Western banks and companies, these Chinese banks establish
   a dual pattern of ownership organizations through personal links and
   named trusted directors to build an informal structure with `floating'
   subsidiaries in offshore financial centres.},

Title = {Power and Truth in Science-Related Populism: Rethinking the Role of
   Knowledge and Expertise in Climate Politics},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {845-861},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Populism is often characterized as a rejection of scientific expertise
   and a key obstacle to societies' ability to address the climate crisis
   today. I challenge this account, arguing for a more inclusive conception
   of populism and a more critical account of expertise. Consistent with
   this, I delineate a range of responses to the challenges of climate
   politics in populist times. In doing so, I have two primary aims: first,
   to highlight limitations of ``anti-populist{''} responses among
   proponents of climate change action, and, second, to lean into populist
   criticisms of elite expertise, by delineating how some challenges to
   dominant forms of science and elite power are themselves expert
   knowledge and integral to promising movements that address climate
   change. This can allow expertise to be distinguished from elitism and to
   be recognized in caring relations to the subjects of knowledge. Here,
   expertise is not manifest as separation from the common world, but as
   immersion in it.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {243-265},
Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {Both quantitative and qualitative research has provided evidence of a
   fashion system with principled aesthetic transitions. Previous theories
   of coordination have been proposed at the level of collective behavior,
   but monopolistic competition at the industry level looms large.
   Designers and suppliers around the world have the difficult task of
   anticipating uncertain consumer demand. How are multiple layers of
   futurework coordinated through global value chains? Drawing on 11 months
   of ethnographic data from first-tier suppliers in India, I document the
   role of forecasting in buyer-supplier coordination. I describe the
   contents of forecasts and show how designers use organizational routines
   to balance competing requirements for conformity and differentiation.
   Most importantly, I argue that forecasting information is filtered
   through calculative spaces and the logic of uncertainty absorption. The
   consequences of transnational futurework resonate not only through
   finance and technological innovation, but through aesthetics and
   embodiment.},

Abstract = {The use of AI to automate defense and intelligence tasks is increasing.
   And yet, little is known about how algorithmic analyses, data capture,
   and decisions will be perceived by elite decision-makers. This article
   presents the results of two experiments that explore manifestations of
   AI systems in the cyber conflict decision-making loop. Though findings
   suggest that technical expertise positively impacts respondents' ability
   to gauge the potential utility and credibility of an input (indicating
   that training can, in fact, overcome bias), the perception of human
   agency in the loop even in the presence of AI inputs mitigates this
   effect and makes decision-makers more willing to operate on less
   information. This finding is worrying given the extensive challenges
   involved in effectively building human oversight and opportunity for
   intervention into any effective employment of AI for national security
   purposes. The article considers these obstacles and potential solutions
   in the context of data gathered.},

Abstract = {As US officials have grown more anxious about the credibility of
   extended nuclear deterrence, they have placed renewed emphasis on
   nuclear-assurance measures. The hope is that closer exercises and
   consultations can reassure allies, strengthen deterrence postures and
   reduce the risk that an ally could pursue their own nuclear weapons.
   However, recent developments in the US-South Korea alliance suggest that
   nuclear assurance is not only ineffective at reassuring Seoul but may
   also be fuelling proliferation risks. By raising the salience of nuclear
   weapons within the alliance, nuclear assurance reinforces the fiction
   that South Korea's defence depends on nuclear use. Misunderstanding the
   risks and potential of nuclear assurance has fuelled calls for a South
   Korean nuclear-weapons programme and obstructed the alliance's ability
   to adapt and improve its deterrence posture.},

Abstract = {Our Common Agenda-the flagship report by the UN Secretary General
   released in September 2021-promises a transformative change in the face
   of a post-pandemic crisis in the progress towards global human
   development. As such, the report is not only closely aligned with the
   Sustainable Development Goals but also from the outset outlines its
   ambition to `accelerate' progress towards the SDGs. This paper unpacks
   the complex interplay between the two frameworks through the theoretical
   lens of an epistemic infrastructure of quantification. The paper shows
   how Our Common Agenda could be seen as a move towards an expansion of
   the existing infrastructure of measurement to include a new temporal
   dimension. Overall, the paper argues that the transformative potential
   of the epistemic infrastructure is in fact impeded by the statistical
   path dependency of the existing metrics and the distinct politics of
   infrastructure which promotes blurred accountability lines and lacks
   specific solutions.},

Abstract = {Varieties of regimes exist in carbon markets, but little is known about
   regime interactions within this complex. This article particularly
   focuses on interactions between voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) and
   compliance carbon markets (CCMs) and treats VCMs as soft regimes while
   CCMs as hard regimes. It utilizes comparative case studies and grounded
   theory to dissect drivers of carbon market linkages and regime
   interactions. We argue that institutional complementarities of
   participants, market boundaries, and operation rules exist between VCMs
   and CCMs, providing prerequisites for interactions between soft and hard
   regimes. Furthermore, there are four types of causal mechanisms for
   regime interactions, namely cognitive, rule, behavioral, and functional
   interactions, which mainly occur in the direction of VCMs toward CCMs.
   In addition, regime interactions within carbon markets evolve
   dynamically. Soft regimes are contingent on the development of hard
   regimes, which can gradually absorb, overlap, and squeeze out soft
   regimes. This research advances our understanding of complex regime
   interactions within carbon markets and provides theoretical insights for
   the transformation of future carbon markets.},

Abstract = {A necessary part of planetary justice is self-work, restoring or forming
   our being truthful, consistent, dependable, and accountable people.
   Planetary justice - so far typically associated with vast, geological
   scales of space and time - involves an intimate dimension, too. We can
   work on it wherever we are. Moreover, self-work and planetary justice
   intertwine historically and conceptually. The historical context for
   self-work involves the histories of violence that led to the
   breakthrough of the planetary as a category of thought about justice.
   Facing this, the essay notes areas for further reflection, study, and
   action.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to unpack the implications of the deteriorating rule
   of law within the EU's eastern members for the EU's external democracy
   promotion. We examine the legitimacy of the EU's support for democracy
   in the European neighbourhood in light of the internal EU rule-of-law
   crisis. Adopting a sociological perspective, we emphasize local
   perceptions of the EU by tracing the legitimation dynamics at play in
   neighbouring societies. We adopt a tripartite conception of external
   legitimacy based on appropriateness, utilitarian consensus, and empathy.
   Using representative public opinion surveys, we show that the democratic
   erosion in the eastern EU members has not (yet) negatively impacted the
   EU's credibility in supporting democracy in the neighbourhood. The
   article contributes to the research on the legitimacy of EU foreign
   policy and the literature on the legitimacy of international
   organizations. It also contributes to the broader effort at
   provincializing International Relations and decentring EU foreign policy
   studies.},

Abstract = {Ethnographic field interviews collected in three municipalities of
   Oaxaca explain how the Mexican state's response to the Chiapas
   earthquake facilitated capital accumulation while intensifying
   indigenous-campesino grievances against megaprojects and resource
   extraction. State policies in Oaxaca's Isthmus of Tehuantepec during the
   fall of 2017 reinforced social inequality by way of three key
   mechanisms: neglect, dispossession, and pacification. Making sense of
   the way state institutions exercised power during this disaster benefits
   from combining a critical perspective on global capitalism with
   long-standing frameworks of cultural genocide and internal colonialism.
   Las entrevistas de campo etnograficas recogidas en tres municipios de
   Oaxaca nos muestran como la respuesta del Estado mexicano al terremoto
   de Chiapas facilito la acumulacion de capital al mismo tiempo que
   intensifico las quejas de campesinos indigenas contra los megaproyectos
   y la extraccion de recursos. Las politicas estatales en el istmo de
   Tehuantepec en Oaxaca durante el otono de 2017 reforzaron la desigualdad
   social a traves de tres mecanismos clave: abandono, despojo y
   pacificacion. Para poder dar sentido a la forma en que las instituciones
   estatales ejercieron el poder durante este desastre es importante
   combinar una perspectiva critica sobre el capitalismo global y marcos
   teoricos de larga data en torno al genocidio cultural y el colonialismo

Abstract = {Decision-makers rely extensively on expert groups and commissions for
   policy advice. Many see in this a growing technocracy or expertization
   of decision-making. Yet, we know little about the actual influence of
   these expert bodies in policy-making. When does expert group advice
   shape policy-making rather than being brushed aside? The article goes
   beyond existing research by measuring and explaining variation in expert
   group influence. Using the number of citations to expert group reports
   in government white papers and later expert group reports as measures of
   influence, the article analyzes citations to 1545 Norwegian advisory
   commission reports published 1972-2017. It concentrates on three
   dimensions of the organization of expert groups as potential
   determinants of influence: member composition, appointing ministry and
   resources. The results suggest that expert groups have greater influence
   when they include more politicians and have a bigger secretariat. The
   article contributes empirically and methodologically to research on
   expertise and policy-making.},

Abstract = {Advocates of inclusive growth claim it provides policymakers with a
   means of combining economic success with social inclusivity, making it
   highly attractive across a wide range of settings. Here, we explore how
   three UK policy organizations (a devolved national government, a city
   region combined authority, and a local council) are pursuing inclusive
   growth goals. Drawing on 51 semistructured interviews, documentary
   analysis and policy ethnography, we argue that inclusive growth is a
   classic ``chameleonic idea,{''} strategically imbued with malleable
   qualities that serve to obscure substantive, unresolved tensions. These
   characteristics are helpful in achieving alliances, both within policy
   organizations and between these organizations and their multiple
   stakeholders. However, these same qualities make inclusive growth
   challenging to operationalize, especially in governance settings
   dominated by metrics. The process of representing a malleable idea via a
   set of metricized indicators involves simplification and stabilization,
   both of which risk disrupting the fragile coalitions that malleability
   enables.},

Abstract = {One effect of Zimbabwe's 2017 coup was to unleash a new wave of public
   engagement with the unresolved state repression of the 1980s, known as
   Gukurahundi. This wave was led by the `post-Gukurahundi generation' and
   particularly by activists whose narratives of Gukurahundi were entwined
   with calls for a separate `Mthwakazi nation'. This article explores
   these activists' stories of Gukurahundi and asks why they broke through
   into the public realm after decades of relative silence. It argues that
   Mthwakazi activists' engagement relied on an interpretation of
   Gukurahundi not simply as a discrete historical event, but as the
   clearest expression of an ongoing `Grand Plan' of ethnic
   marginalization. This narrative was foundational to the construction of
   a moral order that divided the country along ethnic and regional fault
   lines, ultimately legitimizing Mthwakazi nationalism. The paper roots
   this narrative's emergence in two interrelated processes. Speaking to
   the role of silencing in keeping conflicts alive across generations, it
   examines how the `noisy silence' that has surrounded Gukurahundi in both
   public and private has meant that Gukurahundi lingered as a readily
   available interpretative lens. This lens became meaningful when the
   second generation, faced with political and economic marginalization,
   was grappling for meaning and political belonging.},

Title = {Generalized Dispositional Distrust as the Common Core of Populism and
   Conspiracy Mentality},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Populism and beliefs in conspiracy theories fuel societal division as
   both rely on a Manichean us-versus-them, good-versus-evil narrative.
   However, whether both constructs have the same dispositional roots is
   essentially unknown. Across three studies conducted in two different
   countries and using diverse samples (total N = 1,888), we show that
   populism and conspiracy mentality have a strong common core as evidenced
   using bifactor modeling. This common core was uniquely linked to
   (aversive) personality, namely the Dark Factor of Personality (D),
   beyond basic personality traits from the HEXACO Model of Personality
   Structure. The association between D and the common core, in turn, was
   fully accounted for by distrust-related beliefs as captured in cynicism,
   dangerous and competitive social worldviews, sensitivity to befallen
   injustice, and (low) trust propensity. Taken together, the results show
   that populism and conspiracy mentality have a shared psychological basis
   that is well described as a sociopolitically flavored manifestation of
   generalized dispositional distrust. The findings thus underscore the
   value of generalized trust for societal functioning and suggest that
   increasing trust may simultaneously combat both populism and beliefs in
   conspiracy theories.},

Abstract = {The 2008 global financial crisis, climate change, and, ultimately, the
   COVID pandemic have once again challenged the European Union's (EU)
   capacity to find effective policy solutions to common problems. The
   article investigates how the novel policy narrative underpinning the
   European Green Deal (EGD), a new EU growth strategy aimed at
   transforming the EU into a fair and prosperous society with no net
   greenhouse gas emissions, has evolved into concrete policy commitments.
   By combining the theoretical insights of the narrative policy framework
   and the assumptions of constructivist approaches to the study of
   politics, we focus on the relevance of strategic narratives for the
   understanding of power dynamics related to the approval of the EGD'
   center piece-the European Climate Law. Our findings show how, by
   effectively using legitimacy arguments, the European Commission and the
   Parliament managed to secure a swift approval of the Regulation.},

Abstract = {Large-scale military platform procurement is an essential but
   understudied component of the policy studies of megaprojects.
   Procurement decisions in this area, from ships to aircraft, are examples
   of a specific type of often very expensive purchases which feature
   complex multi-actor and multiyear processes characterized by high
   degrees of conflict between actors over purchases and planning horizons.
   This study of military procurement efforts of this type demonstrates the
   importance of maintaining policy `alignment' between governments and
   service providers for successful megaproject procurement to occur and
   suggests several strategies for accomplishing this that can be applied
   to similar large-scale but nondefense-related projects, ranging from
   hydroelectric dams to high-speed railway development.},

Abstract = {Although it is broadly accepted that neoliberalism emerged as a reaction
   to what its foundational thinkers believed was a crisis of modern
   liberalism, little work has been done to understand either the timing or
   the nature of the intellectual shift that gave rise to it. Through an
   assessment of Friedrich Hayek's thought, this article claims that the
   neoliberal critique of liberalism is primarily grounded in an
   epistemological dispute about the capabilities of mind that can be
   traced to the early nineteenth century and the development of Jeremy
   Bentham's universal principle of self-preference. Hayek's
   epistemological perspective, anchored in a theory of the understanding,
   and Bentham's conception of mind as plastic, knowable, measurable, and
   reformable, led each thinker to embrace vastly different constitutional
   models. This epistemological dispute is critical to grasp, not merely
   for historical precision, but also because many of its essential
   features lurk at the heart of contemporary debates about the rise of an
   anti-democratic neoliberalism, and the future of liberal democracy.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the limits and challenges of positive
   discrimination policies in the Afghan government (2001-2021). One of the
   primary objectives of the international community after the fall of the
   Taliban in 2001 was to bring Afghan women back into public service. The
   government adopted international and national policy frameworks in this
   direction, notably positive discrimination policies such as quotas. It
   set an objective of 30\% female participation in civil service by 2020.
   To analyze these policies' effectiveness and identify the challenges
   faced, we analyzed official documents setting the stage for a series of
   in-depth semi-structured interviews with female civil servants and
   women's rights activists. The study shows that the Afghan government
   failed to meet its objective. This was due to both institutional and
   non-institutional factors. These factors included the pervasiveness of
   sexual violence, discrimination, and corruption, and the impact of a
   traditional and patriarchal culture. These findings contribute to a
   better understanding of past policies. The article has important lessons
   for the study of mechanisms to promote women in government more widely.},

Title = {Security vs. civil liberties: How citizens cope with threat,
   restriction, and ideology},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JAN 18},
Abstract = {How do citizens balance their preferences for civil liberties and
   security in the context of a competitive party system? Using the case of
   terrorism and counter-terrorism, I argue that the willingness to support
   restrictions of civil liberties does not only depend on external shocks
   and being targeted by a counter-policy. Instead, it also depends on
   their ideological match with policymakers and terrorist actors. Using an
   original survey experiment conducted in Germany in 2022, I study how the
   four factors feeling threatened by a terrorist attack, being targeted by
   a surveillance measure, the ideology behind an attack, and the
   partisanship of counteracting politicians influence the attitudes of
   citizens and whether these factors are mutually dependent. While earlier
   research has focused on one kind of terrorism (mostly Islamic), this
   paper examines various forms of terrorism (religious, right-wing, and
   climate-radical) and how they affect peoples' attitudes toward civil
   liberties and surveillance. The results show that terrorist ideology
   plays a minor role, but that it matters whether citizens sympathize with
   the party that proposes a policy. The study extends our understanding of
   the political consequences of polarization, threat perceptions of
   terrorism, and public support for surveillance policies.},

Abstract = {Policy conflicts are ubiquitous in many countries. Yet research on
   policy conflict is typically based on cases in western, democratic
   countries. As a result, little is known about the characteristics of
   policy conflicts in non-western countries, such as China, or how these
   characteristics compare to western contexts. The Policy Conflict
   Framework (PCF) was recently developed to help scholars identify,
   diagnose, and compare policy conflict characteristics. This research
   uses the PCF to guide a comparative analysis of the nature of policy
   conflicts in China and the United States. With interview data on policy
   actors from Chongqing, China and Colorado, USA, we present the findings
   by comparing the differences and similarities of policy conflicts in the
   two countries around shale oil and gas development. We conclude with the
   strengths and limitations of this comparative study of policy conflicts
   in China and other national contexts, along with recommendations for
   conducting PCF research in China.},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {With the rising risk of complex crises and military escalation in the
   Pacific region, the United States should invite China into a process of
   nuclear restraint and confidence-building, which we call `nuclear
   stewardship'. This process could start with a joint bilateral
   declaration that neither superpower would use nuclear weapons first
   against the other or its formal allies. This would acknowledge that
   neither side could gain by striking first with a nuclear device. This
   declaration could be the leading edge of a broader set of discussions on
   strategic stability and eventual implementation of confidence-building
   measures designed to enhance mutual understanding and trust in the
   US-Chinese nuclear relationship.},

Journal = {SURVIVAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {65},

Pages = {115-128},

Abstract = {The United States and its partners have arrived at a critical crossroads
   in their relations with China - and with one another - in the realm of
   high technology. Some degree of high-tech decoupling between the two
   sides is already under way, and recent events suggest this trend is
   accelerating. Combined efforts to bolster their collective resilience in
   the face of China's rise remain inadequate. Going forward, much greater
   investment in resilience is required, including measures to absorb
   threatening Chinese actions and to adapt and transform in response to
   China's growing technological prowess. While this will call for
   considerable acumen and effort on the part of like-minded governments,
   greater resilience would afford them renewed solidarity and enriched
   opportunities to sustain technological leadership in the future.},

Abstract = {Measures to increase debt sustainability and related creditworthiness
   play an important role in sovereign fiscal policy. The establishing of
   fiscal rules delimits fiscal policy through specific limits for
   particular budget aggregates. Fiscal rules in Poland were analyzed
   against measures applied in European Union countries, with emphasis on
   changes due to COVID-19. Also differences in fiscal rules at the
   regional and local level in the United States, China, and Poland are
   described. Conclusions from the research lead to the identification of a
   relationship between the restrictiveness of the rules and possibilities
   to maintain budget balance and prevent excessive indebtedness. Important
   conclusions may be also drawn from different reactions for crisis in the
   fiscal rules area - from relaxing the rules to wide use of special fund
   or financial vehicles - which were crucial states reply to fiscal
   burdens.},

Pages = {82-98},
Abstract = {The values of Masaryk's ethics are connected with humanist ideals that
   apply to all of humanity and are therefore valid even when we depart
   from his idea of the `meaning of Czech history'. They are the ideals of
   actively promoting democracy and improving the organisation of society
   for the benefit of all its classes, while at the individual level
   presupposing an effort to improve oneself. The emphasis on equality of
   all people, and especially of women, makes his ethics relevant even in
   the twenty-first century. Philosophically, it is grounded in the ethics
   of emotion, especially David Hume, but it is also based on the religious
   imperative to love one's neighbour. As evidenced by his statements in
   university lectures and the final summaries given in interviews with
   Karel Capek, Masaryk's ethics presupposes that people are responsible
   for their own actions. In addition to the role of the individual,
   Masaryk is also aware of the importance of community, which for him
   means mainly family and nation. Masaryk considered emphasis on the
   national question to be a necessity of the times. He assumed equality of
   nations and foresaw the future creation of a unifying organisation, such
   as the United Nations.},

Abstract = {In this article, Norway's ambassador to the United Nations, Mona Juul,
   reflects on the work of the Security Council after Russia started its
   full-scale war on Ukraine 24 February 2022. This brutal and illegal war
   by a Security Council veto power against a sovereign neighbouring
   country is the most serious act of aggression on European soil since
   World War II. Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine, the black swan of
   Norway's fifth membership period of the UN Security Council in
   2021-2022, severely influenced the cooperation and dynamics among the
   Council members. There was a clear and present danger that the Council
   would be so polarised that its ability to fulfil its mandate of
   maintaining international peace and security would be jeopardised.
   Ambassador Juul provides an inside view on Norway's diplomacy after this
   geopolitical watershed moment: Was there any room for manoeuvring, and
   how did Norway, given the increased polarisation, contribute to keeping
   the Security Council functional as a decision-making body in several
   important files and dossiers?},

Abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to highlight an ethical dilemma at the
   intersection of civilian harm and military capabilities. We ask what
   level of risk may morally be demanded of soldiers fighting in urban
   areas if use of wide area effect explosive weapons is to be avoided? The
   challenge is that buildings conceal and protect while exposing advancing
   forces to ambush. Civilian presence constrains firepower. Nevertheless,
   as attackers suffer increasing casualties, they revert to explosive
   firepower from necessity, causing civilian casualties and reverberative
   harm. While not intentional, this foreseeable consequence of
   `wide-area-effect' explosive munitions presents a legal, moral and
   ethical challenge. Our paper explains why high explosive weapons have
   become the default and offers a legal overview before making an ethical
   comparison of `eviction' alternatives including flame and chemical
   weapons. We argue that a possible way out of this dilemma involves the
   use of weapons such as direct fire explosive weapons on buildings.},

Abstract = {In recent years several parts of Norwegian national security legislation
   has been strengthened. A key goal has been to improve the capacity for
   situational awareness and crisis management in the face of Russian or
   Chinese hybrid threats. This article takes a contemporary history
   approach to the develop-ment of Norwegian protective security in the
   decades since the end of the cold war. It shows how the reach of the
   state has been modified by competing pressures from changing threat
   assessments and the ambition of government reforms, economic
   liberalisation and internationalisation. Until 2014 security tended to
   take the back seat. The balance began to change following Russia's
   annexation of Crimea in 2014 and a renewed emphasis on great power
   rivalry. The article concludes that the juxtaposition of
   security-motivated state inter-vention and economic freedoms is not a
   puzzle to be solved, but rather a permanent balancing act. Consequently,
   the vulnerable edges of legislation, where state regulation ends, may be
   moved but not abolished.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article is to analyze to what extent regional
   cooperation and integration strategies helped strengthen Guyana,
   Suriname and French Guiana in international and regional geopolitics.
   Through bibliographical and documentary analysis, combined with field
   trips, a schematic periodization of regionalism processes is outlined to
   conclude that historical, geographical and cultural factors position
   these Guianas as an interface between different regions. Despite various
   challenges, Guyana and Suriname's presence in regional blocs intensify
   their political and economic ties and the French administration has
   expanded its outreach, collaborating with neighbors on common issues
   such as environment, security and infrastructure.},

Abstract = {In this article, Trojan deals with the challenge of positively
   integrating individuals in society. According to Trojan, the unity of
   life in Masaryk is a response to the rising specialisation of education
   aimed at preparing people for being able to be able to pursue various
   human activities. Trojan, together with Masaryk, contrasts life sub
   specie aeternitatis with the volatile and scattered mindset and
   lifestyle of contemporary people. Today, as in the past, one can only
   truly live when one has a rich inner life guided by a spiritual and
   moral compass.},

Abstract = {The war in Ukraine has had a marked economic impact. However, since
   Russia is a net producer of important commodities, the impact of
   sanctions on its economy was less than expected. But what would happen
   if there was a war involving a country that was a net importer of
   commodities? In the case of possible China-US conflict over Taiwan, the
   impact on the world economy would be different, with a deeper recession
   around the world, but the impact on the Brazilian economy would still be
   positive on account of the possibility that would remain of agricultural
   exports to China.},

Title = {Dual Use Deception: How Technology Shapes Cooperation in International
   Relations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {77},
Number = {3},
Pages = {599-632},
Abstract = {Almost all technology is dual use to some degree: it has both civilian
   and military applications. This feature creates a dilemma for
   cooperation. States can design arms control institutions to curtail
   costly competition over some military technology. But they also do not
   want to limit valuable civilian uses. How does the dual use nature of
   technology shape the prospects for cooperation? We argue that the
   duality of technology presents a challenge not by its very existence but
   rather through the ways it alters information constraints on the design
   of arms control institutions. We characterize variation in technology
   along two dual use dimensions: (1) the ease of distinguishing military
   from civilian uses; and (2) the degree of integration within military
   enterprises and the civilian economy. Distinguishability drives the
   level of monitoring needed to detect violations. When a weapon is
   indistinguishable from its civilian counterpart, states must improve
   detection though intelligence collection or intrusive inspections.
   Integration sharpens the costs of disclosing information to another
   state. For highly integrated technology, demonstrating compliance could
   expose information about other capabilities, increasing the security
   risks from espionage. Together, these dimensions generate expectations
   about the specific information problems states face as they try to
   devise agreements over various technologies. We introduce a new
   qualitative data set to assess both variables and their impact on
   cooperation across all modern armament technologies. The findings lend
   strong support for the theory. Efforts to control emerging technologies
   should consider how variation in the dual use attributes shapes this
   tension between detection and disclosure.},

Title = {The Election Effect: Democratic Leaders in Inter-Group Conflict},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {How does the experience of being elected alter subsequent leader
   behavior at the international level? We argue for the existence of an
   election effect, through which a democratic election intensifies
   in-group identification and generates a sense of obligation to voters,
   while simultaneously increasing out-group hostility. These combined
   effects cause leaders to overexert costly efforts in competitive
   situations against other groups. Using an online laboratory experiment,
   we show that democratic leader selection increases effort in inter-group
   contest games, which share key features with interstate conflicts. We
   use a carefully specified decomposition strategy to distinguish the
   election effect from better-known selection effects, wherein eventual
   leaders are nonrandomly chosen. Our results show that a democratic
   election has negative implications in inter-group games, despite the
   near-universally positive effects of democracy found in intra-group
   ones.
   Como altera la experiencia de ser elegido como lider el comportamiento
   posterior de este lider a nivel internacional? Argumentamos que existe
   un efecto electoral, a traves del cual la eleccion democratica
   intensifica la identificacion con aquellas personas que estan dentro de
   este grupo y genera un sentido de obligacion hacia los votantes, al
   mismo tiempo que aumenta la hostilidad hacia aquellos fuera de este
   grupo. Estos efectos combinados provocan que los lideres puedan ejercer
   costosos esfuerzos en situaciones competitivas contra otros grupos.
   Demostramos, mediante el uso un experimento de laboratorio en linea, que
   la seleccion de lideres democraticos aumenta el esfuerzo dentro de los
   juegos de competencia intergrupal, los cuales comparten caracteristicas
   clave con los conflictos interestatales. Utilizamos una estrategia de
   desglose cuidadosamente especificada con el fin de distinguir el efecto
   electoral de aquellos efectos de seleccion mas conocidos, en los que los
   lideres eventuales no son elegidos al azar. Nuestros resultados muestran
   que la eleccion democratica tiene implicaciones negativas en los juegos
   intergrupales, a pesar de los efectos positivos casi universales de la
   democracia que se pueden encontrar en los juegos intragrupales.
   Quel est l'effet d'une election sur le comportement du dirigeant
   nouvellement elu au niveau international ? Nous affirmons qu'il existe
   un effet election : une election democratique intensifie
   l'identification a l'interieur du groupe et genere un sentiment
   d'obligation envers les electeurs, tout en augmentant l'hostilite des
   personnes exterieures au groupe. La combinaison de ces effets pousse les
   dirigeants a employer des efforts couteux et demesures dans des
   situations concurrentielles face a d'autres groupes. A l'aide d'une
   experience de laboratoire en ligne, nous montrons que la selection d'un
   dirigeant democratique augmente les efforts au sein d'une competition
   interne au groupe, qui partage des caracteristiques cles avec les
   conflits interetatiques. Nous employons une strategie de decomposition
   aux regles precises pour distinguer l'effet election d'effets de
   selection mieux connus, par lesquels les dirigeants eventuels sont
   choisis de maniere non aleatoire. Nos resultats montrent que l'election
   democratique s'accompagne d'implications negatives dans les jeux
   internes au groupe, malgre les effets positifs quasiment universels de
   la democratie observes dans les jeux entre les groupes.},

Title = {Contextualizing the Contextualizers: How the Area Studies Controversy is
   Different in Different Places},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {As part of recent years' efforts at reaching a more context- and
   diversity-sensitive study of international relations, the nexus between
   fields of IR and Area Studies (AS) has received a renewed attention.
   While AS is usually presented as the ``contextualizer{''} of the
   disciplines, this forum reverses the perspective by suggesting that an
   awareness of both diversity and context is also relevant when it comes
   to understanding the evolution of the field of AS and its relations to
   IR. In this forum, a selection of scholars with diverse backgrounds (US,
   Middle East, Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Central Asia), different
   (inter)disciplinary trainings and regional orientations examines how
   various fields of AS and its relations to the disciplines vary, and what
   follows from a stronger attention to such kind of diversity. By
   contextualizing the contextualizers, the forum brings attention to how a
   context-sensitive field can also suffer from its own provincialism.
   While the US-centric narrative about AS might have been almost
   ``hegemonic,{''} at closer inspection, it turns out that AS in different
   (sub)disciplinary and geographical settings have evolved differently,
   and in some places the so-called Area Studies controversy (ASC) has been
   almost absent. A broadening of the perspective also reveals how the
   challenges to a successful cross-fertilization are not limited to those
   outlined in the ``classic{''} ASC, but the forum does simultaneously
   offer encouraging lessons on how dialogues between area specialists and
   discipline-oriented scholars can help to overcome epistemological,
   theoretical, or methodological blind spots. Rather than presenting the
   IR/AS nexus as a panacea per se, the aim of the forum is therefore to
   invite to a broader and more self-reflective discussion on some of the
   opportunities as well as challenges associated with this strategy for
   making the study of international relations more context-sensitive and
   attentive to different forms of diversity.
   El nexo existente entre los campos de las RRII y los Estudios de area
   (AS, por sus siglas en ingles) ha recibido una atencion renovada, como
   parte de los esfuerzos que se han llevado a cabo durante los ultimos
   anos para lograr que el estudio de las relaciones internacionales sea
   mas sensible al contexto y a la diversidad. Si bien los EA suelen
   presentarse como ``contextualizadores{''} de las diferentes disciplinas,
   este foro pretende invertir esta perspectiva sugiriendo que la
   conciencia, tanto en materia de la diversidad como en materia del
   contexto, tambien es relevante a la hora de comprender la evolucion del
   campo de los EA y sus relaciones con las RRII. En este foro, una
   seleccion de academicos de diversas procedencias (EE. UU., Oriente
   Medio, Europa, America Latina, africa, Asia Central), con diferentes
   formaciones (inter)disciplinarias y con orientaciones regionales,
   examina como varian los diversos campos de los EA, asi como sus
   relaciones con las disciplinas, y las consecuencias de prestar una mayor
   atencion a este tipo de diversidad. Por el hecho de contextualizar estos
   contextualizadores, el foro pone de manifiesto como incluso un campo
   sensible al contexto puede sufrir de su propio provincialismo. Si bien
   la narrativa en materia de EA centrada en los Estados Unidos podria
   haber llegado a ser casi ``hegemonica,{''} podemos observar, si se
   estudia mas de cerca, que los EA han evolucionado de manera diferente en
   diferentes entornos (sub)disciplinarios y geograficos, y que, en algunos
   lugares, la llamada controversia de los Estudios de area (ASC, por sus
   siglas en ingles) ha estado casi ausente. Una ampliacion de esta
   perspectiva tambien revela como los desafios para una retroalimentacion
   exitosa no se limitan a los que esboza la ASC ``clasica,{''} sino que el
   foro ofrece simultaneamente lecciones alentadoras sobre como los
   dialogos entre los especialistas de esta area y los academicos
   orientados a esta disciplina pueden ayudar a superar los puntos ciegos
   epistemologicos, teoricos o metodologicos. Por lo tanto, en lugar de
   presentar el nexo RRII/AS como una panacea per se, el objetivo del foro
   es invitar a un debate mas amplio y autorreflexivo sobre algunas de las
   oportunidades y de los desafios asociados con esta estrategia con el fin
   de conseguir que el estudio de las relaciones internacionales sea mas
   sensible al contexto y este mas atento a las diferentes formas de
   diversidad.
   Dans le cadre des efforts des dernieres annees en vue d'une etude des
   relations internationales plus sensible au contexte et a la diversite,
   les relations entre les domaines des RI et etudes regionales (ER) ont
   connu un regain d'interet. Bien que les ER soient generalement
   presentees comme le ``contextualisateur{''} des disciplines, ce forum
   inverse ce point de vue en suggerant qu'une sensibilisation a la
   diversite et au contexte est egalement pertinente pour comprendre
   l'evolution du domaine des ER et ses relations avec les RI. Dans ce
   forum, une selection de chercheurs aux profils varies (etats-Unis,
   Moyen-Orient, Europe, Amerique latine, Afrique, Asie centrale), aux
   differentes formations (inter)disciplinaires et orientations regionales
   s'interesse a comment divers domaines des ER et leurs relations avec les
   disciplines varient, et aux consequences d'un interet grandissant pour
   de telles formes de diversite. En contextualisant les
   contextualisateurs, le forum attire aussi l'attention sur comment un
   domaine sensible au contexte peut souffrir de son propre provincialisme.
   Bien que le recit centre sur les etats-Unis concernant les ER ait pu
   etre presque ``hegemonique{''}, en y regardant de plus pres, les ER dans
   differents contextes (sous-)disciplinaires et geographiques ont evolue
   differemment. A certains endroits, la soi-disant controverse des etudes
   regionales (CER) est pratiquement absente. Un elargissement du point de
   vue revele egalement que la reussite de la fertilisation croisee ne se
   limite pas a sa description dans les CER ``classiques{''}, mais le forum
   offre egalement des lecons encourageantes: le dialogue entre les
   specialistes du domaine et les chercheurs orientes vers la discipline
   peuvent permettre de surmonter les angles morts epistemologiques,
   theoriques et methodologiques. Plutot que de presenter les relations
   entre RI et ER comme une panacee en tant que telle, ce forum a donc pour
   but d'inviter a une discussion plus large, qui pousse a l'autoreflexion,
   quant a certaines opportunites et certains defis associes a cette
   strategie afin de rendre l'etude des relations internationales plus
   sensible au contexte et attentive a differentes formes de diversite.},

Abstract = {PurposeFor decades, conflict resolution (CR) educators working
   cross-culturally have struggled with a fundamental dilemma - whether to
   offer western, evidence-based approaches through a top-down
   (prescriptive) training process or to use a bottom-up (elicitive)
   strategy that builds on local cultural knowledge of effective in situ
   conflict management. This study aims to explore which conditions that
   prompted experienced CR instructors to use more prescriptive or
   elicitive approaches to such training in a foreign culture and the
   implications for training outcomes.Design/methodology/approachThere are
   two parts to this study. First, the authors conducted a literature
   review to identify basic conditions that might be conducive to
   conducting prescriptive or elicitive cross-cultural CR training. The
   authors then tested the identified conditions in a survey with
   experienced CR instructors to identify different conditions that
   afforded prescriptive or elicitive approaches. Exploratory factor
   analysis and regression were used to assess which conditions determined
   whether a prescriptive or elicitive approach produced better
   outcomes.FindingsIn general, although prescriptive methods were found to
   be more efficient, elicitive methods produced more effective, culturally
   appropriate, sustainable and culturally sensitive training. Results
   revealed a variety of instructor, participant and contextual factors
   that influenced whether a prescriptive or elicitive approach was applied
   and found to be more suitable.Originality/valueThis study used empirical
   survey data with practicing experts to provide insight and guidance into
   when to use different approaches to CC-CR training effectively.},

Abstract = {When state armed forces engage in violence against civilians during
   civil wars, why do some citizens continue to support the government? I
   argue that individuals' support for the state in such contexts is shaped
   by the interplay between their perceptions of violence, governance and
   ideology. Drawing on research concerning motivated reasoning, I suggest
   that ideological similarity with and effective governance from the state
   can alleviate the negative effect of military violence against civilians
   on support for the state and, conversely, augment the positive effect of
   insurgent abuse on attitudes toward the government. Analysis of seven
   years of surveys fielded by the Latin American Public Opinion Project in
   Colombia between 2005 and 2011 suggests that individuals' responses to
   victimization by the state's armed forces depend on whether the
   individuals are ideologically aligned with the state. More specifically,
   among people who have an ideology similar to that of the president,
   military victimization has a less negative effect on support for the
   armed forces and for the national government. There is also mixed
   evidence that the quality of state governance, particularly the
   provision of security from crime, shapes the ways people respond to
   victimization. While existing studies primarily focus on the effects of
   either violence or governance on attitudes toward the state, these
   findings indicate that a more complete theory of why people support
   governments which engage in violence against civilians requires an
   understanding of not only violence but also of governance and ideology.},

Abstract = {It is widely recognised in contemporary peace and conflict scholarship
   that exploring micro-level experiences is important for a fuller and
   more nuanced understanding of the forms of peace that emerge post-war.
   In this article, we argue that such inquiry might be particularly urgent
   in the context of a victor's peace. Much research on victor's peace
   focus on the state and macro level and seldom account for the outcome
   across local contexts. Based on focus group discussions conducted across
   communities and geographical localities in Sri Lanka, we explore and
   compare narratives of peace in order to elucidate plural understandings,
   experiences and visions. The study moves beyond the dichotomous peace
   conceptions often associated with the notion of victor's peace and
   provides insights into varieties of peace at the local and everyday
   level, and into challenges and possibilities for transforming conflict
   relationships post-war.},

Abstract = {The anti-colonial interpretation of the right to self-determination has
   affected the minorities' autonomy struggles in China and Nepal. The
   Tibetans in China and the Madheshis in Nepal urge their governments to
   recognise their self-determination through autonomy. However, the
   Chinese and Nepalese governments interpret self-determination as the
   right to independence and hesitate to provide autonomy. Against this
   background, this paper examines the following question: How has the
   anti-colonial interpretation of self-determination determined the
   response of the Nepalese and Chinese governments to ethnic autonomy? It
   argues that the anti-colonial interpretation has encouraged the Chinese
   and Nepalese governments to consider autonomy as the other name for
   self-determination that has independence as its goal. This perception
   leads these Asian governments to reject ethnic autonomy. These
   governments thus i) question the sincerity of nationalist movements, ii)
   refuse the ethnonational narratives of identities and belongingness, and
   iii) provide limited autonomy.},

Abstract = {How does spatial interdependence between countries affect domestic
   levels of repression? The current literature on state repression focuses
   on unit-level/common shocks explanations and treats countries'
   interdependence as a statistical nuisance. This article relaxes the null
   hypothesis of policy independence in state repression and examines the
   theoretical and empirical implications of spatial interdependence in the
   democracy-repression nexus. Combining spatial-econometric analysis with
   latent measures of democracy and repression in 138 countries between
   1947 and 2007, the article shows that (1) there is a robust diffusion
   effect of repression at a regional level, (2) previous literature has
   overestimated the suppressing effect of democracy (when spatial
   interdependence is not accounted for), and (3) trade relations and
   security alliances are the main drivers of regional diffusion of
   repression.},

Abstract = {The rise of economic inequality and right-wing populism in the last
   three decades has produced a lively debate about the relationship
   between democracy and advanced capitalism. A prominent view is that the
   troubles are rooted in the growing power of global capital and the rich,
   first reflected in the broad sweep of neoliberal reforms in the 1980s
   and `90s. This view is a story about capitalism subverting democracy.
   This piece instead argues that it was democracy that transformed
   capitalism, and that this transformation laid the foundation for
   unprecedented prosperity. Yet it also unleashed inequalizing economic
   and political dynamics that are now proving difficult to reverse.},

Title = {Politics versus Preparedness? How Electoral Incentives Affect the
   Provision of Local Disaster Public Goods in the Philippines},
Journal = {PHILIPPINE POLITICAL SCIENCE JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {274-306},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There is an expectation that elections create responsive policymakers
   that provide optimal public services. However, does this hold true when
   it comes to nonparticularistic and non-immediate goods like disaster
   preparedness projects? In this exploratory study, I argue that electoral
   incentives can discourage the provision of local disaster public goods
   due to their non-particularistic and non-immediate nature. Using
   datasets containing electoral data and government ratings of local
   disaster public goods in Philippine cities and municipalities from 2017
   to 2021, I find evidence that local disaster public goods provision is
   affected by (1) the intensity of local electoral competition and (2) the
   timing of the elections. Estimates suggest that local disaster public
   goods decline in quality one year before elections. Furthermore, in
   municipalities, more intense electoral competition is linked to lower
   quality provision of these collective goods. The findings illustrate how
   electoral incentives distort leaders' policymaking against their
   constituencies' long-term, common needs.},

Abstract = {Debates about accountability in cyberspace are dominated by
   state-centric and security-driven approaches that disregard the
   complexity of the institutional ecosystem in cyberspace and the diverse
   ways through which different stakeholder groups may pursue
   accountability. Such an approach has contributed to a flawed
   interpretation of accountability in cyberspace as applicable solely to
   malicious actors who need to be punished for their actions. Despite
   greater policy and research attention to this line of reasoning, holding
   states accountable for their behaviour has yielded limited results due
   to the legal, political and technical complexities. At the same time,
   the non-malicious activities in cyberspace that might have unintended
   negative effects remain exempted from scrutiny. Cyber capacity-building
   activities, which aim at supporting governments and societies in
   strengthening their cyber resilience, illustrate this point well. This
   article introduces the concept of positive accountability to describe
   accountability for actions that are not malicious in their intent. It
   argues that the anticipatory potential of mechanisms like deliberation,
   joint problem-solving, interactive learning and competition plays an
   important role in strengthening accountability by eliminating or
   minimising any unintended or undesired spillovers. It concludes with a
   proposal that broadly defined capacity building might also be considered
   a form of anticipatory and deliberative accountability mechanism.},

Abstract = {Cyberspace has brought significant technological innovations and
   benefits, but also new legal and political challenges. It created a `new
   geography', where traditional physical borders co-exist with virtual
   space, posing novel security threats that complement conventional
   understandings of security. The resulting `cyberspace geopolitics'
   comprises multiple actors that are increasingly in competition and
   conflict with each other. This article explores the implications of
   these developments for the European Union (EU) and its changing approach
   to the governance of this human-made Global Space. It argues that the
   approach that the EU has taken in recent years positions it in the
   direction of a more traditional geopolitical player. This means that the
   EU faces the challenge of upholding the promotion of norms, in line with
   its normative identity, while developing coercive mechanisms able to
   deal with geopolitical threats.},

Abstract = {Academics and state officials over the years have put forth a host of
   factors to explain armed insurrections in Turkey since the 1920s. From
   `religious reactionaries' and `underdevelopment' to `foreign
   intervention,' `economic inequality' and `identity-based grievances.'
   What sort of explanation one subscribes to generally seems to depend on
   either one's politics or simply which analysis sounds most plausible and
   convincing. This study looks for evidence from the insurrections in
   Turkey to help shed more light on the issue. We examine the stated
   demands and grievances of the rebels fighting the Turkish state in the
   major uprisings of the twentieth century (1925, 1927-1930, 1937 and 1978
   onwards). Judging from their own statements, the recognition of Kurdish
   identity was central to all these episodes. No other issue appears so
   prominently in all the uprisings. The study then turns to theoretical
   work on protracted conflicts and ethnic conflicts to explain why
   identity recognition is of such importance. Following this analysis,
   parameters to resolve the Kurdish conflict in Turkey are examined in
   light of these observations. Solutions to end the conflict need to begin
   first and foremost with official identity recognition and acceptance of
   the Kurds, as Kurds. The rest consists of issues to be negotiated.},

Abstract = {PurposeIn 2017, the opioid epidemic was declared a public health
   emergency in the United States. The federal and state governments are
   still struggling to contain the crisis through various legislations and
   to stem the tide of overdoses and deaths. This paper looks specifically
   at the issue of high prescriptions of opioids disbursed to patients by
   physicians.Design/methodology/approachThis paper evaluates this evolving
   policy issue through a critical review and synthesis of academic
   literature, government policy documents (at states and national levels)
   and articles in the popular press.FindingsOver-prescription is a legal
   problem because it inevitably leads to diversion of these substances for
   non-medical usage. The Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) laws
   have been passed by all 50 states and the main policy responses are
   covered. However, there are hindrances to their effectiveness, which
   have to be addressed. Two state level policy alternatives are discussed
   as potential solutions - PDMP mandates and Pain Management Clinic Laws
   (PMCLs). After a comparative evaluation, it is recommended that all
   states should pass the mandatory PDMP review and usage laws
   urgently.Originality/valueThis is the first detailed policy evaluation
   on the specific and time-sensitive aspect of physician over-prescribing,
   within the larger opioid abuse problem. Moreover, critique on the public
   health leadership issue is raised.},

   mapping and explaining economic ideas in the European Semester 2011-2022},

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine how and why the European Commission's ideas on
   fiscal policy have changed over the course of the European Semester.
   Empirically, we rely on a semi-supervised scaling approach to identify
   economic ideas as they appear in Semester documents from the aftermath
   of the financial crisis onwards (2011-2022). Our findings demonstrate a
   gradual shift in ideas from an ordoliberal to a Keynesian direction,
   especially during the overlapping Von der Leyen and Covid-19 crisis
   years. We identify substantial country-specific differences throughout
   2011-2022, with some countries receiving exclusively Keynesian
   recommendations, and others distinctively ordoliberal ones. These
   patterns can be explained in part by economic conditions in those member
   states but not by the public's trust in the EU. These results underscore
   the reactive nature of the Commission's economic ideology; crises, as
   well as member states' economic conditions, shape the direction of its
   fiscal policy recommendations.},

Abstract = {Scholars have attempted to theorise the social structure of the
   international system from the perspective of the `middle powers' for
   decades. However, scholars have struggled to agree on the essential
   dispositional characteristics of this category of actors, stunting
   theoretical progress. Drawing on sociological and literary approaches to
   the rhetoric of the `middle class' in domestic societies, this article
   shifts the terms of this debate away from asking who the `middle powers'
   are or what their `essence' is, to ask what actors do with the term in
   practice. Combining this with and contributing to scholarship on
   hierarchy in international relations, I recast `middle powers' as a
   category of practice and argue that one of the term's main uses is to
   differentiate certain status-anxious states - that hold no real prospect
   of achieving great power status - from `small states' that occupy the
   lowest stratum of stratification within the `grading of powers'.
   Following an illustrative case study of Australian and Canadian attempts
   to establish the `middle power' category in the 1940s, the article then
   outlines the contributions of the argument for the study of status and
   hierarchy in world politics.},

Abstract = {Strategic narratives have become an important tool with which states
   define their geopolitical reality and shape the types of foreign policy
   decisions that emerge. In order to build a more favourable international
   environment, China has deployed substantial resources to disseminate its
   strategic narratives and communicate its role, identity and vision and
   legitimise Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rule. Despite the obvious
   importance of narratives on conflict and global security, remarkably few
   studies have examined China's strategic narratives on security-related
   issues. This article marks the first systematic effort to map out
   China's strategic narratives in the context of the ongoing conflict in
   Ukraine. Based on a corpus linguistics approach and qualitative content
   analysis, the findings reveal that China does not project itself as a
   neutral player and that its strategic narratives often echo Russia's
   portrayal of the Ukrainian war. However, the analysis also highlights
   China's efforts to maintain its distance from Russia while presenting
   itself against the backdrop of the US/West-Russian rivalry as an
   equidistant player belonging to the wider international community as
   well as the most suitable actor to manage a peaceful global order.},

Abstract = {The organizational theory approach to public administration emphasizes
   that organizational features of public bureaucracies shape civil
   servants' role perceptions and opinions. This study brings forward a
   novel refinement of this theoretical framework by arguing that such
   processes of organizational resocialization require intertemporal
   consistency of the organizational environment. We empirically test this
   proposition by combining individual-level longitudinal data from a panel
   of Norwegian civil servants (1986-2016; N approximate to 375) with
   information about organizational changes in ministerial structures since
   1945. Using individuals' task portfolio as our main organizational
   ``influencer{''} of interest, we confirm that the impact of individuals'
   task portfolio on their role perceptions only strengthens over time for
   individuals working in ministries with a high level of organizational
   stability. This finding adds an important scope condition-namely,
   intertemporal stability-to the traditional organizational theory
   argument about what shapes civil servants' role perceptions and
   opinions.},

Abstract = {Why do some governments subsidize gasoline consumption, despite its very
   high economic and environmental costs? We answer this question by
   examining how a state's political regime and level of institutional
   capacity jointly determine its level of fossil fuel price distortion. We
   find that, without sufficient institutional capacity, democratic regimes
   do not necessarily provide less fuel subsidies, as those governments are
   unable to pursue other more efficient welfare policies. Using data on
   monthly domestic gasoline prices from 2003 to 2015, we demonstrate that
   democratic governments with high institutional capacity are less likely
   to control domestic gasoline prices. Democratic institutions and strong
   institutional capacity jointly mitigate the effect of the benchmark oil
   price increases on the domestic price. These results suggest that the
   combination of motive (democratic accountability) and means
   (institutional capacity) can help countries avoid inefficient subsidy
   policies.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the extent to which the European Union (EU)
   contributes to the governance of Global Spaces by exploring its policies
   towards the maritime domain. In a more competitive and uncertain
   geopolitical setting, are the EU's policies changing and becoming more
   strategic? Or does the EU continue to promote multilateral cooperation
   and regulation of the maritime Global Space, and if so, what type of
   governance regimes does it promote? Developing and applying three
   analytical models of Global Space policies, the article finds that the
   EU has been consistent in its approach, which reflects a combination of
   its strong interest in free navigation and an attempt to achieve
   sustainable growth through climate regulation. Despite more geopolitical
   conflict in these areas and in international relations more broadly, the
   EU's approach to the maritime Global Space is to promote international
   governance regimes.},

   was presented as a cross-sectorial strategy aiming to `transform the
   European economy'. Our analysis focuses on two specific policy proposals
   of the EGD: the carbon border adjustment mechanism and the reform for a
   greener Common Agricultural Policy. By comparing their discourse network
   structure, we aim to understand policy (dis)continuity introduced with
   the EGD. We use an original longitudinal dataset and discourse network
   analysis to map framing dynamics over time and understand how particular
   frames can gather support in policy networks. Our study shows that two
   elements favor policy change, namely the resonance of new frames with
   the discursive field and the presence of brokers connecting previously
   disconnected actors or coalitions. This paper is relevant for scholars
   interested in the discursive layer of policy networks as well as
   (dis)continuity in policy debates.},

Abstract = {Why do executive agencies form coalitions? Legislative coalitions are
   widely theorized and studied, but less attention has been paid to
   executive coalitions. Executive agencies' dependence on the political
   branches calls for a distinctive theory of coalition building. This
   article presents such a theory, arguing that agencies form coalitions to
   optimize their autonomy given their subordinate position in a separation
   of powers system by signaling to overseers that their policies are
   efficient and should be maintained. Bureaucrats form coalitions actively
   to advance their policy goals in the face of political opposition. Using
   data on dozens of agencies over seventeen years, I find that agencies
   are most likely to form coalitions when their preferences are misaligned
   with the president but aligned with each other. I also find evidence
   that coalitions send credible signals that bureaucratic policies are
   efficient since Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs is less
   likely to request regulatory revisions of policies produced by
   coalitions.},

Abstract = {Organizational ties between political parties and interest groups are
   common in contemporary democracies, but little is known about the
   political effects of such ties. This article examines whether the
   strength of organizational ties between parties and interest groups
   affects the probability of (1) interest group influence on parties, (2)
   party influence on interest groups, and (3) mutual party-interest group
   influence in decision-making. Using novel interest group survey data
   from six democracies, we are the first to systematically examine the
   relationship between organizational ties and perceived and attributed
   influence across multiple policy areas. The findings indicate that
   one-sided influence is more likely when the actors have stronger ties
   but that such ties also increase the likelihood of influence going both
   ways. Close party-interest group relationships hence likely involve
   give-and-take across policy issues. These findings shed important new
   light on the role of parties and interest groups as intermediaries in
   democracies.},

Abstract = {When the European Union is not in active crisis, do we characterise it
   as experiencing a period of stability? What can scholars learn by
   studying the EU as it toggles in between the two? This special issue
   presents some of the best papers from the European Union Studies
   Association's 2022 conference in Miami, Florida. Two themes structure
   this collection. First, by temporally and conceptually locating the EU
   between stability and crisis, we see these contributions on EU policy,
   institutional evolution, financial resilience, and identity formation as
   a substantive reflection of the variety of emergent and ongoing
   challenges that comprise everyday uncertainty. Second, in showcasing
   contributions that study the EU in a variety of ways - as both a
   political actor and context, or site, of politics, this special issue
   aims to encourage a widening of the EU studies field.},

Title = {Pathways to develop state capacity in a weak state: the sub-national

Abstract = {This article aims to unravel how a weak state develops state capacity -
   an aspect hitherto ignored in mainstream literature. This is a study of
   a sub-national case of Bihar in India. Historically, Bihar is considered
   a weak state, lacking state capacity. Yet, improvements have occurred in
   recent decades. By profiling two areas of improved outcomes:
   infrastructure (roads and bridges) and welfare (distribution of bicycles
   to school-going girls), the article argues that the improvements are the
   outcome of the political and bureaucratic elite's ideas and political
   will. The case of Bihar shows that the rationalities within a state
   depend on social learning, puzzling, and powering, having a powerful
   impact on policy paradigms even in weak states.},

Abstract = {The objective of this quantitative study was to examine the impact of
   selected factors on the level and state of public health capacities in
   local self-government units in 2021. This survey included 77 out of 145
   local self-government units in the Republic of Serbia and examined six
   dimensions defined by the Law on Public Health. The results of the
   Pearson correlation showed that there were statistically significant
   correlations between the effectiveness of the realized program budget
   and microbiologically defective drinking water samples from the
   so-called village water supply systems, defective samples of drinking
   water from public taps, unsatisfactory analyses of wastewater samples,
   and the number of mandated fines issued. The results of the logistic
   regression model showed that the local self-government units that
   received assistance from the Standing Conference of Towns and
   Municipalities were 5.6 times more likely to perform analyses of their
   health status.},

Abstract = {The article seeks to analyse the phenomenon of Slovenian regionalisation
   (province) and the names of individual regions, which are still part of
   the heritage and identity of individuals living in the areas of each
   region (province). What are the reasons for the formation of the names?
   Common sense is that province expansion refers to all measures to
   improve and standardise a specific area's legal and economic structure.
   Economic and legal reasons dictated the name; the name was only an
   address for the recipient of economic and legal privileges (rights). In
   other words, the expansion of the province (region) concerned the
   ``constitution{''} of a country in the double sense of ``being legally
   ordered{''} (legal culture) and ``actually being composed{''}
   (administrative culture).},

Abstract = {This research aims to analyze the application and normalization of the
   Osing indigenous people's customary law model in the Indonesian legal
   system. It discusses whether or not local wisdom as unwritten laws can
   be applied as guidelines in establishing the legal system in Indonesia.
   This research used the socio-legal method that views the law as how it
   is applied or how the law lives in society. Results show that people's
   plural socio-cultural values contained in well-preserved local wisdom,
   including those of Osing indigenous people in Banyuwangi, are often
   unwritten. Some view the importance of normalizing customary laws with

Abstract = {During the course of the war in Ukraine, various actors have employed a
   unique type of deterrence by denial: namely, the threat to deliver arms.
   NATO leaders have committed-through rhetoric and deeds-to continue to
   deliver weapons to Ukraine if Russia escalated the war in order to deny
   Russian success. Not only is this type of strategy undertheorized, but
   it also challenges the distinction between direct and extended
   deterrence that has been central to deterrence scholarship. In
   deterrence by delivery of arms, the patron deters not by threatening to
   fight or deploy forces, but by committing to send weapons. However, the
   strategy also requires the protege's ability to fight. Studying
   deterrence by delivery of arms opens up understudied areas of deterrence
   (by denial), and provides a useful opportunity to consider how prominent
   concepts contribute to the research but also at times limit it.},

Abstract = {This article theorizes and tests how different types of interstate
   conflict across borders affect trade between disputing parties and trade
   diversion with third parties. Building on theories of borders as
   institutions, we differentiate the effects of two types of international
   disputes - border disputes and escalated militarized disputes - and draw
   on 60 years of trade and conflict data to test the effects of these
   disputes on bilateral and third-party trade flows. We find that border
   disputes and militarized disputes each depress trade flows between the
   disputing countries. However, legal border disputes are associated with
   increased trade diversion with non-disputing countries, which may fully
   offset the forgone bilateral trade, whereas militarized disputes have
   the opposite effect. These results show that actors engaged in trade can
   offset bilateral trade losses from a border dispute by expanding trade
   with third parties not involved in the dispute, but the same cannot be
   said of offsetting the losses from militarized disputes. The fact that
   border disputes and militarized disputes have opposite effects on trade
   diversion highlights the importance of examining both the type of
   dispute and the type of trade flows that are affected when studying
   conflict and trade and evaluating the potentially pacifying incentives
   of international trade.},

Abstract = {Knowledge production is one of the most important elements of human
   interaction. It shapes identities, determines policies, and reflects the
   understanding of borders and geographies. For instance, how Europe and
   the MENA region perceive one another depends largely on who creates the
   discourse, and under which disciplines these discourses are elaborated.
   For centuries, however, discourse creation has been regulated by
   neoliberal and patriarchal interests. Such (super-)structures frame how
   these regions are represented, leading to colonial assumptions, biased
   knowledge and objectifying research. We argue that knowledge of Europe
   and the MENA, its creation and diffusion should be critical and
   horizontal practices, moving towards deterritorialization and
   decolonisation. Not to succumb to a `regional' hierarchy of global
   North/South, we need to reflect on the positioning of researchers,
   acknowledging the liminality of identities, to appreciate the dynamic
   nature of boundaries, and to revisit various elements of knowledge
   production as language, freedom of movement, and funding.},

Abstract = {Little is known about civil war settlements' effects on public opinion
   in countries emerging from conflict, cases in which beliefs in agreement
   fairness and trust in political authorities may influence acceptance of
   the peace process. We posit that settlements designed to redistribute
   power and resources will be perceived as fairer and produce larger
   improvements in trust in the national government for individuals from
   marginalized groups than for those from dominant groups. Employing
   original survey data collected in the Philippines, we test these
   propositions with reference to the country's 2014 peace agreement. We
   find that marginalized Muslim groups perceive a fairer peace agreement
   and report improved trust in comparison to the dominant Christian
   community. Using a survey experiment to analyze the influence of
   power-redistributing settlement measures, we find that trust in the
   government is not significantly affected by information regarding power
   sharing, a result that holds for members of both communities.},

Abstract = {Quantitative approaches to conflict research are evolving to incorporate
   better theoretical, methodical, and dataset tools. One key area where
   our progress is especially limited relates to the social origins of
   rebel groups: how a group's political identity emerges as a focal point
   for mobilization and future conflict behaviors. We benchmark two key
   empirical agendas in civil war and rebellion research and then discuss
   key contributions of this special issue. In bringing together multiple
   theoretical perspectives and original datasets, including the
   individual-level and group-level data, the contributions to this special
   feature push the research frontier further along these lines. Jointly,
   they demonstrate that a rebel group's origins - where it comes from, who
   are its constituents, what is its political appeal, and how it organizes
   - have far-reaching implications to explanations along different
   dimensions and across a wide range of contexts and regions.},

Abstract = {States enact relations with both important partners and seemingly
   irrelevant countries. The non-strategic constitutes the larger set; a
   histogram could visualize them in a long-tailed distribution, with the
   x-axis denoting the partner countries, and the y-axis showing the
   interaction density. Investigating the function of this long tail, this
   paper premises that the international is characterized by complexity,
   meaning that the number of elements is so large that it is impossible to
   realize all relations simultaneously. States thus select their
   diplomatic partners based on power-rationales. The thereby inactive
   nodes nevertheless pose sources of danger, requiring occasional signals
   of amity-hence a long tail comes about. A repertoire of cheap and quick
   but unambiguously sovereign practices (such as Twiplomacy, gifts, or
   honorary consulates) can be spontaneously activated to fill otherwise
   neglected inter-state ties. Seemingly trivial gestures thus ensure peace
   among plural polities under the constraint of systemic complexity.},

Abstract = {Do basic administrative arrangements in the national public sector
   affect the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and if so, how?
   AMR, one of humanity's most pressing challenges according to the World
   Health Organization, is typically caused by factors inherent to the
   natural sciences. In this paper, however, we investigate the indirect
   causal effect of politics and administration on the management of AMR.
   In a mixed-methodological approach drawing on a panel regression
   combined with 46 semi-structured interviews with senior bureaucrats and
   experts from all member states of the European Union (EU), we derive
   four distinct clusters of countries in AMR governance. The analysis
   shows that politico-administrative arrangements in the EU follow a
   north-to-south and east-to-west pattern in the prevalence of AMR. We
   apply institutional theories of path dependency and administrative
   autonomy to explain such `worlds' of AMR governance.},

Abstract = {Despite the universal implications of nuclear weapons for humanity,
   broad knowledge of nuclear policy is curiously absent from the public
   sphere and even among many senior figures in government. Nuclear
   strategists have nourished the belief that the principles of nuclear
   deterrence are so esoteric as to exempt them from non-expert scrutiny,
   creating an intellectual vacuum within which a number of fallacies about
   nuclear strategy have taken root. These fallacies in turn find
   expression in the configuration of several states' nuclear postures,
   from the number of warheads posited as necessary for deterrence to the
   selection of adversary targets. Puncturing the myth of complexity that
   surrounds nuclear policy is a necessary starting point to assess its
   more questionable features. This essay evaluates some of the prevailing
   tenets of nuclear strategy to expose for non-experts the many
   misconceptions that shape the major powers' strategic postures.},

Abstract = {The article examines how Israel related to the threat that Hamas posed
   to the peace process, both during the talks that led to the signing of
   the Declaration of Principles (December 1992-September 1993) and then
   until the signing of the Oslo 2 agreement (September 1995). The Israeli
   negotiators and leaders were locked into the idea that the PLO would
   ``deal with Hamas{''} because of its clear interest to do so. During the
   talks, however, there was no detailed discussion of the matter. Instead,
   the negotiators focused-and with full justification-on the important
   achievement of an accord with the PLO and its agreement to refrain from
   terrorism. This, reinforced by the assumption that the PLO would
   suppress Hamas, paved the way for the signing of the Declaration of
   Principles without any concrete attention to Hamas. Thus Hamas terrorism
   proved to be a major obstacle to the fulfillment of the Oslo Accords.
   Hamas bomb attacks killed many Israelis and undermined Israelis' faith
   in the process. In parallel, the IDF activity to thwart Hamas, which
   involved major operations on the ground, as well as the accords' failure
   to produce an economic upturn for the Palestinians, diminished their
   support for the agreement.},

Abstract = {As the international community attempts to unite to combat climate
   change, American party politics could hardly be more divided on this
   issue. This paper offers an additional explanation for how US
   congressional politics on environmental policy has polarized: the
   ongoing education realignment in American party politics. As the
   Democratic Party increasingly relies on college-educated voters and the
   opposite is true for the Republican Party, this can affect the parties'
   positions on environmental policy based on public opinion research which
   finds a positive relationship between education and pro-environment
   attitudes. Using League of Conservation Voters legislative scorecards
   from 1983 to 2020, this paper finds the education realignment
   contributed to the removal of pro-environment Republicans and
   anti-environment Democrats in Congress in recent decades; and this
   primarily occurred through elite replacement rather than conversion.},

Abstract = {Aliaksandr Lukashenka pushed through an overhaul of Belarus's
   constitution as a response to the protests against the official results
   of the 2020 presidential election. The goal was to address the desire
   for change among the population without reacting to the demand for snap
   elections. With the February 2022 constitutional plebiscite on the most
   far-ranging changes to Belarus's constitution since 1994, Lukashenka
   further entrenched himself in power. The results of our online survey
   suggest that the constitutional changes do not meet the broad societal
   demand for political change and, in particular, for constraints on
   presidential power. Despite the persistence of the political conflict,
   we also show that Lukashenka's supporters and opponents are not
   irreconcilably polarized in every policy domain. Finally, our results
   suggest that regime supporters have stronger anti-democratic preferences
   than opposition supporters when it comes to future political
   participation of the two camps, making the effects of affective
   polarization highly asymmetrical.},

Abstract = {Governments around the world have instrumentalised the idea of cities as
   innovation hubs in the drive for economic competitiveness and governance
   of anticipated futures. Producers of global indicators have identified
   cities as key actors in the global competition for talent - a race for
   human capital taking place against rapid technological changes, and
   political and social disruptions. In this article, we examine the rise
   of global cities as innovation hubs and its role in tackling global
   challenges. Using qualitative content analysis and conceptual analysis
   of strategies from rival cities in Europe (Amsterdam vs Copenhagen) and
   Asia (Singapore vs Hong Kong), we unpack how future cities are
   articulated and constructed in the nexus of migration and knowledge
   policy. We find that global indicators are actively used to produce more
   `robust futures' that shape policymaking and strategies of cities while
   delimiting alternatives and potential `creative future visions' in
   addressing global challenges.},

Abstract = {A growing literature on diffusion shows that ideas, policies and
   institutions originating in the European Union shape decision-making in
   other regional organisations (ROs). However, a research programme which
   claims to examine processes of interdependent decision-making between
   ROs in general cannot treat a single RO as the `default' source of this
   diffusion. This paper thus (1) discusses what we term the `multiple
   sources' problem in diffusion research and (2) presents a model of
   institutional diffusion, which highlights the important role of local
   actors in the multiple sources scenario. Based on original data
   collected via extensive fieldwork in East Africa, we present a case
   study on the interdependent sources behind the East African Community
   (EAC)'s establishment in drawing on this model. We find that EAC
   policymakers selected between, combined and modified several external
   institutions. These findings highlight local actors' capacity for
   institutional innovation.},

Abstract = {Vladimir Putin has numerous times claimed that `Ukrainians and Russians
   are one people'; this was part of the legitimation for the attack on
   Ukraine in February 2022. This article examines the prehistory of this
   claim in Russian nationalist thinking both in recent times and in the
   tsarist era. It is argued that the claim differs from and is more
   sinister than the pre-revolutionary idea of a `triune Russian nation'
   consisting of Great Russians, Little Russians ( = Ukrainians) and
   Belarussians, for the simple reason that the term `Russians' (russkie)
   does not refer to the same group of people in the two contexts.},

Abstract = {Achieving sustainable development is an important goal for China's
   economic transformation to high-quality development. Using the city-year
   panel data and constructing a green total factor productivity (GTFP)
   indicator, we implement the idea of an ``event study{''} to explore the
   impact of official turnover on sustainable development in China. The
   results, supported by a series of robustness tests, show that official
   turnover significantly contributes to sustainable development.
   Furthermore, official turnover mainly promotes sustainable development
   through the deterrent effect and reducing government construction
   investment; the turnover of highly educated, local, promoted, and
   experienced officials could better promote sustainable development.
   These findings shed new light on the determinants of sustainable
   development and suggest that local official turnover plays an important
   role in China's high-quality development.},

Abstract = {For centuries, coal extraction and production provided low-cost energy
   that powered the American economy. Currently, an estimated 5.5 million
   people in the Appalachian region live within one mile of an Abandoned
   Mine Land (AML) site. The site remediation has been funded and promoted
   by the AML program under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act
   (SMCRA) of 1977, and public engagement has been required. However,
   little is known about the AML program and the public engagement
   requirement for site remediation decision-making. Relying on State and
   Tribal Reclamation Plans and community surveys, we investigate how AML
   states and tribes engage the public and which barriers limit successful
   participation in the AML program. We found that AML states and tribes
   rely heavily on traditional methods of public engagement, such as public
   meetings, hearings, and comment periods, rather than nontraditional
   methods that could include more diverse stakeholders. We also found (1)
   lack of information on public participation opportunities and (2)
   unclear project selection and awards processes as key barriers limiting
   public engagement. Three recommendations specific to AML program are
   suggested.},

Abstract = {Decades of research demonstrates that minoritized groups are
   disproportionately affected by swathes of harmful pollutants, including
   air pollution, even controlling for low income. Would significantly
   reducing individual car traffic help reduce the EJ gap? The systemic
   shock of the COVID-19 economic shutdown, with accompanied reduction in
   car use, can be exploited to analyze this question. Kerr and colleagues
   ask this question for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), use satellite data and
   categorical differences, and find that majority-minoritized tracts on
   average benefited more from the shutdown, but the least-White tracts
   still were significantly worse off than the most-White tracts. We
   further explore this question for PM2.5, one of the most harmful air
   pollutants, using Geographic Information System (GIS) methods to combine
   several different federal datasets to compare pre- and post-COVID-19
   shutdown. Analyzing Census tracts, we find (1) little evidence of
   discrimination in the placement of PM2.5 sensors, (2) evidence of the
   standard EJ disproportionality for PM2.5 in both pre-shutdown 2019 and
   post-shutdown 2020, but (3) evidence of disproportionate improvement for
   Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans, with concerning indications of
   possible harm to African Americans. This implies, as do the findings in
   Kerr and colleagues' study, that policies that limit gasoline-powered
   car use can reduce air pollution but are unlikely to importantly
   alleviate US environmental racism affecting African Americans.},

Abstract = {A growing literature investigates the political implications of
   automation and globalization, lacking an explanation for the similarity
   between the nationalist stances triggered by both economic changes. I
   provide an empirical explanation based on risk perception, showing that
   automation << losers >> misattribute the cause of their material
   concerns toward migrants. I put forward an interpretation of
   misattribution based on status loss against which I test a
   rational-choice hypothesis. I run multivariate models on a novel survey
   dataset testing the effects of the regional, sectoral, and occupational
   impact of automation and globalization on risk perception. I find that
   the exposure to automation is associated with the fear of migrants,
   regardless of other individual vulnerabilities. On the contrary, the
   exposure to imports from China only weakly and positively correlate with
   fear of globalization.},

Abstract = {We employ the results of a survey conducted on two thousand voters that
   have participated in Korean local election of 2018 to perform clustering
   analysis of Korean voters' preferences. We attempt to test the
   hypothesis of these preferences being adequately represented by the five
   major political parties. We find that there was likely a significant
   mismatch between Korean voters and the five voting camps identified
   under the assumption of five being an optimal number of the voting
   clusters. After relaxing this assumption we found that the optimal
   number of voting camps in Korea is two or three, suggesting that a two
   or a tri-partite political party system would have been a more adequate
   match representing Korean voters' preferences in 2018.},

Abstract = {The European Union is the only international organisation that has a
   parliament where taxation is debated and legislated on. Along with
   foreign affairs and defense, however, taxation is also one of the few
   policy areas that is subject to unanimity voting among member-states.
   This creates a responsiveness-responsibility dilemma that the European
   Commission has tried to navigate by constructing responsiveness to
   public demands for tax justice as a political imperative. In this
   article, I apply the concept of `political work' to analyse EU tax
   policy between 2014 and 2019 and show the ways in which the politics of
   responsiveness partly eroded the institutional constraints of
   responsibility vis-a-vis member states. As I document, the Commission's
   political work was initially successful but then lost momentum, as a
   handful of governments managed to veto efforts in the Council and push
   the issue to the OECD, where it was stalled by the United States until
   the election of Joe Biden.},

Abstract = {The pandemic has revived attention to several problems in Latin America,
   among them the labor gap. The rise of remote work has led to debates
   centered around the future of workers in the face of cognitive
   capitalism and data colonialism. In this connection, the health
   emergency is revealed as a process of reengineering that threatens to
   further precarize and polarize employment, erasing the physical boundary
   between work and the home. An examination of the devices that have given
   geographical meaning to this phenomenon, addressing their impact within
   and across urban space, and of the problems arising from the right to
   digital connection and disconnection in various Latin American countries
   reveals a complex process of virtualization/spatialization and the
   disappearance of the boundary between productive and reproductive tasks
   because of the dissemination of teleworking. La pandemia ha
   redescubierto diversos problemas existentes en Latinoamerica, uno de
   ellos la brecha laboral. El auge del trabajo remoto ha animado debates
   en torno al futuro de los trabajadores en el horizonte del capitalismo
   cognitivo y el colonialismo de datos; en este sentido, la emergencia
   sanitaria se revela como un proceso de reingenieria que amenaza con
   precarizar y polarizar el empleo; estallando la frontera fisica entre
   trabajo y hogar. Un estudio sobre los dispositivos que dan sentido
   geografico a este fenomeno, desvelando su impacto desde y sobre el
   espacio urbano, y de los problemas derivados del derecho a la conexion y
   desconexion digital revela un complejo proceso de
   virtualizacion-espacializacion, asi como la desaparicion del limite
   entre labores productivas y reproductivas como consecuencia de la
   difusion del teletrabajo.},

Abstract = {Almost a decade after the 2011 post-electoral crisis, Cote d'Ivoire once
   again held elections marred by widespread violence. The third-term
   crisis revolved around President Alassane Ouattara's controversial
   third-term bid and left at least 83 people dead and 633 people injured.
   This briefing draws on a new electoral violence dataset and field
   research to unpack patterns of violence during the crisis, and
   disentangles disruptive electoral violence related to the opposition's
   campaign to thwart the election from incidental electoral violence
   related to the overall electoral tension. The findings show that
   incidental violence was far deadlier than disruptive violence, yet only
   tenuously related to the national political divide. This incidental
   violence was often driven by pre-existing local resource conflicts,
   revenge, rumours and disinformation, and elite manipulation. The
   briefing contributes new knowledge on the local drivers of electoral
   violence in Cote d'Ivoire, and cautions that viewing local communities
   only as victims of elite rivalries can make decision-makers overlook
   important risk factors.},

Abstract = {This paper looks at the micro-politics of crime disorder and everyday
   peacebuilding in Colombia and Venezuela's contested urban systems,
   particularly Cucuta. Despite being plagued with crime, Cucuta is also a
   space of hope where resilience and coexistence shape the survival
   strategies of thousands of marginalised people who transit or live in
   this contested city. Focusing on how residents, including immigrants,
   navigate informality and crime at the street and neighbourhood level,
   this study contributes to the emerging literature on how people resist
   criminal governance in violently contested cities by exploring the
   overlap between violent crime and everyday peace practices. Notably, it
   examines how mobility restrictions, and contested informalities come
   into play in places where social order is bargained between non-state
   armed groups and the state. Building on Urban Criminology and Peace
   Studies, I show how communities navigate and resist violence and crime
   in a violently contested city.},

Abstract = {Australia's 2023 Defence Strategic Review has inaugurated a new era of
   `archipelagic deterrence'. Despite Australia's often forward-leaning
   rhetoric, it has turned away from making significant military
   contributions in Northeast Asia or globally, and instead is building a
   secure bastion across its northern approaches while inviting the United
   States to radically expand its military presence on Australian soil. The
   aim of archipelagic deterrence is to deter and deny China from a
   coercive maritime presence in the zone from the eastern Indian Ocean,
   through maritime Southeast Asia and into the South Pacific. It is hoped
   this will help stabilise the regional balance of power. This new model
   of alliance cooperation better reflects enduring differences in size and
   interests between Washington and Canberra, and should provide a stable
   and effective foundation for the United States' presence and activity in
   the southern Indo-Pacific.},

Volume = {44},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {268-283},

Abstract = {This article analyzes how the pandemic caused by the coronavirus
   (COVID-19) has impacted international migration. In particular, we
   compare the mobility and economic repercussions faced by Bolivian and
   Venezuelan migrants. We conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with
   migrants who requested legal and social support and advice provided by
   the Open Assembly of Migrants and Pro-Migrants of Tarapaca, Chile
   (AMPRO), an organisation dedicated to defending migrant rights. The
   Bolivian interviewees worked in Chile before the pandemic in the city of
   Iquique (close to the Bolivian border). The Venezuelan interviewees are
   undocumented people in transit who entered Chile during the pandemic.
   Through this comparison, we describe the economic repercussions on the
   everyday life, mobility, and survival strategies of people in transit,
   transboundary workers, and migrants with transnational families, and
   reveal a realignment of Chile's border regime that benefits
   post-pandemic capitalism. Furthermore, we clarify how the health
   restrictions implemented due to the pandemic have favoured the
   reconfiguration of the border regime imposed in Chile, through a racist
   immigration policy based on the control and management of migration,
   leading to a greater irregularization of migration.},

Abstract = {Wallonia demonstrated the importance of regional actors for EU trade
   policy. What remains, however, of regional involvement when
   politicization subsides, as after CETA and TTIP? Our paper provides a
   framework that allows a prediction of involvement after politicization.
   It posits that the interaction of three factors is decisive:
   politicization (short-term), preferences (medium-term), institutions
   (long-term). The more regional actors dispose of institutionalised
   channels of voice and the more they develop endogenous preferences, the
   less impact for politicization. We demonstrate this interplay in the
   cases of Austria, Germany, Belgium, Spain, and Italy. Whereas regional
   involvement in Spain and Italy is driven near-exclusively by
   politicization, the German and Austrian Lander will remain cooperatively
   involved even in its absence. The Belgian regions, in turn, are in a
   process of gradual institutionalization. Our study demonstrates that
   regional actors remain a force to be reckoned with in EU trade policy,
   but some more so than others.},

Abstract = {Recognizing the correlation between the growing spread of violent
   extremist and terrorist content on the internet and online platforms and
   the significant increase in attacks inspired by these posts prompted
   governments, security agencies, and private companies to launch various
   countermeasures to reduce the spread and impact of such material.
   Struggling to adjust to these countermeasures and maintain their online
   presence, terrorists and violent extremists have migrated from
   mainstream online platforms to alternative online channels like 4chan,
   8chan, Telegram, TikTok, and most recently to the new platform TamTam.
   This paper describes the migration to and within social media generally,
   with a specific focus on the newly discovered migration to the platform
   TamTam and presents the results of our extensive content analysis of
   hundreds of posts and shares containing terrorist and violent extremist
   content on this platform. These findings are discussed in terms of
   ethical and practical implications.},

Abstract = {Two protest songs created within the first month of the 2019 Chilean
   uprising were intended as explicit statements against violence and in
   favor of peace, but they voiced different understandings of violence and
   proposed different ways out of the conflict. The artists behind each
   song argued that their recordings were nonpartisan, cutting across
   traditional left-right divides. The songs' use and reception, however,
   shows that for Chilean audiences these songs conveyed a clear political
   cleavage through their lyrics, music, and audiovisual content. More
   broadly, consideration of music in the Chilean uprising foregrounds the
   ways in which the uses of music have changed since the classic era of
   protest song of the 1960s and 1970s. Dos canciones de protesta creadas
   en el primer mes del levantamiento chileno de 2019 pretendian ser
   declaraciones explicitas contra la violencia y a favor de la paz, pero
   expresaban distintas interpretaciones de la violencia y propusieron
   diferentes formas de salir del conflicto. Los artistas detras de cada
   cancion argumentaron que sus grabaciones no eran partidistas, cortando
   asi a traves de las tradicionales divisiones de izquierda y derecha. El
   uso y recepcion de las canciones, sin embargo, muestra que, para el
   publico chileno, dichas piezas transmitian una clara division politica a
   traves de sus letras, musica y contenido audiovisual. En terminos mas
   generales, considerar el aspecto musical en el levantamiento chileno
   pone en relieve las formas en que los usos de la musica han cambiado
   desde la era clasica de la cancion de protesta de las decadas del
   sesenta y setenta.},

Title = {Can policy instruments shape the policy problems they aim to solve? How
   interest registers redefined conflicts of interest},

Abstract = {By analysing the policy process leading to the introduction of interest
   registers in France and Sweden, this article argues that their use as a
   policy instrument was crucial for acknowledging and defining conflict of
   interest as a problem. It challenges rationalist approaches to public
   policy that focus on how the adoption of policy solutions follows the
   identification of policy problems, instead, favouring the
   acknowledgement of how problems and solutions can exist independently.
   To identify how interest registers became a preferred policy solution,
   the article traces how policies from the UK and US were integrated in
   the global anti-corruption toolkit in the 1990s and subsequently adopted
   in France and Sweden in the 2010s. It uncovers the sequencing of events,
   and, specifically, the evolution of public discourse on conflicts of
   interest around the adoption of public interest registers. It shows that
   interest registers contribute to (re)define the problem of conflict of
   interest in new contexts of adoption. The sequencing of events suggests
   that the problem of conflict of interest was rarely used before the
   instrument's adoption and, what is important, did not have a clear
   `stabilised' shared meaning. Interest registers thus give reality to the
   problem and modify its definition. By establishing which interests are
   to be declared in standardised forms, interest registers define new
   `risk areas' for corruption. They also convey the idea that the problem
   relates to an asymmetry of information between elected officials and
   voters that can be corrected through transparency measures, shifting the
   locus of problem-solving responsibility to the public.},

Abstract = {An efficient allocation of talents through occupational choice is
   central to modern economic growth. Removing developmental barriers
   unfavorable to entrepreneurship and artificially imposed for political
   reasons (i.e., the cage theory) might be a plausible channel for China's
   superb economic performance. Using a newly compiled dataset on China's
   Super Rich Persons, the regression kink design reports supportive
   evidence on the politically induced structural change in the social
   composition of entrepreneurs using Deng Xiaoping's Southern Talks as an
   event shock. Consistent with a pro-market talent allocation framework,
   this article finds that (1) the share of super-rich entrepreneurs with
   state sector experience and a college degree declined, suggesting that
   the period of the Southern Talks opened a window of opportunity for
   venturing, and (2) the effects on the attributes of the parental father
   of the entrepreneurs are somewhat limited.},

Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES},

Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1160-1177},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article argues that shifts in the UK's territorial management
   practice in the late 2010s and early 2020s, described by various terms,
   including `muscular unionism', may be more rhetorical and ideational
   than substantive. The practices associated with these terms are
   recognisably part of the `British political tradition', and the changes
   of the early 2020s can be viewed as reasserting traditional governance
   practices rather than introducing new ones. The article examines the
   various phenomena described as `muscular unionism' and suggests that
   many are relatively ad hoc, low-level initiatives, often rhetorical.
   There is also much evidence that the UK governments of the 2020s see the
   `Millennium Settlement', introduced in 1999, as continuing to be a core
   part of UK territorial management. The clearest break from historical
   practice comes in the overt, explicit quality of `muscular unionist'
   rhetoric. The article then suggests that, contrary to some scholarly
   expectations, this muscular unionist turn may come to be an effective
   territorial management strategy for the UK government, as it aligns with
   an Anglo-British imaginary within England that continues to conflate
   England, Britain and the UK in terms of governance and national
   identity.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the UK's post-Brexit turn toward softening data
   protection standards. It uses this case to develop a perspective on data
   governance that is rooted in the growth model framework. With this
   approach, it illustrates how incentives to ease data-based value
   creation can be tied to certain macroeconomic conditions. The studied
   data protection reform serves as a crucial event at which links between
   macroeconomic conditions and policy action promise to become
   particularly visible. As the analysis shows, the UK government's policy
   discourse and actions reflect various facets of the country's data
   economy that have special weight in the UK's growth model: the
   importance of data markets and advertising, the role of tech and data in
   attracting foreign investments, and the general importance of tech and
   data-intense service industries. The case study therefore points to
   important analytical dimensions that are relevant more generally for the
   study of evolving growth regimes.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to seek to and understand how civil conflict and
   international claims inform one another. Does the existence of ongoing
   civil and international conflicts affect how a government addresses an
   international claim? The paper builds on existing literature that link
   international and domestic conflict. However, it suggests that the logic
   behind civil conflicts may be different from that for international ones
   as states decide how to deal with any one claim.
   Design/methodology/approachThe paper posits that states faced with
   domestic conflicts and additional international claims are more likely
   to seek to resolve an international claim than those without similar
   conflicts. It develops a series of hypotheses about the likelihood of
   claim escalation and peaceful settlement attempts and proceed to test
   them quantitatively using the Issue Correlates of War data combined with
   the uppsala conflict data program/peace research institute oslo Armed
   Conflict Data. FindingsOn the one hand, the paper finds support for the
   argument regarding the difficulty states are faced with when seeking to
   resolve multiple international claims. On the other hand, it finds that
   the presence of civil conflicts incentivizes states to resolve
   international claims either by force or peacefully, suggesting internal
   violence can both lead to diversionary behavior and attempts at conflict
   resolution. Research limitations/implicationsThe findings have important
   implications for work considering the complexity of domestic and
   international conflict linkages. Originality/valueWhile many studies of
   claim militarization and peaceful attempts focus on dyadic and
   international characteristics, this paper creates a more nuanced
   understanding of the complexities of this foreign policy decision
   process.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {This study examined the impact of Official Development Assistance (ODA)
   on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by aid type, which has been largely
   overlooked in previous studies. Using the Generalized Method of Moments
   with a gravity model, five major donor countries (France, Germany,
   Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and 63 recipient
   country pairs from 1996 to 2020 were analyzed. Granger causality tests,
   impulse response analyses and variance decomposition analyses using a
   panel vector autoregressive model were conducted to identify causal
   relationships in the time series and to quantitatively capture the
   impact. The results suggest that ODA Loans from Germany, Japan, and the
   United Kingdom promote FDI. Their ODA Loans have a high proportion of
   economic infrastructure and productive-sector support. Hence, their ODA
   Loans may attract FDI to recipient countries by developing
   infrastructure in recipient countries such as transportation,
   telecommunications, energy, and finance. This study contributes to an
   academic community by highlighting the differences of aid type in
   attracting FDI and provides practical implications for policymakers and
   practitioners in the field of international development.},

Title = {Ontological Security Dilemma: a Practical Model of Relational Deterrence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {283-306},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper complicates the classic security dilemma by considering the
   notions of ontological security and relational deterrence. It studies
   how the ontological security dilemma has emerged between the US, China,
   and Taiwan from the relational perspective and how these spiral chains
   will further develop in the future. The paper incurs the literature on
   relational analysis to expound on how different ontological security
   concerns allude to relational deterrence between the three actors.
   Taiwan's separatism is more of a threat to China's relational self than
   to physical security because the separatist does not belong to any
   already agreed relationship. A geometric model and a few simulations
   yield three unconventional findings. 1) The less advantaged the US
   military is over China, the less likely armed unification will occur. 2)
   The US anti-Chinese tendency is irrelevant in determining the
   probability of armed unification. 3) What may escalate the spiral are
   China's anti-Taiwan independence and Taiwan's anti-unification. Case
   sensitivity indicates the ontological sensibilities of a security
   dilemma.},

Abstract = {This article provides a comparative analysis of three central policies
   to regulate low wages: statutory minimum wages, state support for
   collective bargaining and topping up low wages with public transfers
   (in-work benefits). We map the variation of these policies across 33
   OECD countries and analyze the incidence of low-wage employment they are
   associated with. We find three approaches to regulating low wages. In
   the first, `wage scale protection', states put most emphasis on
   supporting collective bargaining. In the second, `bare minimum', there
   is not much else than the statutory minimum wage. In the third, `state
   pay', the statutory minimum wage is supplemented by sizeable public
   financial support for low earners. When analyzing policy outcomes, `wage
   scale protection' is associated with least low-wage employment. For
   `bare minimum', much depends on the level of the statutory minimum wage.
   Although `state pay' props up workers' disposable income, many workers
   receive low gross pay.},

Abstract = {Regulatory discretion is a central theme in the study of regulation and
   governance. However, little attention has been paid to the question of
   how countries vary in the way they design regulatory discretion. This
   article fills this gap by conceptualizing styles of regulatory
   discretion according to a novel conceptual framework that distinguishes
   between three dimensions of regulatory discretion: obligation, content,
   and procedure. Empirically, the article compares regulatory discretion
   in British and Israeli education legislation during the period
   1948-2020. The findings reveal substantial differences in regulatory
   discretion styles between the two countries across all three dimensions
   of regulatory discretion. Accordingly, this article proposes several
   links between regulatory discretion and regulatory production that can
   be explored further. In doing this, the article points to the
   relationship between discretion practices and regulatory outcomes.},

Abstract = {More African Union (AU) peacekeepers have been killed in Somalia than
   any other modern peace operation. It is likely that over 450 of them
   were killed during al-Shabaab mass attacks on the AU's forward operating
   bases (FOBs) in south-central Somalia, principally between June 2015 and
   January 2017. Based on a comparative analysis of six such battles, this
   article identifies the main factors that account for both the
   peacekeepers' vulnerabilities and al-Shabaab's military successes. It
   concludes by drawing lessons for peace operations beyond Somalia that
   might face similar threats from insurgents.},

Abstract = {Why do substate actors engage in foreign affairs even if endowed with
   limited formal powers? How are these activities institutionalised and
   legitimised? This article addresses these questions by examining a
   critical case: the rise of Scotland's international development
   cooperation. The spotlight is put on the domestic sources of foreign
   policy formation. Our core argument is that the politics of
   nation-building underpins both the ambition and the increased
   distinctiveness of the Scottish approach to development. This
   nation-building effort is mainly reflected in the emergence of an
   assertive narrative: `Scotland as a good global citizen'. Another core
   insight is the strong articulation between domestic and international
   representations. The external projections of the Scottish Government
   mirror the domestic agenda. Our article places the striking Scottish
   case in analytical and comparative perspective.},

Abstract = {The debate on the necessity of a federal fiscal capacity in the EU has
   featured prominently on the EU's agenda over the past decade. New
   Generation EU marks a historic breakthrough in that regard. This
   breakthrough has been accomplished in order to fulfil macroeconomic
   stabilization functions, but the bulk of the funding has been earmarked
   for green transition projects. This paper asks whether a federal budget
   has added value in relation to the green transition and provides a
   theoretically informed answer. It ends with a call to revise articles
   311 and 312 TFEU so as to grant fiscal powers to the EU},

Abstract = {The study examines bureaucrats facing administrative architectures that
   are multiple, overlapping, ambiguous and sometimes incompatible. It
   makes two main contributions. Firstly, by an organizational approach it
   derives fine-grained predictions on how bureaucrats maneuver when taking
   part in integrated multilevel administrative orders. Secondly,
   benefitting from a large-N data-set (N = 4285) from 16 ministries and 47
   government agencies in Norway, the study demonstrates how organizational
   factors systematically `moderate' and bias behavioral perceptions among
   government officials. Moreover, to probe the robustness of explanatory
   models, the study specifies patterns of moderation by outlining multiple
   interaction models as well as illustrating how interaction effects
   unfold. The study finds that few moderators make dramatic effects by
   profoundly weakening relationships. Moderating variables either
   strengthen or attenuate already apparent effects, thus probing the
   empirical robustness of the models.},

Abstract = {Embeddedness theory and relational work theory propose that people in
   close social relations naturally have better information about partners,
   which helps safeguard and optimize their relationships. Yet, researchers
   have noted that despite access to better information, broken trust still
   occurs. Why? We identify two factors that systematically keep access to
   information from working as anticipated: detection errors, which prevent
   people from effectively accessing and processing information, and
   associational dilemmas, which hinder using the information to report and
   punish deception. We also consider how relational work can sustain or
   amplify these factors and foster relational matches that give the false
   impression of being based on shared meanings and understandings. For
   example, detection errors and associational dilemmas can place victims
   into illusory solidarity where, despite appearing close, they are stuck
   with opportunistic partners.},

Title = {Trading labor for experience: The role of unpaid internships in shaping
   Active Labor Market Policies in Ireland since the Great Recession},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLICY ANALYSIS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Active Labor Market Policies (ALMPs), which include state-funded
   apprenticeships, have long been used as a way of encouraging unemployed
   youth into skilled and semiskilled trades. However, new forms of
   ``nonstandard{''} employment are now dominating young people's
   experience of the labor market. In fact, unpaid internships are becoming
   a normal part of a modern curriculum vitae and viewed as a necessary
   rite of passage for a successful school-to-work transfer, especially in
   the middle-class professions. Through the use of freedom of information
   requests, policy documents, evaluation reports, and semistructured
   interviews, this paper examines the role of unpaid internships in
   shaping the four most recent ALMPs targeted at Irish youth since the
   Great Recession (2008). It theorizes that the increased prevalence of
   unpaid internships in the entry-level jobs market leads to Irish
   policymakers designing youth unemployment ALMPs based on a
   private-sector unpaid internship model. This paper will first situate
   youth unemployment policy within the literature on ALMPs and unpaid
   internships. It will then combine process tracing as a within-case
   research method with a comparative case study of the four ALMPs. In
   conclusion, this paper finds that Irish youth unemployment policy
   designed during periods of economic crisis tends to prioritize the needs
   of host organizations and mirror employment norms established through
   unpaid internships. Conversely, during periods of economic growth, the
   Irish youth unemployment policy reverts to a more regulated model that
   protects the entry-level jobs market. Furthermore, this paper recommends
   that European states should prohibit the use of unpaid internships to
   avoid further entrenching precarious and discriminatory work patterns.},

Abstract = {This article examines how former Protection of Civilian site (PoCs)
   residents are staying safe and protecting themselves after the United
   Nations Mission in South Sudan's (UNMISS) handing over of the PoCs to
   the Revitalised-Transitional Government of National Unity (R-TGoNU).
   Using key informant interviews, questionnaires, and observations, we
   establish that those still residing in the PoCs do so with less
   humanitarian assistance, increased insecurity, and few authorities they
   can rely upon or turn to for protection. In response, it is shown how
   camp residents have developed their own safety and protection strategies
   at the cost of their ability to pursue livelihoods, move freely outside
   of the camps, and publicly express their identities. Although broadly
   stable, this situation is unsustainable and risks the safety of camp
   residents and the wider ongoing peace process. The paper concludes with
   policy recommendations for humanitarians and R-TGoNU policymakers
   interested in their welfare.},

Abstract = {This article considers how the child's gaze in Napoleonic culture
   functions as a multifaceted tool in the moral and political history of
   the Napoleonic Wars. Drawing from Stahl's framework of the `weaponized
   gaze' and, at points, multimodal discourse, I track how the youthful
   gaze has become an emblem of power and ethics in art and literature of
   the period. In the first two sections of the article, I explore how this
   gaze has been mediated and manipulated by adult narratives, used for a
   variety of purposes ranging from personal introspection to political
   broadcast. The first section considers the gaze within the context of
   children within war art, and the second moves to literature, forming new
   critical readings of Victor Hugo's Les Miserables and Leo Tolstoy's War
   and Peace in relation to the history of childhood. The final section of
   the article attempts to reclaim the child's gaze through self-awareness
   and internalization, introducing examples of child authors of the
   Napoleonic period - Felicia Hemans (Browne), Marjory Fleming, Elizabeth
   Barrett Browning, and the Bront \& euml;s - and considering how their
   writings, varying from patriotism to protest, imitation to epiphanic
   moments, create a parallel military history, useful for readers and
   critics of childhood, war and emotion in that they challenge our
   understandings of children's agency and involvement. Overall, this
   article offers new ways of approaching children's participation in war,
   demonstrating how their roles as muses, consumers and producers are
   intimately bound with the moral and emotional fallout of conflict.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the employment of words, images and rituals, in the
   early years of the Italian Republic, to reinforce the militarization of
   the Public Security Guard (Corpo delle Guardie di Pubblica Sicurezza)
   and to engender public support for hard-line military-type solutions to
   law-and-order difficulties. Drawing on police literature (especially the
   magazine of the Public Security Guard, Polizia Moderna), newspapers and
   cinema newsreels, it analyses police commemorations and celebrations,
   and representations of these rituals internally and to the wider public.
   This includes an examination of the employment of religious language and
   liturgy, which I argue intended to reinforce a warrior mentality among
   police officers. The article also investigates how the police and the
   media framed policing activities and the hard-line repressive tactics
   which the enhanced militarization of the Public Security Guard
   determined. To aid interpretation of the sources, the article partly
   draws on recent critical feminist scholarship on the employment of
   gendered constructions in the process of militarization.},

Abstract = {Vaccines are essential for the eradication of diseases. Yet for many
   reasons, individuals do not embrace them completely. In the COVID-19
   pandemic and with the possibility of the Brazilian population's
   immunization against the disease, both political and health-related
   dimensions might have had a role in individual COVID-19 vaccination
   acceptance. In two studies (n = 974), we tested the hypothesis that
   participants' vaccination acceptance is related to their past vote in
   the 2018 Brazilian presidential election (being or not being a Jair
   Bolsonaro voter) and their different levels of perceived vulnerability
   to disease (PVD). We further tested whether Bolsonaro's opposition or
   ambiguous messages towards vaccination (vs. control) increased
   vaccination rejection among those who have (vs. have not) voted for him
   and who are low (vs. high) in PVD. Results show that Bolsonaro (vs.
   non-Bolsonaro) voters accepted less vaccination, with higher rejection
   rates when participants expressed low (vs. high) PVD. Also, when primed
   either with Bolsonaro's opposed or ambiguous messages towards COVID-19
   vaccination, such participants accepted less vaccines (vs. participants
   primed with neutral information). These findings are the first to show
   that the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance is related to their past vote and
   leadership influence but also different levels of perceived
   vulnerability to disease.},

Title = {Ideations of social sustainability? Concepts and cleavages of cohesion
   in Germany},

Abstract = {The UN 2030 Agenda calls for the development and promotion of societies
   that pursue not only ecological and economic, but also socio-political
   sustainability goals. Yet, the political as well as academic discourse
   on that is marginal. Conducting an empirical case study in Germany, this
   article examines existing political ideations about societal integration
   and thus cohesion and discusses ideational obstacles to the development
   of a socially sustainable society. First, the concept of ideations is
   made accessible for empirical analysis by distinguishing cognitive and
   affective elements with symbolic, sentimental, programmatical and
   ideological foundations. The focus is not on the implementation of
   specific policies, but on the negotiation processes of the ideational
   foundations of integration governance. The following critical discourse
   analysis elaborates central aspects of `constitutional patriotism' and
   `Leitkultur.' It traces their emergence and characteristics and thereby
   reveals how different historical contexts and political interests of the
   actors influence the emergence and dissemination of ideations.
   Furthermore, it demonstrates how formerly opposing positions converge,
   emphasizing the impact of ideational processes on changing governance
   trends. Subsequently, inherent elements of cultural racism and hegemony,
   religion and `values,' and emotion politics are critically discussed as
   obstacles to developing decolonial ideations about integration.
   Accordingly, the widespread appreciation of patriotism and national
   pride as a foundation for successful integration is questioned. The
   conclusion diagnoses that republican elements are gaining influence with
   the tendency to individualize, paternalize, and depoliticize
   integration. Shared cognitive and emotional ideations are intended to
   ensure support for democracy, but the extent to which these policies
   themselves exhibit undemocratic tendencies must be critically observed.
   The two ideations examined are therefore not or only partially suitable
   for promoting social sustainability.},

Abstract = {As part of its European Data Strategy, the EU wants to create a market
   for non-personal data and unlock the sharing of industrial data between
   companies. This theory-building case study suggests that businesses'
   data governance preferences are determined by their position in the data
   value chain and thus whether firms monetise data as data holders
   (producers) in the upstream or as data reusers (access seekers) in the
   downstream segment. While the latter favour legal rules for governing
   data sharing, the former prefer only contractual agreements. The data
   value chain theory draws on concepts of the role of data in value
   creation in the digital economy and on case evidence from the automotive
   and financial sectors, which are typical cases of digital disruption.
   The theory helps to better understand coalition building in business
   lobbying activities, the potential dynamics between private
   self-regulation and public policies, and the probable feedback effects
   of digital policies on corporate power sources.},

Abstract = {New York City, where the Manhattan Project began, has some of the
   world's oldest nuclear weapons production sites, exposing New Yorkers to
   ongoing risks of ionising radiation. This article considers six sites of
   particular environmental concern. Assessment, monitoring and clean-up of
   these locations have taken place over three different periods: private
   remediation before 1992; federal government remediation in the early
   1990s followed by two decades of neglect; and a long-standing campaign
   to deal with risks at two remaining sites. Addressing radioactive
   legacies has involved a feedback loop between literal excavation of
   contaminated locations and a more hermeneutical process of
   meaning-making. Journalists, activists and politicians have transformed
   some places into sites of memory, cultivating connections to concerns
   about environmental justice, radiation protection and nuclear
   disarmament. The 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons
   (TPNW) established new obligations to remediate environments
   contaminated by nuclear weapons activities. While the USA refuses to
   join the TPNW, in-depth, historical study of remediation at these sites
   can provide useful insight for states parties establishing policy to
   implement TPNW obligations. Recent passage of nuclear disarmament
   legislation by the NY City Council shows the ongoing policy relevance of
   nuclear weapons issues in local policymaking.},

Abstract = {As Russia continues to wage war against Ukraine, Western calls to
   confiscate Russian frozen assets to aid Ukraine's reconstruction have

   seize Russian assets, legal conservatism and concerns over the
   disruption of international rules are strong constraints. Finding a

Abstract = {Bringing democracy to the workplace has gained researchers' attention
   during the last few years. In addition to its proorganizational
   outcomes, democratization at the workplace also helps to eradicate
   organizational negativities. The present study investigates these claims
   by empirically examining the relationship between organizational
   democracy, perception of politics, and workplace incivility. A sample of
   300 full-time employees working in fifteen different banks in the
   district of Gujrat Pakistan was obtained. The structural equation
   modeling technique was used to test the proposed hypotheses. The results
   indicated that workplace democracy is negatively associated with the
   perception of organizational politics and workplace incivility.
   Nevertheless, when there is organizational democracy with a supportive
   environment, it further reduces its incivility and politics. The study
   provides empirical evidence to managers and organizational decision
   makers in developing democratic workplaces to promote participative
   culture and eradicate organizational negativities. More studies on
   democratic practices with different contexts and factors are discussed
   and proposed for future studies.},

Abstract = {In the post-WWII period, the claims over the savoir-developper were
   numerous, coming from diverse ideological and institutional origins, and
   dealing with multiple topics, from rural welfare to community
   development, from education to health and labour. Many were the
   competing arguments and plans to intervene about those topics in various
   geographic spaces. Among the international actors participating in the
   promotion of a developmentalist agenda with global impacts, two
   interimperial organizations were particularly active, sometimes
   cooperating, sometimes rivalling with the specialized agencies of the
   United Nations system: The International Institute of Differing
   Civilizations ( INCIDI, 1949) and the Commission for Technical
   Co-operation in Africa South of the Sahara (CCTA, 1950). Associated to
   projects of imperial and colonial resilience in contexts characterized
   by mounting anti-colonial pressures, both organisations contributed to
   the growing internationalization of social policies, gathering numerous
   experts in various conferences, in Europe and in Africa, promoting the
   production and transfer of original knowledge, publishing diverse
   reports and enquiries with considerable reach, and even sponsoring
   specific interventions on the ground. These dynamics were meaningfully,
   and frequently, shaped by disputes about the motivations and
   applications of social policies that occurred at the imperial
   metropoles. This paper addresses these two institution's roles in the
   internationalization of social policies, analysing some of their major
   meetings, key publications, and significant projects, taking the topics
   of education, `social' and `rural welfare' and, mostly, labour as main
   observatories.},

Abstract = {Engaging with the UN Secretary General's call for a more effective,
   networked and inclusive approach to multilateralism (Our Common Agenda,
   2021), this paper discusses the main challenges to the implementation of
   the Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus concept. Institutionalised by
   the UN in 2016, such cross-policy effort at global governance has been
   neglected by the IR and IPE literatures. To start filling this gap, the
   paper identifies strengths and weaknesses of multilateral inter-agency
   cooperation on the Nexus approach. Based on previous research on
   inter-organisational performance and regime complexity, it investigates
   select evidence from three organisations (UN, EU, World Bank), in pre-
   and post-COVID-19 contexts. Identifying tangible elements of
   experimentalist governance in the HDP global endeavour, the paper
   concludes with a synthetic overview of the comparative advantages that
   each organisation offers to implement the Nexus.},

Abstract = {Several billionaires have recently emerged as leaders of climate
   governance. So far, little research has examined how they legitimize
   their involvement in climate networks. We argue that billionaire
   governance entrepreneurs have high levels of resources but low
   procedural legitimacy. They pursue output legitimacy to support their
   political action, highlighting their effectiveness in managing climate
   issues. Their main strategies, depoliticization, outgrouping, and
   technical solutionism, may give them short-term legitimacy but risk
   undermining their long-term goals of addressing climate change. We
   analyze the discursive legitimation strategies of a successful
   billionaire entrepreneur in transnational climate governance, Michael
   Bloomberg. Our empirical analysis is based on the study of more than 800
   statements, speeches, and news releases related to Bloomberg's climate
   action from 2010 to 2021. It contributes to the study of
   entrepreneurship, leadership, philanthropy, and transnational actors in
   climate governance.},

Abstract = {Grouping people into a geographical category of `peripherality', based
   on positivist ontologies, conceals histories and policies of
   humiliation, marginalisation, and discrimination that forced communities
   away from access to material and cultural benefits. For this reason, we
   call for an anti-positivist ontological approach based on intersectional
   investigation, juxtaposing multi-variants of marginalised identities
   with multi-dimensional histories of discrimination. We also seek
   reconsideration of the universal validity of `periphery',
   `peripherality', and `center', and propose instead to develop more
   accurate concepts that reflect particular localism, histories, and
   social conditions. Following the anti-positivist ontology, we meld two
   concepts of relevance in the Israeli context, periphery and frontier,
   into a portmanteau-frontieriphery-and add it as a socio-spatial and
   ethnical frame for intersectionality. Our urgings are the outcomes of
   research on Israel's `development towns' and its periphery.},

Abstract = {Sub-national governments are a crucial non-state actor for mitigating
   climate change. This importance has recently strengthened as increasing
   numbers of municipalities declare net-zero carbon emission goals to
   support the Paris Agreement, often well ahead of national governments.
   In Japan, net-zero declarations have also diffused widely, with nearly
   800 declarations appearing in domino-like fashion over 2019-2022. To
   elucidate the factors that propelled this rapid diffusion, we used an
   event-history analysis based on data from a survey to develop an
   integrated statistical model. We then deepen understanding of diffusion
   mechanisms through seven brief case studies informed by interviews and
   document analysis. We find that the drivers of policy diffusion varied
   over time. During the early stage, internal factors drove the spread of
   declarations; namely participation in transnational city networks,
   endowed human and financial resources, and political leadership. But in
   later stages, diffusion was mostly propelled by external factors; namely
   declarations by neighboring cities and the affiliated prefectural
   government. Through these findings, we contribute to scholarship through
   two novel perspectives. First, we reveal the factors driving policy
   diffusion across both early adopters and the ordinary majority. Second,
   we show how the influence of well-known factors can vary during
   different stages of policy diffusion.},

Abstract = {The European Union's competences in armament policy have increased and
   its policy instruments have shifted towards military capacity-building.
   Illustrative of this, the European Defence Fund (EDF) finances
   cooperative research and development programmes in defence. Given
   military capacity-building's centrality for statehood, I investigate the
   EDF to analyse the extent to which it challenges national prerogatives.
   I argue that the EDF represents a change away from the European Union's
   regulatory role, and yet, does not correspond to a `positive'
   supranational security state. Instead, the EDF represents a hybrid
   military capacity-building instrument, combining national ownership and
   EU (co-)financing of defence capacities. This argument builds
   conceptually on the state-building scholarship's distinction between the
   centralisation of military and financial resources and adapts it to the
   EU multilevel governance. Theoretically, I build on constructivist
   public policy and core state power scholarship and demonstrate that the
   EDF's hybrid design is the result of policy frame competition. The
   Commission-driven `efficiency' frame, pushing for supranational
   centralisation of financial and military resources, was effectively
   tamed by member-states, whose preferences regarding defence and fiscal
   policies ('distribution of competences' frame) excluded EU ownership of
   defence assets and limited its financing role.},

Abstract = {Interlocal agreements are becoming a popular policy tool for
   facilitating intergovernmental coordination and cooperation in Canada
   and the United States. Indigenous and local governments are also turning
   to these agreements despite long histories of colonialism, exploitation
   and dispossession by the settler State toward Indigenous communities. To
   what extent do interlocal agreements between Indigenous and municipal
   governments require stringent accountability measures to facilitate
   intergovernmental coordination? Using a hierarchical Bayesian item
   response theory model, we explore this question by analyzing 317
   interlocal agreements between Indigenous and municipal communities in
   Canada. We find that accountability strength varies significantly across
   agreements, contrary to our expectation that accountability requirements
   would be strong across agreements due to the long history of
   colonialism. We also find that some of the variation may be a function
   of the policy area addressed by each agreement, although this finding is
   likely the result of measurement uncertainty in our estimates.},

Abstract = {We challenge Kruck and Weiss' argument about the regulatory security
   state on two counts. First, we contest the notion that the regulatory
   state is a viable alternative to the positive security state. While
   regulation and epistemic authority are increasingly important means of
   security provision, they remain critically dependent power resources and
   political authority that only the positive state provides. The
   regulatory security state is premised on the positive state and unviable
   without it. Second, the rise of the regulatory security state over the
   past three decades reflects highly specific historical conditions rather
   than a general trend. These conditions include unusually low
   geopolitical tensions in Europe and the strong regulatory bias of EU
   integration. Concepts matter: The wider the notion of security, the more
   relevant the regulatory security state becomes. It is an important
   reality but the war in Ukraine reminds us of the enduring centrality of
   the positive state.},

Abstract = {Three multibillionaire-owned consortia in Mexico-Carlos Slim Helu's
   Minera Frisco, German Larrea's Grupo Mexico, and Alberto Bailleres's
   Industrias Penoles-have played a leading role in the process of
   accumulation through dispossession by perpetrating violence against
   indigenous and peasant communities in the form of the expulsion of
   thousands of people from their land, attacks on their security, health
   and ways of life, environmental depredation, fraud, criminalization, and
   murder. Examination of media reports of the most recent
   socio-environmental conflicts and corporate documents reveals the
   tension between profit accumulation through dispossession and
   territorial depredation in mining and various forms of resistance. Los
   consorcios multimillonarios mexicanos-Minera Frisco de Carlos Slim Helu,
   Grupo Mexico de German Larrea e Industrias Penoles de Alberto
   Bailleres-han desempenado un papel protagonico en el proceso de
   acumulacion a traves del despojo efectuado a traves de la perpetracion
   de actos de violencia contra las comunidades indigenas y campesinas.
   Esto se ha manifestado en la expulsion de miles de personas de sus
   tierras, ataques a su seguridad, salud y formas de vida, asi como
   depredacion ambiental, fraude, criminalizacion y asesinato. Un analisis
   de los informes hechos por los medios de comunicacion en torno a los
   conflictos socioambientales mas recientes asi como de documentos
   corporativos revela la tension existente entre la acumulacion de
   ganancias a traves del despojo y la depredacion territorial en el rubro
   de la mineria, al igual que diversas formas de resistencia.},

Abstract = {International regimes contain norm bundles with several distinct norms
   that jointly define what is expected from parties. As states engage with
   these regime-inherent norms, they attribute meanings to them. Moreover,
   they can also translate norms extraneous to the regime. Here we take a
   theoretical middle ground between full-fledged norm adoption and
   approaches that emphasize the novelty of each translation. We argue that
   norm translations may be largely shared among states with similar
   domestic contexts. This includes individual translations of norms as
   well as prioritizations between them. Empirically, we focus on the
   United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by
   applying unsupervised quantitative text analysis (topic modeling) to the
   Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted around the 2015
   Paris conference. Studying these implementation pledges, we find that
   states have mostly engaged in regime-inherent norm translations,
   indicating normative stability of the regime. This occurred in distinct
   forms, such as by translating mitigation responsibilities in the form of
   absolute or relative emission reduction targets. We find hints that norm
   translations indeed vary in line with states' domestic context factors:
   Beyond broad differences between industrialized and developing
   countries, we show the relevance of factors like vulnerability to
   climate change and emissions levels.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 4},
Abstract = {The UK faced a potential loss of influence after the 2016 Brexit
   referendum. Without a seat in EU institutions and absent from the Common
   Security and Defence Policy, London lost the opportunity to influence
   the trajectory of the EU as a security actor. However, the UK remains a
   heavyweight in European security and has focussed on ways to exercise
   military and security leadership unencumbered by the constraints of EU
   membership. It has done so by leveraging its high standing in NATO, by
   emphasising regional initiatives such as the Joint Expeditionary Force
   and by reinforcing (and, in some cases, extending) bilateral cooperation
   with individual European countries. Brexit-induced concerns about the
   trajectory of UK power and influence opened up space to cooperate with
   the UK's European partners in several ways. These trends have been
   amplified by the UK's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.},

Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {4},
Pages = {729-747},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigate how partisan motivations shape voters'
   reactions to a political scandal by drawing on a unique survey
   experiment fielded immediately after Justin Trudeau's
   brownface/blackface scandal broke during the 2019 Canadian election. We
   thus explore motivated reasoning in real time in a competitive and
   highly partisan election context. Are voters more willing to forgive
   politicians for past behavior when their own party leader's impropriety
   is cued? To what extent do personal interests, such as cross-pressures
   or electoral concerns, affect the motivation to forgive? Our findings
   show that partisan-motivated reasoning is overwhelmingly powerful,
   producing politically biased judgments of politicians implicated in
   scandals. Furthermore, voters' willingness to forgive scandals is also
   influenced by ``strategic{''} considerations, in that preferences over
   which political party wins or loses in the election affect opinions
   about whether someone should be forgiven or whether the scandal is
   considered important at all. However, we find no evidence that personal
   involvement in the issue raised by the scandal conditions partisan
   motivations. We posit that the environment-in this case, a competitive
   election-is an important consideration for understanding the extent and
   limits of partisan-motivated reasoning.},

Abstract = {Russia's decision to invade Ukraine in early 2022 was seemingly driven
   by an unprecedented willingness to accept risks for the Russian regime,
   state, and society. Developing a generalizable framework, this article
   analyzes the development of Russian risk acceptance in offensive war
   initiation. Drawing on policy documents, speeches, expert literature,
   and various interviews with Russian, Ukrainian, and Western
   policymakers, the article finds that risk acceptance has continuously
   risen since the mid-2000s, although the 2022 invasion still evinces some
   risk aversion. These results are robust when accounting for
   miscalculation and caution against attributing the 2022 invasion solely
   to short-term and leader-centric factors. They also provide cues for
   understanding the crisis behavior of Russia and other major powers,
   corroborate prospect theory models on cognitive biases in elite
   decision-making, and indicate the need to revise the theoretical
   assumption that risk acceptance is an empirically rare and drastic
   aberration from a risk-neutral or risk-averse normality.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the hourly wage gap between 25- and 55-year-old
   temporary and permanent employees across 30 countries worldwide based on
   Luxembourg Income Study data from 2000 to 2019 supplemented by other
   survey data. Two-stage multilevel regressions reveal wage disadvantages
   for temporary workers, particularly for prime-age workers and those
   working in medium-/high-level occupations. There is no evidence that a
   stronger institutional dualization in terms of stronger employment
   protection for permanent contracts increases the wage gap. Instead
   partial deregulation matters: In countries where permanent workers are
   strongly protected, the wage gap is larger if the use of temporary
   contracts is deregulated. Moreover, results suggest that the larger the
   size of the temporary employment segment the larger the wage gap. Thus,
   our findings indicate that stronger institutional and structural labor
   market dualism amplifies labor market inequality in terms of wage gaps
   between temporary and permanent workers.},

Abstract = {Legality of abortion has been one of the most controversial political
   initiatives in modern times, which also impacts the healthcare delivery
   system especially for women. The debate often devolves into disagreement
   on either access to services on demand from healthcare providers or
   service refusal regardless of the circumstances. However, the reality is
   different from this bipolar conversation. Instead, it varies depending
   upon location of the potential abortion recipient and a host of factors
   associated with nation-states. Thus, our purpose is to reveal different
   legislative protocols that lead to or inhibit availability of this
   aspect of women's reproductive rights, and to empirically determine what
   are the underlying series of factors that drive these policy decisions.
   Together they reveal a complex mosaic of fundamental principles that are
   rarely considered when formulating public policy. We hope our research
   across nations will help healthcare providers and policy makers
   recognize the genealogy of options and opportunities as they continue to
   debate abortion's provision to women within healthcare systems.},

Abstract = {Local ceasefire agreements are prevalent in modern civil wars, but we
   know little about their impact. This study analyzes geo-referenced data
   on 145 local ceasefire agreements declared during the Syrian Civil War,
   2011-2019, exploring their short- and long-term effects on the intensity
   of armed violence. Drawing on scholarship on gradual confidence-building
   processes, we theorize the conditions under which local ceasefire
   agreements may generate trust and reduce conflict intensity. Using
   interrupted time-series analysis and spatial panel regression, we
   examine factors relating to the design and strategic context of
   ceasefire agreements. We find that local ceasefire agreements can
   trigger both escalation and de-escalation in the short term.
   De-escalatory outcomes are more likely in the long-term, when ceasefire
   signatories share a history of previous interaction, and when ceasefires
   are implemented in a stepwise fashion. We also find evidence of spatial
   diffusion: local ceasefire agreements in one area reduce conflict
   intensity in neighboring areas.},

Abstract = {The EU is unlikely to develop the kinds of efficient collective
   responses to the Russia-Ukraine war that it produced in reaction to the
   COVID-19 pandemic. The conditions of strategic interdependence generated
   by the Ukraine crisis are more demanding than those triggered by the
   pandemic because its consequences are asymmetrically distributed across
   member states. Germany will find it difficult to play the role of
   regional stabiliser, anti-Europe parties could become stronger, new
   intra-European cleavages may arise over collective goals, and the
   expansion of the crisis's time horizon could weaken prospects for
   effective collective action.},

Abstract = {The surprise victory of the small state of Norway over the major power
   of Canada in the competition for a seat in the Security Council caught
   the attention of several observers. This article argues that an early
   announced candidacy, consistent high-level political engagement, and a
   focus on building personal relationships between the countries to
   establish trust were particularly crucial factors in shaping the outcome
   of the 2020 election for the Western Group's seat in the Security
   Council. It is specifically argued that these factors are rooted in a
   question of trust among states, which ultimately determines whether a
   country votes for them or not. This highlights the significance of
   prioritizing trust-building as a distinct logic in future international
   campaigns - both strategically for upcoming campaigns and academically
   for future analyses. The data for this study was collected through
   document analysis, fieldwork, and elite interviews with 25 informants
   within and outside of the United Nations.},

   the currently web-based programs to support the optimization of public
   service performance related to licensing to document issuance in
   Sidoarjo Regency, Indonesia. This research aims to develop a service
   quality evaluation model in information systems by examining the
   understanding and application of the e-government field. Achieving this
   study's objectives should produce: 1) mapping critical factors to
   develop web-based quality evaluation models for PATEN, 2) formulating
   web-based development of quality evaluation models for PATEN, and 3)
   adopting strategies for developing web-based PATEN quality evaluation
   models in Sidoarjo Regency Government. The research method used is
   descriptive research with a qualitative approach. The research location
   is Sukodono District and Buduran District, Sidoarjo Regency Government,
   Indonesia. The data collection method included interviews, focus groups,
   and discussions. The research results show that the mapping of critical
   factors in developing a web-based quality evaluation model of PATEN in
   terms of knowledge development of employees who have often attended
   workshops to support employee competence in providing public services;
   leadership strongly supports innovation. Standard Operating Procedures
   and the innovation network are under continuous development. This study
   develops an e-government-based evaluation model of sub-district
   integrated administrative services quality. It combines the previous
   model of improving the service quality of electronic -based systems to
   improve the quality of continuity of use and a model of service
   measurement to consumers using the website.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the author considers the issues of one's legal
   personality in international law in general, with emphasis on the
   international legal personality of the European Union. The focus of
   discussion is on the character and structure of the European Union's
   international legal personality and its peculiarities as a unique,
   juridical person. Special attention was given to the notion of the EU as
   a sui generis subject of international law, along with its scope of
   activities and supranational elements. As pointed out in this paper,
   these issues are numerous. Firstly, the issue of the European Union's
   status within the international legal order is analysed and, further on,
   the character and the elements of its legal personality and the scope of
   the EU's legal capacity as a juridical person in international law is
   also looked at. By conducting this discussion, conclusions were reached
   regarding the determination of the EU's international legal personality
   (primarily regarding its current character and structure), which
   undoubtedly exists within the framework of the international legal
   order, but as a specific and unique personality in many respects.},

Journal = {STUDIA EUROPEJSKIE-STUDIES IN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS},

Volume = {27},

Pages = {71-92},
Abstract = {Historically, Estonia has suffered many years of hostilities inflicted
   by Russia, with Russia being a constant threat towards the nation's
   identity and sovereignty, including the loss of its independence and
   coming under and enduring belligerent Russian occupation. Recently,
   Moscow's policy escalated by their unilaterally using military power
   against Ukraine in an attempt to subordinate the nation while harbouring
   desires to restore their sphere of influence. 2022's aggression came as
   no surprise to Tallinn, as the nation's leadership had issued warnings
   about Russia's intentions, based on understanding its nature and being
   aware of what a so-called ``Russian world{''} means. This article aims
   to focus on presenting the impact of Russian aggression against Ukraine
   on Estonia within three domains of understanding; those of the
   political, public, and military, and the author will use scientific
   methods including the collection of original data and a systematic
   review of existing literature and studies, along with analyses,
   syntheses, and elements of comparative analysis. The case study, of
   course, concerns Estonia. The research contends that the Russian
   Federation is and will continue to be considered an existential threat,
   one which carries out both continuous and decisive non-military and
   military activities against its neighbours. These activities require
   Estonia to improve internal security with the need of regional and
   international support.},

Abstract = {In this article, we introduce a new dataset on financial support for the
   International Criminal Court (ICC) and examine how this support has
   changed over its two decades of existence. We first consider how the
   ICC's overall budget has changed over time. Then, we explore the
   evolution of support from individual donor governments. In addition,
   given former Prosecutor Bensouda's emphasis on the effective
   investigation and prosecution of sexual and gender-based crimes, we
   examine the extent to which ICC funding is consistent with its apparent
   commitment to gender justice. Our research contributes to debates about
   the cost of justice, donors and norm diffusion, South-North clashes over
   the definition and delivery of justice, and gender mainstreaming within
   costly international justice processes. We argue that the level of
   funding state parties and other bodies allocate to particular forms of
   justice is a better proxy for their commitment to justice than their
   rhetoric, and conclude that the patterns of funding seen at the ICC
   support the claim that the Court remains, to a significant extent, a
   tool of powerful states.},

Abstract = {The threat of the use of nuclear weapons by the aggressor is a
   significant factor in the ongoing war. Also in future, the Ukrainian
   government (any leadership) will be interested in its own nuclear
   weapons at least as long as Russia is ruled by an ill-predictable
   authoritarian regime. Nuclear arms could be helpful for Ukraine both for
   deterrence and to increase the attractiveness of the country as a
   military ally. However, due to many economic, political, and legal
   factors discussed in the paper, the likelihood of development of
   Ukraine's own nuclear arsenal should be considered as extremely low. The
   unlikely scenario, in which Ukraine could nevertheless develop such
   weapons, would require such a significant improvement of political and
   economic institutions, that the risk for third countries from the new
   nuclear actor will remain minimal.},
