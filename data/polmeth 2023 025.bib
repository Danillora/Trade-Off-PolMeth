Title = {The Attempted Destruction of Western Values},
Journal = {STUDIA EUROPEJSKIE-STUDIES IN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {65-81},
Abstract = {An attempt to shake the established world order of Western society,
   based on International Law, by the waging of war, has reached its peak.
   This is evidenced not only by Russia's war in Ukraine, but also by
   Russia's political attempts to destabilise Moldova's approach to Western
   values, along with the recent unrest in Georgia, where there is a risk
   of restricting individual freedom of expression, and the constant
   threats against the Baltic States. Conflicts of values have existed
   throughout world history, but the events we are witnessing now are not
   an accident, but a systematic reiteration of Russia's influence, with
   the aim of maintaining its influence and, perhaps, increasing its power
   in the region. The aim of this article is to show the clash of
   contemporary values in the current socio-political situation from the
   perspectives of theory and practice. Russian political leaders had long
   used alarming language in their rhetoric, up to and including the moment
   of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In Europe and throughout the Western
   world there was a belief in universal values with peaceful/ stable
   global institutions, a belief which has proved to be misguided. On the
   other hand, military aggression against a free and independent country
   can be interpreted as a direct and clear attempt to destabilise the
   values of Western civilisation, without which no democratic society can
   exist. The timing of the military aggression was chosen after a decline
   in civic confidence from the perspective of the COVID-19 crisis;
   European countries were experiencing a reduction in political activity
   among their citizens, dissatisfaction with the political elite, and a
   certain decline in confidence in the EU institutions. The course of the
   pandemic reflected the lack of critical thinking in societies, as
   individuals were also at risk of manipulation in the information sphere.
   The Russian invasion of Ukraine caused some indignation in the Western
   world and a failure to react quickly to the rapid turn of events. After
   the first year of the war, the EU Member States managed not only to
   change their position but also to give unwavering and unequivocal
   support to the victim of the war, namely, Ukraine. So far, the EU slogan
   ``United in Diversity{''} has become ``United in Solidarity{''}, helping
   Ukraine to hold on and possibly win the war against the aggressor state,
   because no war, especially a war of values, ends on the front lines. As
   a result of current events, EU and transatlantic cooperation has
   undergone a major transformation involving extensive cooperation, a
   clear position on international law, and a desire to preserve and
   strengthen Western values.},

Abstract = {The European Research Area and Framework Programme 7 represents a
   conducive means for positive differentiation beyond the borders of the
   EU. The article aims to identify the ERA's differentiated integration
   and segmentation swatches by concentrating on the closely-tied
   neighbouring countries of Morocco and Tunisia. The thematic distinction
   of the Mediterranean represents positive differentiation that surpasses
   EU territory. It occurs based on the thematic priorities co-decided by
   key EU institutions and articulated by the European Commission in annual
   work programmes. Segmentation in research across the Mediterranean area
   is a centrally-steered process incentivised by the European Commission
   through open calls for project applications. Process tracing allows for
   even more nuanced thematic steering patterns to be explored. A content
   analysis of open calls with a specific focus on the annual work
   programmes demonstrates the important role played by the fact that
   Morocco and Tunisia correspond to the country category of ``(African)
   Mediterranean Partner Countries{''}. This geographical position offers
   preferential treatment to participate in several project applications
   explicitly inviting geographical focus on the Mediterranean area and/or
   partnerships with a Mediterranean membership.},

Abstract = {Objectives/Context: The main objective of this paper is to present an
   explanation for the divergent development trajectories of two regions of
   the capitalist world-economy, Latin America and East Asia. Methodology:
   starting from the concepts of world-economy, world region, regional
   focus and long duree, it is intended to verify how the forms of
   integration of the two regions to the capitalist world-economy affected
   them in three essential dimensions for economic development: State,
   capital accumulation and technological capability, from the 16th century
   to the present. Conclusions: having autonomously developed the three
   dimensions analyzed to the point of equating to the West at least until
   the end of the 17th century, when it was incorporated into the
   capitalist world-economy in the first half of the 19th century, East
   Asia was able to take advantage of this integration and advance in
   global hierarchies of wealth and power. On the other hand, Latin
   America, which as a geopolitical entity was born together with the
   capitalist world-economy in the 16th century, was at that moment at a
   relatively low level of development in these dimensions, which, together
   with colonialism, continued to restrict its development and maintaining
   the region in its historical position as a periphery of the capitalist
   world-economy. Originality: the originality of this research is to
   establish a historically grounded principle of variation to explain the
   divergence in recent development trajectories of Latin America and East
   Asia.},

Abstract = {Strategic theory dictates that an understanding of a war's character is
   imperative for the achievement of victory in strategic practice. This
   article identifies and analyses extant approaches to the understanding
   of war. These approaches include categorization, strategic analysis and
   historical comparison. A theoretical analysis accompanied by
   illustrative cases indicates that one can achieve the most in-depth
   understanding of a war's character by combining strategic analysis and
   historical comparison, though the process of achieving such
   understanding is difficult and time-consuming.},

Title = {From Diffusion to Diffuse-ability: A Text-as-Data Approach to Explaining
   the Global Diffusion of Corporate Sustainability Policy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {This paper argues that attributes of diffusion objects, in their own
   right, shape the form and extent of policy diffusion. To date, diffusion
   scholarship focuses on actor-level attributes (e.g., connections,
   culture, physical proximity, etc.) to explain what is diffused and how
   much. Extending existing theory on the impacts of policies' textual
   properties on diffusion patterns, we argue that policies that are easier
   to understand, specific in their applicability, and that do not mandate
   specific behavior have their text diffused with less adaptation,
   regardless of the attributes of the authoring organization. We test our
   argument in the context of the global diffusion of corporate
   sustainability policy (CSP), analyzing a novel dataset of 1,429 CSPs
   from 100 countries, 20 international organizations, and 12 regional
   organizations over a 65-year period. Offering a precise measure of
   diffusion as the extent to which a source text is copied into an adopter
   text, we find statistical support for our hypothesis. We contribute to
   diffusion scholarship by helping to mainstream natural language
   processing methods and by theorizing how attributes of policy documents
   affect how much adaptation occurs.
   Este articulo argumenta que lo que determina la forma y el alcance de la
   difusion de las politicas son, por derecho propio, los atributos de los
   objetos de difusion. Hasta la fecha, los estudios de difusion se centran
   en los atributos a nivel de cada agente (por ejemplo, conexiones,
   cultura, proximidad fisica, etc.) con el fin de explicar que es lo que
   se difunde y cuanto. Extendemos la teoria existente sobre los impactos
   de las propiedades textuales de las politicas en los patrones de
   difusion con el fin de argumentar que la difusion de los textos de las
   politicas que son mas faciles de entender, que son especificas en su
   aplicacion y que no exigen un comportamiento especifico, se difunden con
   un menor grado de adaptacion, independientemente de los atributos de la
   organizacion autora. Demostramos este argumento en el contexto de la
   difusion global de la Politica de Sostenibilidad Corporativa (CSP, por
   sus siglas en ingles), analizando un nuevo conjunto de datos procedente
   de 1429 CSP de 100 paises, 20 organizaciones internacionales y 12
   organizaciones regionales durante un periodo de 65 anos. Encontramos
   apoyo estadistico para nuestra hipotesis, a traves de una medida precisa
   de difusion como es el grado en que un texto fuente se copia en un texto
   adoptante. Contribuimos a los estudios sobre difusion ayudando a
   incorporar los metodos de procesamiento del lenguaje natural y
   teorizando como los atributos de los documentos de las politicas afectan
   al grado de adaptacion que se lleva a cabo.
   Cet article affirme que les attributs des objets de diffusion en
   eux-memes faconnent la forme et la portee de la diffusion politique. A
   ce jour, la recherche sur la diffusion se concentre sur les attributs de
   l'acteur (par ex., connexions, culture, proximite physique, etc.) pour
   expliquer ce qui est diffuse et dans quelle mesure. Nous elargissons la
   theorie existante sur les consequences des proprietes textuelles des
   politiques sur les schemas de diffusion pour affirmer que les politiques
   qui sont les plus faciles a comprendre, a l'applicabilite specifique et
   qui ne requierent pas de comportement particulier voient leur texte
   diffuse avec moins d'adaptation, independamment des attributs de
   l'organisation qui les diffuse. Nous evaluons notre argument dans le
   contexte de la diffusion mondiale de la politique de developpement
   durable d'entreprise (PDDE), en analysant un ensemble de donnees inedit
   de 1 429 PDDE issues de 100 pays, 20 organisations internationales et 12
   organisations regionales sur 65 ans. En proposant la mesure dans
   laquelle un texte source est copie dans le texte adopte comme indicateur
   precis de diffusion, nous trouvons des elements statistiques qui etayent
   notre hypothese. Nous contribuons a la recherche sur la diffusion en
   participant a la generalisation des methodes de traitement du langage
   naturel et en theorisant les effets des attributs des documents
   politiques sur la portee de l'adaptation.},

Abstract = {Policy is not only made by street-level bureaucrats at the frontlines.
   It is also made by their superiors-street-level managers-who set the
   organizational conditions through which street-level bureaucrats act.
   Although scholars have documented how street-level bureaucrats cope with
   the pressures of their work by, for instance, breaking or bending rules,
   the question of how street-level managers cope with the pressures of
   their own work has received less attention. Drawing from ethnographic
   data of a network of publicly funded health centers in the Midwestern
   US, I show how street-level managers use an interaction ritual with role
   distance to cope. Role distance is mobilized when the person uses
   communicative expressions such as laughter or cries of frustration to
   convey a critical distance from what her organizational role prescribes.
   Based on classic sociological insights, I posit that role distance can
   function as follows. It can help managers preserve self by allowing them
   to define their putatively ``more-human self{''} from their work, create
   a feeling of collectiveness as they orient themselves to the shared
   frustrations yet obligations that their role engenders, which enables
   them to coordinate on carrying out tasks, even those that rub against
   their preferences and well-intentions. Taken together, I suggest that
   role distance can offer a coping function, which enables them to hold in
   abeyance individual and collective responsibility for the decisions they
   make. I then highlight the benefits and unintended consequences of role
   distance and posit what academics and practitioners can do to ensure
   that street-level managers use role distance toward more productive
   ends.},

Abstract = {How should we measure terrorism? Political scientists typically use
   executed attacks as the dependent variable and test covariates to
   identify factors that produce terrorism. But attacks are an imperfect
   measure of terrorist activity because of `plot attrition' - the tendency
   for plots to derail due to police intervention or other factors. We
   examine whether the exclusion of foiled plots from event datasets
   constitutes a measurement problem in terrorism studies. Building on
   recent advances in plot data collection, we study the correlation
   between plots and attacks and conduct an original analysis of jihadism
   in Europe. Our results suggest common research designs predicting
   terrorism can produce different results depending on whether incidents
   are operationalized as plots or attacks. Adjusting for state security
   capability does not solve the problem. Despite its limitations, plot
   data is a more complete measure of terrorist activity that should be
   incorporated, when available, in quantitative studies of terrorism.},

Abstract = {This article introduces and reports the psychometric properties of the
   Hate Behaviours Scale (HBS), which assesses individual intentions to
   engage in a range of violent and non-violent hateful behaviours against
   various target groups. Three independent U.S. adult samples (total n =
   3524) were used to gather data on the scale and associated covariates
   and constructs. The twelve-item HBS is comprised of three subscales;
   Discrimination, Defensive Violence and Belligerent Violence. The higher
   scores on the HBS were significantly associated with past behaviours
   such as attending a protest against the target group (beta = 0.57, p <
   .001), having physically hit a member of the target group (beta = 0.57,
   p < .001), and sharing an offensive joke online about the target group
   (beta = 0.51, p < .001). This new measure provides a modifiable, easy to
   use, reliable and valid multi-component scale for assessing hate against
   different target groups. It should allow researchers to reliably assess
   individual levels of hate, and establish relationships with other
   demographic, social, situational, and psychological characteristics. The
   HBS provides a short and cost-effective tool to inform and evaluate
   counter violent extremism interventions aimed at reducing the potential
   for hateful behaviours.},

Abstract = {Major weapon system imports are significant as they are useful for
   domestic and international security. However, states regularly imported
   weapons they want in addition to weapons they need. One explanation is
   that states import unnecessary weapons to gain status. We argue that
   states suffering from higher levels of negative status inconsistency
   (SI) import a greater proportion of status symbol weapons. To account
   for differing security motives, we also separate non-democratic regime
   types - strongman, junta, boss, and machine - as they vary in their
   international conflict propensity and domestic stability. Due to the
   differences across these regimes, we further argue that non-democratic
   personalist regimes will import more status symbol weapons. Using data
   covering 1965-1999, we find that negatively status inconsistent regimes
   import more status symbol weapons.},

Abstract = {Policy integration has become an important principle guiding public
   policy development. Despite its prominence, we lack comprehensive
   knowledge of the exact degree of policy integration and its variation
   across policy sectors and time, mainly due to the lack of systematic
   measurement approaches. We address this shortcoming by (1) developing a
   novel measure that evaluates the intersectorality of legal acts and (2)
   assessing its development in the European Union over four decades
   (1977-2019) for 16 policy sectors. Our mapping reveals that, on average,
   intersectoral policy-making has increased since the 1990s with the most
   substantial rise during the Barroso I and II Commissions and a trend
   reversal after Juncker took office in 2014. Furthermore, we identify
   substantial variation in intersectoral policy-making between different
   policy areas reflecting varying levels of political attention and public
   salience. We deem our measurement concept and findings to have important
   implications for the study of policy integration in general and the
   study of EU policies in particular.},

Title = {Preaching the ``Traditional Family{''} in the Romanian Parliament: The
   Political Stakes and Meanings of a Hegemonic Narrative},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {616-638},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this article, we examine a decade of parliamentary debates related to
   the topic of family to understand the reasons and the rhetorical
   strategies that drive the support of the Romanian MPs for the
   traditional family. Starting from four themes identified in the
   literature as relevant for the topic of family-national identity,
   religion, heteronormativity, and children-we identify the dominant
   definition of the ``traditional family{''} as that of the Christian
   Romanian family founded and defended by ancestors, that is, the union
   between a man and a woman, for the purpose of reproduction, as the only
   place that can guarantee that children will grow up in a healthy and
   moral environment. This hegemonic narrative is enhanced by the
   anti-gender campaign repertoire and strengthened by populist logic,
   aiming to restore the true Romanians values-Christian, ancestral, and
   national-in opposition to contemporary Western relativism and the
   alleged colonial cultural project of gender equality+ politics. The
   decadent present, threatening national identity, the continuity of the
   people, Christian values, the natural gender order, or the safety of
   children, can only be saved by returning to the traditional family,
   which functions as a hegemonic signifier re-imposing, in the logic of
   the narrative of return, a nationalist, conservative, and religious
   definition of the family, based on biological and natural foundations
   and necessarily heteronormative and chauvinist.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationships between conflict, climate
   change, and disaster in forced displacement contexts. We present these
   nexus dynamics through the case of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh who
   are exposed to climatic hazards and other vulnerabilities that threaten
   their lives and livelihoods. Having fled persecution by the Myanmar
   military, Rohingya refugees face a range of conflict- and
   climate-related risks, both in the overcrowded and disaster-prone camps
   in Cox's Bazar and on the island of Bhasan Char where Bangladeshi
   authorities have relocated tens of thousands of people. The protracted
   refugee crisis has exacerbated social tensions between the Rohingya and
   host communities; limited access to resources and exposure to
   significant hazards that exacerbate conflict-induced displacement
   challenges. This paper contributes to the nascent literature on the
   region's conflict, climate change, and disaster displacement nexus by
   examining how cascading risks and state fragility contribute to
   increased instability. The article demonstrates the need for a more
   nuanced understanding of how conflict-induced displacement leads to new
   threats and vulnerabilities in hazard-prone environments.},

Abstract = {In 2019, the prime ministers of the United Kingdom and Australia both
   declared their intent to ban indirect, or secondary, boycotts. In the
   United Kingdom, the ban was directed against public bodies engaging in
   the ``boycott, divest, and sanction{''} (BDS) campaign against Israel.
   In Australia, the proposed ban was directed against environmental action
   groups. Research on market-based activism to date has focused primarily
   on conceptualizing the use of the market by nonstate actors to achieve
   social change, with less attention paid to the role of the state in
   these dynamics. State efforts to curtail social movements' repertoires
   of contention require careful scrutiny to understand the state's role in
   legitimizing or delegitimizing political activism and to reveal the
   complex power dynamics between corporations, social movements, and the
   state. This article analyzes two key instances of the state declaring an
   intent to prevent activists from protesting through the market. By
   investigating how indirect boycotts were problematized by state actors,
   we aim to reveal the rationale behind the state's intervention in
   marketplace politics. Our findings indicate that opposition to the
   political cause behind the boycott, rather than a problematization of
   the strategy itself, drives state intervention.},

Abstract = {Evidence suggests that firms frequently over-comply with U.S.
   sanctions-a process also known as ``de-risking.{''} We argue that U.S.
   enforcement of its economic sanctions has contributed to this phenomenon
   to the extent that we can observe a systematic relationship between U.S.
   sanctions enforcement and third-party trade with U.S. sanction targets.
   Specifically, we theorize that, the greater the frequency and severity
   of sanctions enforcement penalties imposed by the U.S. against sanctions
   violators, the more third-party trade with U.S. sanction targets will
   decline. Analyzing data from 2003 to 2015, we find that U.S. sanctions
   enforcement actions correlate with significant declines in dyadic trade
   between third-party states and U.S. sanctions targets, even when
   enforcement actions target parties external to that dyad. This suggests
   that the U.S.'s enforcement of its sanctions magnifies the harm that
   U.S. sanctions inflict on target economies.},

Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},

Abstract = {This analysis examined whether commonly assumed associations between
   personal values and political attitudes within countries varied
   worldwide by the level of democratic governance. In less democratic
   countries, people may have less exposure to or engagement with value
   expression through political party affiliation and experience less
   motivation to express values through political attitudes. Therefore, in
   such countries, the commonly assumed association of personal values
   typically labeled ``conservative{''} (e.g., tradition) or ``liberal{''}
   (e.g., universalism) with right- or left-wing political ideologies could
   be weaker. Furthermore, less democratic governments are more likely to
   be perceived as a deciding presence in economic outcomes than the
   people's or the market's will, which could alter the degree to which
   right-wing economic attitudes toward free markets and private enterprise
   are associated with conservative values. Responses to the World Value
   Survey across 60 countries were largely consistent with these moderation
   effects when operationalizing democratic governance using both more
   objective, structural, and subjective, perceptual metrics. In less
   democratic countries, conservation-oriented personal values were less
   positively associated with broad right-wing political identification and
   self-transcendence-oriented values less positively associated with broad
   left-wing political identification. In less democratic countries,
   conservation-oriented values were more negatively associated with
   right-wing economic attitudes.},

Abstract = {A collaboration's ability to convene diverse stakeholders and knowledge
   is often associated with success. However, a more nuanced evaluation of
   representation is needed to understand if meeting-level factors (e.g.,
   who attends as well as including facilitators or external technical
   experts) influence representation. This article examines representation
   via two-way communication in meetings to explore: (1) patterns of
   discussion across sectors (i.e., appointed citizens, agency delegates,
   and external stakeholders), (2) how patterns of discussion change given
   attendance differences across sectors, and (3) how meeting-level factors
   associate with observed discussion patterns. Using meeting-level data,
   across three US, state-level, legislatively-mandated environmental
   justice councils, results suggest: (1) sectors have different patterns
   of how much and with whom they discuss, (2) retreat meetings increase
   discussion for all, and (3) other meeting-level factors and discussion
   patterns are narrowly focused to specific sectors. The discussion
   applies the findings of this study to the broader field of collaborative
   governance.},

Abstract = {Global IR is an encompassing term for a range of work that has set out
   to globalize the discipline in terms of its core concepts, assumptions,
   and substantive areas of study. Our symposium supports Global IR's goals
   but also offers some friendly critiques of the project with the aim of
   increasing its impact and durability. In this Introduction to the
   symposium, we posit that Global IR is vulnerable to a dynamic that
   limits its capacity to upend the status quo, which we term the
   `essentialism trap'. Essentialism captures a range of commitments
   oriented around the notion that the world is constituted by pre-formed,
   fixed, internally coherent, and bounded social forms. The trap involves
   the overuse of essentialist categories by radical projects, a process
   that can result in the reinforcement of status quo categories and
   assumptions. With reference to previous openings in IR that have
   succumbed to this trap, we identify the dynamics that lead to this trap
   and suggest ways in which Global IR can avoid it by leaning more into
   relationalism and global history, and, thereby, fulfil the promise
   contained in the range of movements it speaks with and for.},

Abstract = {Nonprofits are increasingly involved in cross-sectoral collaborations
   with the public sector. However, we know little about the dynamics
   behind these collaborations and what happens to them in politically
   contested fields where actors may have divergent positions. In this
   article, a multi-country comparison of data gathered from
   semi-structured interviews (n = 68) with representatives of nonprofits
   involved in the labor market inclusion of newcomers is presented. Our
   findings indicate that, in politically contested fields, the possibility
   of participating in cross-sectoral collaborations (political autonomy)
   is influenced by nonprofits' financial and ideological autonomy. Welfare
   models and migration regimes play a fundamental role in shaping the
   inclusion of these organizations in collaborations, and in most cases,
   the collaborations are based on latent conflicts. Our article discusses
   that if the costs of autonomy associated with cross-sectoral
   collaborations are not offset, the collaboration in a politically
   contested field becomes a liability for nonprofits (and their
   beneficiaries).},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to explore the role of rebel group legitimacy and
   ideology in durable peace (DP) following peace agreements to end civil
   wars. It builds on earlier research showing that justice and civil
   society involvement are critical in achieving DP. This study adds the
   impacts of rebel group activities and support on DP. Activities include
   service delivery and mobilization. Support is gauged with outcomes of
   presidential and parliamentary elections held following peace
   agreements.Design/methodology/approachFive data sets were used to
   measure the key variables: DP, inclusive commissions (IC), legitimacy
   symmetry (electoral outcomes), service delivery and ideological
   mobilization. A measure of rebel group integration in the political
   system was also constructed. Impacts of the integration, legitimacy and
   ideology variables were assessed with a hierarchical regression model
   (HRM). This study begins with a base model drawn from earlier research
   showing the key predictors were procedural justice (PJ) and IC. The
   authors ask about the extent to which the rebel group variables
   contribute additional variance to the prediction of DP.FindingsThe main
   contributors to the prediction of DP were PJ, IC and integration in the
   political system. None of the legitimacy or mobilization variables added
   significant variance to the prediction. Only one of the mobilization
   variables, forced recruitment, was significant. The decision to
   integrate into the political system following the agreement did not
   mediate the relationship between PJ in the negotiation process and DP.
   Results of a factor analysis showed that DP, PJ, IC and integration
   formed a cluster with strong loadings on the first factor.Research
   limitations/implicationsThe negative results for the legitimacy and
   mobilization variables may not be the last word on rebel group
   influences. Lack of support for the key hypotheses spurs attempts to
   discover other sources that contribute to the survival of rebel group
   actors in the political system and, in turn, to DP.Practical
   implicationsThe issues raised by this study contribute to debates about
   ways to attain peaceful relations among competing groups following a
   civil war. It appears that attention to factors inside and around the
   negotiation process (PJ, ICs and conversion) may be more important than
   rebel group activities outside of these processes. The results call
   attention, in particular, to the important role played by political
   integration. From a policy perspective, it would be useful to develop
   levers for encouraging rebel groups to emerge as political actors in the
   post-agreement environment.Originality/valueDeveloping measures of the
   symmetry of rebel group legitimacy and integration in the context of a
   comparative case study are the primary original contributions of this
   study. Furthermore, the mode of analysis (HRM) is novel in this
   literature. This approach builds on and extends the earlier research on
   factors influencing DP.},

Title = {Russia as a hybrid threat to Moldova in the context of the
   Russian-Ukrainian war},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 21},
Abstract = {Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in February 2022 has largely
   shaken Europe's existing security architecture. The neighbouring
   Republic of Moldova, home to a Russian military contingent, has also
   expressed concerns about its security. These soldiers are stationed in
   Transnistria, a de facto state on Moldovan territory. Based on the field
   research conducted, the present article aims to clarify how the Kremlin
   exploits the internal vulnerabilities of Moldova in creating hybrid
   threats in this country in the context of the current conflict in
   Ukraine and how the Moldovan government copes with them while facing the
   new security situation. The authors conclude that despite the Moldovan
   government's efforts to limit Russian hybrid operations on its
   territory, the Kremlin has effectively destabilised Moldova, except for
   its energy dependence on Russia. In this regard, the Moldovan government
   is succeeding in taking the necessary steps towards greater energy
   independence from Russia.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses Remembrance of Earth's Past, also known as The
   Three-Body Trilogy, by Liu Cixin and its connections to Chinese politics
   and Historical IR. I examine how the Trilogy as a contemporary
   pop-cultural artefact and a fictional narrative sustains, recrafts and
   critically deals with the historical, conceived here as constructions of
   history, historical trajectories and the key historic challenges. I
   respond to the call of this special issue to consider new dimensions of
   how storytelling and Historical IR can be disruptive. On the theoretical
   level, I distinguish the notions of external and internal disruptions
   (critiques) with the help of pragmatism and post-colonialism. On the
   empirical level, I argue that the Trilogy offers an internal critique of
   China's long-term obsession with developmentalist modernisation by
   expressing ironies and uncertainties of it. It reveals limits
   ('selvedges') of development(alism) by showing that it is ultimately
   unachievable, unnecessary and uncontrollable. In other words, the
   internal disruption stems from exposing the final frontiers of the given
   tradition where its internal logic starts to crumble.},

Abstract = {How does contracting out affect service performance? Evidence to date is
   mixed. We argue that this is partially due to prior studies focusing
   often on whether-not how-services are contracted. Yet, how services are
   contracted matters. In particular, we argue that whether users pay user
   fees for services to contractors affects efficiency. Where they do,
   contractor revenue depends on user satisfaction and contractors face
   incentives to provide quality services to users to retain revenue.
   Where, by contrast, governments fund services, information asymmetry
   about the quality of services users receive allows contractors to shirk
   quality. The assertion is substantiated by empirical evidence derived
   from a comprehensive analysis of conditional efficiency within the water
   supply services across 2,111 municipalities in Spain, employing a
   two-stage conditional order-m data panel estimation. Our results show
   that contracting out where users pay service fees and thus have
   incentives to hold contractors accountable outperforms contracting out
   without user fees in quality-adjusted service provision.},

Abstract = {This short paper summarizes the key findings of a collaborative project
   looking at civic actors' role in promoting more equitable taxation
   across seven countries. Their examples show that effective tax advocacy
   usually relies on multiple strategies that engage diverse actors-from
   public officials and legislators to the media and broader civic
   coalitions. Moreover, progress depends on building robust and convincing
   narratives around the need for tax reform and deploying different kinds
   of capacities-for technical analysis, political engagement and
   compelling communications. Ultimate success often builds on past
   failures. In this sense, civil society tax advocacy is a long-haul
   endeavor that requires organizations to have a long-term vision and
   learn and adapt.},

Title = {The Elusive Effect of Political Trust on Participation: Participatory
   Resource or (Dis)incentive?},

Abstract = {Although political trust has long been linked to political
   participation, its effects remain elusive. Trust in political
   institutions may enhance levels of participation, diminish political
   engagement, or yield distinct effects depending on the activity. This
   article examines these diverging effects through a rational choice
   framework, with which we theorize and test whether political trust
   functions as a resource or a (dis)incentive to participate.
   Specifically, we assess the direct effects of political trust on
   intended participation and its moderating effects on outcome-related
   motivations and activity type. To this end, we use a factorial survey
   experiment in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom to isolate the
   effects of outcome-related motivations and to disentangle participation
   from the effectiveness of action and the effect of activity type,
   factors that remain confounded in existing survey measures of
   participation. Overall, our findings suggest that political trust
   operates as a (dis)incentive, rather than a resource spurring
   participation.},

Abstract = {Privately financed infrastructure agreements (PFIAs) are increasingly
   being used across the globe, bringing private money into the delivery of
   public goods. How does introducing private actors to such a process
   change how we think about distributive politics? I investigate this
   question using both quantitative and qualitative analyses, uncovering a
   relationship consistent with PFIAs being used as distributive goods and
   exploring how the credit-claim potential of PFIAs may affect their
   distributive use. My quantitative analyses (on 16 middle-income
   countries) present evidence suggestive of a relationship between
   electoral variables and the likelihood of a PFIA being present in a
   district. In districts aligned with the national ruling party, PFIAs are
   more likely to be concentrated in swing districts than core districts. I
   find that this relationship is more pronounced for PFIAs that are more
   directly attributable to the government. My qualitative press analysis
   provides insights into how politicians use various features of PFIAs to
   create credit-claiming opportunities.},

Title = {What Counts as Transitional Justice Scholarship? Citational Recognition
   and Disciplinary Hierarchies in Theory and Practice},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {Since its emergence as a field of scholarship and practice, transitional
   justice has coalesced around a set of mechanisms to deal with a legacy
   of violence. The ``pull{''} toward mechanisms, institutions, and
   structures as a means of delivering justice has led to certain kinds of
   knowledge being recognized as ``transitional justice research{''} in the
   mainstream. Drawing on the theory of epistemic positioning, we reveal
   how hierarchies of academic knowledge and the dominant ``ways of
   knowing{''} in and of transitional justice are created. Through citation
   analysis, we reveal an emerging canon, a central body of valuable and
   seemingly ``inevitable{''} knowledge of transitional justice consisting
   primarily of structure and outcome-oriented inquiries in the disciplines
   of politics, international relations, and law and consolidating a
   standardized model of how to ``do{''} transitional justice. We argue
   that this canonization comes at the expenses of alternative approaches
   that challenge the core assumptions of the field. Inquiries that
   prioritize agency or process and reimagine what transitional justice
   could be remain bounded to their disciplines and subfields. We
   demonstrate how certain anxieties about the survival of the field result
   in policing of the boundaries of the field, creating hierarchies of
   ``valuable{''} knowledge, and resisting the ``decolonizing{''} impulse.

   de justicia transicional >>. Partimos de la teoria del posicionamiento
   epistemico para revelar como se crean las jerarquias del conocimiento
   academico y las << formas de conocimiento >> dominantes tanto en la
   justicia transicional como a partir de ella. Revelamos, mediante un
   analisis de citas, un canon emergente: un conjunto central de
   conocimiento valioso y aparentemente << inevitable >> de la justicia
   transicional que esta formado, principalmente, por investigaciones
   orientadas a la estructura y a los resultados dentro las disciplinas de
   la politica, las relaciones internacionales y el derecho, asi como a la
   consolidacion de un modelo estandarizado sobre como << hacer >> justicia
   transicional. Argumentamos que esta canonizacion se produce a expensas
   de otros enfoques alternativos que desafian las principales premisas de
   este campo. Las investigaciones que priorizan a la agencia o al proceso,
   y que reimaginan lo que podria ser la justicia transicional permanecen
   limitadas a sus disciplinas y subcampos. Demostramos como algunas de las
   ansiedades que existen con relacion a la supervivencia del campo
   provocan una vigilancia de las fronteras de este campo, creando
   jerarquias de conocimiento << valioso >> y resistiendose al impulso <<
   descolonizador >>.
   Depuis son apparition comme domaine de recherche et pratique, la justice
   transitionnelle s'est unie autour d'un ensemble de mecanismes pour
   traiter de l'heritage de la violence. L'attirance pour les mecanismes,
   les institutions et les structures comme moyens de rendre la justice a
   mene a la reconnaissance de certains types de savoir comme << recherche
   sur la justice transitionnelle >> dans l'opinion majoritaire. En nous
   fondant sur la theorie du positionnement epistemique, nous devoilons le
   processus de creation des connaissances academiques et des << moyens de
   connaissance >> dominants de justice transitionnelle. A l'aide d'une
   analyse de citations, nous revelons un canon emergeant, un ensemble
   central de connaissances precieuses et apparemment << inevitables >> de
   la justice transitionnelle, principalement constitue de recherches
   relatives a la structure et aux resultats dans les disciplines de la
   politique, des relations internationales et du droit, et qui consolide
   un modele standardise sur la facon de rendre la justice transitionnelle.
   Nous affirmons que cette canonisation s'effectue aux depens d'autres
   approches qui remettent en question les hypotheses dominantes du
   domaine. Les recherches qui mettent l'accent sur le role ou le
   processus, et qui reinventent la justice transitionnelle, restent
   cantonnees a leur discipline et sous-champ. Nous demontrons que
   certaines inquietudes concernant la survie d'une discipline peuvent
   aboutir sur une surveillance accrue des frontieres du domaine, ce qui
   cree des hierarchies de connaissances << precieuses >> et va a
   l'encontre de l'elan de << decolonisation >>.},

Abstract = {Scholarship on the advisability of territorial accommodation in
   conflict-torn societies prioritises attention to the political and
   identity-based factors that fuel societal divisions and often complicate
   the success of such forms of accommodation. Yet these divisions are
   themselves shaped by the boundaries that delineate who lives within the
   territory being accommodated. Here we focus on the critical question of
   whether the borders of the territorial unit to potentially receive
   autonomy are clearly demarcated when peace is established or, instead,
   form an essential and continued part of the post-conflict space. Where
   demarcation remains unsettled, elites will encourage perceptions of
   societal differences - among identity groups, insurgent factions, and
   political networks - that subsequently lead to conflict continuation or
   re-emergence. To evaluate this argument, we leverage two similar cases -
   Aceh in Indonesia and Mindanao in the Philippines - where much of the
   conventional wisdom fails to explain divergent outcomes in trajectories
   of peace and conflict.},

Title = {Resilience, Vulnerability, and Social Isolation: Barriers to Poverty
   Reduction in War},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {The majority of the world's ultra-poor live in conflict-affected
   environments. Poverty reduction efforts are increasingly attempting to
   target the most vulnerable inhabitants of these settings. Few studies
   have so far examined their impacts. Against the backdrop of one of the
   largest humanitarian crises in recent years, survey data from the
   Central African Republic demonstrates that a year after the conclusion
   of a large social safety net program, the poorest female participants
   did not benefit proportionately to other women and men. We draw on 257
   in-depth qualitative interviews in extremely difficult-to-access
   conflict-affected sites across the country to explore the puzzle of why
   the most vulnerable inhabitants of conflict-affected settings may fail
   to benefit equally from poverty reduction programs. We demonstrate that
   conditions of social isolation-rather than poverty itself-create two
   specific barriers to long-term benefits. First, social isolation means
   that the poorest women recipients lack the social support networks that
   permit others to respond to conflict-related shocks without draining all
   their new income on emergency spending. Second, small social networks
   create a shortage of labor and higher start-up costs for new
   revenue-generating activities, thereby preventing spending on investment
   opportunities. These factors highlight the social barriers to poverty
   reduction, which are often intensified by shocks born from war, that
   material aid alone fails to redress.
   La mayoria de las personas en situacion de extrema pobreza en el mundo
   viven en entornos afectados por conflictos. Los esfuerzos en materia de
   reduccion de la pobreza intentan dirigirse cada vez mas a los habitantes
   mas vulnerables dentro de estos entornos. Hasta ahora, han existido
   pocos estudios que han examinado los impactos de estos esfuerzos.
   Tomamos los datos procedentes de una encuesta que tuvo lugar en la
   Republica Centroafricana, dentro del contexto de una de las mayores
   crisis humanitarias de los ultimos anos. Estos datos demuestran que, un
   ano despues de la conclusion de un gran programa de redes de seguridad
   social, las mujeres participantes mas pobres no se beneficiaron de este
   programa de una manera proporcionalmente equivalente a otras mujeres y
   hombres. Nos basamos en 257 entrevistas cualitativas en profundidad
   llevadas a cabo en sitios extremadamente dificiles de acceder y que
   habian sido afectados por conflictos por todo el pais con el fin de
   explorar el misterio de por que los habitantes mas vulnerables de los
   entornos afectados por conflictos pueden no llegar a beneficiarse por
   igual de los programas de reduccion de la pobreza. Demostramos que las
   condiciones de aislamiento social, y no tanto la pobreza por si misma,
   crean dos barreras especificas para los beneficios a largo plazo. En
   primer lugar, el aislamiento social significa que las mujeres
   potencialmente receptoras mas pobres carecen de las redes de apoyo
   social que permiten a otros responder a las crisis relacionadas con los
   conflictos sin necesidad de agotar todos sus nuevos ingresos en gastos
   de emergencia. En segundo lugar, las pequenas redes sociales crean una
   escasez de mano de obra y unos mayores costes iniciales para la puesta
   en marcha de nuevas actividades generadoras de ingresos, lo que
   obstaculiza el gasto en oportunidades de inversion. Estos factores ponen
   de relieve las barreras sociales que existen para la reduccion de la
   pobreza. Estas barreras se intensifican con frecuencia debido a las
   conmociones nacidas de la guerra y que la ayuda material por si sola no
   logra reparar.
   La majorite des ultra-pauvres du monde vivent dans des environnements
   soumis a un conflit. Les efforts de reduction de la pauvrete essaient de
   plus en plus de cibler les habitants les plus vulnerables de ces
   regions. Jusqu'ici, peu d'etudes se sont interessees a leurs effets. Sur
   toile de fond de l'une des plus grandes crises humanitaires de ces
   dernieres annees, des donnees de sondage issues de Republique
   centrafricaine demontrent qu'un an apres la conclusion d'un grand
   programme de filet de securite social, les participantes les plus
   pauvres n'en avaient pas beneficie equitablement par rapport aux autres
   femmes et hommes. Nous nous fondons sur 257 entretiens approfondis dans
   des sites soumis au conflit et extremement difficiles d'acces du pays
   pour etudier les raisons compliquees qui expliquent pourquoi les
   habitants les plus vulnerables de ces regions ne beneficient pas de
   maniere equitable des programmes de reduction de la pauvrete. Nous
   demontrons que les conditions d'isolation sociale, plutot que la
   pauvrete en elle-meme, creent deux barrieres specifiques aux benefices
   sur le long terme. D'abord, a cause de l'isolation sociale, les
   beneficiaires feminines les plus pauvres ne jouissent pas du reseau de
   soutien social qui permet aux autres de faire face aux crises liees au
   conflit, sans utiliser tous leurs nouveaux revenus dans des depenses
   urgentes. Ensuite, les petits reseaux sociaux entrainent une penurie de
   main-d'\& OELIG;uvre et des couts de demarrage plus eleves pour les
   nouvelles activites generatrices de revenus, et donc limitent les
   investissements dans des opportunites. Ces facteurs mettent en evidence
   les barrieres sociales auxquelles est confrontee la reduction de la
   pauvrete. Elles sont d'ailleurs souvent aggravees par les crises issues
   de la guerre, auxquelles l'aide materielle, a elle seule, ne peut
   remedier.},

Abstract = {Do political institutions matter in explaining how economic sanctions
   are used? The current understanding of sanctions imposed by
   non-democratic sender countries is limited in the literature, as
   existing theories predominantly focus on the behaviors and strategies of
   democratic sender countries, leaving a notable gap in systematic
   comprehension. Using the existing dataset on sanctions, we theoretically
   and empirically distinguished characteristics of sanctions by
   non-democracies in terms of their motivating issues, types, and
   objectives. We also assessed our arguments based on recent data on
   Chinese and Russian sanctions since 2005 and a case illustration of
   China's de facto sanctions on South Korea for the Terminal High Altitude
   Area Defense deployment beginning in 2017.
   Tienen alguna relevancia las instituciones politicas a la hora de
   explicar como se utilizan las sanciones economicas? La comprension
   actual de las sanciones impuestas por los paises emisores no
   democraticos es limitada en la bibliografia, debido a que las teorias
   existentes se centran predominantemente en los comportamientos y
   estrategias de los paises emisores democraticos, dejando abierta una
   brecha notable en la comprension sistematica de esta materia.
   Distinguimos, tanto de manera teorica como empirica, las caracteristicas
   de las sanciones emitidas por parte de las no democracias en terminos de
   las cuestiones que las motivaron, asi como sus tipos y objetivos,
   mediante el uso de un conjunto de datos ya existente en materia de
   sanciones. Tambien evaluamos nuestros argumentos en base a datos
   recientes sobre sanciones por parte de China y de Rusia desde 2005 y
   ofrecemos una ilustracion de caso de las sanciones ``de facto{''} por
   parte de China contra Corea del Sur por el despliegue del THAAD a partir
   de 2017.
   Les institutions politiques importent-elles quand il s'agit d'expliquer
   l'utilisation des sanctions economiques ? Actuellement, dans la
   litterature, notre comprehension des sanctions imposees par les pays
   emetteurs non democratiques est limitee, car les theories existantes se
   concentrent principalement sur les comportements et strategies des pays
   emetteurs democratiques. La comprehension systematique presente donc une
   lacune notable. A l'aide de l'ensemble de donnees existant sur les
   sanctions, nous distinguons sur le plan theorique et empirique les
   caracteristiques des sanctions des pays non democratiques par rapport
   aux problematiques qui les motivent, aux types et aux objectifs. Nous
   evaluons egalement nos arguments d'apres des donnees recentes sur des
   sanctions chinoises et russes depuis 2005 et une illustration de cas des
   sanctions de facto de la Chine a l'encontre de la Coree du Sud

Title = {Killing Protests with Kindness: Anti-China Protests and China's Public
   Diplomacy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {Anti-China protests have posed challenges to China's ambition to further
   expand its political and economic influence globally. How does Beijing
   respond to anti-China protests? And how do anti-China protests affect
   Beijing's use of public diplomatic resources? We address these questions
   by examining the effect of anti-China protests on China's public
   diplomatic engagement across low- and middle-income countries in Asia.
   We argue that anti-China protests lead to an increased level of
   non-financial public diplomatic engagement (e.g., elite visits) as well
   as financial engagement through foreign aid. We further argue that the
   effect of anti-China protests on increasing public diplomatic engagement
   is contingent on regime type. This is because China takes the anti-China
   message from autocracies more seriously given the higher political costs
   of participating in public protests in autocracies. Compared to
   democracies, autocracies are also in a better position to use anti-China
   protests as a means to signal their political constraints, compelling
   China to invest more public diplomatic resources for the countries.
   Las protestas contra China han planteado desafios a la ambicion por
   parte de China de expandir, aun mas, su influencia politica y economica
   a nivel mundial. Como responde Pekin a estas protestas contra China?
   Cual es el efecto que tienen estas protestas contra China sobre el uso
   de los recursos diplomaticos publicos por parte de Beijing? Abordamos
   estas preguntas estudiando el efecto que tienen las protestas contra
   China sobre los compromisos diplomaticos publicos de China en los paises
   de ingresos medios y bajos de Asia. Argumentamos que las protestas
   contra China provocan un aumento del compromiso diplomatico publico no
   financiero (por ejemplo, visitas de elite), asi como un compromiso
   financiero, que se manifiesta a traves de la ayuda extranjera. Ademas,
   argumentamos que el efecto que pueden llegar a tener las protestas
   contra China sobre el aumento del compromiso diplomatico publico depende
   del tipo de regimen. Esto se debe a que China se toma mas en serio el
   mensaje anti-China por parte de las autocracias, ya que la participacion
   en protestas publicas tiene un mayor coste politico en las autocracias.
   En comparacion con las democracias, las autocracias tambien estan en una
   mejor posicion para utilizar las protestas contra China como un medio de
   senalar sus limitaciones politicas, lo que obligaria a China a invertir
   mas recursos diplomaticos publicos en esos paises.
   Les manifestations contre la Chine ont remis en question les desseins
   chinois d'elargissement de son influence politique et economique
   mondiale. Quelle est la reponse de Pekin aux manifestations anti-Chine ?
   Et comment ces manifestations affectent-elles l'utilisation de Pekin des
   ressources diplomatiques publiques ? Nous repondons a ces questions en
   nous interessant a l'effet des manifestations anti-Chine sur
   l'engagement diplomatique public chinois dans les pays d'Asie aux
   revenus faibles et intermediaires. Nous affirmons que les manifestations
   anti-Chine debouchent sur une augmentation du niveau d'engagement
   diplomatique public non financier (par exemple, des visites aux elites)
   ainsi que l'engagement financier par le biais de l'aide etrangere. Nous
   affirmons en outre que l'effet des manifestations contre la Chine sur
   l'augmentation de l'engagement diplomatique public depend du type de
   regime. En effet, la Chine prend plus au serieux les messages anti-Chine
   emanant des autocraties, etant donne le cout plus eleve de participation
   a des manifestations publiques dans ce type de regime. Par rapport aux
   democraties, les autocraties sont aussi mieux placees pour utiliser les
   manifestations contre la Chine pour indiquer leurs contraintes
   politiques, et ainsi obliger la Chine a investir davantage de ressources
   diplomatiques publiques pour les pays.},

Abstract = {A generation of scholars, writers and diplomats, mostly born in the
   1930s, who grew up in depression and war but became young adults at the
   advent of a new era of security and comfort, is fading away. John le
   Carre, one of the great post-war writers of any genre, rendered in his
   spy fiction Britain's post-imperial reckoning, and brought back in 2017
   George Smiley, his most acutely realised spy, to lament the folly of
   Brexit. Five more children of the 1920s, 30s and 40s who were important
   contributors this journal have died in recent years. Michael Howard
   (1922-2019), Ronald Steel (1931-2023), Pierre Hassner (1933-2018), David
   Calleo (1934-2023) and James Dobbins (1942-2023) each reflected shrewdly
   and profoundly on war and peace, global politics, and the US and Europe.
   At a time when the world appears to be regressing, we might best honour
   this generation by holding to the fictional Smiley's vision `of leading
   Europe out of her darkness towards a new age of reason'.},

Journal = {SURVIVAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {65},
Number = {5},
Pages = {117-142},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {The potential impact of generative AI across politics, governance and
   war is enormous, and is the subject of considerable speculation informed
   by few hard facts. Yet it is possible to identify some major challenges.
   They include threats to democracies by privately controlled models that
   gain tremendous power to shape discourse and affect democratic
   deliberation; enhanced surveillance and propaganda dissemination by
   authoritarian regimes; new capacities for criminal and terrorist actors
   to carry out cyber attacks and related disruptions; and transformed war
   planning and military operations reflecting the accelerated
   dehumanisation of lethal force. While new innovations historically
   require time to take root, generative AI is likely to be adopted
   swiftly. Stakeholders must formulate pragmatic approaches to manage
   oncoming risks.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the position of the Christian churches on the
   protests in Belarus in 2020. This study contributes to the research on
   the state-society relationship in autocratic regimes by nuancing the
   thesis that civil society is either marginalized or fully co-opted by
   the authoritarian state. The protest wave showed that the initiatives of
   religious groups fostered collective action in a state system that is
   punitive of any dissent. The article identifies churches as an
   ambivalent space: one where the state can exercise social control, but
   where potential resistance to the repressive state might also occur
   since they enjoy a greater degree of freedom than other organizations in
   authoritarian Belarus. Moreover, our study argues that religion can be
   seen as a privileged arena of protest within existing legal frameworks
   of the ``contract{''} between the state and the church. By looking at
   the societal engagement of different religious confessions campaigning
   for their rights and promoting their visions of desirable political
   development on the grassroots level, this article addresses a range of
   opportunities to engage in civic activism in Belarus.},

Abstract = {The European Union established the Recovery and Resilience Facility
   (RRF) to address the socio-economic impact of Covid-19. The RRF promotes
   domestic ownership through increased engagement of national authorities
   with stakeholders. However, empirical manifestations of ownership remain
   unclear. This study refines the concept of `ownership' and analyses the
   engagement of social actors in the formulation of National Recovery and
   Resilience Plans (NRRPs) in Croatia, the Netherlands and Sweden. The
   findings indicate that all three countries exhibit limited procedural
   ownership, while the extent of substantive ownership varies based on
   pre-existing conditions. Interestingly, higher financial allocation can
   hinder the ownership of social actors, although low allocations do not
   necessarily facilitate their involvement. Time pressures and divergent
   time horizons between EU and national politics further undermine
   domestic ownership. While the centralised preparation of NRRPs has led
   to the concentration of ownership primarily in the hands of governments,
   poor governance of NRRPs could erode legitimacy.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on right-wing populists (RWP) in power and their
   discourses and policy preferences on environmental issues. Through a
   content and frame analysis of electoral manifestos, party communication
   and semi-structured, in-depth interviews with party representatives,
   this paper examines whether ideological or contextual factors (political
   opportunities) determine RWP positioning on the environment. By focusing
   on the only three cases in Europe of RWP in government in a prominent
   position, i.e. alone or as a major coalition partner (also representing
   key ideological varieties of RWP), Law and Justice - PiS in Poland;
   Fidesz in Hungary and Lega in Italy, this study shows that ideological
   positions (and especially differences) are less important in determining
   RWP environmental discourses than are opportunities and
   institutionalization. Moreover, we also find that the shared features
   across these actors reflect a conditional, `yes-but' environmentalism of
   these parties, embedded in the discourse of ecological modernization and
   oppositional, Manichean framing.},

Abstract = {Campaign rallies are commonly understood as events where politicians
   appeal to a crowd of prospective voters to politically mobilise them.
   This article argues that an underexplored dimension of rallies is where
   they are used as performances to shape alliance-building between
   subnational and national politicians. Through focusing on two rallies
   organised by gubernatorial campaigns in Marsabit county, Kenya, for the
   president during the 2017 elections, the article shows how these rallies
   were used as tools to secure electoral alliances with the president's
   campaign. It shows how organisers choreographed the crowd - through
   colour, props and positioning - to perform to the president their
   grassroots popularity, to secure electoral and post-election futures.
   This article builds on scholarship that takes a more complex look at
   what messages are performed at rallies, by and to whom, and how. It also
   offers insights on how elite alliance-building and devolution operate in
   a particular sub-national setting in Kenya.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Governments around the world, when faced with a crisis, struggle to
   manage various legitimate accountability expectations. Our study
   investigated how Chinese local governments reconcile social and
   hierarchical accountability in managing COVID-19. We found that local
   governments are generally more responsive to hierarchical than social
   accountability. Moreover, senior officials are highly unlikely to shirk
   their duties toward hierarchical accountability when a crisis is severe.
   Furthermore, crisis severity increases local governments' responsiveness
   to social accountability. Our study has encircled our understanding
   regarding the management of multiple accountabilities in crisis.},

Abstract = {Launched by George W. Bush in 2003, the President's Emergency Plan for
   AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is hailed as one of `the most significant moments
   in the history of global health policy' (Fidler in PEPFAR's Impact on
   Global Health is Fading, 2018). Twenty years on, there is now scope to
   revisit the legacy of PEPFAR and Bush's personal commitment to HIV/AIDS
   relief in sub-Saharan Africa and to re-evaluate its record. This article
   explores Bush's personal religious-moral convictions in shaping his
   intentions with PEPFAR and the effects of the religious-conservative
   alignment between Bush, Congress and the American population in this
   period. Drawing on the implementation of the Abstinence-Be
   Faithful-Condoms mandate, this article explores Bush's moral
   interpretation of the HIV/AIDS crisis which shaped PEPFAR. It considers
   how Bush's religious rhetoric captured a unique moment in American
   political and social life, leading to the largest commitment of any
   nation to fight one single disease to that point.},

Abstract = {How do self-determination groups and de facto states use diplomacy to
   advance their international legitimacy? Lacking diplomatic recognition,
   aspiring states still foster productive relationships with external
   actors-trading, allying, and partnering to pursue economic, diplomatic,
   and military objectives. They do this through ad hoc executive visits,
   participation in summits, and contact with party leaders, judicial
   bodies, and other actors. To explore these diplomatic relations and
   strategies behind them, I employ original data on twelve years of
   diplomatic visits of the representatives of the Polisario Front and
   Kurdish Regional Government, and I analyze the Polisario case through 11
   interviews with foreign ministry representatives. I find: (1) these
   governments employ extensive resources to establish a constant presence
   in third-party states; (2) they employ their resources strategically
   based on the domestic characteristics and international positioning of
   these states; (3) their diplomatic reach depends on the kind of appeals
   they make to external parties.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of concerns over the transparency, accountability, and
   democracy of international organizations has contributed to an increase
   in accountability mechanisms to hold global governors to account, by
   both state and non-state actors. Much of the scholarly focus on this
   subject has been on how levers of accountability can improve global
   governance for Member States and actors seeking to improve
   decision-making, and thus outputs. This article instead examines how
   individuals and communities, or neglected publics, are using
   accountability mechanisms designed to provide them with recourse for
   environmental and social harm. It probes the use of the grievance
   mechanisms for the multilateral development banks to examine what kinds
   of actors use them (e.g., international nongovernmental organizations,
   nongovernmental organizations, or project-affected people {[}PAP]) and
   to what effect. To explore these questions, we analyze 500 complaints
   submitted to the grievance mechanisms of the World Bank Group; the
   Asian, African, and Inter-American Development Banks; and the European
   Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The results demonstrate that
   claims for recourse come from a range of primarily local actors, but
   that PAP in developing countries will more often achieve positive
   outcomes from the grievance mechanism process if they receive assistance
   from international and national nongovernmental organizations. These
   findings therefore demonstrate that transnational activists can fulfill
   a facilitating role as ``accountability enablers{''} and that domestic
   representatives are especially effective in problem-solving processes,
   while international representatives are especially effective in
   compliance processes.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to contribute to discussions on peace between
   hostile nonmajor powers by focusing on the behavior of major powers.
   Specifically, alliances between nonmajor and major powers are explored
   to determine whether such ties contribute to transitions to higher
   levels of peace. Moreover, systemic factors involving power dynamics and
   relationships between major powers are also evaluated.
   Design/methodology/approachMultiple data sets which altogether covered
   the era from 1816 to 2010 were analyzed. All pairs of countries that
   were former foes were considered. Cox hazard regression was conducted.
   FindingsSystemic instability is influential at transitions from lowest
   levels of peace for nonmajor power dyads. Eras where major powers are
   operating multilaterally appear to play a highly limited role in
   nonmajor powers attaining stable peace. However, alliances with major
   powers are relatively more crucial in these discussions for nonmajor
   powers and contribute to higher levels of peace being attained by
   nonmajor powers. Research limitations/implicationsFurther research in
   particular with case studies can help to elucidate and extend the
   statistical findings. Practical implicationsBased on the findings, the
   design and operations of alliances can create more space to hear a wider
   range of issues that allies can be facing. Originality/valueWhile major
   powers clearly have considerable capacity and global outreach, there has
   been little attention to whether and how they contribute to former foes
   attaining higher quality of peace.},

Abstract = {Can governments make courts politically compliant without undermining
   public confidence in the judicial system? Many studies show a positive
   relationship between judicial independence and citizens' trust in
   courts. However, most of them have shown static cross-sectional
   correlations rather than actual effects of court curbing on trust.
   Factors such as citizens' level of education and political preferences
   may also play a role in moderating reactions to court curbing. We
   analyse how assaults on judicial independence by populist governments in
   Turkey, Hungary, and Poland affected judicial trust, using a
   difference-in-differences approach to Eurobarometer data. While we find
   evidence that court curbing has an adverse effect on judicial trust,
   this effect is much clearer among citizens who are ideologically distant
   from their governments. These findings coincide with experimental
   evidence indicating how citizens tolerate democratic backsliding,
   suggesting that, for many, trust in the judicial system can subsist even
   when courts are made politically subservient.},

Abstract = {Since 9/11, considerable research has been done on US interrogation and
   detention operations, but comparatively little is known about the
   involvement of other traditionally liberal states' intelligence agencies
   and their evolving perspectives on torture-related policies for
   foreigners abroad. Particularly, the United Kingdom and Germany provide
   interesting cases; despite similar levels of public and political
   pressure regarding their indirect involvement in Central Intelligence
   Agency's operations, the two states took different strategic decisions
   in 2010 on whether to implement new extraterritorial human rights
   safeguards. While the United Kingdom introduced a new intelligence
   guidance for interrogations overseas, the German government opted for
   policy-continuance, which raises the question why the two states
   embarked on different policy trajectories, even if they found themselves
   in contextually similar situations and were subjected to the comparable
   accountability measures. By bridging insights from Rationalist and
   normative literature, the article addresses this conundrum by clearly
   outlining the states' differing strategic preferences, and by dissecting
   the multi-layered composition of these interests. As a result, the
   article delineates how strategic constraints pertaining to the states'
   national, international, or political elite level affect
   decision-makers' policy responses.},

Abstract = {The approach of combining diverse policy instruments is increasingly
   being applied to address complex environmental and sustainability
   issues. For such an approach of policy mix to be effective, broader
   contextual and process factors must be taken into account. In this
   paper, we identify interdepartmental cooperation within the government
   as a condition for an effective policy mix, especially for China. Taking
   domestic waste governance as a case study, we collect policy document
   data from 32 cities across China in the last decade and verify the
   influential mechanism between the interdepartmental cooperation network
   and the policy mix through quantitative methods of social network
   analysis and regression. The empirical results show that the Chinese
   government has intensified interdepartmental cooperation over the past
   decade in the area of domestic waste governance, which has facilitated
   the increased adoption of policy mixes. In addition, a shift in the
   policy strategy and policy direction of the Chinese government for
   domestic waste governance can be traced from the changes in the specific
   departments involved in the cooperation network.},

Abstract = {The Amazon region is home to nearly half of the world's tropical
   forests, which are key to carbon absorption, and the continent has
   abundant reserves of minerals critical for the energy transition and the
   development of low-carbon technologies, notably lithium. If skilfully
   deployed, South America's rising importance for global climate
   mitigation and energy transition could engender more sustainable
   economic models at home, as well as reinforce its clout in global
   decision-making. Social tensions around mining and rising environmental
   crime could, however, diminish focus from global-projection efforts and
   impede building geopolitical influence through the control of resources.
   South America's success in this endeavour will depend on whether
   regional governments can adopt policies on critical minerals, energy
   transition and sustainable mining that furnish predictable guidance for
   investors as regional partners.},

Title = {Making gifts from contracts: symbolic resources and resanctification in
   officers' language},
Journal = {CRITICAL MILITARY STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {384-403},

Abstract = {Officers of the Irish Defence Forces have studied at civilian university
   since 1969, with the introduction of a policy referred to as the
   University Service Academic Complement (USAC) scheme. In attending
   university through USAC, officers are obliged to sign a contract
   stipulating that they will repay the full costs of their time at
   university. This paper draws on a study of 46 retired and serving
   officers, to analyse how they discussed their career and the military
   officer's experience of civilian higher education. While the agreement
   officers are obliged to sign is a legal contract, interviewees
   consistently characterised their experience of the USAC scheme in terms
   that omitted this economic reality of the financial implications of
   attending higher education. Instead, they favoured terms that almost
   exclusively excluded such a perspective, and instead made the USAC
   scheme appear to be a `gift' in Marcel Mauss's terms. This paper
   illustrates how and why this is the case, in that the use of `gift
   language' is a type of `resanctification' of the military profession by
   individual officers in the face of the threat to cohesion and their
   symbolic universe. Beyond and at the societal level, resanctification
   through gift language also implies a political `double-bind' for
   officers in terms of their relationship with civilian military
   authorities and the military organisation itself. This paper concludes
   with an overview of some of the implications of a gift analysis for
   militaries and their surrounding societies.},

Abstract = {In rally-intensive campaigns, the rally is an essential mode of
   political communication between politicians, parties and citizens. This
   article moves beyond the exclusive focus, in most literature, on rallies
   convened for presidents and presidential candidates to include similar
   rallies convened for others significant enough to act as a proxy but are
   not themselves presidential candidates. It develops a broader category
   of what it refers to as `bigwig' rallies. In Zimbabwe, the bigwig rally
   constitutes a distinct sub-genre that occupies a distinct place in
   election campaigning. I ask: what do parties communicate through bigwig
   rallies? How do they produce rallies to generate those communications?
   Little prior research considers what is particular to the rallies
   convened in electoral-authoritarian regimes. In this article, I ask:
   what do ruling parties in electoral-authoritarian regimes communicate
   and how do they achieve this? It answers these questions through
   studying ZANU-PF in Zimbabwe's 2008 and 2013 elections.},

Abstract = {The paper examines the operation of the Catholic Church in
   Czechoslovakia under the Communist regime, one of the most oppressive
   communist regimes in Eastern Europe, and the choice of the Church to
   operate both officially and secretly. Based on the religious economy
   approach, it defines the conditions favoring diversified operation on
   both the legal market and the black market. Despite repression, the
   Church strived to maintain official operation in Czechoslovakia.
   Simultaneously, it developed an underground structure that allowed for
   uncompromised religious life. The case study confirms the theoretical
   predictions that severe repression favors underground operation without
   eliminating the need for the official presence of the Church. Beyond the
   religious economy approach, the paper points to the role of agency. The
   diversification strategy could only emerge and function due to the
   combination of externally imposed circumstances and individual
   initiative.},

Title = {The impact of migrants' knowledge about their social rights on their
   subjective wellbeing},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {IntroductionIn this contribution I examine the role of migrants'
   knowledge about their social rights (system knowledge) for their
   subjective well-being. Based on the Social Production Function Theory, I
   expect system knowledge to be positively associated with migrants'
   well-being. Migrants who are well informed about their social rights are
   likely to have better access to resources that are crucial for their
   well-being such as healthcare or financial security. Moreover, I expect
   that knowledge in certain domains which affect daily life, such as
   healthcare, matter more than knowledge in other domains, which are
   life-course specific, such as childcare. MethodsI make use of the
   Migrants' Welfare State Attitudes (MIFARE) data which includes the
   perspective on the welfare state of migrants from nine different origin
   countries across three receiving countries: Denmark, the Netherlands,
   and Germany. Linear regression analyses were applied. ResultsResults
   indicate that migrants differ extensively in their social rights
   knowledge. Moreover, migrants' knowledge about their social rights is
   indeed positively associated with subjective well-being, though the
   effect is not equally strong in all three receiving countries and
   differs by welfare domain (healthcare, childcare, unemployment benefits,
   social assistance, and state pensions). DiscussionKnowledge about social
   rights matters for migrants' well-being. Policy advisors should
   therefore pay special attention to migrants' access to information about
   social right policies in order to increase their well-being.},

Title = {Do Eyes in the Sky Ensure Peace on the Ground? The Uncertain
   Contributions of Remote Sensing to Ceasefire Compliance},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {In many conflicts, international ceasefire monitors are deployed to
   mitigate future violence. Increasingly, such monitors use satellite
   imagery, uncrewed aerial vehicles, and other camera-equipped assets to
   supplement, and sometimes substitute, human monitoring efforts to
   document ceasefire violations. To date, we know little about when and
   how such technology contributes to ceasefire compliance, with scholars
   offering diverging assessments of the effects. Integrating scholarship
   on the use of remote sensing in ceasefire monitoring with theories on
   the causal processes underlying ceasefire monitoring, this analytical
   essay offers a framework to assess the contribution of remote sensing to
   ceasefire compliance and illustrates the empirical application of this
   framework by examining the most technologically advanced ceasefire
   monitoring mission yet deployed, the Special Monitoring Mission in
   Ukraine. Focusing on the period prior to the Russian invasion of 2022,
   our research finds that while the mission's observational power was
   expanded, remote sensing technologies ultimately had little effect on
   modifying conflict party behavior or compliance. While in this case
   remote sensing technology minimally increased compliance, the study
   contributes to debates on the use of technology as a conflict management
   tool, and provides an assessment framework for scholars and for
   policymakers considering adopting technology in other monitoring
   contexts.
   En muchos conflictos, se despliegan supervisores internacionales de alto
   el fuego con el fin de mitigar la violencia futura. Estos supervisores
   utilizan, cada vez con mas frecuencia, imagenes satelitales, vehiculos
   aereos no tripulados y otros dispositivos equipados con camaras para
   complementar, y a veces sustituir, los esfuerzos humanos en materia de
   vigilancia que se llevan a cabo para documentar las violaciones del alto
   el fuego. Hasta la fecha, sabemos poco sobre cuando y como contribuye
   dicha tecnologia al cumplimiento del alto el fuego, y los academicos
   ofrecen evaluaciones divergentes de sus efectos. Este ensayo analitico
   ofrece, mediante la integracion de la bibliografia sobre el uso de la
   teledeteccion en la vigilancia del alto el fuego con las teorias sobre
   los procesos causales subyacentes a la vigilancia del alto el fuego, un
   marco para evaluar la contribucion de la teledeteccion al cumplimiento
   del alto el fuego e ilustra la aplicacion empirica de este marco
   mediante el examen de la mision de vigilancia de alto el fuego mas
   avanzada tecnologicamente que ha sido desplegada hasta la fecha, la
   Mision Especial de Observacion en Ucrania. Nuestra investigacion se
   centra en el periodo anterior a la invasion rusa de 2022, y concluye
   que, si bien el poder de observacion de la mision se fue expandiendo,
   las tecnologias de teledeteccion tuvieron, al final, un efecto escaso en
   la modificacion del comportamiento o en el cumplimiento de las partes en
   conflicto. Si bien en este caso, la tecnologia de teledeteccion aumento
   minimamente el cumplimiento, el estudio contribuye a los debates sobre
   el uso de la tecnologia como herramienta de gestion de conflictos, y
   proporciona un marco de evaluacion para academicos y formuladores de
   politicas que consideren adoptar estas tecnologias en otros contextos de
   supervision.
   Dans nombre de conflits, des observateurs du cessez-le-feu international
   sont deployes pour attenuer les risques de nouvelles violences. Ces
   observateurs ont de plus en plus recours aux images satellites, aux
   vehicules aeriens sans pilote et a d'autres actifs dotes de cameras pour
   renforcer les efforts de surveillance humaine, et parfois s'y
   substituer, dans la documentation des violations de cessez-le-feu. A ce
   jour, nous en savons peu sur quand et comment ces technologies
   contribuent au respect du cessez-le-feu, les chercheurs proposant
   differentes evaluations des effets. En integrant la recherche sur
   l'utilisation des capteurs a distance dans l'observation d'un
   cessez-le-feu aux theories sur les processus causaux sous-jacents a
   cette observation, cet article analytique propose un cadre pour evaluer
   la contribution des capteurs a distance au respect du cessez-le-feu. Il
   illustre aussi l'application empirique de ce cadre en examinant la
   mission d'observation d'un cessez-le-feu la plus avancee sur le plan
   technologique deployee a ce jour, la mission speciale d'observation en
   Ukraine. En se concentrant sur la periode precedant l'invasion russe en
   2022, notre travail de recherche conclut que bien que le pouvoir
   d'observation de la mission se soit elargi, les technologies de capteur
   a distance n'ont finalement eu que peu d'effet sur la modification du
   comportement ou du respect des parties au conflit. Bien que dans ce cas,
   la technologie de capteur a distance ait quelque peu augmente le
   respect, l'etude contribue aux debats sur l'utilisation de la
   technologie en tant qu'outil de gestion des conflits. Elle fournit
   egalement un cadre d'evaluation pour les chercheurs et les legislateurs
   qui envisagent d'adopter cette technologie dans d'autres contextes
   d'observation.},

Abstract = {The delegitimization of policy advice has generated a defensive response
   that combines an assertion of the superior scientific character of
   expertise with a forthright affirmation of social and political values.
   This more value-driven discourse of policy expertise is examined with
   the case study of the Global Solutions Summit/World Policy Forum,
   launched in 2017 to support the Think20 network of global policy
   advisors supporting the G20 meetings under the German presidency. The
   Global Solutions Summit has evolved into a more policy-wonkish version
   of the World Economic Forum held annually in Davos and now is a
   switching point of global policy advice for the G7 as well. Through
   participant observation and an analysis of the proceedings of the annual
   summits since 2017, the article shows a distinctive configuration of
   normatively framed policy advice designed to overcome the social and
   political pathologies that have been the foundation of populist
   critiques of policy expertise.},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {In 2017, media coverage of the \#MeToo movement brought attention to the
   pervasive problem of sexual harassment against women, highlighting
   several prominent American cases including Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby,
   and Donald Trump. In survey experiments with nationally representative
   samples in the United States (N = 2,843), the Netherlands (N = 3,770),
   and Germany (N = 2,357), we tested how thinking about the American cases
   influences public opinion towards the issue across countries. As
   predicted, being reminded of the Weinstein, Cosby, and Trump cases
   increased the evaluation that sexual harassment is a serious problem in
   the United States. We further tested how thinking about the U.S. cases
   influences participants' evaluations of sexual harassment in European
   countries: Does it pale by comparison to the prominent U.S. cases, or do
   the cases increase the assessment that harassment is a problem
   everywhere? All samples evaluated sexual harassment in the European
   countries as a more serious issue when the U.S. cases were brought to
   mind, which is compatible with the assumption that sexual harassment is
   seen as a global gender issue rather than a country-specific issue.
   These results provide experimental evidence that attention-grabbing
   cases can shift evaluations of a policy issue within and across
   countries.},

Abstract = {This article clarifies the role of trust in alliances with a focus on
   NATO. We bridge IR scholarship on trust and alliance theory by dealing
   with trust as a central factor in maintaining alliance cohesion and
   longevity. NATO has, throughout its history, been characterised by an
   asymmetric trusting relationship, with Europe being more vulnerable to
   defection than its American counterpart. This means that a fear of
   abandonment, intrinsic to the structure of reciprocal commitment in all
   alliances, has been felt differently on the opposite sides of the
   Atlantic, with implications for how specific crises have led to a
   fluctuation in (mis)trust. Whereas the Europeans have harboured mistrust
   regarding the longevity of the US commitment and extended deterrence,
   the Americans have doubted the Europeans' faithfulness to US leadership
   and willingness to share the alliance's burdens. Simultaneously, general
   trust - cultivated by shared interests, institutions, interdependence
   and converging identities - has bound the allies together. The article
   then uses these insights to analyse the Trump presidency, which marked
   an historic spike in mistrust between the US and the Europeans. Despite
   the unforeseen tumult, the presidency did not result in the definitive
   collapse of trust in the trans-Atlantic relationship, let alone NATO.},

Abstract = {The history of strategic thought is well trodden ground, but has not
   been approached from a fashion perspective. This article focuses on the
   issue of engagement among intellectual fashions by examining how events
   may lead observers to believe that established, long cycle ways of
   thinking have become partially, if not wholly, inapt, thereby leading to
   an uncertain and perhaps incomprehensible strategic environment. Newer,
   revisionist but often short-lived concepts emerge as a consequence,
   variously complementary to, despite, or in direct repudiation of
   longer-lived concepts or theories. This dynamic is examined through the
   interaction between Clausewitzian and competing fashions.},

Abstract = {The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 ended the hybrid stage
   of conflict that emerged in 2014, following the Russian illegal
   annexation of Crimea and proxy aggression in East Ukraine. Empirical
   data demonstrate a two-fold interplay between grey zone strategies and
   applicable rules. `Lawfare' instruments affect jus ad bellum, permitting
   multiple political choices and the deployment of different means of
   hybrid warfare. A grey zone conflict itself develops conflicting and
   overlapping sets of rules supported by different actors. Eventually,
   additional rules may emerge due to the actions or interactions of
   conflicting parties; these rules focus on conflict management or
   settlement.},

Abstract = {Targeted transparency has become an essential tool for regulation.
   Through information disclosure, regulatory agencies try to get regulated
   companies to improve their practices and comply with regulations. In the
   past, regulation was associated with distrust in regulated sectors.
   Recent research suggests that regulation, especially targeted
   transparency, may also increase citizen trust in regulated sectors.
   However, empirical evidence on whether transparency as a regulatory tool
   undermines or decreases trust in a sector is lacking. We contribute to
   this debate by investigating the effect of targeted transparency on
   citizen trust through a large-scale representative survey experiment (n
   = 5,303). We used 12 transparency frames in three regulated domains in
   the Netherlands (consumer rights, healthcare safety, and nuclear plant
   safety). Our findings suggest that, in general, targeted transparency
   does not undermine trust, but has a positive effect on trust in
   regulated sectors. However, this effect is small and contextual,
   depending on the regulatory domain and type of transparency frame.},

Abstract = {Despite widely covered controversies, biodiversity offsetting continues
   to be introduced in novel places as a solution to counter biodiversity
   loss. As previous studies have focused on contestation around
   offsetting, there is a lack of studies analyzing how actors generate
   consensus while constructing biodiversity offsetting policies. To assess
   this, we analyze the early phases of policy construction in Finland, a
   country that until recently did not have policy mechanisms for
   offsetting in place. Based on document analysis and interviews with
   experts, we argue that expert stakeholders' widespread support for
   biodiversity offsetting is explained by the interplay of three framings
   in the early phase of policy development. First, expert stakeholders
   share an understanding of biodiversity offsetting as a necessary policy
   mechanism to which there are no alternative solutions. Second, divergent
   views on the mechanism are accommodated through maintaining an
   interpretatively flexible understanding of the policy mechanism. Third,
   concerns over past policy failures are refurbished as opportunities to
   learn from in developing an experimental approach to policy
   implementation. This designates offsetting primarily as an expert issue
   for technical deliberation and forecloses other policy options, while
   placing high expectations on the ability of experimental governance to
   solve problems.},

Abstract = {Discourse analysis (DA) has established itself as a widely accepted and
   legitimate approach to policy analysis. It is used to study issues such
   as the role of knowledge in policymaking, political cleavages and
   coalitions, and legitimacy. However, the proponents of DA have generally
   been reluctant to provide strategic policy advice. This reluctance
   limits the utility of DA for providing new and partly alternative policy
   ideas and advice on how to propagate new policies and to consolidate
   existing ones. This paper aims to extend the scope of DA to include
   advice that may change or modify how discourses are utilised in shaping
   policy. It elaborates on seven types of discursive agency allowing
   policy actors (including politicians, policy strategists, public
   managers, and citizen groups) to either consolidate existing policy or
   propagate new policy by manoeuvring within a given discursive framework,
   navigating between different and conflicting discourses, or transforming
   existing discourses.},

Abstract = {Foreign fighter (FF) backgrounds and their pathways have been studied
   before, yet most work is based on open sources. In this article, we
   examine FFs by examining uniquely acquired data from Dutch probation
   files. Focusing on profound life events and using insights from social
   control theorists and the concept of redemption, we provide a general
   overview of the group through different themes. Moreover, unlike most
   previous studies, we make comparisons between the FFs based on age, sex,
   and timing of (attempted) travel. Besides empirical findings regarding
   profound events, mental health and criminal histories, results
   demonstrate that a radical social (online) environment was critical in
   becoming a FF. Also, the explorations of the age and sex comparisons
   demonstrate the necessity of looking beyond the FF group as a whole.},

Abstract = {This study traces the evolution of systemic state-sponsored coercive
   labor in the cotton harvest in China's northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur
   Autonomous Region (XUAR). The recent situation in the XUAR is compared
   to Uzbekistan, which implemented forced labor in cotton picking until
   2021. Both regions create structurally coercive labor environments
   through a centralized authoritarian state apparatus that deploys human
   resource-intensive local grassroots mobilization efforts. The article
   finds that while both regional entities' coercive labor dynamics are in
   many ways comparable, the resulting labor settings are not easily
   captured through static standard measures such as the ILO forced labor
   indicators. Instead, state-sponsored forced labor is characterized by
   pervasive state-induced and systemic dynamics of coercion that are
   deeply embedded within sociocultural contexts. Whereas Uzbekistans
   coercive labor practices were primarily driven by economic
   considerations, Xinjiang's labor transfer program pursues some economic
   aims but is predominantly designed to achieve Beijing's wider
   ethnopolitical goals in the region.},

Abstract = {Although street-level bureaucrats (SLBs) play a key role in the
   implementation of market-based instruments (MBIs), their participation
   is widely understudied. This paper addresses this blind spot by engaging
   the concept of street-level bureaucratic policy entrepreneurship. Using
   the case of conservation banking, a market-based environmental policy in
   the United States, we explore why this novel instrument has only been
   adopted in a handful of jurisdictions. We examine both non-adoption and
   adoption of conservation banking to find that SLBs are likely to engage
   in such entrepreneurial acts when a new policy form is particularly
   useful in legitimizing regulatory enforcement. Implementing a MBI is,
   however, not straightforward. Organizational conditions can restrain SLB
   autonomy to implement MBIs, preferring instead to persist with baseline
   policies, which further underscores the importance of SLB risk-taking
   behavior. SLBs must strategically straddle their unique position between
   the market and the hierarchy to enroll different actors into the new
   policy arrangement, all within dynamic political-economic conditions.},

Abstract = {The emissions trading scheme (ETS) has piqued substantial interest among
   economists and policymakers. China officially launched the electricity
   sector's national carbon emissions trading market in 2021, making it the
   world's largest compliance carbon market. In contrast to the
   cap-and-trade (C\&T) system prevalent in other economies, China's
   national carbon market employs a rate-based mechanism that implicitly
   subsidizes the output of regulated entities; however, is it effective?
   This study uses a market-design theoretical framework to explore whether
   China's national carbon market functions effectively and, more
   critically, what leads to its (slight) underperformance. We discover
   that policy design, policy conflicts, policy uncertainty, inexperienced
   market regulation, and excessive or inappropriate government
   intervention are the primary constraints on this emerging market,
   resulting in shrinking market thickness, congested market transactions,
   and lack of safety. For China to establish a better national carbon
   market, stronger market-oriented rules, appropriate market regulation,
   improved policy coordination, and greater electricity market reforms are
   required.},

Abstract = {Tax reduction is supposed to garner popular support, yet rural unrest
   sharply increased following the Chinese government's agricultural tax
   reform aiming to reduce peasants' tax burden. We argue that the tax
   reduction could undermine village elites' economic and political
   incentives to assist the state in implementing unpopular policies and
   achieving desirable outcomes. We exploit the exogeneous timing of the
   agricultural tax reform that abolished the agriculture tax and estimate
   its impact through a rare national representative village-level panel
   dataset. We demonstrate that the tax reform led to tax noncompliance and
   rising social unrest. We further show that local governance worsened
   because village elites were disincentivized from carrying out
   state-preferred yet unpopular policies.},

Abstract = {To what extent does postliberal peace represent a substantive cultural
   paradigm shift relative to the liberal peace paradigm? We offer an
   empirical examination of the question through the Israeli case. An
   analysis of sixteen peace associations shows that peace activism has
   changed in the last twenty years in Israel in terms of organization,
   orientation, and action. Such change is clearly based on reflexivity,
   i.e. on the attempt by the activists to overcome the weakness of the
   liberal peace approach that has failed repeatedly in the
   Israeli-Palestinian context. The Israeli case reveals a cultural change
   that is creating a new, concrete, micro-level, ``bottom-up{''} model of
   peacebuilding grounded, first and foremost, in everyday life. It is
   based on creating bridges on the social and cultural levels through
   practices, meetings, and networks. Although the peace process is not
   visible in the near future in Israel, and precisely because of that, the
   article presents the formation of a new cultural perception, which might
   be useful, and even necessary in time.},

Abstract = {Countries are facing the deterioration of democratic institutions under
   a process named democratic backsliding. In this context, political
   attacks on public organizations become more frequent and intense. While
   previous studies have examined how civil servants counteract and resist
   political attacks, their ultimate impact on civil servants' well-being
   remains underexplored. To shed light on this phenomenon, we conducted an
   exploratory sequential mixed methods design with civil servants from
   Brazil. The first phase of the study is qualitative and exploratory. The
   second is quantitative and we tested if perceived political attacks was
   associated with higher levels of emotional exhaustion, which, in turn,
   would lead to a greater incidence of physical health symptoms. Both
   studies provide compelling evidence of the negative impact of political
   attacks on civil servants' emotional and physical health, which may have
   significant consequences for the performance of public organizations and
   the effective functioning of the democracy.},

Abstract = {The global anti-Nigerian sentiment that has engendered the state's image
   crisis cannot be denied. This has circumscribed Abuja's capacity to
   effectively wield its soft power in Africa and beyond. While successive
   Nigerian governments have striven to improve the country's battered
   image through various initiatives, the state's image remains negative.
   There can be no doubt that the diaspora contributes to this image crisis
   through the activities of Nigerian criminal networks abroad such as drug
   and human trafficking and advance fee fraud. However, the diaspora has
   also been critical in counteracting these negative perceptions and so
   this article examines how the Nigerian diaspora has contributed to soft
   power by challenging anti-Nigerian sentiment, promoted Nigerian culture,
   provided remittances, and given technical assistance through the
   Technical Aid Corps (TAC) scheme.},

Abstract = {In what ways do amicus curiae or friend of the court briefs shape the
   decisions of constitutional courts outside of the United States? Using a
   unique data set of more than nine hundred briefs from the Bulgarian
   Constitutional Court, hearing cases of constitutional review and legal
   interpretation, we analyze the Court's propensities to both borrow
   language from briefs and cite the identity of interested parties. We
   find that the Court is more inclined to incorporate language from briefs
   by powerful government actors rather than non-governmental groups.
   Furthermore, the Court's alignment with the governing coalition and the
   type of constitutional review also influence the propensity to borrow
   language from briefs. However, the Bulgarian Constitutional Court does
   not appear to favor citing any particular interested party. These
   results question whether the briefing process in Bulgaria lives up to
   democratic expectations for including less powerful civil society
   viewpoints into decision-making. The study is one of the few of its kind
   to explore how the reasoning found within the brief influences an
   important national high court outside of the United States.},

Abstract = {We conceptualize recruitment partnerships between higher education
   institutions (HEIs) and accounting firms as a social network. While
   elite closure is known to be typical of such relationships, we posit
   that commitments to improving organizational diversity should curtail
   this tendency. Yet, whereas diversity in employee recruitment is
   culturally institutionalized, there are no imperatives encouraging HEIs
   to partner with diverse firms, what we call `downstream diversity'. We
   hypothesize this differentiation should lead elite companies to form
   more diverse partnerships with HEIs than HEIs do with firms. Our
   analysis confirms elite HEIs mostly partner with prestigious companies.
   The latter partner across the status spectrum, but recruitment from
   lower-status HEIs is for less desirable jobs. We also find elite
   establishments in both fields are unlikely to partner with organizations
   with high representation of Black persons. We conclude that (a)
   recruitment partnerships reproduce status distinctions, (b) firms are
   failing to meet diversity commitments and (c) downstream diversity needs
   to be incorporated into HEI diversity management toolkits.},

Abstract = {Using court records of legal disputes over transfers of land, this
   article explores the way transfers of landed property have impacted
   social relationships and the governance of land rights in Ghana in the
   twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. As urbanization, commercial
   agriculture, and natural resource extraction pushed up the value of
   land, disputes over land ownership have multiplied. In adjudicating such
   disputes, courts are often confronted with claims based on unverifiable
   oral histories invoking events of the distant past. Rather than simply
   dismiss such forms of evidence as hearsay, judges have often
   supplemented them with documentary and/or oral evidence on recent
   histories of land use. By doing so, they have tended to sustain
   customary forms of ownership, effectively recognizing the authority of
   landholding collectivities such as families and stools alongside that of
   individual owners. In effect, they are inferring ownership from land
   use, inverting the standard economic argument.},

Abstract = {Boundary spanners are pivotal in developing effective public-private
   collaboration in public infrastructure projects. As boundary spanners
   have to account for different interests, perspectives, and ways of
   working in public-private collaborations, engaging in boundary-spanning
   activities often comes with role stress, which can negatively impact
   their job performance. However, despite the significant levels of role
   stress associated with boundary spanning, there is a dearth of empirical
   studies on the role stress of boundary spanning public managers and how
   it can be reduced. In this study, we empirically investigate the
   reciprocal relationship between role stressors and boundary spanning and
   test if supporting organizational conditions can alleviate role
   stressors. The findings show that especially role conflict is
   detrimental for boundary-spanning activities. We further find that
   top-management support can diminish both role conflict and role
   ambiguity and that co-worker support can help in reducing the role
   ambiguity of boundary spanning public managers.},

Abstract = {This article aims to illustrate the measures which were developed by the
   rebel army in order to maintain control over their troops during the
   Spanish Civil War. Coercive measures were adopted that became
   progressively tightened, reaching a peak during the first Francoist
   government. They were based on integration, propaganda, surveillance and
   punishment. This article focuses on the idea that surveillance and
   punishment were applied because troops were not socio-politically
   homogeneous. Measures were also based on traditional and colonial
   military ideology, and nationalist in nature, and new tendencies
   arriving from Europe: such as fascism. This text also serves to portray
   the context in which the combatants were integrated, as well as how the
   Francoist `New State' was established during the 1940s and early 1950s.},

Abstract = {Studies have shown that intergroup conflict may result from two distinct
   human motives: the desire to obtain personal retributions from conflict
   (egoism), and the desire to sacrifice for the benefit of the ingroup
   (parochial altruism). Yet, the relative strength of these motives is
   open to debate. In this study, we compare behaviors in two Intergroup
   Prisoner's Dilemmas (IPD), which respectively capture altruistic and
   egoistic motives to generate conflict. Egoistic motives result in about
   40\% more conflict than altruistic motives. Yet, parochial altruism
   generates more conflict when three conditions are gathered: i) other
   ingroup members are parochial altruists, ii) the outgroup is aggressive
   and iii) the outgroup is rich. Implications regarding the diverging
   structural causes of terrorism and civil wars are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article uses securitisation theory to examine the Zimbabwean
   government's handling of protests and protesters' use of social media.
   It is based on the case study of Harare and data gathered from both
   primary and secondary sources. The article argues that securitisation of
   the right to protest in Zimbabwe forecloses opportunities for
   engagement, which negatively affects peace and development. It asserts
   that social media platforms' capacity to mobilise discontented citizens
   for protests can be used by Zimbabwean policy makers to engage the
   citizens and enhance the formulation and development of pro-peace and
   development policy initiatives. The article concludes that embracing
   relevant digital technologies, particularly social media platforms, can
   offer broader policy engagement opportunities and thereby minimise
   protests by disgruntled citizens.},

Abstract = {For decades, strategies granting discretion to `lower-level actors' to
   propose solutions themselves had become preferred to conventional
   command and control - the hierarchical imposition and enforcement of
   stable rules. Yet after the 2008 financial crisis, also these
   alternatives (e.g., principles-based regulation) are under pressure.
   Which strategy prevails today, and why? By comparing two crucial yet
   different cases, the article finds that, in both EU digital and
   pharmaceutical regulation, the dominant strategy is experimentalist.
   This emphasises not only discretion but also regular revisions based on
   review of implementation experience. It is driven by uncertainty about
   the best solutions, as perceived by the relevant actors. Since
   uncertainty pervades most contemporary policy challenges, the future of
   regulation and public policy more broadly is thus likely to be
   experimentalist.},

Abstract = {This study examined diversity and similarity of orientations for
   renewable energy policies across US states through frame analysis based
   on semantic topic modeling technique. More specifically, it analyzed
   Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) bills of 29 RPS adopted states.
   Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling for semantic topic analysis
   was applied to explore hidden meanings within text bills, as well as
   shared patterns of the meanings among states, by utilizing latent
   information of nested topic. It found two major themes of the definition
   of eligible renewables and implementation mechanisms, underlying the
   states' RPSs substantially contributed to framing each state's renewable
   energy policies. In accordance with the state's energy situation and
   socio-economic interests in renewable energy, however, states' frames
   for defining eligible renewables and for building implementation and
   compliance mechanisms differed substantially.},

Abstract = {Contributing to the `narrative turn' in International Relations and
   offering an answer to the question `What makes a strategic narrative
   efficient?', this article adds to the methodological theorization of the
   formation and projection phases of the narrative's lifecycle. We suggest
   that the impact of the constructed image in the narrative can be
   reinforced by the interplay of at least three projection properties: (1)
   content accentuation and priming, through iterations; (2) content
   contextualization, through historical and cultural resonance with the
   consumers' memories; and (3) content verbalization, through narrative
   tactics that evoke a range of the consumers' involved attitudes to the
   framed image. These properties, being intrinsic ingredients of the
   projected content, tend to enhance emotions. In our work, they get
   traction in the antagonistic narrative tailored by the Russian
   propaganda to depict Ukraine orientated towards the European Union (EU).
   The empirical case study analyses articles published on the Russian
   e-news platforms portraying the EU granting Ukrainians visa-free travel
   to the Schengen area in 2017, a milestone in Ukraine-EU relations. We
   define Russia's narrative, created in reaction to this event, as
   antagonistic and consider it to be a precursor of the aggressive
   narrative crafted/employed by Russia to justify its 2022 military
   assault on Ukraine's sovereignty.},

Abstract = {Purpose Foreign fighters (FFs) appeared in at least approximately
   one-fourth of conflicts over the past 200 years. This study aims to
   reveal the impact of FFs in conflicts, whether they resolve the conflict
   faster or they drag out the conflict, and investigate the single and
   simultaneous impacts of ethnic conflict (EC) and FFs on conflict
   duration (CD).Design/methodology/approach The data set consisting of 352
   conflicts from 1818 to 2022 was collected from different sources.
   Logarithmic Linear Regression with Dummy Variables and the Cox
   Regression models were used to check the hypotheses.Findings One of the
   key findings of this analysis is that the use of FFs extends the
   duration of conflicts. Similarly, conflicts involving EC increase CD.
   Additionally, the simultaneous effect of FFs and EC together increases
   the CD much more, and it is noted CD significantly varies
   regionally.Research limitations/implications As this study focused on
   the factors that affect the duration of the conflict in the hypotheses,
   the findings only can contribute to explaining the duration rather than
   factors such as the number of casualties and economic losses. The
   authors believe that policy and key decision-makers can benefit from the
   results and think twice before deciding to use FFs in
   conflicts.Originality/value This study offers a separate and
   simultaneous effect of EC and FFs on CD, which provides some empirical
   contributions to conflict management by filling the gap in this area.},

Abstract = {As China has made it a top priority to enrich and upgrade its chip
   capabilities across the value chain, some international observers
   predict that China's semiconductor industry will eventually, if not
   immediately, surpass its foreign competitors. Others remain skeptical
   about its presumed tech supremacy for plausible but largely speculative
   reasons. Is the Chinese semiconductor industry a game-changer or a paper
   tiger? Is China's indigenous chip technology attractive to, and usable
   by, foreign technology? One way to look into these half-empty/half-full
   questions is to comparatively analyze chip patents granted by the US
   Patent and Trademark Office. The target domain of this study is
   integrated circuits (IC) technology, especially thin-film-transistor
   circuits, where China has recently registered a sharp growth in patent
   publications. Using the modified forward citation indices of panel
   display-related IC patents, this study examines whether and to what
   extent the quantitative growth in the Chinese semiconductor industry has
   been translated into a gravitational force to pull foreign industries
   within its sphere of influence. Estimation results of a zero-inflated
   negative binomial regression analysis show that a Chinese chip patent
   has a fewer expected modified forward citation index than a non-Chinese
   patent. These findings indicate that the technological gap between China
   and advanced countries will take longer to close despite China's
   accelerated campaign for chip supremacy. This study concludes, with some
   caveats, that China faces the dual challenge of achieving higher
   productivity and greater self-reliance, while having to survive in the
   escalating technological competition with other advanced countries.},

Title = {Composite Violent Extremism: Conceptualizing Attackers Who Increasingly
   Challenge Traditional Categories of Terrorism},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 21},
Abstract = {Scholars and counterterrorism practitioners have expressed increasing
   concern over violent extremists who display an amalgamation of disparate
   beliefs, interests, and grievances. Despite a proliferation of labels
   like ``salad bar extremism,{''} consensus on the nature of the problem
   is lacking and current understandings risk conflating what are in fact
   distinct types of extremism. Building on current literature and a
   detailed dataset, this article presents a new conceptual framework for
   understanding this phenomenon, consisting of an overarching concept of
   composite violent extremism (CoVE) and underlying typologies of
   ambiguous, mixed, fused, and convergent violent extremism. The article
   then proposes explanations for the apparent increase in these
   radicalization patterns.},

Abstract = {Public organizations are increasingly held accountable by multiple
   institutions and standards. This study explores how key actors perceive
   accountability changes in Fire and Rescue Services in England. However,
   few studies have examined perceptions of accountability where
   long-established governance arrangements are changing. The UK's Policing
   and Crime Act 2017 provided for a new model of governance in the form of
   a single directly elected commissioner to replace the traditional
   indirectly elected fire authority. This study uses a comparative
   multiple case study design to understand the impact of the governance
   arrangements on individuals' perceptions of accountability within each
   service. It adds to the wider understanding of the influences of
   institutional structures on individuals' perceptions and actions, and it
   demonstrates that accountability perceptions change depending on the way
   public services are governed.},

Title = {The Problem with Trade Measurement in International Relations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Trade statistics are widely used in studies and policymaking focused on
   economic interdependence. Yet, researchers in International Relations
   (IR) have largely disregarded half the data available to study trade.
   Bilateral trade flows are usually recorded twice: by the sending economy
   as an export and by the receiving one as an import. These two values
   should match, but discrepancies between them tend to be large and
   pervasive. Most studies ignore this issue, which we label the ``mirror
   problem{''} for short, by using only one entry. However, it is not
   self-evident which one is consistently most accurate. Hence, IR's
   reliance on error-prone trade statistics may be distorting its study of
   economic interdependence. This article explores this problem in three
   steps: first, we quantify the mirror problem in trade data. Second, we
   investigate the origins of the mirror problem, using statistical
   analyses, archival records, and interviews with statistical experts.
   Third, we illustrate the implications of the mirror problem through
   replications covering diverse topics in IR. We find that accounting for
   the mirror problem can variably strengthen, undermine, or overturn
   conclusions of such analyses. The findings underscore the severity of
   measurement problems in IR and suggest particular ways to address those
   problems.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the politicisation of EU trade policy at the level
   of the EU's Member States. In an effort to study the variation of
   politicisation across the EU, going beyond the degree to which an issue
   is politicised, we map out the debates surrounding EU free trade
   agreements (TTIP and CETA) in the media of Denmark, France, Germany,
   Italy, Spain and Poland, based on a novel representative claims analysis
   dataset. We ask whether and how claimants from different EUMS attempt to
   politicise FTAs in distinct ways. The expectation, based on Castles and
   Obinger' families of nations, is that the behaviour of claimants
   belonging to the same family of nations displays overarching features,
   which sets them apart from other claimants. By way of an actor-level
   regression analysis, this study identifies possible correlations between
   claimant nationalities and types of politicisation. The findings
   suggest, on the one hand, that there is a link between families of
   nations, the socio-economic and institutional trajectories they capture,
   and types of politicisation. On the other hand, the variation in how
   issues are politicised is not random but, just like policy outcomes, it
   appears to `cluster' following a territoriality logic.},

Journal = {SURVIVAL},

Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Many Asian governments regard Russia's war with Ukraine as a distant
   event with limited impact on the region beyond raising food and energy
   prices. To the extent that they have considered the geopolitical
   implications of the war, they have largely focused on whether it
   increases the risk of China attacking Taiwan. But the war has strained
   the rule of law and is entrenching divisions along ideological lines,
   introducing unnecessary complexity into alliances and partnerships. It
   has also raised questions about the extent to which Europe will be able
   to play a meaningful role in the Indo-Pacific. Asian governments should
   be alert to these developments and their negative implications for
   regional peace and security. For them to condemn Russia's invasion of
   Ukraine and defend the rule of law would not be blindly supporting the
   West, and would be entirely consistent with their national interests.
   The West must also do its part to avoid worsening geopolitical fault
   lines. In particular, framing great-power competition as a battle
   between autocracies and democracies is unhelpful.},

Abstract = {The role of charity in the provision of public services is of
   substantial academic and practitioner interest, and charitable
   initiative within the English and Welsh National Health Service (NHS)
   has recently received considerable attention. This study provides rich
   insights into the role that NHS-linked charities present themselves as
   playing within the NHS. The dataset analysed is a novel construction of
   3,250 detailed expenditure lines from 676 sets of charity accounts.
   Qualitative content analysis of itemised descriptions of expenditure
   allows us to explore how these charities portray their activities. We
   distinguish between expenditures that can be framed as supplementary to
   government funding (such as amenities and comforts) and items that
   suggest charitable effort is substituting for government support (such
   as funding for clinical equipment). We also consider the claims being
   made through these representations, and suggest that the distinctiveness
   of the charity and NHS spheres are currently under question. We argue
   that, through their representational practices, charities are both
   shaping and blurring the expected roles of government and charity.
   Acceptance of the benefits that charitable initiative does provide, in
   terms of innovation, pluralism and participation, must be tempered with
   the realisation that charitable funds are playing a role in service
   provision that is not guided by clear policy, and that this has the
   potential to widen existing inequalities within a key public service.},

Abstract = {This article explores the day-to-day operations of a fundamental
   education experiment led by Amadou Mahtar M'Bow in the village of
   Badiana, Senegal, in the early 1950s. This micro-historical approach,
   seldom employed in the field of development studies, allows to shed new
   light on how ideas and practices associated with an idealized vision of
   ``modernity{''} manifested at a local level. Specifically, the article
   examines the wide range of activities undertaken as part of this project
   - encompassing areas such as literacy, agriculture, housing, and
   healthcare - and emphasizes the pivotal role played by African staff. By
   doing so, it contributes to a deeper comprehension of the impact of
   developmentalist ideology on the redefinition of colonial rule in Africa
   after the Second World War. Furthermore, the article also suggests
   research directions for evaluating its enduring legacies in
   post-independence contexts.},

Title = {The many meanings of policy instruments: exploring individual and
   structural determinants in obesity policy},
Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},

Abstract = {Health inequalities researchers have long advocated for governments to
   adopt policy instruments that address structural determinants of health
   rather than targeting individual behaviours. The assumption behind this
   position is that such instruments might challenge a core neoliberal
   principle of individualism embedded in the prevailing health policy
   paradigm. We critique this assumption by highlighting the discursive
   construction of policy instruments, and their discursive effects. Using
   the UK's Tackling Obesity policy as a case study, we demonstrate how
   instruments designed to target structural determinants of health (such
   as food advertisement regulation) can actively sustain - rather than
   challenge, the dominant policy paradigm. We call this phenomenon
   `upstream individualism', exploring how it relates to tensions in the
   research-policy relationship, and its relevance beyond health policy. We
   argue that instruments can shape policy change and continuity, including
   at a paradigm level, and that `upstream individualism' provides a useful
   basis for theorising these power dynamics. This article contributes to
   the constructivist public policy literature by noting how policy
   instruments meant to challenge the discursive construction of
   individualism within public health can ultimately reinforce it.},

Abstract = {Bosnians show little faith in their state-level institutions, and with
   good reason, as the country ranks poorly on measures of corruption,
   regulatory quality, and government efficacy. However, the Central Bank
   of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) is a notable exception. In a country
   where the state is still often paralyzed by ethnically aligned
   obstructionism, the Central Bank is widely lauded as an effective
   state-level institution, and it backstops, and oversees, a stable,
   trusted, pan-Bosnian banking system. To explain the Bank's success, we
   draw on rational choice and institutionalist literature to propose and
   test a theory of the ``CBBH as referee `` in its three main functional
   areas: currency board maintenance, payment system operation, and the
   coordination of banking supervision. We find evidence for this mechanism
   in the context of currency board operations, and we also document a
   Haas-ian neofunctional process, in which the Bank has interacted
   cyclically with foreign banks to unintentionally de-ethnicize the
   Bosnian financial sector. Initial Bank reforms facilitated foreign
   banks' market entry, and their subsequent lack of interest in hewing to
   prior ethnic divisions served to cement a unified Bosnian financial
   space. We substantiate this argument with data drawn from interactive
   interviews with Bosnian policymakers, financial sector experts, and
   banking sector participants, and in so doing, also show how the
   commercial behavior of transnational actors can have unexpected policy
   impacts.},

Abstract = {Do disadvantaged ethnic groups favor violent over nonviolent conflict
   tactics? To understand when and why civil war breaks out, we need to
   study violent and nonviolent forms of conflict together, using
   analytical tools that can account for the choice between them. Yet, most
   large-N analyses of the causes of civil war do not account for
   nonviolent conflict, and vice versa. Because the mechanisms held to link
   horizontal inequalities to civil war closely resemble those used to
   explain largely nonviolent social movements, this article studies group
   disadvantages, political violence and nonviolent resistance together. To
   reduce concerns about selection bias in horizontal inequality research,
   it extends the analysis to socially as well as politically relevant
   groups around the world. A consensus is emerging that politically
   disadvantaged ethnic groups shun nonviolent tactics, because they lack
   ties to people close to the regime and its institutions. This article
   challenges the consensus, by showing that political group disadvantages
   predict nonviolent as well as violent forms of conflict. Groups'
   economic status helps explain tactical choices. Among economically
   advantaged groups, political disadvantages increase the risk of
   nonviolent conflict. Among the economically disadvantaged, they
   facilitate violence. This pattern is strongest in situations where no
   policies are in place to remedy group disadvantages, in authoritarian
   and less economically open societies, and in analyses that account for
   conflicts of low intensity, to capture onsets early. The results point
   to the importance of economic and other forms of leverage, which have
   been largely overlooked in the econometric literature.},

Abstract = {The liberal international order has recently come under increasing
   nationalist pressure, evidenced by a rise in nationalist demands to
   withdraw from international institutions. A growing literature examines
   the domestic economic, social, and political origins of this nationalist
   backlash against international institutions. However, less is known
   about the extent to which precedents of withdrawals of one country
   affect nationalist pressures for future withdrawals elsewhere. In this
   paper, we argue that initial withdrawal episodes provide new information
   about the feasibility and desirability of withdrawals to nationalist
   elites in other countries. Hence, we expect nationalists abroad to be
   either encouraged or deterred to follow a similar path - depending on
   the success of these precedents. We explore this argument in the context
   of the British withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), which
   arguably marks the most significant withdrawal from an international
   institution to date. Based on a quantitative analyses of media reports
   in ten European countries, we show we show that nationalist parties in
   Europe increased or moderated the aggressiveness about their EU-related
   rhetoric as the ups and downs of the Brexit-drama unfolded. Our results
   suggest that precedents of nationalist withdrawals shape domestic
   politics well beyond the concerned countries themselves.},

   war on TikTok},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {Interpretative struggles of global crises are increasingly being
   reflected on social media networks. TikTok is a relatively new social
   media platform that has achieved substantial popularity among young
   people in many parts of the world and is now being used to disseminate
   and make sense of information about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
   Through a user-centered sampling approach, we collected 62 TikTok videos
   and conducted an in-depth qualitative analysis of them and their
   uploading profiles to explore how the war was being represented on the
   platform. Our analysis revealed a strong prevalence of remixing
   practices among content creators; that is, they recontextualise images,
   sounds and embodied self-performance within the platform-specific
   affordances of trends. We found that distant suffering is mediated
   through the emotive online self-performance of content creators, cuing
   their audiences toward appropriate emotional responses. Trending sounds
   situate videos within a singular-motif and context-diverse environment,
   facilitating what we theorize as affective audio networks.},

Abstract = {The Movimento Brasil Livre (Free Brazil Movement) has been one of the
   main proponents of the new Brazilian right since its emergence after the
   June Days of 2013. Through the strategic use of social networks, it has
   promoted a conservative agenda similar to those seen in other parts of
   the world. An examination of its mobilization strategies focused on its
   communicative power, its capacity to produce engagement, and its network
   mobilization shows how the use of information and communication
   technologies influenced the emergence of new political actors on the
   Brazilian right. O Movimento Brasil Livre tem sido um dos expoentes
   principais da nova direita brasileira que e um movimento que surgiu apos
   as Jornadas de Junho de 2013. Atraves do uso estrategico das redes
   sociais, ajudou a expandir uma pauta conservadora em consonancia ao que
   ocurre em diferentes partes do mundo. A presente pesquisa avalia as
   estrategias de mobilizacao do movimento com enfase no seu poder
   comunicativo, capacidade de producao de engajamento e poder de
   mobilizacao de rede para indicar como os usos das tecnologias de
   informacao e comunicacao influenciam a emergencia de novos atores
   politicos no campo da direita brasileira.},

Abstract = {Does increasing counterinsurgent mechanization result in higher levels
   of unintentional civilian casualties? Existing research on unintentional
   civilian victimization in recent conflicts has focused on air strikes,
   but this question remains unexplored in research examining
   counterinsurgent force structure for ground units. However, a host of
   counterinsurgency practitioners in Iraq have cited the mechanized
   forces' effectiveness in delivering precision fires that limit civilian
   casualties. We propose an armored restraint theory, suggesting that
   mechanized crews' armored protection enhances soldiers' decision space
   when making the consequential choice to employ lethal force. When this
   enhanced decision space is combined with units that systematically
   respect jus in bello principles and non-combatant immunity norms, it
   results in armored restraint, which may reduce government-caused
   civilian casualties in civil conflicts. We test this theory using
   micro-data from Iraq and find mechanized units are associated with
   significantly lower civilian casualty levels compared to dismounted
   units.},

Abstract = {From a document corpus taken from leading journals recording the
   discourses and actions of President Jair Bolsonaro and his team in
   managing the economy, politics, and the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more
   than clear that this administration refuses to play by the rules of the
   democratic game. There is a close relationship between the authoritarian
   administration and the naturalization of a logic that prioritizes market
   interests above all, producing an ultra-neoliberalism that not only
   operates within the economic and financial sphere but also produces
   antidemocratic modes of social subjectivity. Segundo um corpus de
   documentos proveniente dos jornais principais que registravam os
   discursos e acoes do Presidente Jair Bolsonaro e seu equipe com respeito
   a sua gerencia da economia, da politca e da pandemia do COVID-19, fica
   muito claro que este governo se recusa a cumprir as regras do jogo
   democratico. Ademais, existe uma relacao intima entre o governo
   autoritario e a uniformizacao de uma logica que prioriza os interesses
   do mercado sobre todo, produzindo um ultra-neoliberalismo que nao
   somente opera dentro da esfera economica e financeira mas tambem gera
   modos antidemocraticos de subjetividade social.},

Abstract = {What was the `alt' in alt-right, alt-lite, and alt-left? Tracing these
   controversial terms' development over the 2010s, this article
   interrogates the construction, meaning, and utility of the `alt'
   modifier in US politics. Contextualizing the emergence of `alt' among
   wider debates about how to spatially conceptualize anti-system politics
   beyond the left-right spectrum, it argues that `alt' was used to name a
   tendency that moved beyond traditional ideological questions about what
   society should look like, and instead signified a preference about how
   politics should be done: namely, a rejection of the mainstream norms of
   political conduct, and an embrace of vulgarity, incivility and an
   extremely adversarial approach to political opposition. It shows how a
   popular-cultural understanding of `alternative' was used to give this
   approach a countercultural sheen, and maps out the cleavages between
   groups that the alt/mainstream binary opened up. Finally, it considers
   the legacy of the `alt' modifier in contemporary politics.},

Abstract = {Global support for democracy is puzzling in the time of alleged backlash
   toward democracy. Building on recent studies on democratic support that
   take into consideration heterogeneity in the subjective perceptions of
   democracy, I conducted a conjoint analysis and examined the trade-offs
   among various democratic values that the citizens might face when they
   think of democracy. Using an original dataset of 2,206 respondents,
   sampled from Japanese adult population, I found that the procedural view
   of democracy played the most important role when Japanese people
   evaluated a country's democracy level. In their view, a lack of free and
   fair elections and disenfranchisement of certain groups were more
   detrimental to democracy than a shortage of checks and balances,
   economic growth, and social welfare. In addition, the analysis shows
   that factors representing the minoritarian view and the substantive view
   of democracy play an undeniable role in citizens' democracy evaluations,
   which confirms the discrepancies between how students of democratization
   conceptualize and how ordinary people think of democracy today.},

Title = {Building blocks of polycentric governance},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 23},
Abstract = {Success or failure of a polycentric system is a function of complex
   political and social processes, such as coordination between actors and
   venues to solve specialized policy problems. Yet there is currently no
   accepted method for isolating distinct processes of coordination, nor to
   understand how their variance affects polycentric governance
   performance. We develop and test a building-blocks approach that uses
   different patterns or ``motifs `` for measuring and comparing
   coordination longitudinally on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Our
   approach confirms that polycentric governance comprises an evolving
   substrate of interdependent venues and actors over time. However, while
   issue specialization and actor participation can be improved through the
   mobilization of venues, such a strategy can also fragment overall
   polycentric capacity to resolve conflict and adapt to new problems. A
   building-blocks approach advances understanding and practice of
   polycentric governance by enabling sharper diagnosis of internal
   dynamics in complex environmental governance systems.},

Abstract = {This article argues that causality between economic conditions and
   political sentiment can be moderated by the presence of strong political
   polarisation based on sociocultural issues. We look at the
   interdependencies between economic and political sentiment in Croatia, a
   country characterised by strong political divisions over interpretations
   of history, the role of religion in society, and conflicts of
   traditional vs. modernist values. Our results reveal that economic
   variables and government support move more or less independently. Thus,
   we conclude that performance evaluation in general, and economic voting
   in particular, play a very small role in Croatian politics.},

Abstract = {What does it mean to be an academic who is also a war veteran? This
   paper examines that question as I delve into my own identity and
   positionality as a war veteran and as an academic who critically
   examines war and militarism. It is broken up into three sections: living
   war, writing war, and teaching war. Living war refers to what it is like
   to be a war veteran in academic spaces, from a student perspective to a
   teaching perspective. Writing war examines some of the ways in which war
   experiences can be utilized in academic writing, as it examines a few
   useful methodologies that were helpful and healing in my experience.
   Finally, teaching war reiterates the importance to centre war in the
   classroom and provides an example that I often use in the classroom. The
   primary aim of this paper is to discuss the reciprocal aspects of the
   interactions between my embodied war experience and higher education
   institutions.},

Title = {Integration of the European Single Market Thirty Years After Its
   Creation},
Journal = {STUDIA EUROPEJSKIE-STUDIES IN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {63-85},
Abstract = {The European single market was launched on 1st January 1993. Presumably,
   it is at that time that three fundamental barriers (physical control at
   the border, various technical requirements, and differing systems of
   indirect taxation) were formally removed to ensure four treaty-based
   freedoms: free movement of goods, freedom to provide services, free
   movement of people and free movement of capital. The EU single market is
   characteristic in nature due to the scope of legislation governing
   businesses and consumers, which is largely subject not to unification,
   rather only harmonisation. Regrettably, this has resulted in EU
   legislation being (deliberately at times) not always correctly
   implemented into the national legal system. This leads to market
   fragmentation and creates barriers, rather than eliminating them. This
   study aims to identify the relationship between full and correct
   implementation of EU legislation into the Member States' legal systems
   versus progress in European single market integration. Therefore, the
   evolution of indicators defining how much EU single market legislation
   in the Member States has been implemented was examined. At the same
   time, changes in transposition deficit (from 1997 to 2021) and
   conformity deficit (from 2004 to 2021) for particular Member States were
   critically analysed. Further, it was analysed how much the single market
   was integrated from the perspective of goods being the main components
   of the single European market. To this end, intra-EU trade was analysed
   as broken down into exports and imports of goods, versus the global
   trade of individual Member States (including trade with non-EU
   partners). The outcome of the study shows that both transposition and
   conformity deficit levels are quite high. In turn, intra-EU trade in
   goods does not largely correspond to the extent of implementation of EU
   legislation, which may be caused by growing interest in non-EU partners
   without compromising EU presence.},

Abstract = {There is a widespread consensus that urban warfare poses significant
   challenges for military leadership. In this paper I examine general
   ethical questions associated with the strongest gang model for urban
   warfare, proposed by David Betz and Hugo Stanford-Tuck. The paper
   eventually focuses on leadership responsibility. What are the particular
   ethical demands on small-team leaders in urban warfare? The claim I
   shall defend is that military leadership according to the strongest gang

Abstract = {This main focus of this article is to elaborate on the personal
   dimension of the mandate of the OSCE High Commissioner on National
   Minorities. Using interviews with the HCNMs, other interlocutors and
   studies on HCNM's conflict prevention practice, the article profiles the
   individual and professional backgrounds of the six past and present
   HCNMs: Max van der Stoel, Rolf Ek \& eacute;us, Knut Vollebaek, Astrid
   Thors, Lamberto Zannier and Kairat Abdrakhmanov. It looks at some of the
   common and distinct elements of the HCNMs' experience in a so-called
   mutual accommodation between the post and the post-holder's personality
   and background over the last three decades of existence of the
   institution (1993-2023). How one takes ownership of the mandate and the
   persona created? How does one operates including through the quiet
   diplomacy approach? The paper finds that the political clout and the
   profile of the post-holder matter in upholding a strategic approach to
   conflict prevention that captures the critical connections between the
   security and human dimensions of conflict prevention. At the same time,
   it acknowledges that the evolving political and security environment
   demands adaptations and that there are there are limits to what one
   person may achieve without a cooperative and supportive environment. A
   key challenge remains, however, regarding making use of existing
   possibilities for the HCNM to engage and relatedly, the willingness or
   capacity of the post-holder to take calculated risks in order to focus
   on the HCNM core mandate of conflict prevention.},

Abstract = {EU Foreign and Security Policy and Their Implications for Norway The
   European Union's (EU) collective response to Russia's war on Ukraine
   illustrates the breadth of the EU's foreign policy tools and Member
   States' increased willingness to address common challenges within the
   EU-system. How the EU and NATO increasingly complement each other has
   also become clearer. The war and a changed geopolitical situation also
   illustrate how security increasingly spills over into other policy areas
   in the EU, such as trade, energy, technology, communication and critical
   raw materials. We therefore find ourselves in a European security policy
   context that has radically changed since 1994. A key challenge for
   Norway is that its agreements with the EU do not reflect these
   developments. To compensate for this, there is a continuous need to
   pursue new agreements in order to ensure Norwegian security interests,
   which is demanding and unpredictable. So far, there have been challenges
   related to potential Norwegian participation in the EU's satellite-based
   communications collaboration (IRIS2) and the health union, for example.
   This article discusses the EU's foreign and security policies, and
   implications for Norway. We outline important developments and drivers
   behind the EU's foreign policy, before delving deeper into the kind of
   foreign policy actor the EU is today. Finally, we discuss the
   significance of this development for Norway.},

Abstract = {It is generally accepted that attempts at coup d'etat have decreased
   since the end of the Cold War. But this does not mean that coup attempts
   will not occur in the future. With the recent two military coups in
   Thailand and Myanmar, all the continental states in Southeast Asia have
   entered authoritarian rules. This article explores when coups possibly
   occurred in the cases of Thailand in 2014 and Myanmar in 2021 that
   experienced overthrowing the civilian governments and the rise of the
   military in power. The Early Warning Signals (EWS) recently endorsed to
   investigation of the likelihood of military coups and qualitative
   analysis of collected data on factors affecting such incidents were
   combined to better explain the situations. From this approach, this
   article found that Group Grievance and Security Apparatus indicators in
   the Fragile States Index are important factors leading to the occurrence
   of military coups in the two countries. Also, from the qualitative
   analysis, a political culture relying on on iconic political leaders in
   the two countries has been a negative influence that deludes
   democratization and challenges civilian rule.},

   criticism derived from the critical hermeneutics of Habermas and Ricoeur
   and critical thinking of Masaryk. The paper analyses significant
   criticism which accompanied critical readings of Masaryk's Czech
   Question. This includes liberal criticism represented by Kaizl,
   Peroutka, Lowenstein, and Havelka, the national conservative critique of
   the Czech historian Pekar, religious and Christian critiques, especially
   of Hromadka and Radl, Marxist critiques of Czech Marxists, communists,
   and Bolsheviks, and the political praise and philosophical criticism of
   Jan Patocka. The paper not only offers criticism but also discusses and
   tries to find out which of Masaryk's concepts are alive in the face of
   criticism stemming from modern Czech history and the current political
   situation.},

Abstract = {Since 2015, a series of high-impact global crises has sent shockwaves
   across Europe. From the so-called migrant crisis of 2015, through the
   Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, national minorities have, like
   their majority counterparts, seen considerable changes to their lives
   and lifestyles as a result of measures taken by the national executives
   in their host countries. It is possible that significant changes to
   border control and the increased importance of nation-state action in
   times of crisis have affected the ways in which national minorities
   understand themselves vis \& agrave;-vis their host and kin-states. By
   reviewing recent media comments and academic research, this article
   hypothesises that these international crises have pushed national
   minorities away from local identities and towards more national and
   European discourses. As a commentary, this article encourages future
   exploration of this hypothesis in other minority communities across
   Europe.},

Abstract = {When Norway left the UN Security Council on 31 December 2022, observers
   described Norway's two years on the Council as a ``diplomatic feat{''}.
   Despite the pandemic and a very hostile diplomatic climate between the
   veto powers, Norway, together with other elected members, managed to
   build alliances, negotiate and maneuver. Within the UN system and in the
   diplomatic community in New York, Norway was acknowledged in particular
   for initiating a number of measures to strengthen the UN Security
   Council's work on ``Women, Peace and Security{''} (WPS). By working
   systematically and targeted, Norway contributed, among other things, to
   increasing the number of women briefers to the Council, and to
   strengthening the operationalization of previous commitments on WPS in
   the UN's operational activities. Not only did the Norwegian way of
   operating help streamline the UN Security Council's work on WPS, it also
   contributed to strengthen Norway's international status as a leading
   country in this thematic area.},

Abstract = {The political system in Belarus is still in the process of
   non-democratic transformation. This evolution was launched by the
   political crisis that had emerged in 2020 due to the presidential
   campaign. It became evident that previous methods of authoritarian
   governing using elements of facade democracy were not effective anymore
   for keeping and legitimating power. Political crisis in Belarus and
   authority reaction led to reestablishing functions of the political
   institutions, dismantling pro-democratic activities, introducing
   political terror as one of the main instruments of the political rule.
   As a result, a new type of political regime has formed. Its
   stabilisation is still going on; new political and institutional
   components are introduced and fixed in the new constitution. Political,
   structural and functional changes of the Belarusian regime allowed us to
   speak about it as neo-totalitarian. This chapter deals with studying the
   main institutional changes in Belarus, which lead Belarusian society and
   the state from the neo-authoritarian political conditions to the
   neo-totalitarian.},

Title = {The Political Geography of Globalized Civil Wars: Networked Actors and
   Multi-Scalar Strategies in the Kurdish Conflict Assemblage},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {This article introduces and lays out a conflict assemblage framework for
   understanding the political geography of globalized civil wars. It
   suggests the utility of conceptualizing Turkey's Kurdish conflict as an
   assemblage in which networked actors use multi-scalar strategies as part
   of their overall conflict strategy. Insurgent organizations such as the
   Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) operate at various scales beyond the
   national-including local, regional, transnational, and global-and in so
   doing utilize political opportunities and mobilize resources that are
   embedded in different locales. In the Kurdish case, disparate sites such
   as Diyarbakir, Marseille, Istanbul, London, New York, and Kobane become
   tied together within a single conflict assemblage that transcends
   geographical boundaries. An assemblage approach to violent conflict is a
   form of ontological theorizing that highlights this spatial and
   political complexity. By treating violent conflicts as assemblages with
   their own symbolic boundaries, political dynamics, internal governance
   structures, and strategic logics, we gain a better understanding of the
   contours and dynamics of globalized civil wars.
   Este articulo presenta y establece un marco de ensamblaje de conflictos
   con el fin de comprender la geografia politica de las guerras civiles
   globalizadas. Sugiere la utilidad que tendria el hecho de conceptualizar
   el conflicto kurdo de Turquia como un ensamblaje en el que actores
   interconectados en una red utilizan estrategias multiescalares como
   parte de su estrategia general de conflicto. Organizaciones insurgentes
   como el Partido de los Trabajadores del Kurdistan (PKK) operan en
   diversas escalas mas alla de la nacional, incluyendo la local, regional,
   transnacional y global, y al hacerlo utilizan oportunidades politicas y
   movilizan recursos que estan incorporados en diferentes lugares. En el
   caso kurdo, sitios dispares como Diyarbakir, Marsella, Estambul,
   Londres, Nueva York y Kobane se unen dentro de un solo ensamblaje de
   conflicto que trasciende las fronteras geograficas. Un enfoque de
   ensamblaje para el conflicto violento es una forma de teorizacion
   ontologica que destaca esta complejidad espacial y politica. Al tratar
   los conflictos violentos como ensamblajes con sus propias fronteras
   simbolicas, dinamicas politicas, estructuras de gobierno interno y
   logicas estrategicas, obtenemos una mejor comprension de los contornos y
   dinamicas de las guerras civiles globalizadas.
   Cet article presente la notion d'agencement de conflits comme cadre
   theorique pour comprendre la geographie politique des guerres civiles
   mondialisees. Il montre l'utilite de conceptualiser le conflit kurde en
   Turquie comme un agencement dans lequel les acteurs en reseau deploient
   des strategies multiscalaires dans le cadre de leur strategie globale de
   conflit. Des organisations insurgees telles que le Parti des
   travailleurs du Kurdistan (PKK) operent a diverses echelles au-dela du
   national, y compris local, regional, transnational et mondial. Ce
   faisant, elles profitent d'opportunites politiques et mobilisent des
   ressources qui s'inscrivent dans differents contextes geographiques.
   Dans le cas kurde, des sites disparates tels que Diyarbakir, Marseille,
   Istanbul, Londres, New York et Kobane sont lies au sein d'un seul
   agencement de conflit qui transcende les frontieres geographiques.
   Utiliser la notion d'agencement pour apprehender les conflits violents
   est une forme de theorisation ontologique qui met en lumiere leur
   complexite spatiale et politique. En considerant les conflits violents
   comme des agencements dotes de leurs propres limites symboliques,
   dynamiques politiques, structures de gouvernance interne et logiques
   strategiques, nous enrichissons notre connaissance des contours et
   dynamiques des guerres civiles mondialisees.},

Abstract = {Ukraine has always been a plural state comprised of multiple ethnic,
   linguistic, religious, and regional subcultures. Yet, since 2014 and, in
   particular, since February 2022, these often-competing identities have
   been codified under a more overarching identity. The forging of unified
   plural Ukrainian identity as concept has arisen out of a mutual struggle
   for survival, international diaspora mobilization, the elevation of
   diverse narratives of experience from across Ukraine, and a connected
   digital environment that links and reinforces concepts of social
   capital. Rooted in theories of constructivist identity formation, this
   analysis examines those attributes of Ukraine and Ukrainian society
   which have been fused together under great pressure to create a new and
   perhaps more unified national identity. Leveraging cases examining
   discourses on identity and the production of shared socio-cultural
   artifacts and quantitative data from both public opinion surveys and
   large-scale social media sentiment, this analysis finds that Ukraine,
   often thought of in the West as fractured along multiple lines, is, in
   fact unifying behind a common national idea. This unification and the
   creation of a new national identity have profound implications for
   post-war Ukraine.},

Abstract = {In the wake of the deepest and longest recession that the United Kingdom
   has experienced since the 1930s, the consequences of Brexit and now
   COVID too, this article examines the origins, sustenance and puncturing
   of the growth dynamic it enjoyed since the early 1990s. It identifies
   what is termed the `Anglo-liberal growth model' and its social policy
   corollary, `asset-based welfare', considering the symbiotic yet
   increasingly tense and dynamic interdependence of the two. It argues
   that although both are compromised by the compound shocks of the crisis,
   Brexit and COVID, they have in fact become more not less intertwined and
   interdependent in these more troubled times. It considers the
   implications for the long-term sustainability of this fractious coupling
   and the wider consequences for UK economic performance and social
   welfare in the years ahead.},

Abstract = {Research on wealth inequality and wealth concentration has made much
   progress in establishing statistics on the distribution of private
   wealth, its historical development, and its components in a large set of
   countries. Yet, this research is less concerned with country-specific
   contexts that have an impact on the practical relevance of private
   wealth and its distribution. This article develops a framework for
   comparative research that is interested in this question. Starting from
   a typology that distinguishes six ``capacities of wealth,{''} it asserts
   that private assets can be more important, more powerful, or more
   tolerable, depending on the institutional regulation of the political
   economy, for example, limitations on private property rights, welfare
   state redistribution, the electoral system, and cultural patterns of
   wealth legitimation. Using the USA and Germany as exemplary cases, I
   show that such differences exist and are politically relevant and that
   investigating the practical significance of private wealth in different
   political economies would open up new research trajectories in wealth
   research.},

Abstract = {Establishing representative bodies for the regions was an opportunity
   for politics to be decentralised. Using a three-dimensional index of
   congruence of the vote, this text explores the extent to which this
   opportunity has been taken up in Czech regional elections. Analysing all
   such ballots since 2000, it compares electoral competition at the
   national and regional levels; the success of regional parties is also
   analysed. The results show that Czech regional polls are strongly
   national in flavour, and their results are similar to those of national
   elections (only the second-order-election effect is visible); the
   success of regional parties is very limited, while national parties
   clearly dominate.},

Abstract = {Precisely because public health crises are uncertain, complex and have
   multiple dimensions, deeper institutional state capacity is needed. This
   article develops an approach to thinking about state capacity by
   incorporating time as a key component of a refurbished idea of state
   capacity. This reorientation helps us understand the specific
   mechanisms, especially of learning - that were crucial for the success
   of East Asian cases in managing the COVID-19 epidemic. Previous exposure
   to a health crisis - a critical juncture - activates learning capacity
   via two distinct mechanisms, one a political route of that restores
   public trust and renews the social contract, and the second through a
   functional route leading to administrative capacity building
   necessitated by a complex and multiplex crisis that crosses a variety of
   boundaries. Learning that builds coordinating state capacity is
   therefore needed. This article applies these ideas to understanding the
   successful pathway cases of South Korea and Taiwan.},

Abstract = {This article examines the effect of various enabling factors that
   influence the innovation performance of the global south countries by
   analyzing the Global Innovation Index-2020, as little was known about
   their innovative behavior. Unlike previous studies, this article
   investigates what factors drive innovation performance in the
   global-south countries by examining the other factors unrelated to the
   input subset of GII. Multiple regressions were employed using
   cross-sectional data from 86 countries to explore the relationship while
   controlling for GDP per capita, R\&D expenditures, R\&D personnel,
   income gap, population, income level, government category, and regions.
   The robust results indicate that innovation performance was
   significantly linked with e-participation, efficiency enablers, and
   democracy. Inconsistent with previous studies and the hypotheses of this
   study, e-governance, economic freedom, and governance effectiveness
   remained indifferent to national innovation performance, ceteris
   paribus. These results suggest that improving developing countries'
   e-participation, efficiency enablers, and democratic culture, which
   represent policy planning and institutional structure, would
   significantly contribute to increasing innovation behavior and economic
   development.},

Abstract = {Why are international regulatory standards not set? While most of the
   literature focuses on explaining positive cases of standard-setting
   where international rules are agreed upon, weak or negative cases remain
   prevalent and yet surprisingly under-explored. To explain these cases in
   the area of financial services, we integrate an inter-state explanation,
   which focuses on competition between major jurisdictions, with a
   transgovernmental explanation, which relates to conflict between
   different regulatory bodies at the international level. We also consider
   how these dimensions interact with financial industry lobbying. This
   allows us to construct a typology differentiating between distinct types
   of cases concerning international standard-setting: (1) absent
   standards, (2) non-agreed standards, (3) symbolic standards, and (4)
   agreed standards. The explanatory leverage of our approach is
   illustrated through a systematic structured focused comparison of four
   post-crisis cases related to ``shadow banking.{''} The article generates
   novel insights into regulatory conflicts and the scope conditions for
   international agreement.},

   anti-Muslim attitudes in the United States},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},

Abstract = {What are the underpinnings and ramifications of anti-Muslim attitudes in
   the United States? While scholars have emphasized the centrality of race
   and racial attitudes to American politics, examinations of hostility
   towards Muslim Americans with context-specific measures are still
   lacking despite the increasing relevance of this population in the
   public imagination. Particularly after the tragic 9/11 attacks,
   Islamophobia emerged as a pervasive force in American social and
   political life, entangling race, religion, and nationality to further
   stigmatize and marginalize Muslims. By more systematically examining the
   relationship between anti-Muslim attitudes and public support for a
   range of initiatives that aim to, or already have, further
   marginalize(d) American Muslims, the research presented herein aims to
   underscore the limitations of attitudinal measures that lack context
   specificity. Through two studies that utilize a nationally
   representative survey and a longitudinal study of public opinion towards
   Muslims, we make the case for the development and use of more nuanced
   measures that capture the distinct nature of hostility towards Muslims
   as encompassing both perceived realistic and symbolic threats.
   Additionally, we consider the range of social, psychological, and
   physical consequences that Islamophobia may exert on Muslim individuals
   themselves, as well as their interactions with the majority population.
   These have important implications for scholars studying the
   sociopolitical behavior of Muslims and policymakers seeking to
   counteract the adverse effects of Islamophobia in the United States or
   elsewhere.},

Abstract = {In the most notorious, mixed Roma and non-Roma Romanian neighbourhood of
   Bucharest, structurally accumulated problems of governance turn into
   practical challenges that need to be tackled with the means at each
   person's disposal. Under conditions of capitalist incorporation and
   prolonged crises on the post-socialist periphery, the main protagonists
   of this account-male members of an extended network of Spoitori Roma
   with diverse livelihoods-strive for relative independence not only from
   market forces but also from actors who may expose them to abuse. In this
   article, I reflect on personalized value struggles associated with
   marketization. Instead of accepting the sectorial divisions between
   formality and informality, I show how marketization elucidates moral
   evaluations of being and doing good among men who hope to be or become
   ``their own bosses{''} in precarious urban conditions. Distinguishing
   folk and analytic concepts, my analysis engages with the moral
   contestation of the ``good{''} and the ambiguity of value-based human
   endeavours among different layers of contemporary economic life.},

Abstract = {Global multi-stakeholder initiatives aiming to strengthen public
   governance and transparency (PGMSIs) in participating countries are
   increasingly prominent but little researched and undertheorized. This
   analysis provides a preliminary mapping of the 121 countries that
   participate in the six most prominent initiatives (CoST, EITI, OCP, OGP,
   IATI). Rates of participation in single and multiple initiatives are
   characterized according to contextual factors of geography, economic
   development, and democratic governance. This mapping is complemented by
   31 interviews with government focal points in countries that participate
   in multiple initiatives, assessing national motivations for
   participation. Interview results suggest that countries are motivated by
   considerations related both to technical capacity development and
   reputational effects, and that in many countries these motivations are
   mutually reinforcing. Interview responses further highlight how
   different types of actors are associated with different motivations,
   including government agencies, domestic civil society, international
   donor organizations, and PGMSIs themselves. Findings indicate that
   national decisions to participate in PGMSIs are perceived to be driven
   by both capacity and reputational motivations, but primarily by national
   actors (heads of state, ministries, and to a lesser extent civil
   society). The particular role of the World Bank, different types of
   government actors, and the PGMSIs themselves are given particular
   attention.},

Abstract = {Digital technology is frequently used in the delivery of public
   services. Since not everyone has the skills or digital access required
   to use such digital services, street-level bureaucrats must find new
   ways to support citizens to be able to enhance digital inclusion. In
   most public settings, these new practices of digital support need to be
   developed in parallel with the street-level bureaucrats' ordinary
   assignments. This article analyses the development of street-level
   bureaucrats' entrepreneurial and innovative practices in promoting
   digital inclusion in two spheres: conventional welfare service provision
   and in a project-based welfare service provision initiative explicitly
   intended to enhance digital inclusion. The article builds on qualitative
   case studies in municipalities in Sweden and demonstrates that there are
   more openings for innovative, entrepreneurial solutions among
   street-level bureaucrats in the more project-based setting than in the
   conventional welfare services. This implies that context matters for
   street-level entrepreneurial approaches.},

Abstract = {Avoiding moral hazard is a recurrent argument of those seeking to limit
   the development of European financial support mechanisms. Germany has
   been the traditional leader of this coalition of actors in the European
   Union (EU). However, in reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic, Germany
   supported an EU response which included grants and massive debt
   issuance. What was previously presented as unacceptable - because of
   moral hazard - became appropriate. This contribution seeks to explain
   why the German government ceased to emphasise the moral hazard problem
   in EU economic governance. We argue that the answer is not because of a
   challenge to the relevance of moral hazard per se, or because the
   Germans lost interest in the moral hazard problem, but rather because
   German policymakers were discursively constrained by one of the dominant
   meanings of moral hazard they had previously imposed - which lost its
   relevance in the context of a symmetric exogenous shock.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether the spatial segregation of immigrant
   groups conditions the relationship between the share of migrants and
   attitudes towards EU integration. Do varying degrees of clustering of
   migrants in space diminish, mitigate or exacerbate the effect of
   immigration on EU attitudes? We combine data from the European Social
   Survey with fine-grain spatial segregation measures captured by the D4I
   project across four European Union countries. We find that those who
   live in regions with a greater share of migrants from Eastern Europe
   have more positive attitudes towards the EU but that this positive
   influence diminishes in highly segregated areas. The analysis also shows
   that the effect is primarily driven by the working class. Our findings
   have important implications as they show that the joint consideration of
   both the levels and the distribution of migrants in space is crucial to
   understanding the relationship between immigration and attitudes towards
   the EU.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {IntroductionWhy do cohorts differ in their attitudes toward sexual
   orientation and what is the role of societal values during formative
   years? We investigate whether discontinuities in the prevailing values
   of equality and tradition in a person's formative years impinge on their
   attitudes toward sexual orientation as adults.MethodsWe test this by
   integrating historical political data from the Manifesto Project Dataset
   with contemporary micro-data on attitudes toward sexual orientation from
   10 rounds of the European Social Survey (2002-2020) across 13 cohorts in
   13 European countries.Results and discussionUsing hierarchical
   age-period-cohort analysis with synthetic age cohorts, we find if the
   value of equality is politically diffuse, it can have a socializing
   effect. We find that the individuals who came of age during a period
   when political values of equality were more dominant are more tolerant
   of gays and lesbians. On the other hand, we do not find any evidence
   that individuals who experience youth during a time of more traditional
   political values have more negative opinions about different sexual
   orientations. Overall, these findings suggest that cohorts adopt
   distinct patterns of attitudes toward gays and lesbians as a result of a
   collective process of socialization during their impressionable years.},

Abstract = {Climate change, health pandemics, structural decline, and more - the
   challenges of solving political problems are daunting, particularly when
   the political institutions addressing them are not trusted. This article
   tests the economic theory that residents of high-income regions are more
   likely to trust political institutions, given their positive experiences
   with services and opportunities, against the rival argument that
   predicts a negative effect of regional disadvantage within a country on
   political trust. Using European Values Study and World Values Survey
   (2017-2020) data, combined with socioeconomic data for 606 regions in 42
   countries, this paper analyses samples of regions both in and outside
   the EU. The results suggest that people living in wealthy EU regions -
   both in absolute and relative terms - trust national government more and
   the EU less. In the global sample, the evidence is more variegated and
   corroborates economic theory only in democracies. The article sketches
   implications for regional inequality, political trust, and legitimacy

Abstract = {Resilience of local communities (territorial hromadas) is an
   increasingly salient matter in the academic and policy debate on the
   factors which have determined Ukraine's resilience to Russia's 2022
   invasion. Building on existing literature on institutional resilience
   and its predictors, this article explains the ability of Ukrainian
   self-governed municipalities to withstand the threats to institutional
   stability stemming from the invasion. First, it uses an exploratory
   qualitative design to operationalize the concept of resilience and its
   predictors with an account of varying experiences of Ukrainian hromadas
   during the full-scale invasion (e.g., hromadas near the frontline and in
   the rear). Next, it presents data from open sources and the results of a
   regression analysis to test the impact of various groups of predictors
   on hromadas' resilience to the full-scale invasion. Our models show a
   significant relationship between hromadas' resilience and geographical,
   politico-administrative and economic predictors influenced by the
   outcomes of the decentralization reform conducted in Ukraine since 2014.},

Abstract = {A common explanation for the success of populists is that they
   rhetorically shift blame for their followers' hardships toward
   ``elites,{''} therefore creating a culpable outgroup. However, we argue
   that there are two confounded effects at play here: shifting blame
   toward an outgroup and shifting blame away from oneself. Therefore, we
   theorize that above and beyond elite blame, victimization rhetoric
   heightens leader support because it specifically relieves followers of
   the pressure of having to take responsibility for negative life
   outcomes, especially when they subscribe to neoliberal competition
   ideology. Supporting our predictions, we show via a survey that victim
   rhetoric increases leader support while controlling for elite blame,
   especially among people subscribing to neoliberal competition ideology.
   In a subsequent experiment, we replicate the findings causally and show
   that the effect works by reducing perceived personal responsibility for
   negative life outcomes. Our results indicate that populist rhetoric
   involves shifting blame toward others and away from oneself. This can
   explain some of the conundrums that have plagued the literature, such as
   why elites also fall for populist rhetoric. We discuss our findings in
   relation to cultural differences and differences in left- versus
   right-wing populism.},

Abstract = {The global race for green hydrogen is not just about decarbonisation,
   but also about power and profit. Examining the formation of a political
   project around an emerging hydrogen economy in South Africa, this
   article shows that a hydrogen transition is fundamentally contested.
   Employing (neo-)Gramscian hegemony theory and historical materialist
   policy analysis, it delineates four competing hydrogen initiatives in
   the policy debate: green extractivism, green developmentalism, fossilism
   and energy justice. The findings indicate the dominance of green
   extractivism, which prioritises the export of green hydrogen to Europe
   and reproduces patterns of neocolonialism and unequal ecological
   exchange. Contestations arise both from reactionary forces clinging to
   fossil fuels as well as from initiatives pursuing justice-centred
   transitions through green developmentalism and energy justice. This
   study contributes to the debate on justice in the global energy
   transition by highlighting alternative transition pathways in the global
   South that challenge green extractivism through sovereign industrial
   development and energy justice.
   La course mondiale a l'hydrogene vert n'est pas seulement une question
   de decarbonisation, mais aussi de pouvoir et de profit. En examinant la
   formation d'un projet politique autour de l'emergence d'une economie de
   l'hydrogene en Afrique du Sud, nous montrons que la transition vers
   l'hydrogene est fondamentalement contestee. En nous appuyant sur la
   theorie de l'hegemonie (neo-)gramscienne et sur l'analyse materialiste
   historique des politiques, nous delimitons quatre initiatives
   concurrentes dans le debat politique relatif a l'hydrogene :
   l'extractivisme vert, le developpementalisme vert, le fossilisme et la
   justice energetique. Nos conclusions soulignent la predominance de
   l'extractivisme vert, qui donne la priorite a l'exportation d'hydrogene
   vert a destination de l'Europe et reproduit des schemas de
   neocolonialisme et d'echange ecologique inegal. Les contestations
   proviennent a la fois des forces reactionnaires qui s'accrochent aux
   combustibles fossiles et des initiatives poursuivant des transitions
   axees sur la justice par le biais d'un developpement vert et d'une
   justice energetique. Cette etude contribue au debat relatif a la justice
   dans la transition energetique mondiale en mettant en evidence des voies
   de transition alternatives dans les pays du Sud qui remettent en
   question l'extractivisme vert par le biais d'un developpement industriel
   souverain et de la justice energetique.
   A corrida global ao hidrogenio verde nao tem apenas a ver com a
   descarbonizacao, mas tambem com a energia e o lucro. Analisando a
   formacao de um projeto politico em torno de uma economia emergente de
   hidrogenio na africa do Sul, este artigo mostra que as transicoes de
   hidrogenio sao fundamentalmente processos contestados. Empregando a
   teoria da hegemonia (neo)gramsciana e a analise politica materialista
   historica, expoem-se quatro iniciativas concorrentes no debate politico:
   extrativismo verde, desenvolvimentismo verde, fossilismo e justica
   energetica. Os resultados indicam o dominio do extrativismo verde, que
   prioriza a exportacao de hidrogenio verde para a Europa e reproduz
   padroes de neocolonialismo e trocas ecologicas desiguais. As
   contestacoes surgem tanto de forcas reacionarias agarradas aos
   combustiveis fosseis como de iniciativas que procuram transicoes
   centradas na justica atraves do desenvolvimentismo verde e da justica
   energetica. Este estudo contribui para o debate sobre a justica na
   transicao energetica global, destacando caminhos alternativos de
   transicao no Sul global que desafiam o extrativismo verde atraves do
   desenvolvimento industrial soberano e da justica energetica.},

Abstract = {A key theory of environmental politics holds that states must achieve a
   certain level of economic development before environmental protection
   will occur. The assumption is that once people attain economic
   satisfaction, they are no longer willing to accept environmental
   degradation in return for a greater standard of living. Yet, numerous
   developing states ratify environmental treaties without achieving a
   median-level per-capita income. How do some states reach environmental
   goals that require some behaviour change without the assumed demands of
   the citizenry? This paper argues that judicial autonomy may be the key
   to bringing environmental protection to the poorest states in the
   developing world. Activist judges, free of political interference, can
   push through policies that are unpopular but serve the greater good.
   Reacting to this, governments may be more likely to sign and ratify
   international environmental agreements. Using patterns of ratification
   for two conventions, I find evidence in favour of the hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Since the Age of Enlightenment, many thinkers and philosophers have
   viewed democracy and science as two aspects of modernity that reinforce
   each other. This article highlights a tension between the two by arguing
   that certain aspects of contemporary democracy may aggravate the mass
   public's anti-intellectual tendency and thus potentially hinder
   scientific progress. The authors analyze a new global survey of public
   opinion on science using empirical strategies that exploit cross-country
   and cross-cohort variations in experience with democracy, and show that
   less-educated citizens in democracies distrust science much more than do
   their counterparts in nondemocracies. Further analyses suggest that the
   increase in skepticism in democracies is not the result of greater
   religiosity or weaker scientific literacy; instead, it is more likely
   driven by a shift in the mode of legitimation, which reduces states'
   ability and willingness to act as key public advocates for science.
   These findings shed light on the institutional sources of
   science-bashing in many longstanding democracies.},

Abstract = {This study explores the variation in the non-state armed group (NSAGs)'s
   behavior concerning target selection. Scholars of transnational
   terrorism have investigated transnational NSAGs' target selection.
   However, we are still missing out on the most common form of terrorism,
   terrorism perpetrated by domestic NSAGs involved in civil conflicts.
   This paper's novel contribution is to the understanding of domestic
   NSAGs' strategic logic. I argue that hardening makes soft targets,
   including civilians, attractive targets when hard targets are no longer
   attractive. NSAGs tactically adapt to hardening by switching to soft
   targets or by displacing attacks to adjacent locations within their home
   country. The empirical results from data on relevant state-group dyads
   in India between 2004-2016 show that domestic NSAGs (1) switch to soft
   targets when faced with hardening, (2) less frequently target soft
   targets when more of their attacks against hard targets have been
   logistically successful, and (3) commit more attacks in their primary
   area of operation when more of their attacks in that location have been
   logistically successful. These findings emphasize a variety of ways
   through which domestic NSAGs adapt their tactics and underscore
   potential costs for target hardening.},

Abstract = {This article makes the case that the literature of hegemonic orders and
   debates on the crisis of US hegemony have been shaped and up to a point
   intellectually confined by a tradition or idea of world history
   understood as a series of hegemonic powers. This tradition of history as
   a succession of hegemonic powers is traced from ancient to modern
   sources, later reconstituted as a theoretical discourse. In drawing
   attention to the historical traditions underpinning this literature,
   these findings contribute to advancing the historiography of
   International Relations and to studying the role of multiple
   contemporaneous histories in the emerging international order.},

Abstract = {When Russia amassed troops in the winter of 2021-2022, many analysts
   deemed a large-scale invasion of Ukraine unlikely. Surveying the expert
   literature, we establish that these arguments largely relied on
   utility-based reasoning: Analysts thought an invasion was improbable, as
   it would foreseeably entail massive costs for Russia, its people, and
   its regime. We show that this regnant expert opinion had not
   sufficiently accounted for the Russian regime's tendencies to
   increasingly accept risks, coupled with an inadequate processing of
   information on Ukrainian and Western views and policies. We argue that
   analysts miscalculated partially because the most prominent facts,
   long-term trends, and causal mechanisms available to them jointly
   suggested Russian cost-sensitivity, but provided only weak signs of
   countervailing factors. We thereby showcase that good forecasting
   requires explicit theory with a view on multiple interacting causal
   factors, area expertise and Socratic humility on the extent, context and
   certainty of our findings.},

Abstract = {Major arms producing states and defense firms have struggled to supply
   the Ukraine war's massive demand for munitions. Key elements of the
   war-such as artificial intelligence-enabled analysis of data obtained
   from commercial surveillance satellites transmitted by the
   privately-owned Starlink network-have emerged from new providers as well
   as developed organically on the battlefield. Research failed to
   anticipate this due largely to the discipline's focus on the ``defense
   industry{''} rather than three distinct ``defense industries{''}
   highlighted in the war: platforms such as tanks, commodities such as
   artillery shells and loitering munitions, and militarized ``tech{''}
   such as commercial satellites and artificial intelligence. Understanding
   each requires a distinct political economic approach. Using these three
   lenses, the article concludes that the United States retains advantages
   in all three industries, Europe risks regressing into a commodities
   producer, and China seeks to disrupt, rather than duplicate, American
   defense industrial advantages in technology.},

Abstract = {Standards developed by standard-setting organisations (SSOs) - sometimes
   labelled private rulemaking - are part of larger practices of governance
   in most societies yet are underinvestigated from a policy process
   perspective. Utilising and developing the multiple streams approach
   (MSA), this article investigates a policy process moving between
   government and the SSO Standards Norway (SN). The study finds
   standardisation by SSOs to be an ambiguous institutional arrangement.
   Strong institutional barriers in theory did not work as such in the case
   investigated. This article argues that the differentiation between
   responsibility for process (SN) and content (committee) makes the
   standardisation process vulnerable. The concept of ``institutional
   deficit{''} is introduced to describe a potential mismatch between SSOs
   producing policy in a government-like institution, but where the SSOs
   are not capable of taking responsibility for policies in a
   government-like way. This article finds the adjusted MSA useful in this
   potentially least likely case.},

Abstract = {This article investigates member state influence on the making of EU
   counter-terrorism policy. Crucially, member states have not been viewed
   as major drivers of change in EU counter-terrorism, despite their
   experience of attacks, policy expertise, and the domestic salience of
   the issue. To address this gap, I show how member states acted as policy
   entrepreneurs during EU Passenger Name Records (EU-PNR), on which final
   agreement was reached in 2016. Specifically, I demonstrate that the UK
   Home Office was a prominent, long-term actor in the development of the
   EU's counter-terrorism policy and worked with the Commission to build an
   alliance in favour of EU-PNR. However, it was only with the `window of
   opportunity' presented by jihadi terrorist attacks between 2015 and 2016
   that members of the French government were finally able to pressure
   critical elements of the European Parliament into agreement.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to extend Bippus and Young's (2005)
   study and examine the effectiveness of the ``I-you,{''} ``I,{''}
   ``You,{''} ``We,{''} ``But{''} and Question-based ``Why{''} statements
   from Winer's (2021) verbal coding program of conflict management using
   Bandura's (1977) social learning theory
   (SLT).Design/methodology/approachMixed methods were used using 175
   university students from Texas and New York. A cross-sectional
   convenience sampling approach was conducted. Survey data was collected
   using Qualtrics.FindingsDescriptive results demonstrated that the
   ``We{''} statement was the most passive, the ``I-you{''} statement was
   the most assertive and the ``But,{''} ``I,{''} ``You{''} and Question
   statements were perceived to be aggressive. In addition, assertive
   ``I-You{''} statements were perceived to be more effective in resolving
   the conflict and maintaining a relationship, whereas aggressive
   statements were less likely to resolve the conflict and maintain the
   relationship. Qualitative themes also support the ``I-You{''} statement
   as the most assertive, while the ``But,{''} ``You{''} and ``I{''}
   statements were found to be the most aggressive statements.Practical
   implicationsImplications and applications are discussed to stimulate
   future research among researchers and practitioners when addressing
   conflict. Being aware of the verbal statements that de-escalate conflict
   may be helpful in solving conflict in interpersonal, family and
   professional relationships. Future trainings can adopt effective verbal
   statements to resolve conflict when experiencing anger issues. Future
   research can continue to investigate verbal communication statements
   using SLT to help practitioners and managers address conflict in
   interpersonal relationships.Originality/valueThis study examines verbal
   statements in relation to communication styles and conflict management.},

Abstract = {Scholars have historically focused on explaining terrorist groups by
   reference to a variety of external factors believed to prompt
   politically motivated acts of violence. This essay seeks to extend and
   sharpen these insights. First, members of the May 19th Communist
   Organization were alienated by contemporary social justice movements.
   The members developed strong affective bonds with revolutionary figures
   which created a sense of differential belonging. Second, their
   commitment to a Marxist-Leninist utopian ideal functioned as an
   encyclopedic myth. These two elements provided them with a specific
   sense of agency, and established a rationale for violence. Several
   implications follow from these observations.},

Abstract = {In June 2016, the WHO officially declares the end of the Ebola Virus
   Disease (EVD) epidemic in the Mano River countries. Four years later,
   while writing my doctoral dissertation on Ebola, the threat of a
   coronavirus outbreak from Wuhan emerged, generating a form of scientific
   uncertainty. This reflexive article first documents how the occurrence
   of the Covid-19 epidemic impacted the progress of a doctoral research
   project on Ebola, both through the abundant bibliographic data and
   through the opportunity of an incorporated epidemic experience that
   invited me to question established analyses and hypotheses while
   modifying my relationship with field data and respondents. In the second
   part, based on an ethnography in a Covid-19 screening center in Abidjan,
   I identify similarities and continuities in the management of these two
   epidemics (MVE and Covid-19) and their popular reception.},

Abstract = {While there is a developing consensus that governments need to address
   systemic racism, public administration scholarship has not played a
   large role in supporting policymakers who want to achieve that end. To
   institutionalize that effort, we analyze the budget process as a setting
   to identify inequities and incorporate social equity given its
   overarching reach across all programs and policies. This article uses
   the tenets of critical race theory to illustrate how to use the budget
   process to incorporate equity. The resulting racial equity budgeting
   (REB) framework has three tenets: acknowledging and correcting historic
   biases, increasing the voice of nondominant groups, and disrupting the
   status quo by ensuring equity in current policies. The REB framework
   suggests how public officials may apply these tenets to the stages of
   public budgeting, including the use of reparation statements, increasing
   the participation of underrepresented minorities, and reviewing the
   disaggregated impact of policies, among others.},

Abstract = {We examine the strategic use of contract and in-house lobbyists by
   interest groups in response to shifting policy agendas. The role that
   lobbyists play in the policy process changes based on the policy agenda.
   Most of the time, subsystems manage small changes to public policy,
   rewarding actors with long-term relationships. Organizations with a deep
   interest in the issue area maintain permanent lobbying presences,
   earning some degree of privilege over policymaking. However, when the
   broader macropolitical agenda lurches toward the issue, new participants
   become involved. New participants often lack the lobbying expertise of
   the in-house lobbyists of established actors. Contract lobbyists play a
   critical role in providing spare capacity on-demand, allowing
   participants not normally involved in subsystems to lobby. They also
   allow the best-resourced actors, who may employ a long-term lobbying
   presence, to further expand it when necessary. We test this theory using
   a new dataset of the lobbying content of 1,370,396 bill mentions in U.S.
   lobbying disclosure reports by 11,842 organizations from 2006 to 2016.
   We compare their policy agenda to that of the U.S. Congress. We find
   strong evidence that organizations hire contract lobbyists to respond to
   brief moments of agenda setting while permanent in-house lobbyists have
   a more stable agenda.},

Abstract = {Contemporary conflict studies often cite actor ``legitimacy{''} as a key
   mechanism linking rebel actors to a variety of outcomes, including
   civilian targeting, recruitment practices, and war termination. This
   article advances a conceptualization of legitimacy as a dynamic process
   of triangulation among rebels, their potential local constituents, and
   the international community. Rebels derive or lose legitimacy from the
   local population, but also from external audiences, which have played a
   central role in supporting peace processes in many conflicts. We explore
   conceptually a myriad of ways that rebels work to create and maintain
   legitimacy in the context of ongoing conflict, identifying the target
   audiences of these tactics. These are illustrated with an in-depth study
   of the Moro rebellion in the Philippines.},

Abstract = {In the literature on the role of agency in the policy process,
   relatively little attention has been devoted to how agents define policy
   problems. This article helps to address this gap by asking when and how
   policy entrepreneurs are successful in defining problems. The article
   rests on a framework that shows how policy entrepreneurs holding
   specific ideas and given a propitious socioeconomic context are able to
   define problems, translate those problems into new frames, and draw on
   those frames, while using their personal skills and political and
   institutional resources, to help build supportive coalitions in favor of
   policy change. Illustrated by a puzzling case in the field of European
   mobility policy, the article offers a new perspective on the role of
   ideas at the problem definition stage of the policy process, while
   providing a richer understanding of the policy entrepreneur as a driver
   of policy change.},

Abstract = {Which factors drive support of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)
   for trade liberalisation? The literature suggests that economic factors,
   ideology, and politicization shape MEP voting behaviour. Drawing on a
   new dataset encompassing all trade-related MEP votes (2009-2019), this
   study offers a quantitative assessment of the determinants of MEP
   support for trade liberalisation. It finds that ideological factors have
   the strongest and most persistent effect on MEP support for trade
   liberalisation. The economic competitiveness of MEPs' home regions, in
   turn, has only a limited effect. Politicization, lastly, has an unclear
   effect on its own and mostly influences MEP voting behaviour through
   interactions with ideological and economic factors. The study offers the
   first comprehensive assessment of the determinants of MEP voting on
   trade liberalisation and contributes to political economy research on
   electoral institutions and trade, the European Parliament's role in
   trade policy and the effects of politicization on policy-making.},

Title = {The determinants of the European Union's selective approach to trade
   sanctions in Southeast Asia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},

Pages = {784-804},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has recently emerged as a promoter of human
   rights in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) through
   social and material trade sanctions. Yet, it used different trade
   measures in reacting to human rights violations, according to a partner.
   This paper investigates the reasons for such a selective approach. It
   finds evidence in support of the thesis that while ideational factors
   seem to have a low predicting potential, trade and security interests
   are strongly correlated with the level of interference adopted by the EU
   on the domestic affairs of the single ASEAN partners. More specifically,
   security alignment seems to supersede any commercial considerations when
   it comes to the adoption of punishing trade measures on ASEAN members.
   The paper leads to the conclusion that ASEAN countries have become
   increasingly relevant catalysts of EU foreign policy interests and that
   security strategies have strongly conditioned the role of the EU as a
   human rights promoter through trade in the region.},

Abstract = {Debates over localisation in transitional justice and peacebuilding have
   been characterised by the assumption that more equitable relationships
   between local and international actors allow for more effective and just
   interventions. Critical scholarship has in turn cautioned over the use
   of reified conceptions of the `local' and `international', emphasising
   each as contested sites. Through a network analysis of transitional
   justice event data in Cambodia, we ask: what are the roles and influence
   of Cambodian actors, and what might their positions tell us about the
   relationships between international and local groups? We find that event
   data shows strong local representation within the transitional justice
   community. However, representation is not synonymous with influence. Our
   data demonstrates an uneven distribution of network positions within
   both local and international groupings. This illustrates the need for
   greater attention to the role of individual biographies that advantage
   certain individuals to shape transitional justice interventions.},

Abstract = {The present article aims to provide an analysis of the introduction of
   digital innovations in local welfare in the aftermath of the COVID-19
   pandemic. In particular the article will try to clarify if a) these
   innovations have responded to long-standing deficits in local welfare
   and which sectors have been prioritised to apply digital innovations, b)
   whether the changes produced in the policy design are simple incremental
   adjustments or represent a paradigm shift. Having defined the structural
   deficits of local social welfare and framed the complex relationship
   between welfare and digital innovation, the article will propose tools
   for analysis and apply them empirically to the Lombardy region case
   study.},

Abstract = {The myriad applications of artificial intelligence (AI) by the private
   and public sectors have exploded in the public consciousness in the
   postpandemic period. However, researchers and businesses have been
   working on AI technology applications for decades, and in many ways,
   governments are rushing to catch up. This article presents an argument
   that the future of AI policy in the United States will be driven in
   large part by current and future state-level policy experiments. This
   argument is presented by drawing on scholarship surrounding federalism,
   regulatory fragmentation, and the effects of fragmentation on business
   and social equity. The article then presents the case of autonomous
   vehicle policy in the states to illustrate the degree of current
   fragmentation and considers the effects of layering new AI policies on
   top of existing rules surrounding privacy, licensing, and more.
   Following this consideration of existing research and its application of
   AI policy, the article presents a research agenda for leveraging state
   differences to study the effects of AI policy and develop a cohesive
   framework for governing AI.},

Title = {Strategic culture as a meaning-making system: towards a social semiotic
   account of multimodal cultural constraints in international relations},

Abstract = {The article reconsiders the notion of strategic culture using
   fundamental categories of general and social semiotics, which make it
   possible to systematise and instrumentalise this concept while
   preserving its broad scope. The proposed framework suggests a
   relationalist reconceptualisation of strategic culture based on Charles
   Peirce's semiotic theory, thereby helping to transcend the existing
   controversy about how culture-as-ideas, culture-as-artefacts, and
   culture-as-behaviour are related to each other in strategic culture. The
   suggested approach helps to clarify the problematic aspects of the
   notion of strategic culture by redefining strategic culture as a
   logonomic system (a system of rules of meaning-making) that constrains
   interactions in strategic affairs. Such reconceptualisation helps to
   study how strategic cultures are reproduced not only through verbal
   discourse but also through other artefacts and actions. Semiotic
   categories also make it possible to account for important distinctions
   between various elements of strategic culture and formulate principles
   that can guide the studies of this phenomenon. The article provides some
   examples from the Russian strategic culture to demonstrate how the
   proposed framework can be applied.},

Abstract = {The literature on planetary and Earth system boundaries calls on humans
   to live within those boundaries. Sharing such limited ecospace raises
   questions of justice. Global environmental assessments and scholarship
   are increasingly paying attention to justice issues, yet inadequately
   define how to share the limited ecospace. Against this background we
   ask: how can global environmental assessments' concerns for justice be
   enhanced through an Earth system justice framework that guides how the
   global community could share limited ecospace? Based on an analysis of
   how justice concerns are addressed in the Assessment of Assessments and
   global environmental change projects, we build an Earth system justice
   framework that discusses how ecospace can be shared fairly through the
   setting of Earth system boundaries and the provision of minimum resource
   needs for all, and how this can be achieved through an equitable
   redistribution of resources, rights, and responsibilities focused on
   addressing inequality, overconsumption, and harmful accumulation.},

Abstract = {In an unprecedented global crisis, like the COVID-19 pandemic, when
   vertical global governance plays a relatively minor role, government
   leaders must obtain policy information cues from other governments'
   behaviors horizontally. This study builds on the policy diffusion
   literature to examine the distinct role of geographic, cultural, and
   institutional peers in influencing a country's policy adoptions
   throughout a diffusion episode. We theorize that in the case of
   COVID-19, policy-culture fit enhances policy learning, leading cultural
   cues to exert a more pronounced diffusion influence than geographic and
   institutional cues over time. Our empirical analysis leverages worldwide
   data tracking the daily adoption of nine universal COVID-19
   non-pharmaceutical policies from January 1, 2020 to June 1, 2021 in
   nearly 100 countries. We show that geographic and institutional
   proximity are initial sources of policy cues affecting adoption. But
   their effects fade over time while that of cultural cues grows in the
   later stage of a diffusion episode, illustrating the role of policy
   learning fueled by cultural fit. This research deepens our understanding
   of policy diffusion dynamics, shedding light on the role of national
   culture in policymaking and design in comparative policy studies.},

Abstract = {PurposeWorkplace bullying has appalling fallouts for organizations and
   employees. While the association between bullying and employees' exit
   intentions has been sufficiently established in research, the underlying
   conditions remain overlooked. Using the affective events and
   conservation of resources theories as the theoretical lens, the purpose
   of this study is to probe work alienation and emotional exhaustion as
   sequential mediators in the association between bullying and employees'
   exit intentions. Design/methodology/approachA sequential mediation model
   was examined using three-wave longitudinal data gathered from 406
   employees working with hotels situated in tourist destinations of India.
   FindingsWork alienation serves as a significant mediator between
   bullying and emotional exhaustion. More importantly, work alienation and
   emotional exhaustion emerged as sequential mediators in the association
   between bullying and exit intentions. Originality/valueResearch on
   workplace bullying is often cross-sectional, and researchers have called
   for time-lagged and/or longitudinal examination. While responding to the
   frequent calls made by researchers to examine underlying conditions,
   this three-wave longitudinal study advocates for holistic cognizance,
   i.e., how workplace bullying results in employees' exit.},

   of civic ecosystems in action to highlight their main characteristics
   and to provide insights and lessons for applying ecosystem approaches to
   social innovation in practice. The discussion of civic ecosystems is
   placed in the broader context of the rise of ecosystem thinking among

Abstract = {Does police militarization influence government use of repression? While
   comparative work examines police militarization, violence, human rights
   abuses, and torture, it does not integrate militarized police within
   existing theories of repression. Connecting police militarization and
   repression, this article argues that police militarization increases the
   police's perception of threat as well as their coercive capacity,
   thereby increasing their willingness to repress. As such, we hypothesize
   police militarization increases repression. To evaluate the theory, we
   conduct an international analysis using existing datasets covering 102
   countries from 1994 to 2010. Employing several statistical models, the
   data supports the conclusion that police militarization increases the
   likelihood of government repression, specifically through extrajudicial
   killing and torture. Aside from highlighting a consequence of police
   militarization policy, the findings point to police militarization as an
   important omitted variable in cross-national models of repression and
   human rights.},

Abstract = {Despite decades of military gender integration and women's increasing
   presence in military ranks globally, military uniforms and equipment are
   still designed after the measurements of a `standard male body' in many
   countries. Servicewomen are therefore - on a group level - less likely
   to be provided with fitting, functional, and safe military gear. So why
   is it taking so long to provide servicewomen with adequate uniforms and
   equipment? US right-wing TV host Tucker Carlson may inadvertently have
   provided one answer to such a question.},

Title = {The two-state impasse in Israel/Palestine-The EU caught between
   egalitarian norms and expansionist realpolitik},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUN 26},
Abstract = {In recent years, many academics as well as local actors have started to
   question the feasibility of a two-state solution for Israel and
   Palestine. Increased Israeli unilateralism, expansionism as well as weak
   Palestinian institutions have instead pointed toward a
   ``one-state-reality{''} where Israel is in de facto control over all
   lands. This in turn reveals a paradox, where international policymakers,
   most prominently in the EU and the US, and international organizations
   like the UN, seem determined to insist on a two-state solution, even
   though all facts on the ground indicate a move away from such a vision
   where the egalitarian principles inherent in the two-state solution
   exists in constant tension with expansionist attempts to establish
   Israeli sovereignty also on Palestinian land. This article unpacks
   various visions for the future in Israel-Palestine, based on egalitarian
   principles on the one hand and expansionist ones on the other and
   display how they current co-exist in a very uneasy relationship. The
   over-arching aim of the article is to understand how the EU relates to
   this paradox. We do this in three steps; first we conduct a mapping of
   visions for solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict according to either
   egalitarian or expansionist principles, where we find one- as well as
   two-state solutions; second, we conduct a historical analysis on EU
   positions with regards to the abovementioned principles for solving the
   conflict, related to other powerful international actors' visions;
   lastly, we move to an investigation of current developments captured
   through recent speeches, documents and semi-structured interviews with
   centrally placed EU staff. Our main conclusion is that even though the
   EU is determined to hold on to the two state-solution, it however lacks
   willingness and/or power-resources to push Israel in that direction. Our
   interviewees seem painfully aware of the lack of viability of the
   two-state-solution and hence welcome criticism which could push for more
   egalitarian tendencies in Israel by appealing to its
   democratic-self-image. Here the current spread of the apartheid
   narrative among international organizations and an increased
   international human rights rhetoric emphasizing equal rights for two
   peoples seem to have left the EU balancing on a tight-rope where they
   have to choose between standing by status quo, risking supporting
   ultra-nationalist Israeli sovereignty-aspirations, or criticizing those,
   instead exposing itself to accusations of antisemitism.},

Abstract = {The sovereignist vision of European integration is becoming increasingly
   present in the debate on the EU, although it is difficult to build a
   compelling narrative on European integration accommodating radical
   sovereignist claims. We look at the role religion plays in the
   construction of sovereignist narratives, taking Polish right-wing
   populist parties as our case study. In the findings we highlight the
   identitarian role of religion and the mechanisms of othering built on
   religiously referred antagonising tropes. We also show how religion
   helps to symbolically ``thicken{''} the sovereignist narrative. Finally,
   we demonstrate the intrinsic tensions in this discursive construction,
   leading to inconsistency in sovereignist claims.},

Abstract = {A critical element in civil wars is military fragmentation. Yet, we have
   a limited understanding of why military elites fight in civil wars and
   on what side. In this article I develop a theory of the economic and
   professional motivations of military elites. I test this theory using
   the case of West Point graduates in the American Civil War. I argue that
   in addition to home state, economic and professional interests were a
   major influence on West Pointers. Graduates with connections to Southern
   cash crops were less likely to fight for the Union and more likely to
   fight for the Confederacy. Higher ranking graduates were more likely to
   fight for both sides, as they were better positioned to compete for
   promotion. I test this argument using a new dataset of more than 1000
   West Point graduates' wartime allegiances and antebellum careers and
   find strong evidence in support of my expectations.},

Title = {Patterns of change in the justifiability of euthanasia across OECD
   countries},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {IntroductionThe public's justifiability of euthanasia has increased as
   more countries have adopted laws permitting a range of end-of-life
   practices. Despite this trend, there is a dearth of longitudinal and
   comparative studies investigating attitudes toward euthanasia.
   Consequently, it remains unclear whether this rise in justifiability is
   a period-specific trend or generational change. MethodsWe analyzed data
   from the European and World Values Survey from 1981 to 2021 to examine
   period variations, between-cohort differences, and within-cohort changes
   across 35 affluent countries. This analysis was conducted using dynamic
   comparative multilevel regression and a comparative version of the
   cross-classified random effects regressions. ResultsOur descriptive
   results supported our hypotheses, indicating an increase in euthanasia's
   justifiability in virtually all surveyed countries, with both overall
   and within-cohort changes gravitating toward higher degrees of
   justifiability. Furthermore, newer periods and younger cohorts were
   found to be more permissive than their older counterparts. These
   consistent increases in the justifiability of euthanasia were verified
   by the multilevel models. DiscussionOur results were in line with
   modernization theory, observing a gradual change in attitudes between
   cohorts due to generational replacement. However, we also identified
   intra-cohort changes related to the processes of human development
   across various countries. Some robustness checks produced ambiguous
   results in distinguishing period and cohort effects, yet the combination
   of these components aligns with substantive theory. ConclusionOur
   findings indicate a more complex pattern of change than predicted by the
   impressionable years model, a leading approach in political
   socialization research. This study contributes significantly to our
   understanding of evolving attitudes toward euthanasia, bridging the gap
   in longitudinal and comparative studies on the subject.},

Title = {International Norms as Emergent Properties of Complex Adaptive Systems},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {This theory note argues that international norms, as currently
   understood by scholars of international relations, can be seen as
   emergent properties of a complex adaptive system (the international
   political system). Arising from the microlevel interactions of agents
   within and across various levels of analysis, they have the potential to
   become system properties that (a) influence the constitution,
   relationships, and behavior of agents within that system and (b) are not
   analytically reducible to the sum of the interactions between those
   agents. They also exhibit evolutionary dynamics common to complex,
   rather than merely complicated, systems. Thinking of norms in this
   manner helps point norms scholars toward particular spaces and
   methodologies of research. After a brief resume of complexity theory in
   IR, the note proceeds with an introduction to complex systems theory. It
   then explores the conceptual nexus between norms theory and complexity.
   It finishes by suggesting the ways in which understanding norms as
   complex emergent phenomena might influence norms research more broadly.},

Abstract = {The Organization of the Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC) used oil as
   a weapon against Western countries supporting Israel in the 1973 Yom
   Kippur War. From 2021, Russia used a similar strategy of restricting gas
   flows to Europe, while Europe later reduced Russia's market access. In
   these cases, there was economic and political damage. These examples
   show that energy is a weapon used to pressure sovereign states. Energy
   is a multidimensional resource that reflects broader ties within the
   political-economic system of international relations. This comparative
   study identifies four components that enable energy as a weapon:
   interdependence, energy security, neoliberal economics and sovereignty.
   Four key policy lessons emerge to improve energy security: (1) determine
   the acceptable limits of energy dependence, (2) acknowledge institutions
   and markets cannot deliver energy security outside their design
   parameters, (3) energy security requires addressing the entire value
   chain, and (4) energy is a weapon that threatens state sovereignty. The
   collapse of the gas trade between Russia and the EU creates instability
   and removes the pillar of interdependency; this now ushers in a new era.},

Abstract = {This study examines the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
   Development (OECD) and the World Bank, the two largest global actors in
   the education sector, in their capacity as knowledge brokers. For these
   actors, positioning themselves between research and policy and
   circulating their versions of evidence has become a popular governance
   instrument to amplify their impact at the national level. To compare the
   strategies and targets of the OECD and the World Bank, we analyze three
   publication series: the OECD's Education Policy Outlook and Reviews of
   National Policies for Education and the World Bank's Systems Approach
   for Better Education reports. The results reveal significant differences
   between the OECD's and the World Bank's approaches to producing evidence
   and brokering knowledge. We interpret the differences against the
   backdrop of the idiosyncrasies of the two organizations: The World Bank
   sees itself as a transnational actor, and its knowledge production and
   brokerage are highly decontextualized transcending national experiences.
   By contrast, the OECD is an intergovernmental organization that views
   itself as a facilitator of cross-national peer exchange. Situating the
   findings within the broader framework of the global-national nexus, we
   argue that the World Bank's approach promotes vertical policy learning,
   while the OECD's approach pursues horizontal policy learning.},

Abstract = {Violently contested cities are at the heart of ethnonational conflicts,
   and their final status is often a central issue for peace negotiations.
   These negotiations, typically led by national politicians and diplomats,
   include little, if any, representation of local voices, which are often
   fundamentally different from those of state-centric actors. This article
   integrates the seeing like a city theoretical approach with the
   literature on urban peacebuilding and asks: How is seeing peace like a
   city different from seeing peace like a state? and whether the visions
   of local grassroots leaders are complementary or contradictory to the
   models that national decision-makers propose for cities. We analyse the
   case study of Jerusalem using historical analysis, public opinion
   surveys, and in-depth interviews. Our findings show the distinction
   between the focus of state-centric processes on `rigid' issues (e.g.,
   security and sovereignty) and the focus of city-centric processes on
   `soft' issues (e.g., tolerance and daily life).},

Abstract = {While much is known about factors associated with deradicalisation and
   disengagement from violent extremism and terrorism, the underlying
   mechanisms at play have been under theorised. Literature on criminal
   desistance has a lot to offer in understanding the process of exiting
   from extremism, particularly in how it proceeds, the mechanisms at play
   and why it may or may not be sustained-what we term as the
   sustainability problem. We draw on criminal desistance scholarship to
   theoretically unpack the change processes underpinning desistance from
   extremism and why it is a challenging process for individuals. We
   propose a theory of cognitive transformation and explore the role of
   agentic change and external influences on the sustainability of
   desistance. We link our proposed theory of change to practical
   implications relating to the role of formal agents and how desistance
   from extremism can be supported, undermined, and assessed as authentic.
   Limitations with the theory of change are considered, as well directions
   for future research.},

Abstract = {At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many leaders claimed that
   their public health policy decisions were `following the science';
   however, the literature on evidence-based policy problematises the idea
   that this is a realistic or desirable form of governance. This article
   examines why leaders make such claims using Christopher Hood's (2011)
   blame avoidance theory. Based on a qualitative content analysis of two
   national newspapers in each of Australia, Canada and the UK, we gathered
   and focused on unique moments when leaders claimed to `follow the
   science' in the first six months of the pandemic. We applied Hood's
   theory to identify the types of blame avoidance strategies used for
   issues such as mass event cancellation, border closures, face masks, and
   in-person learning. Politicians most commonly used `follow the science'
   to deflect blame onto processes and people. When leaders' claims to
   `follow the science' confuse the public as to who chooses and who should
   be held accountable for those decisions, this slogan risks undermining
   trust in science, scientific advisors, and, at its most extreme,
   representative government. This article addresses a gap in the
   literature on blame avoidance and the relationship between scientific
   evidence and public policy by demonstrating how governments' claims to
   `follow the science' mitigated blame by abdicating responsibility, thus
   risking undermining the use of scientific advice in policymaking.},

Abstract = {When can crises overcome the fragmentation of a core executive and
   facilitate a centralised management response? Here, we identify the
   latter by reference to the concept of a `crisis response network' (CRN).
   We draw on several literatures that refer to crisis centralisation and
   develop hypotheses that comprise likely contributing factors. We explore
   these hypotheses in the setting of a core executive normally identified
   as being `segmentary', but which has exhibited centralised management of
   past crises, and in the context of an acute economic crisis: that is,
   Greece in its debt crisis in two seminal periods. Based on extensive
   interviews with all the senior personnel involved, including both Prime
   Ministers, as well as documentary evidence, we find that the strength of
   the CRN in leading the crisis response varied and that this was
   consistent with our hypotheses. We consider the conceptual and empirical
   implications of our findings.},

Title = {Immobility beyond borders: Differential inclusion and the impact of the
   COVID-19 border closures},
Journal = {POLITICS},

Volume = {44},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {302-316},

Abstract = {This article discusses differential inclusion as it relates to mobility
   in Europe through migrants' experiences of the closure of the European
   Union (EU) Schengen borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on 36
   comparative online interviews with three groups of migrants - Erasmus
   students, asylum seekers and seasonal workers - the article empirically
   investigates how differential inclusion is reflected in migrants'
   perceptions of border closures and the impact of border closures on
   international mobility. Drawing on the concept of differential
   inclusion, I examine the divergent border mobilities in a moment of
   crisis. In the interviews, migrants' reflections on borders are informed
   either by their own perception of borders, their surprise at the lack of
   awareness of borders for other migrants, or the realisation that closed
   borders are crossed for capitalist economic demands under high health
   risks. Taking this as its basis, the article makes two arguments. First,
   that preexisting differential inclusion exacerbated during border
   closures in a global health emergency. Second, that borders are not
   concrete but flexible in (im)mobilising people according to capitalist
   economic demands. In this way, the article contributes to an
   understanding of the process of rebordering that took place during
   COVID-19 and in which borders remained spaces of differentiation.},

Abstract = {The IT Army of Ukraine is unlike any other cyber-threat actor. Created
   by the Ukraine Ministry of Digital Transformation two days after the
   Russian invasion, it has gathered, trained and directed thousands of
   people from inside and outside Ukraine to participate in persistent DDoS
   campaigns against Russian civilian infrastructure. In its current form,
   the IT Army is neither civilian nor military, neither public nor
   private, neither local nor international. Notably, whether it is lawful
   or unlawful remains unclear. Given its apparent adaptability and its
   continuing ability to recruit participants and mount cyber campaigns, it
   is positioned to become an advanced persistent threat.},

Title = {How Selected Pro-Duterte Facebook Pages Framed the AsS-CsN Shutdown
   Issue: A Discussion on Epistemic Discrediting in Echo Chambers},
Journal = {PHILIPPINE POLITICAL SCIENCE JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-84},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article looks into the discursive frames employed by selected
   pro-Duterte pages on Facebook that tackled the ABS-CBN shutdown and
   franchise denial issues in 2020. The legal frames were mostly derived
   from the findings of the lawmakers' technical working group (TwG). The
   political frames, meanwhile, include ABS-CBN's alleged biased reporting,
   the victory-over-oligarchs narrative pushed by the Duterte
   administration and other related pronouncements. The article identifies
   these frames as reinforcing layers to fortify the echo chamber behavior
   of pro-Duterte pages through an attack-amplify-attract stratagem. C. Thi
   Nguyen's study resembling echo chambers anchored on ``epistemic
   discrediting{''} was operationalized for this purpose. Data from the
   selected pro-Duterte pages were mined using the timeline feature of
   Crowd Tangle as the official social listening tool of Facebook. The
   article also explored the impact of pro-Duterte pages on ABS-CBN's
   stature as a legacy media giant and on the Duterte presidency as a
   social media-driven administration.},

Abstract = {This article tries to explain an apparent paradox in the Common European
   Asylum System (CEAS): despite political stalemate over CEAS legislative
   reform and lack of trust amongst MSs, administrative cooperation shows
   operational continuity. Drawing on the `Infrastructural Europeanism'
   approach, we argue that a sociotechnical perspective allows detecting
   the material means that operationally provide continuity to
   administrative action, despite policy gaps. It reveals mediating agency
   exerted by less visible actors who are nevertheless crucial to the
   integration process. Through a sociotechnical lens, alleged integration
   failures - like in the post-2015 asylum crisis - can reveal operational
   cooperation not visible if only legislative outcomes are taken into
   account. Empirically, the article shows how the International
   Organization for Migration assumed a role in mediating relocations
   between MSs, overcoming an implementation gap in health data
   circulation, thanks to its data infrastructure able to prompt data
   production, harmonise administrative standardisation and build
   continuity in time.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},

Pages = {497-526},
Abstract = {In this article I explain a nexus between slavery and state formation in
   Africa, proceeding from initial demographic and institutional conditions
   to an external demand shift, individual state responses, and their
   collective systemic consequences. Historically, African rulers faced
   distinctive challenges: low population density prioritized control of
   people more than territory, and internal disintegration was often a
   greater threat than external conquest. A massive expansion in the demand
   for slaves offered African rulers increased opportunities to use
   external resources for ``outside-in{''} state building. Many did so by
   creating highly militarized predatory slaving states. The collective
   consequence was heightened systemic insecurity. Variation in the timing
   of these developments reflected regional and historical variation in the
   expansion of the demand for slaves. Slaving states appeared first in
   West Africa, reflecting the late-seventeenth-century expansion of the
   trans-Atlantic slave trade, before spreading to East Africa a century
   later, following the parallel later increase in the Indian Ocean slave
   trade. This ``outside-in{''} path to state formation both parallels and
   contrasts with contemporary postcolonial state formation.},

Title = {Terrible security problem: an aesthetics approach and study of the
   Korean Nuclear Crisis},
Journal = {CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 13},
Abstract = {This article develops aesthetics as a method in the study of
   international politics from and for the `love children' in the colonial
   house of IR. I argue that the terrible as an aesthetic category captures
   the problem of violence and distortion in international politics
   particularly along imperial/anti-imperial, colonising/colonised lines of
   division. Denoting an extreme, the terrible captures how some political
   positions, actions, subjectivities and performances assault human sense
   and sensibilities that simultaneously construct boundaries. This
   affective form of violence requires conceptual-creative reckoning. The
   first section develops aesthetics as a method with a focus on the
   concept of caricatures to show how they are boundary events that create
   newness through distortion and exaggeration significant in moving beyond
   the entrapments of coloniality and imperial arrangements. The next two
   sections illustrate and extend this point through Korea as a place where
   Great Power politics play out. I first examine the prevailing
   caricatures of the Korean Nuclear Crisis and then empty out the state as
   a subject position in approaches to studying international politics.
   Together I show what is involved in moving beyond the violence matrix of
   international politics: everyday-level creative, reflexive strategies
   that more intimately face up to the political violence on auto-repeat.},

Abstract = {Perceptions of an East-West divide in the European Union (EU) with
   regard to democracy have led to re-evaluations of EU eastern enlargement
   as a policy failure and militate against further enlargement. This
   article examines the accuracy of narratives of an intra-EU East-West
   divide on democracy, in which the western member states outperform the
   eastern members, and in which the former support, and the latter oppose,
   rule of law (RoL) interventions by the EU in member states engaged in
   democratic backsliding. The article considers two aspects of a potential
   democracy divide: the quality of democracy and attitudes towards RoL
   interventions. It draws on several quantitative indicators for a more
   comprehensive assessment of intra-EU democracy divides and uses
   set-theory to identify different in- and out-groups that demarcate such
   intra-EU divides. Although different indicators and different
   conceptions of set-membership reveal to varying extents East-West
   patterns, none fit with a clear regional divide. It is more fruitful to
   conceive of these differences as a continuum, with (currently) a small
   group of (western) member states at one end and a small group of
   (eastern) members at the other, and most member states in distinctive
   sub-groups in-between.},

Abstract = {PurposeUsing the broaden-and-build theory, this study aims to examine
   whether (1) employees have hateful emotional responses and think the
   overall performance review is fair at different levels of managers'
   emotional flexibility; and (2) the difference in employees' hateful
   emotional responses mediates the relationship between managers'
   emotional flexibility and employees' perceptions of performance review
   fairness across flexibility conditions. Design/methodology/approachA
   sample of 110 Pakistani undergraduates participated in the seven waves
   of online scenario-based experimental research. For a one-way
   repeated-measures analysis, the general linear model was used, and for a
   two-condition within-subject mediational path analysis, the mediation
   and moderation analysis for repeated measures (MEMORE) was used.
   FindingsEmployees experience a high level of performance review justice
   and a low level of hateful emotional responses when managers are more
   emotionally flexible during the meeting, and vice versa. A manager's
   emotional flexibility may also prevent employees from responding
   hatefully during performance reviews, which in turn makes them perceive
   the overall performance review as just. Originality/valueThe study
   expands on the thought-action repertoire and personal resources,
   supporting the broaden-and-build theory. The research applies this
   notion to performance reviews, which are an emotional experience for
   managers and employees. The study timely addresses organizations' need
   for performance management system overhauls by suggesting managers to
   use emotional flexibility until an alternate performance review system
   is available.},

Title = {Knowledge Production beyond West-Centrism in IR: Toward Global IR 2.0},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {The primary purpose of this article is to advance the ongoing global
   international relations (Global IR) debate and to offer some possible
   paths toward Global IR 2.0. To this end, this article first analyzes how
   Global IR has emerged, what contributions it makes to giving new impetus
   to IR knowledge (production), and, more importantly, what charges are
   leveled against Global IR. Although Global IR has produced an important
   body of scholarship, contributing substantially to identifying
   West-centrism as a key point of contention in IR and nudging the
   discipline toward theoretical pluralism, Global IR in its current form
   still carries the risk of reinforcing the old hierarchical and
   essentialized structure of knowledge production in ways that are
   analytic, epistemological, and ontological. Following this critical
   mapping exercise, I argue that while Global IR can serve as a key
   signifier of challenge to West-centrism, this important signifier needs
   to be redefined in terms of what it indicates and means-thereby becoming
   Global IR 2.0. In onto-epistemological terms, Global IR 2.0 relates more
   directly to questioning and dissolving essentialized ways of knowing in
   the discipline. In the final section of this article, I elaborate on how
   to realize this idea and harness it in practice.},

Abstract = {Do intense religious experiences increase or decrease terrorism? We
   argue that fasting during the month of Ramadan offers an ideal setting
   for studying this question empirically. Reasons are twofold: first,
   daily fasting from dawn to sunset during Ramadan is considered mandatory
   for most Muslims. Second, the Islamic Hijri calendar is not synchronized
   with the solar cycle. Therefore, the daily fasting duration during
   Ramadan is exogenous once we control for latitude and the seasonality of
   Ramadan, which we can do by using district and country-year fixed
   effects. Focusing on predominantly Muslim countries, we document three
   main findings: first, longer and more intense Ramadan fasting has a
   robust negative effect on the likelihood of local terrorist events and
   terror deaths over the next year. Second, this negative effect is
   particularly pronounced for operationally more difficult attack types,
   which are more dependent on public support for terrorism. Third, using
   survey data, we show that longer and more intense Ramadan fasting lowers
   the share of respondents who consider religiously motivated violence to
   be justified. These findings imply that intense religious experiences
   may not be a breeding ground for terrorism. Quite the opposite, they can
   decrease public support for terrorism and, consequently, terrorist
   attacks.},

Abstract = {``Climate intermediaries{''} are ``go-betweens{''}, operating between
   levels of governance and/or between different types of actors.
   Faith-based actors (FBAs) are one populous yet neglected type of
   potential climate intermediary. In the UK, Muslims are the second
   largest group of religious adherents, yet are ``othered{''}, and face
   widespread Islamophobia, alongside multiple other intersecting
   inequalities. Drawing from 21 interviews, we analyse data from
   individuals self-identifying as Muslim and their experiences of
   intermediation with state and non-state actors, to understand how such
   roles manifest. We find that Muslim FBAs are invisibilized and/or
   instrumentalized as climate intermediaries when engaging with state
   actors and ``mainstream{''} ENGOs, but can assume such roles effectively
   when liaising with others from the shared faith or acting in interfaith
   contexts. The outcome of this obstructed action is a lack of
   representative or transformative strategies for climate action within
   ``mainstream{''} fora, leading to subjective fatigue, poor policy
   design, and Muslim communities instead electing to intermediate through
   interfaith channels and between other Muslims. Through this article, we
   seek to redress the invisibilization of Muslim climate intermediaries,
   and raise critical questions about how climate intermediaries are
   understood, both within the policy literature, and in policy-making
   circles.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to investigate how and when different dimensions
   of trust and contracts interact to influence the development to
   negotiation strategies. Specifically, it explores how different
   dimensions of trust and contracts are combined to influence dispute
   negotiation strategies when cooperation parties have or do not have
   expectations of continuity. Design/methodology/approachThis paper
   theoretically identified and empirically examined the interaction effect
   of trust and contract on dispute negotiation strategies in
   contractor-subcontractor relationships, by developing a conceptual
   framework and conducting a questionnaire survey comprising more than 300
   disputes in the Chinese construction industry. Hierarchical regression
   analysis was mainly used to test the hypotheses. FindingsThis paper
   finds that contractual control may weaken the effect of goodwill trust
   in fostering interest-based strategies in the presence of expectations
   of continuity, while it may strengthen the effect in the absence of
   expectations of continuity. Contractual coordination negatively
   moderates the relationship between goodwill trust and interest-based
   strategies only when parties have little expectations of continuity.
   Moreover, contractual control enhances the effectiveness of competence
   trust on fostering interest-based strategies. Practical implicationsThis
   paper provides insights for practitioners to wisely use different
   governance mechanisms to manage negotiation strategies and generate
   desired outcomes of dispute resolution. Originality/valueThis paper
   provides a nuanced understanding of how the two types of governance
   mechanisms interact, by considering trust and contract as
   multi-dimensional constructs. It explicit the boundary conditions of
   both the substitute and complementary relationship between them.},

Title = {Politics and fantasy in UK alcohol policy: a critical logics approach},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {The Scottish Government's policy of minimum unit price (MUP) for alcohol
   has received significant scholarly attention. Much of the focus of this
   literature has been on the efforts by sections of the alcohol industry
   to oppose the policy, including attempts to `frame' key terms of the
   debate and an understanding of its legitimacy and effects within the
   wider field of interpretative policy analysis. The present article
   builds on these studies by re-conceptualizing the MUP debate through the
   lens of post-structuralist discourse theory and the logics of critical
   explanation that emerge from this. It argues that the success and
   failure of MUP (as a projected social logic) can be understood through
   the shifting coalitions of actors that emerged (political logics) and
   the affective hold that industry narratives were able to exert
   (fantasmatic logics) in this context. While focused on UK alcohol
   policy, the article speaks to a wider research agenda on the `commercial
   determinants of health' and, through the application of the critical
   logics approach, offers new analytical insights beyond those provided by
   existing models of industry influence. Similarly, it contributes to the
   field of post-structural policy analysis through its novel focus on the
   role of commercial entities as health policy actors.},

Abstract = {This article examines the development of judicialization literature in
   the EU arguing that - in spite of the obvious advantages of
   inter-disciplinary collaboration - scholarship on judicialization in law
   and political science is drafting apart in the 21(st) Century. While
   early political science research on the European Courts found
   theoretical inspiration in legal research, law and political science
   have increasingly diverging epistemological and methodological starting
   points. As the article argues, using prominent papers, this results in
   both disciplines producing partial accounts of judicial change with
   limited external validity. The article concludes by offering routes to
   improving the inter-disciplinary foundations of judicialization
   research.},

Title = {Do Different Coercive Strategies Help or Hurt Deterrence?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Powerful states build different coercive tools to manage their broad
   foreign policy agenda. Do different coercive strategies help or hurt
   deterrence success? I analyze a simple crisis model where the Defender
   seeks to deter a Challenger from investing in a novel coercive
   technology through hassling and preventive threats. Subtle differences
   between my model and those of Schram, Bas and Coe, and others generate
   different logics that clarify the Defender's costs and benefits for
   building diverse coercive tools. Unlike others, I show that hassling can
   complement and undercut the threat of war in a one-shot, complete
   information crisis. I show that adverse effects arise when we want
   deterrence to hold the most: against technologically sophisticated
   rivals with moderately to severely opposed preferences. After I detail
   my model, I connect different core specifications to different empirical
   domains. This exercise helps connect formal theory to empirical
   research. I argue that my model best fits Defenders who want to deter
   Challengers from building novel coercive technologies in the modern era.
   I propose a novel approach for modeling policy implications.},

Abstract = {Luke Cooper's Authoritarian Contagion draws attention to the politics of
   protection proffered by contemporary ethno-nationalist authoritarian

   politics lies in neoliberal projects, which promoted conservative social
   hierarchies, such as those associated with gender, race and class, to
   further capital accumulation. These neoliberal projects led to
   anti-democratic governance and the concentration of wealth and power,
   trends that contemporary authoritarian leaders claim to challenge but,
   in fact, consolidate and intensify in the name of protecting an

Abstract = {Terrorist organizations are presumed to specialize in the planning and
   execution of acts of terrorism, but to what extent do these groups
   actually employ terrorism? The answer can help inform the debate over
   whether such groups should be labeled terrorist organizations at all. We
   explore these questions by examining the relative use of terrorism
   vis-a-vis guerrilla tactics among 1,013 groups listed in the Global
   Terrorism Database from 1970 to 2019. We find, first, that ``terrorist
   groups `` have historically relied on a combination of terrorist and
   guerrilla tactics. Second, while terrorism has been the preferred mode
   of warfare in the first four decades examined, guerrilla tactics have
   predominated in the 2010s. Our findings imply that the use of the
   ``terrorist group `` label had empirical justifications in the first
   four, although not the most recent decade under review. The data support
   calls for the adoption of value-neutral labels for contemporary militant
   groups.},

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organisation (WHO) was
   politicised in the United States (US) by Donald Trump in an effort to
   deflect blame as the virus spread. In this paper, we empirically
   investigate media coverage of the WHO in the US to better understand how
   negative evaluations of international organisations (IOs) spread. To do
   so, we perform quantitative text analysis on an original corpus of over
   11,000 news articles on the WHO from the New York Times and the
   Washington Post between 1980 and 2020. Our text-as-data analyses yield
   several noteworthy findings. First, we show that media coverage of the
   WHO in the US has become more negative over time. Second, we show that
   negativity increases during global health crises. Third, we provide
   evidence that explicit criticisms also increase during crises. Fourth,
   we show that ``blame-shifting `` by Trump and allies was clearly
   observable in the US news media. Finally, we show that negative stories
   about the WHO are shared more than positive ones on social media. Our
   results provide unique evidence, suggesting that the WHO has become more
   politicised in the US, which we argue creates opportunities for
   politicians seeking to blame IOs during crises.},

Abstract = {In the Fordist era, trade unions promoted welfare state expansion and
   coverage against risks for the broader workforce. With the shift to the
   post-industrial economy, however, new economic groups have been left
   without representation. This is particularly evident for women: despite
   a rapid increase in female employment since the 1980s, unions'
   membership base remains anchored in the male, old and industrial working
   class. Without the crucial pressure of labour, welfare systems have
   failed to enhance the reconciliation of work and family life. Under
   which conditions do unions support the expansion of work-family
   policies? Marshalling evidence from 20 OECD countries in the 1980-2010
   period, this paper investigates the role of political actors in family
   policy reform. Findings suggest that unions promote the expansion of
   work-family packages when they are gender-inclusive and have
   institutional access to policy-making.},

Abstract = {In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, German
   Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a Zeitenwende, or historical turning
   point, for German foreign and defence policy. Expectations of profound
   German geopolitical, geostrategic and geo-economic transformation were
   raised both in Germany and among Berlin's allies. One year later,
   Germany's greatest success has come in the geo-economic arena, where
   progress has been made to reduce Germany's energy imports from Russia.
   Geopolitically, the picture is less convincing. While Scholz has
   committed to the defence of NATO territory against potential Russian
   aggression, it is not obvious whether the German government really
   perceives Russia as a direct threat to the country. Berlin has yet to
   formulate a convincing geopolitical leadership role in Europe, and it
   remains to be seen if the new defence minister, Boris Pistorius, will

Abstract = {This article shows how Forum Against Depression,( 1 ) an online platform
   devoted to depression, creates awareness on depression in Poland. This
   qualitative study uses critical discourse analysis to interpret texts
   published by the Forum and a short film, Disappearing Children, devoted
   to ``teenage depression. `` In this discourse, depression is presented
   as an object, the meaning of which is stable and dispersed. The article
   shows how the creation of this double semiosis of depression provides an
   invitation for auto-diagnosis and blurs the identity of the sender: the
   pharmaceutical company running the campaign, which is the subject of
   this article. Neuro-tivization of depression conceals the social context
   of distress and helps maximize drug sales. Ultimately, this article
   tracks the merging of complex psychiatrization and depsychiatrization
   processes. The article enhances discussion about issues related to
   biomedical framings of mental health, diagnostic reification of mental
   health diagnoses, and debate about conditions in which mental health
   knowledge is produced in Poland and globally.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the discourses and practices of securitization
   toward internally displaced persons (IDPs) after the Russian military
   intervention in the eastern part of Ukraine in 2014. It investigates in
   what ways the IDPs' rights to vote in the local, parliamentary, and
   presidential elections in 2015-20 were presented as a security issue.
   The article discusses this unique case of securitization in the shadow
   of an armed conflict and the role of othering practices. The data were
   collected using 15 semi -structured in-depth interviews with IDP
   activists and experts, selected media, and legal documents. The analysis
   was conducted by applying a Foucauldian type of discourse analysis. It
   identified four types of othering practices: ``suspicious{''} citizens
   and the governmentality of ``unease,{''} routine security practices, the
   distinctiveness of the Donbas region within Ukraine, and ``pragmatic{''}
   othering. These four types of othering practices resulted in the
   institutionalization of the securitization of IDPs and its tacit
   acceptance by the Ukrainian general public. Nevertheless, it also
   paradoxically paved the way for the desecuritization of IDPs' rights,
   which happened with adoption of a new election code in 2020.},

Title = {Limits of Evaluation in the Quality Assurance System of Chilean
   Education: a Case Study},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2023},
Number = {85},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Education Quality Assurance Systems (in Spanish, SAC) are institutional
   architectures with which some educational systems seek to enhance the
   achievement of results by actors and institutions. Evaluation has a
   central place within the set of components that SAC have, since it is
   necessary to judge performance in order to determine to what extent the
   expected results are being achieved. The result of such evaluation is
   subject to accountability, which positive or negative consequences.
   Given its relevance, the SAC evaluation must be sufficiently valid to
   capture the achievements and weaknesses of the institutions and actors,
   as well as to be credible within the system. In addition, the different
   evaluation devices need to be articulated and mutually reinforcing, to
   account for the systemic logic of this strategy. A case study was
   carried out to analyze the capacities and limits of the SAC evaluation,
   seeking to compare the results of the evaluation of an educational
   institution categorized as ``insufficient{''} for its performance in
   learning achievements, with the analysis and data considered within its
   educational community. The results revealed important gaps between both
   perspectives and weaknesses in the functioning of the SAC evaluation
   mechanism, such as: the updating of information to categorize the
   institution, the identification of relevant results that account for its
   performance, or the use of information produced by the assurance system
   itself. These difficulties are relevant because of the effects they
   produce on the evaluated institutions and open the discussion about the
   evaluation process itself, but also regarding the accountability
   mechanisms used on the basis on the results of these evaluations.},

Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2023},
Number = {85},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {As a result of a series of modernization processes, the Chilean State
   has implemented a group of management and governance mechanisms, among
   which public-private partnerships or alliances stand out. Inspired by
   efficiency-oriented approaches from New Public Management and democratic
   principles of New Governance, neither their socio-technical
   configuration nor their effects on the transformation of the work
   activity in public action have been explored. Based on the qualitative
   study of fifteen public programs operating through networks established
   by public-private partnerships (PPNetworks) in Chile, a typology and
   characterization of these networks is proposed. The results reveal four
   types of PPNetworks that organize the work activity in public action:
   networks for investment n public goods, networks for the delivery of
   social services, associative networks of public interest, and networks
   to subsidize projects. Each of these networks is organized based on a
   fundamental principle that establishes coordination mechanisms through a
   set of governance and management instruments, from which private state
   actors and citizens are called to action and positioned within the
   network. It is discussed how these networks attribute forms of
   involvement to the actors involved, thereby questioning them and shaping
   subjective dispositions in public work.},

Title = {A win or a flop? Measuring mass protest successfulness in authoritarian
   settings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {60},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {107-123},

Abstract = {Previously rare events, mass protest movements have become popular
   vehicles for those seeking political, economic, and social change. How
   do we evaluate movement success? Most studies addressing movement
   outcomes are grounded in the goal attainment approach, where movement
   success is dependent upon fulfilling one's stated demands. The models
   derived from this approach heavily rely on visibility and transparency
   in the policymaking process. These offer limited analytical utility for
   scholars studying movements in authoritarian states, where policymaking
   is shrouded and media is state-controlled. Evaluating movements solely
   on their fulfillment of mission goals is highly problematic, as
   movements produce more outcomes than their intended goals. Movements
   also produce unintended benefits: concessions unrelated to the
   movement's mission. These include negative consequences, or societal
   costs. Since movements produce both positive and negative unintended
   outcomes, any evaluation of a movement should also incorporate the costs
   associated with new gains. I argue a cost-benefit approach improves
   scholarly conceptualization and measurement of protest success. I
   conceptualize protest success as multidimensional and comprised of
   protest gains and societal costs. I develop a 21-point scale of protest
   success using Mokken Scale Analysis. AISP diagnostics indicate gains and
   costs comprise separate subscales, which are collapsed to produce total
   sum scores. I score 34 nonviolent movements in authoritarian states
   between 2002 and 2013 on an additive scale. Protests in authoritarian
   settings attain considerable accomplishments; however, those gains come
   with significant cost. Most total success scores are negative,
   indicating considerable backlash is common during and immediately after
   the demobilization of movements in authoritarian states. Success scores
   improve upon the canonical binary measure by: (1) offering improved
   discrimination between movements, (2) identifying cases of regime
   `ignoring', and (3) pinpointing misclassified cases. By incorporating
   negative consequences into our evaluations, we advance our understanding
   why movements deemed successful by scholars are disappointments to their
   home publics.},

Abstract = {Democratic alternation in power involves uncontrolled policy
   experiments. One party is elected on one policy platform that it then
   implements. Things may go well or badly. When another party is elected
   in its place, it implements a different policy. In imposing policies on
   the whole community, parties in effect conduct non-randomized trials
   without control groups. In this paper, we endorse the general idea of
   policy experimentation but we also argue that it can be done better by
   deploying in policymaking randomized controlled trials. We focus
   primarily on the democratic benefits of using randomized trials in
   policymaking and on how they can enhance the democratic legitimacy of
   policy. We argue that randomized trials resonate well with three key
   democratic principles: non-arbitrariness, revisability and public
   justification. Randomized trials' contribution to non-arbitrariness and
   revisability is not unique; other types of evidence can advance these
   democratic principles as well. But through their peculiar democratic
   scrutability, randomized trials are well-equipped to contribute to the
   public justifiability of policy.},

Abstract = {In this article, we use network science to explore the topology of the
   Islamic State's ``terrorist bot `` network on the online social media
   platform Telegram, empirically identifying its connections to the
   Islamic State supporter-run groups and channels that operate across the
   platform, with which these bots form bipartite structures. As part of
   this, we examine the diverse activities of the bots to determine the
   extent to which they operate in synchrony with one another as well as
   explore their impacts. We show that these bots are mainly clustered
   around two communities of Islamic State supporters, or ``munasirun, ``
   with one community focusing on facilitating discussion and exchange, and
   the other one augmenting content distribution efforts. Operating as
   such, this network of bots is used to lubricate and augment the Islamic
   State's influence activities, including facilitating content
   amplification and community cultivation efforts, and connecting people
   with the movement based on common behaviors, shared interests, and/or
   ideological proximity while minimizing risk for the broader
   organization.},

Abstract = {As the origin story of the present world political order the
   globalization of international society serves as a unifying frame for
   the discipline of international relations. This paper considers the
   consequences of the shift from the `expansion' to the `globalization' of
   international society in relation to two main texts: Hedley Bull's The
   Anarchical Society and Tim Dunne and Christian Reus-Smit's The
   Globalization of International Society. The analysis shows that Bull's
   conception of world order depends on a key distinction between aggregate
   and system which marks the difference between an aggregate of local
   political orders and a systematically unified world political order (a
   global international system). Because recent histories of the
   globalization of international society remain guided by Bull's
   distinction, they are unable to explain this transition in historical
   terms without transforming the global international order from the
   explanandum of the globalization of international society to its
   explanans. As a result, global histories of the globalization of
   international society grant a global international system a structural
   permanence the original expansion story was meant to contest. In doing
   so they change profoundly the kind of questions that can be asked
   regarding the origins, character, and future of political order on
   earth.},

Title = {More than just experts for hire: A conceptualization of the roles of
   consultants in public policy formulation},
Journal = {POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 25},
Abstract = {Consultants are increasingly a part of public policy formulation, and
   their policy involvement draws extensive interest in research and public
   debate. However, there is a gap in how we think about their formulation
   role: they are often conceptualized as a type of expert, while their
   actual interaction with and contribution to policy formulation is much
   more varied. This paper develops a conceptualization of consultants'
   formulation roles. It demonstrates that rather than just informing
   policy formulation, consultants take multiple roles and interact with
   policymaking and makers in multiple ways. Using a policy
   network/subsystem distinction and a substance/process distinction as the
   main axes for analysis, the paper develops four role categories: (1)
   experts and knowledge brokers, in which consultants provide policy
   advice and analysis; (2) seeing for the government, in which they
   construct a picture of the policy field; (3) legitimizers and
   validators, in which they provide symbolic capital to policy; and (4)
   channels for stakeholders' policy preferences, in which they manage
   deliberation and synthesize actors' policy preferences. The paper
   provides much-needed clarity on how consultants engage with policy
   formulation and policymakers and forwards our understanding of how
   consultants exert their policy influence.},

Abstract = {The question to what extent voters punish governments for cutting the
   welfare state is an unsettled issue in social policy research. Our
   contribution addresses this shortcoming by systematically analyzing how
   media reporting about legislative changes to the welfare state affects
   the public agenda and citizens' vote intentions while controlling for
   the influence of actual cutbacks and expansions. In our analysis we
   examine the case of Germany from 1994 to 2014; a period where major
   cutbacks but also significant expansions to the German welfare state
   occurred. We find that mass media reporting about pension cutbacks is
   associated with a drop in government approval, whereas the reaction to
   expansive legislative changes is muted. We also find that the
   relationship of media reporting and government approval strongly depends
   on who is in government with the social democrats being punished harder
   than the Christian democrats.},

Abstract = {Contemporary conflicts are becoming increasingly transnational in
   nature. In particular, individuals are leaving their homelands to
   participate in foreign conflicts at an unprecedented rate. This paper
   analyzes the foreign fighter phenomenon in the context of the Islamic
   State. Using primary source data on individual ISIS members from the
   Middle East, this paper contributes to the literature with two key
   findings. The first affirms previous work on terrorist participants and
   finds that those who join the Islamic State are more educated and
   younger than others from the same country. Second, other characteristics
   that are thought to correlate with joining a terrorist organization,
   such as prior occupation and marital status, have an inconsistent
   association and vary by country. Specifically, individuals with a
   university education and who also hold an unskilled job have the highest
   likelihood of joining ISIS. Overall, the results suggest that relative
   deprivation drives participation in foreign fighting.},

Title = {Empathic reactions to press photographs from the War in Ukraine: A
   Q-sort study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JAN 23},
Abstract = {This study scrutinizes press photographs published during the first 6
   weeks of the Russian War in Ukraine, beginning February 24th, 2022. Its
   objective is to shed light on the emotions evoked in Internet-savvy
   audiences. This empirical research aims to contribute to the
   understanding of emotional media effects that shape attitudes and
   actions of ordinary citizens. Main research questions are: What kind of
   empathic reactions are observed during the Q-sort study? Which visual
   patterns are relevant for which emotional evaluations and attributions?
   The assumption is that the evaluations and attributions of empathy are
   not random, but follow specific patterns. The empathic reactions are
   based on visual patterns which, in turn, influence the type of empathic
   reaction. The identification of specific categories for visual and
   emotional reaction patterns are arrived at in different methodological
   processes. Visual pattern categories were developed inductively, using
   the art history method of iconography-iconology to identify six distinct
   types of visual motifs in a final sample of 33 war photographs. The
   overarching categories for empathic reactions-empty empathy, vicarious
   traumatization and witnessing-were applied deductively, building on E.
   Ann Kaplan's pivotal distinctions. The main result of this research are
   three novel categories that combine visual patterns with empathic
   reaction patterns. The labels for these categories are a direct result
   of the Q-factorial analysis, interpreted through the lense of
   iconography-iconology. An exploratory nine-scale forced-choice Q-sort
   study (N-stimuli = 33) was implemented, followed by self-report
   interviews with a total of 25 participants {[}F = 16 (64\%), M = 9
   (36\%), M-age = 26.4 years]. Results from this exploratory research
   include motivational statements on the meanings of war photography from
   semi-structured post-sort-interviews. The major result of this study are
   three types of visual patterns ({''}factors{''}) that govern distinct
   empathic reactions in participants: Factor 1 is ``veiled empathy{''}
   with highest empathy being attributed to photos showing victims whose
   corpses or faces were veiled. Additional features of ``veiled
   empathy{''} are a strong anti-politician bias and a heightened awareness
   of potential visual manipulation. Factor 2 is ``mirrored empathy{''}
   with highest empathy attributions to photos displaying human suffering
   openly. Factor 3 focused on the context. It showed a proclivity for
   documentary style photography. This pattern ranked photos without clear
   contextualization lower in empathy than those photos displaying the
   fully contextualized setting. To the best of our knowledge, no study has
   tested empathic reactions to war photography empirically. In this
   respect, the study is novel, but also exploratory. Findings like the
   three patterns of visual empathy might be helpful for photo selection
   processes in journalism, for political decision-making, for the
   promotion of relief efforts, and for coping strategies in civil society
   to deal with the potentially numbing or traumatizing visual legacy of
   the War in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {In many American Indian nations the security situation is dire. While
   scholars have studied how institutions shape economic development in
   American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) nations, the role of AIAN
   institutions for security and violent crime has received much less
   attention-despite the extensive literature highlighting the important
   role of effective and legitimate institutions in the long-term decline
   of violence. We analyze how varying types of American Indian polities
   and judiciary institutions fare in tackling violent crime using data
   across 146 American Indian polities. Our findings indicate that more
   autonomous American Indian criminal justice institutions with
   specialized court systems are associated with lower violent crime.
   However, customary justice institutions do not appear to be effective in
   reducing violent crime, highlighting the problem of cultural mismatch
   between traditional and formal justice systems. We argue that analyzing
   AIAN nations provides important insights into how institutional
   legitimacy can shape violent crime.},

Abstract = {While ontological security (OS) studies have gone through a recent
   evolution, shifting toward psychoanalytic and existential accounts of
   anxiety, this article argues there remains a deficient engagement with
   the affective environments within which actors operate. Specifically,
   focusing on shared emotions/affect allows for a thicker account of the
   mechanisms of OS - including the constitutive forces underpinning
   society/societal trust, the role/power of signifiers and narratives, and
   the basis upon which actors promote social change. Accordingly, it
   suggests Durkheim's social theory, his broader concept of `religion' as
   an affective community constituted by faith in a moral order entwined
   with the sacred, offers a viable pathway to develop these insights and
   develop a new basis for the mechanisms of OS. The drive for OS thus
   becomes reconfigured as an effort to act faithfully toward a dynamic
   moral order, while ontological insecurity emerges from the unbearable
   lightness of being experienced within moral disorder. Following
   Durkheim's preliminary argument on nationalism representing the
   continuation of religion, we can then revise how/why nations are
   integral to OS and International Relations. Specifically, we can view
   foreign policy as informed by debates around how to act faithfully
   toward the moral order - a process interrelated with revitalization and
   renewal of the sacred.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The phenomena of democratic backsliding in enlarged European Union
   countries of central, eastern, and southeastern Europe tend to be lumped
   together. These paradigms fail to capture differences across countries
   and time, and the differences in backsliding among the subcomponents of
   liberal democracy. This study analyzes this issue from several
   indicators provided by V-Dem for 18 countries. The results indicate that
   democratic backsliding has been occurring in Poland, Hungary, Serbia,
   and Turkey, while not as much in other countries. What has been observed
   in these four countries is that the violation of the liberal component
   of democracy, the weakening of judicial control and restrictions on
   freedom of expression, comes before the violation of the cleanliness of
   democracy and the full breakdown of democracy. Through a comparative
   weighing of multiple indicators, this study clarifies the nuanced
   reality of democratic regression in the region.},

Abstract = {We ask why working hours in the rich world have not declined more
   sharply or even risen at times since the early 1980s, despite a steady
   increase in productivity, and why they vary so much across rich
   countries. We use an internationally comparable database on working
   hours () and conduct panel data estimations for a sample of 17 European
   countries and the USA over the period 1983-2019. We find that high or
   increasing top-end income inequality, decentralized labor relations, and
   limited government provision of education and other in-kind services
   contribute to long working hours. Our results are consistent with the
   hypothesis that upward-looking status comparisons in positional
   consumption ('Veblen effects') contribute to a `rat race' of long
   working hours that is more or less pronounced in different varieties of
   capitalism.},

Abstract = {The weakness of indispensable leaders is on full display in countries
   led by strongmen sitting atop authoritarian regimes, many of whom now
   appear embattled. The strength of democracy is that political leaders
   are systematically replaceable, particularly when they make mistakes.
   Neither US Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy nor Italian Prime
   Minister Giorgia Meloni is indispensable. What matters for the United
   States and Italy is how good existing US and Italian constitutional
   arrangements are at self-correcting if they turn out to be poor leaders.
   Even in democracies, however, those who have power can be reluctant to
   surrender it. Leaders who presume themselves to be indispensable and
   seek to restructure political institutions to ensure they stay in power
   constitute a grave threat. What McCarthy and Meloni have done to gain
   power is less worrisome than what they might do to keep it.},

Abstract = {Although the governments of Poland and Hungary seem to similarly contest
   the conditionality mechanism that requires one to respect the rule of
   law when using EU funds, there are differences between these countries.
   They become visible in the framing of political communication as regards
   the opposition parties. This article seeks to identify the grounds of
   the competition from parliamentary opposition of the governments in
   relation to the EU Recovery and Resilience Fund. An analysis of 2021's
   parliamentary debates on national recovery and resilience plans revealed
   three communication frameworks: the financial frame (the policy
   dimension), the quality of governance frame (the politics dimension),
   and the European integration frame which shaped domestic political
   rivalry (the polity dimension). Differences within these framings
   between the narrative of the Polish and Hungarian opposition resulted
   from different institutional and structural contexts. The study confirms
   the importance of national opposition parties for the analysis of the
   process of European integration. The existence of a liberal opposition
   may promote the salience of the topic of European integration in
   domestic political debate.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to assess the digital transformation
   quantitatively and qualitatively in the management of public services
   against the background of the pandemic. The E-Government Development
   Index (EGDI) analog for evaluating the effectiveness of digital public
   services was developed. Qualitative and quantitative changes in digital
   transformation in the management of public services on the background of
   the pandemic were determined. It was found that no more extensive range
   of non-mandatory actions aimed at improving the client -oriented nature
   of public services and communication is observed in the innovative
   regions of the Russian Federation. It is established that the main
   transformations are qualitative, as the trend of increasing
   digitalization of public services was observed even before the pandemic,
   but during the pandemic the requirements for the expansion of such
   services, their efficiency, ``customer centricity{''}, and communication

Abstract = {This article analyses the evolution of civil-military relations in Spain
   from 1923 to 2021. The research defines the role of the military
   organisation during two authoritarian regimes in the 20th century along
   with the country's democratic transition. After a historical overview,
   the military change process known as Experimental Brigade 2035 is
   selected as a case study to determine whether its origin is civilian or
   military in nature. The results of the research evidence the civilian
   influence in budgetary issues and limits in performance. At the same
   time, the military has a certain autonomy to implement modernisation
   plans in the framework of assigned competences.},

   integration processes in the history of CEE region and uses a broad
   perspective to facilitate a better understanding of its roots. As well
   as looking at the ways in which the history was constructed, Pawluszko
   explores the theoretical implications of current state in intra-European
   relations in the field of security studies. ``Peripherality of the CEE
   region{''} concludes with a study of current geoeconomic position of the

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Abstract = {Our study aimed to understand the role of situational factors in
   instigating people to perform violence against frontline healthcare
   workers during the coronavirus disease outbreak in India. We performed a
   thematic analysis of secondary data, collected from online web pages of
   leading national and regional newspapers. The study pro-posed a
   framework linking situational factors and violence through the mechanism
   of emotional dynamics that led to aggression (stress, tension, and
   anger). Existing literature suggests that environmental and cognitive
   factors influence human learning and behaviour, and there is a
   chronological sequence of several activities to reach the point of
   committing violence. The current study identified three thematic areas:
   information deficit, mistrust in government actions, and socio-economic
   insecurities based on situational factors. False beliefs, rumours, lack
   of relief material, doubt in government actions, communication gap, and
   fear for life, land and livelihood were identified as situational
   factors. The study contributes to building a stronger theoretical
   foundation for the existing literature and filling the gap in effective
   intervention strategies for preventing such violent acts in the near
   future.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 29},
Abstract = {Asymmetric relationships are key to international relations with
   Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine placing asymmetry at the
   forefront of global politics. This article's originality arises from its
   examination of the effects of an international crisis involving the
   larger partner of an asymmetric relationship and a third-party country
   for the asymmetric relationship in question. Specifically, Havana-Moscow
   relations. Havana's response to the August 1968 invasion of
   Czechoslovakia, the December 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and the 2022
   Ukrainian invasion are examined using a rigorous historical qualitative
   analysis of primary and secondary sources and a qualitative and
   quantitative analysis of bilateral trade. It is posited that during an
   international crisis: (1) the dynamics of the asymmetric relationship
   change triggering a new type of asymmetry: temporal crisis asymmetry;
   and (2) the bilateral relationship becomes more symmetric. Significant
   for other asymmetric relationships impacted by an international crisis
   involving the larger partner and a third-party country.},

Title = {Delegation of Economic Statecraft to Private Enterprises: Russia, China,
   and Turkey in Africa},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {The literature on economic statecraft, defined as the use of economic
   means to achieve strategic ends, deals primarily with direct state
   instruments (sanctions, embargoes, and loans), or delegation to
   state-owned enterprises. However, states as principals also frequently
   delegate to private enterprises, which leads to the puzzling question of
   why some principals delegate economic statecraft to private enterprises
   instead of state-owned enterprises. In the classic literature on
   principal-agent theory, the principal delegates to agents because of the
   agents' experience, the principal's poor relationship with the target
   subject, or inability to participate in every step of the process.
   Arguably, the reasons for the principal's delegation to private
   enterprises in economic statecraft might differ. The contribution of
   this article is two-fold. First, it introduces a three-tiered model of
   the economic statecraft's delegation based on deniability and control.
   It consists of direct state interventions, delegation to the state-owned
   enterprises, and delegation to the private-owned enterprises. Second, it
   aims to close the gap in the existing literature by focusing on the
   principal's preference of the delegation to private instead of
   state-owned enterprises in the context of Russian, Chinese, and Turkish
   geopolitical goals in Africa.
   La literatura en materia del arte de gobernar economico, al que
   definimos como el uso de medios economicos con el fin de lograr fines
   estrategicos, trata, principalmente, acerca de los instrumentos
   estatales directos (sanciones, embargos, prestamos) o de la delegacion
   en empresas estatales. Sin embargo, los Estados, como principales,
   tambien delegan con frecuencia en empresas privadas, lo cual nos conduce
   a una desconcertante pregunta: por que algunos de estos principales
   delegan el arte de gobernar economico en empresas privadas en lugar de
   en empresas estatales? En la literatura clasica en materia de la teoria
   principal-agente, el principal delega en los agentes debido a la
   experiencia de los agentes, a la mala relacion del principal con el
   sujeto objetivo o a la incapacidad por parte del principal de participar
   en cada paso del proceso. Podria decirse, por tanto, que las razones de
   esta delegacion en las empresas privadas por parte del principal en el
   campo del arte de gobernar economico podrian ser diferentes. La
   contribucion que realiza este articulo es doble. En primer lugar, el
   articulo presenta un modelo de tres niveles de delegacion del arte de
   gobernar economico basado en la negacion y el control, que consiste en
   intervenciones estatales directas, en delegacion en empresas estatales y
   en delegacion en empresas privadas. En segundo lugar, el objetivo de
   este articulo es cerrar la brecha existente en la literatura tomando un
   enfoque centrado en la preferencia del principal hacia la delegacion en
   empresas privadas en lugar de en empresas estatales, dentro del contexto
   de los objetivos geopoliticos rusos, chinos y turcos en africa.
   La litterature relative a la politique economique, ou l'utilisation de
   moyens economiques pour atteindre des buts strategiques, traite
   principalement d'instruments directs de l'etat (sanctions, embargos,
   prets) ou de la delegation a des entreprises publiques. Neanmoins,
   etonnamment, les etats, en tant que mandataires, deleguent egalement
   souvent a des entreprises privees. Aussi apparait la question suivante :
   pourquoi certains mandataires deleguent-ils la politique economique a
   des entreprises privees plutot qu'a des entreprises publiques ? Dans la
   litterature classique sur la theorie mandant-mandataire, la delegation
   du mandant au mandataire s'explique par l'experience du mandataire, le
   manque d'affinite du mandant avec le sujet cible ou l'incapacite de
   participer a toutes les etapes du processus. Les raisons qui motivent la
   delegation par le mandant a des entreprises privees en politique
   economique pourraient etre differentes. La contribution de cet article
   est double. D'abord, il presente un modele a trois niveaux pour
   representer la delegation de la politique economique en fonction de la
   possibilite de nier et du controle : les interventions directes de
   l'etat, la delegation aux entreprises publiques et la delegation aux
   entreprises privees. Ensuite, il vise a combler la lacune de la
   litterature existante en se concentrant sur les preferences du
   mandataire quand il s'agit de deleguer a des entreprises privees plutot
   que publiques dans le contexte des objectifs geopolitiques russes,
   chinois et turcs en Afrique.},

Abstract = {Participatory budgeting (PB) aims to enhance citizens' participation in
   local government. While there is a significant body of literature on PB,
   few studies investigate the role of internal actors in its management.
   This study aims to understand public managers' perceptions of the whole
   PB process. Using the Q-methodology on a sample of Italian local
   governments experienced in PB, we analyze the perspectives of public
   managers, revealing four approaches to PB, which we classify as
   skeptics, enthusiasts; guarantors; and believers. We find that managers
   have different approaches to how PB works and its potential effects,
   based on their role in managing the process. We also find that their
   attitude may influence citizens' participation in and perception of PB.
   Further research should consider the nexus between managers' perceptions
   and citizens' involvement in PB.},

Abstract = {The nexus between economic motivations and terrorist activities has been
   extensively theorized, but existing explanations often overlook the
   contemporary shifts in terrorist financing ushered in by technological
   advancements. The advent of cryptocurrencies, with their hallmarks of
   anonymity, decentralization, liquidity, usability, and profitability,
   has bestowed upon terrorist groups new avenues for raising funds while
   remaining largely clandestine. This exploratory research delves into the
   repercussions of this digital financial realm, examining how Bitcoin
   popularity, price volatility, and regulatory frameworks influence the
   operational latitude of terrorist groups. Drawing on the Global
   Terrorism Database (GTD) for terrorist attack data, coupled with Google
   Trends data on ``bitcoin{''} searches from 2009 to 2020 as an indicator
   of cryptocurrency popularity in each country, the study uncovers a
   nuanced dynamic. While the rising prominence of cryptocurrencies subtly
   amplifies the operational sphere for terrorist outfits, the uncertain
   nature of Bitcoin prices as well as the legal and regulatory landscape
   act as deterrents.},

Abstract = {Which job attributes attract prospective high-performing individuals to
   a job in the public sector? Research shows that the particular
   attributes of a job influence perceptions of job attractiveness.
   Moreover, public service motivation (PSM) and self-efficacy are valuable
   individual-level traits for public service performance. This article
   examines how variation within particular job attributes that are generic
   to many public service jobs may attract (or discourage) potential
   workers high in PSM and self-efficacy-i.e., prospective high-performers.
   We focus on eight job attributes encompassing total compensation,
   performance-based incentives, job performance assessment, diverse
   service recipient characteristics, overtime commitments, and key job
   tasks. Using data from a pre-registered conjoint survey experiment among
   1501 US residents, we show how individuals higher in PSM and
   self-efficacy (relative to their counterparts with lower levels of these
   traits) exhibit distinct reactions to the job attributes of
   performance-based pay, service recipients' resources and racial
   demographics, and key job tasks.},

Abstract = {The contemporary study of the welfare state began, along with World
   Politics, , in the immediate postwar era, inspired by the near-collapse
   of democracy and the crucial role envisaged for public spending in
   stabilizing it after war. Over the following decades key scholarly
   questions focused on the normal welfare politics of the era-distributive
   politics, the effects of government policy on growth, and the capacity
   of social policies to create their own political constituencies. In a
   new era of more uncertain democratic resilience, we may need to return
   to older questions: of the coercive function of the welfare state, of
   its ability/inability to conserve democracy, and of the weaknesses of
   welfare policies to maintain political support.},

Abstract = {Drawing on a qualitative analysis of primary sources and interviews with
   members of representative offices, this article shows how five
   post-Soviet de facto states-Transnistria, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, the
   so-called Donetsk People's Republic ({''}DPR{''}), and Luhansk People's
   Republic ({''}LPR{''})-engage in activities of international
   representation by borrowing from diverse repertoires of diplomatic
   practices, generating hybrid practices of their own. On the one hand,
   they are attentive to looking like bona fide states and to displaying
   material and symbolic attributes of statehood through mimicking
   state-led diplomacy. On the other, they resort to creativity and
   innovation to partially compensate for the constraints intrinsic to
   their ambivalent status and complete their repertoire with practices
   similar to those of transnational advocacy networks, especially
   regarding information politics and public diplomacy. Overall, the
   article aims to contribute to the field of contested statehood, as well
   as to the study of the international engagement of non-state actors in
   situations of liminality in the international system.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {How has the field of conflict studies evolved over the past three
   decades? This essay suggests an answer by posing three questions: Why do
   we study conflict? What do we understand as conflict? And how do we
   study conflict? The article proceeds with critical remarks, illustrated
   with articles that have appeared in World Politics during the past five
   years. It concludes by highlighting three key challenges for the future
   evolution of the field: the theoretically driven broadening of our
   understanding of conflict; the development of conceptual, theoretical,
   and empirical links between micro, meso, and macro levels of analysis;
   and a theoretically informed way of specifying the scope conditions that
   apply to findings.},

Title = {Families in Times of Crisis: Narratives of Family and Care during the

Abstract = {Societal narratives about families, ranging from individual discourses
   to public discourse, do not always reflect the reality of family lives.
   This is also valid for Narratives of Return (NoR), which propose a
   return to a ``natural{''} family order and lean on conservative
   ideological values. However, such a notion does not rely on the actual
   past and present social practice but tries to reshape it. It
   deliberately omits the variety of existing forms and relationships
   present among families. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia, many
   processes, patterns, and problems in society became more visible. The
   crisis put particular pressure on families and intergenerational
   relationships, mainly regarding care. This paper aims to analyse the
   micro-narratives about families, relationships, and care juxtaposed to
   the actual practice during the pandemic. We rely on the data from a
   two-year-long ethnographic research using online surveys, ethnographic
   interviews, and autobiographical texts. We compare these data with
   political discourse and its presentation in media, where we looked for
   aspects of NoR. It seems that the political discourse was primarily
   focused on securing public health but was at the same time oriented
   towards particular problems (such as natality or abortions),
   constructing an ideological narrative with specific family structures in
   mind (in accordance with NoR). Simultaneously, it has put older adults
   at the forefront as a uniform social group which is vulnerable and
   dependent on others, omitting their function as caregivers of the
   youngest generation in the family.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the role of accounting in disaster mitigation and
   the importance of transparency to avoid corruption. During the Ukrainian
   war, accounting has allowed the redistribution of war material, the
   quantification of economic aid, or the efficient management of
   humanitarian aid. This paper aims to set a research agenda on
   transparency and corruption in foreign aid to a fragile and
   conflict-affected country. In order to analyze the situation of
   corruption in Ukraine during the war, first a review of the latest
   corrupt events is carried out and its position in the Corruption
   Perception Indicator is analyzed. Subsequently, we analyze the aid that
   Ukraine has received from other countries and institutions, and whether
   it is transparent. The possible dependence of the Corruption Perception
   Indicator on the transparency index of each country in the management of
   aid to Ukraine is studied. This article links corruption, transparency
   and accounting in the context of the Ukrainian war, highlighting the
   important role of auditing and financial controls, and presents
   proposals for future research.},

Abstract = {The past decade has seen a growing interest in the `turn to history'
   which has coincided with a counter-reading of the archive as a means to
   trouble contemporary practices of governance. In this article, I explore
   what a decolonial feminist approach to the colonial archive can look
   like through the development of a research method that involves
   counter-mapping. This method included the use of participatory
   interviews, carried out between 2019-2020, that involved asking
   interviewees to annotate colonial maps of Cairo, and the co-creation of
   an alternative map. This method presented a decolonial space where I,
   the researcher, and the participants, co-investigated the spatial
   securitisation of urban sites as `security threats' and `dangerous
   communities'. In doing so, we co-examined how certain security `truths'
   constructed by the colonial archive transcend the colonial/modern
   continuum in new postcolonial forms of securitisation in Egypt.
   Securitised spaces on the map were, instead, reimagined as spaces of
   emancipation and life. At the same time, the gendered differences
   between participants also point to the coloniality of gender in Egypt.
   In light of this, I thereby also discuss the troubles of representative
   methods, and the need for an intersectional feminist approach to
   decolonial research methods.},

Abstract = {This contribution examines how the roles of the European Union (EU) in
   the governance of the atmosphere - the global ozone and climate regimes
   - as a contested Global Space have evolved over time. To do so, it first
   combines theoretical considerations regarding foreign policy roles and
   global justice. It then traces EU role conceptions and role performance
   in these regimes from their inception until today. The article argues
   that, as the two regimes have matured, the EU has increasingly been
   adopting the role of a `spacifier', pursuing a substantive justice
   position dedicated to fully protecting the atmosphere ('leaving the
   space in peace') while actively striving to reconcile other actors'
   positions. This role embodies the EU's simultaneous quest for embracing
   the European Green Deal's socio-ecological transformation agenda while
   becoming a geopolitical actor. It can be interpreted as an expression of
   `principled pragmatism' under the conditions of the Anthropocene.},

Abstract = {Research shows that dictators purge (military) elites following coups,
   while other work shows the utility of analyzing individual-level elite
   purges to understand the inner workings of autocracies. We therefore
   ask: Who do regime change coup-entry dictators purge? We argue that who
   dictators purge depends on costs and benefits relating to two factors.
   First, purging elites with coercive capacity entails higher costs due to
   the assistance they provide dictators in navigating outsider threats.
   Second, dictators benefit from purging elites who helped them seize
   power; the demonstrable willingness of these elites to overthrow an
   incumbent threatens the dictator and his ability to consolidate power.
   We find support for our argument from original quantitative data on 289
   elites in 32 autocratic ruling institutions between 1948 and 2000. Our
   findings have important implications for the study of the large
   proportion of autocracies born of regime change coups, particularly
   topics on survival and state violence.},

Abstract = {Globally, tens of millions of forcibly displaced people live in informal
   urban neighbourhoods. Although critical sites for humanitarian and
   development intervention, municipal authorities may have only a limited
   presence. Especially in conflict and post-conflict settings, other
   non-state actors emerge to compete for public authority. While the
   localisation agenda of international donors seeks to better engage local
   governance actors, little is known about how aid donors take account of
   non-state public authority actors as they seek to achieve stability,
   state building, security and refugee resilience objectives. Accordingly,
   this study adopts a qualitative methodology to analyse how, why and to
   what effect donors conceive of and seek to address the legitimacy of
   state and non-state urban public authority actors in their response to
   urban displacement. Analysis of the Syrian refugee crisis in Jordan and
   Lebanon shows that municipalities remain the focus, as donors hold three
   key assumptions that inform their interventions. Adopting sophisticated
   tools for understanding non-state actors' pursuit of public authority,
   donor interventions seek to undergird, shift, work around, blank or ban
   their legitimacy-making practices. We conclude that while donors embrace
   empirical legitimacy approaches, development and humanitarian responses
   to urban protracted displacement in marginal urban neighbourhoods are
   restricted by powerful normative legitimacy approaches rooted in foreign
   policy objectives.},

Abstract = {This article offers a comparative assessment of the current roles of the
   European Union (EU) in the governance of the Global Spaces - the
   atmosphere, the high seas, the poles, outer space, and cyberspace. It
   does so from a twofold perspective: first, it compares the EU's capacity
   to act and roles across the Global Spaces, drawing on actorness and role
   theory. Second, to contextualize the EU's roles, it contrasts them with
   those of the United States, China and Russia. The findings show that the
   EU is still in the process of calibrating its roles in the governance of
   most of these Global Spaces. It is primarily a norm defender, which
   distinguishes its external action from the more competitive approaches
   of other major powers. The EU's recent attempt to become more strategic
   has, for now, led to a gap between its role conception and performance,
   largely due to its limited actorness.},

Abstract = {The comparative capitalisms literature has developed an increasingly
   dynamic approach to conceptualizing capitalism variety, and has
   suggested mechanisms to explain shifts in institutional practices under
   the surface of formal stability of the institutional context. Less is
   known, however, about how new entrepreneurial firms engage with
   institutions to develop organizational arrangements needed to support
   their innovation activities. Such engagement with institutions can
   represent sources of heterogeneity within and across national
   institutional contexts, with incremental changes in practices resulting,
   in some instances, in major transformations in institutions over time.
   We draw on a study of fifty-three independent mobile games firms in the
   USA and Japan and the structures and processes used by these firms to
   develop innovative activities in their institutional context. Our
   research advances our understanding of organizational diversity and
   institutional change in two ways. First, our study identifies two new
   `variants' of how entrepreneurial firms organize their innovation
   activities in their institutional context-digital creatives and digital
   engineers. Second, we characterize the mechanisms through which
   entrepreneurial firms engage and respond to institutions that support
   the establishment of these variants-defecting, intensifying, and
   positioning vis-a-vis large firms.},

Abstract = {The article aims to offer a contribution to a better understanding of
   the mechanisms underpinning the intertwining of national and religious
   identity at the individual level in (some) European former communist and
   socialist countries. It starts by retracing from a historical
   perspective the place religion occupied during the regimes, then paying
   attention to how, once politicized and ethnicized by the hand of a new
   class of ethnopolitical entrepreneurs, religion has become ``the
   hallmark of nationhood.{''} This excursus allows us to better
   contextualize both the theoretical argument and findings. The
   intertwining of national and religious identity is investigated from two
   main theoretical sources. The first is the debate within sociology and
   political science on the different ideas of nationhood, while the second
   consists of socio-psychological models of intergroup relations. The
   empirical investigation is based on survey data from the European values
   study (EVS, 2017). A comparative approach is used which includes four
   countries having Catholic large majorities (Poland, Slovenia, Croatia,
   and Hungary) and, as a benchmark, Romania having an Orthodox majority.
   To test the hypotheses, a structural equation model is specified. The
   causal model seeks to unravel to what extent different conceptions of
   nationhood (ethno-religious vs. civil), together with national
   attachment, influence the intergenerational transmission of religious
   values and distrust of people of another religion/nationality. The
   research results are in line with the current European trends pointing
   in the direction of a stronger overlap between the religious and the
   national in tailoring collective identities.},

Abstract = {Among the founding figures of the English School of International
   Relations (ES) and the British Committee (BC), Adam Watson is perhaps
   the least studied and researched. How, for example, did his past as
   diplomat informed his Weltanschauung and his understanding of combining
   theory and practice? How did his academic relationship and friendship
   with other members of the BC and colleagues shaped his outlook on
   international politics? What was his political theory and philosophy?
   And what have his contributions been, not simply to the ES, but to IR
   writ large? This paper offers an intellectual portrait of Adam Watson
   and his persona, making use not only of his published written
   production, but also of so far unexplored archives and materials.
   Specifically, the paper situates Adam Watson within the ES and the
   broader IR panorama, taking into account the professional, academic, and
   human material that the extensive research for this paper has uncovered.},

Abstract = {Relations between the US and Russia during the George W. Bush era were
   marked by a dramatic shift from cooperation to confrontation. Russia's
   unequivocal support for the US-led War on Terror in the wake of the 9/11
   attacks in 2001 gave way to a sustained rise in anti-Western sentiment
   in the Russian political narrative. This article analyses US-Russia
   relations during the presidency of George W. Bush through the lens of
   great power relations and status. It explores the distinctive aspects of
   the Bush administration's foreign policy approach and how they impacted
   the US-Russia relationship: notably increasing US unilateralism and its
   apparent rejection of multilateralism, liberal interventionism and the
   pursuit of democracy promotion around the world. These continue to shape
   the Russian view of the US, its intentions and attitude towards
   international order.},

Title = {Can an arms race promote stability? The inter-Korean qualitative arms
   race and US extended deterrence},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to provide a case study of complex conflict
   management within the arms race on the Korean Peninsula. Exploring the
   complex nexus of nuclear weapons, asymmetry and a qualitative arms race,
   the study explains how the arms race between Seoul and Pyongyang has
   promoted stability on the Korean
   Peninsula.Design/methodology/approachPresenting the limits of arguments
   that the US security guarantee is the factor that saved the two Koreas
   from going to war again, this paper explores the utility of the
   inter-Korean arms race as a stabilizer that promotes indirect
   negotiations. While presenting Korean anomalies, this paper analyzes the
   three stages of the inter-Korean arms race - especially its nuclear
   weapons, its asymmetry and the nature of arms races - and provides
   extant explanations on the causes and consequences of the qualitative
   arms race. These key elements drive the states' strategic
   motives.FindingsUsing the case of the inter-Korean qualitative arms race
   and US extended nuclear deterrence on the Korean Peninsula, the study
   shows the complexities of conflict management today. This paper
   identifies three contributing factors - US nuclear weapons, asymmetry
   and the qualitative characteristic of the arms race - to explain the
   enduring stability on the peninsula despite the arms race's
   intensification. The paper finds that although US nuclear-extended
   deterrence plays a critical role, it does not capture the full context
   of the ongoing, dynamic inter-Korean arms race; a prolonged arms race
   between the two Koreas has become a new regularity; the qualitative
   characteristic of the inter-Korean arms race, which is driven by
   technological advancement, contributes to stability in the arms race;
   and as the constant mismatch in priority technologies becomes more
   severe, the changes to the existing asymmetry could increase
   instability.Originality/valueThis paper offers a diverse perspective to
   the literature on conflict management and captures the complexities of
   21st-century conflict management. Through a thorough examination of the
   inter-Korean arms race, it brings readers' attention to the nested
   dynamics within the arms race and shows how an intensifying arms race
   can promote stability. Furthermore, the paper explains the implications
   for potential instability - fueled by the comprehensive mix of a dynamic
   qualitative arms race and the US extended nuclear deterrence - in the
   Indo-Pacific region.},

Abstract = {Climate change is having increasing impacts on the social, economic and
   political space across the African continent. The compounding character
   of such impacts reinforces existing inequalities, raising important
   considerations around climate justice. Growing awareness has seen the
   emergence of activists working for solutions and promoting alternative
   futures, working across scales and sectors to address the complexity of
   the threats. This article examines environmental activism in Nigeria and
   South Africa, exploring strategies and claims, and how these are rooted
   in questions of justice. While environmental movements in Nigeria have
   generally worked to encourage reform and adaption within the existing
   political economic system, a more systemic critique and need for
   fundamental change is observable in South Africa. Drawing on a
   comparison of Extinction Rebellion in both countries, we argue that
   understandings of just transitions should take into consideration the
   unequal abilities of social movements to call for radically
   transformative and just decarbonisation.
   Le changement climatique a un impact croissant sur l'espace social,
   economique et politique du continent africain. Le caractere cumulatif de
   ces impacts renforce les inegalites existantes, soulevant ainsi
   d'importantes questions sur la justice climatique. La prise de
   conscience croissante a vu l'emergence d'activistes qui cherchent des
   solutions et promeuvent des avenirs alternatifs, en travaillant a tous
   les niveaux et dans tous les secteurs pour faire face a la complexite
   des menaces. Nous examinons l'activisme environnemental au Nigeria et en
   Afrique du Sud, en explorant les strategies, les revendications et la
   maniere dont elles sont ancrees dans les questions de justice. Alors que
   les mouvements environnementaux au Nigeria ont generalement oe uvre pour
   encourager la reforme et l'adaptation au sein du systeme
   politico-economique existant, une critique plus systemique et un besoin
   de changement fondamental sont observables en Afrique du Sud. En nous
   appuyant sur une comparaison d'Extinction Rebellion dans les deux pays,
   nous soutenons que la comprehension de la transition juste devrait
   prendre en compte les capacites inegales des mouvements sociaux a
   appeler a une decarbonisation radicalement transformatrice et juste.
   As alteracoes climaticas estao a afetar cada vez mais o espaco social,
   economico e politico por todo o continente africano. O carater agravado
   de tais impactos reforca as desigualdades existentes, e suscita
   consideracoes importantes em torno da justica climatica. A crescente
   consciencializacao implicou a emergencia de ativistas que trabalham em
   busca de solucoes e promovem futuros alternativos, operando em varias
   escalas e setores para lidar com a complexidade das ameacas. Neste
   artigo analisamos o ativismo ambiental na Nigeria e na africa do Sul,
   explorando estrategias, reivindicacoes e como estas estao enraizadas em
   questoes de justica. Embora os movimentos ambientalistas na Nigeria
   tenham geralmente trabalhado para incentivar a reforma e a adaptacao
   dentro do sistema politico economico existente, na africa do Sul
   observa-se uma critica mais sistemica e a proclamacao da necessidade de
   mudancas fundamentais. A partir de uma comparacao da Extinction
   Rebellion em ambos os paises, argumentamos que os entendimentos de
   transicao justa devem levar em consideracao capacidades desiguais nos
   movimentos sociais para pedir uma descarbonizacao radicalmente
   transformadora e justa.},

Abstract = {This study aimed at evaluating the performance of the Municipal
   Institutional Capacity diagnostic methodologies used in Mexico to
   determine which has the best theoretical, practical, and technical
   adjustment in municipalities of the federated state of Veracruz (periods
   of governance 20182021 and 2014-2017). For this research, a mixed,
   non-experimental, crosssectional, and correlational research design was
   employed. The Subnational Analysis method with municipal unit scale was
   used and content analysis techniques, structured observation,
   descriptive statistics, and correlation tests were applied. Findings
   suggest that the Municipal Institutional Development Index showed better
   overall performance compared to Municipal Functional Capacities Index
   and Municipal Performance Consultative Guide. The areas of opportunity
   that were identified in the methodologies include: maximizing the
   temporal stability and regularity of the measurements (in two cases);
   the complete contiguity of areas and maximizing the observations (in one
   case); and, in all three cases, improving the sensitivity of the
   techniques to the theoretical assumption, as well as strengthening the
   sustainability approach.},

Abstract = {We are enriching the debate on the indebtedness of self-governing
   regions with a scientific article that focuses on the effects of this
   phenomenum of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic as selected
   Central European countries. The main purpose of the article is to find
   out possible measures and solutions in the stabilisation of the
   financial security of self-governing regions in the surveyed countries.
   The research refers to the monitored period from the accession of both
   countries to the European Union in 2004 (data summarized in 2005) till
   2022 when the final annual statistical data of the regional final
   accounts (referring to 2021) are available. Descriptive statistical
   method was used to express the development trends of indebtedness,
   represented by line graphs and tables. The data were aggregated for
   individual budget years in all self-governing regions, due to
   significant differences in the structure of fragmentation, the research
   results were interpreted through the indebtedness per inhabitant and the
   share of indebtedness to current income determined by the legal
   framework. Through the study of foreign and domestic scientific
   literature, possible preventive measures for reducing self-governing
   regions debt were proposed when using returnable funding sources after
   joining the European Union of these two countries.},

Abstract = {This paper examined the roadmap for deliberative democracy development
   through village-level regional development planning forums in Indonesia
   and connected it with the strength of traditions and local values of a
   region. Roadmap innovations can solve problems and increase governance
   capacity. This study aimed to identify innovation challenges \& factors
   affecting the innovation environment; using a qualitative method with a
   case study design. As a result, innovation is able to increase
   interaction and agreement on solving public policy problems and improve
   local government governance capacity. The challenge was determined by
   the open leadership, responsive village leadership behavior. Forums
   transform as a formal dialogue space and media for the contestation of
   knowledge with informal meetings in the community. The community
   traditions are present, recognized, valued through institutionalizing
   local institutions, local actors, and features that drive democracy in
   community consultation and cooperation. Several factors affecting the
   innovation environment included legal culture and policy, political\&
   administrative environment, government \& civil servant traditions. The
   government needs to carry out institutional conversions along with
   changes from the government, deliberation spaces, \&communities to
   achieve these two goals.},

Abstract = {When is the public more likely to defer to elites on foreign policy?
   Existing research suggests the public takes its cues from co-partisans,
   but what happens when co-partisans disagree? We argue that the public
   defers to elites whose prior experiences signal expertise and favorable
   intentions. Elites with backgrounds in socially esteemed institutions
   are thus especially powerful cue-givers, even when the core competencies
   of those institutions are not directly related to the issue at hand.
   Using two conjoint experiments, we find that the American public defers
   to more experienced elites generally, but is especially deferential
   toward elites with experience in trusted institutions: the public defers
   more to elites with military backgrounds, even when considering
   non-military issues. The theory and findings suggest that where elites
   sat in the past shapes how much power they wield once standing in
   office.},

Abstract = {The idea of weaponised interdependence has led many to believe that
   Russia would not invade Ukraine due to the high costs of sanctions,
   including through the Western-backed SWIFT system of financial payments.
   Although Russia's economy has been facing shortcomings, the Russian
   leadership thrived in part due to connections beyond the West. This
   article argues that scholars have missed the fact that, more than being
   interdependent with the West, rising states have been decoupling from
   the United States and the European Union. Emerging powers, particularly
   China and Russia, have expanded their trade network and built their own
   financial infrastructure. Those transformations call for a less
   Western-centric International Relations (IR) scholarship. Scholars
   should furthermore not only focus on theories of Neoliberal
   Institutionalism, but also consider contributions from Realism and
   Marxism to International Political Economy (IPE).},

   case of religion and state in Israel},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLICY ANALYSIS},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {How do external macrolevel factors encourage bureaucrats to become
   policy entrepreneurs? And what are their organizational goals in
   pursuing entrepreneurship? Contrary to traditional public choice
   literature on bureaucracy that sees the latter as change-resistant, this
   study stresses that bureaucracies can and do change; they are not as
   insulated from reformist pressure. In this study, we lay the conditions
   under which change occurs, making bureaucrats-policy entrepreneurs. We
   argue that: (1) bureaucratic inefficiency, leading to (2) societal
   pressure as expressed by public opinion, and consequently to (3)
   pressure from potential new providers offering bottom-up competition,
   will encourage bureaucrats to turn to policy entrepreneurship
   strategies. In addition, we assert that their goals in doing so are to
   modify and design efficient services, while protecting their monopoly on
   service provision. We test these claims by analyzing the state-religion
   dynamics in Israel, and specifically the case of the 2021 kosher food
   inspection reform.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the role of parliamentary oversight of emergency
   measures and policies in increasing democratic resilience and recovery
   from the COVID-19 pandemic. The study on the Finnish Parliament is
   conducted by analyzing the statements of the Constitutional Law
   Committee, whose role is to conduct a parliamentary constitutional
   review of governmental bills. The main focus of the analysis is on the
   Committee's reviews of the constitutionality of the emergency measures
   and the procedures of law drafting. The research indicates that the
   committee considered the restrictions and exceptions of fundamental
   rights as proportional and necessary to prevent the overburdening of the
   healthcare system in most cases. However, the justifications for the
   emergency measures were often lacking, and the parliament's right to
   receive information was compromised. These deficits undermined the
   Parliament's capacity to oversee emergency measures and policies. The
   parliamentary constitutional review during the pandemic could still
   serve a critical complementary function by protecting fundamental rights
   and democratic values.},

Title = {Ripeness obscured: inductive lessons from Türkiye's (transactional)
   mediation in the Russia-Ukraine war},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {PurposeConventional wisdom tells us that mediation without ripeness is a
   fool's errand (Zartman and Touval, 1985). What, then, is Turkiye's
   motivation for mediating the war in Ukraine in lieu of ripeness - and
   what can its behavior as a mediator tell us about that motivation? In
   pursuit of this question, this paper inductively analyzes Turkish
   mediation in the Ukraine war to unpack the relationship between a
   contextual (ripeness) and actor-level (motivation) variable. Of
   particular interest is the decision-making and behavior of third parties
   (like Turkiye in Ukraine) who elect to mediate highly complex conflicts
   in which ripeness is indiscernible. The purpose of this research is not
   to propose or test a causal relationship between obscured ripeness and
   mediation, but rather to examine mediation behavior in situations where
   ripeness is obscured.Design/methodology/approachThe impact of weaponized
   information on ripeness and third-party mediation is evaluated through
   an original, systematic and inductive case study analysis of Turkish
   mediation in the Russia-Ukraine war. As an intense theater of operations
   for information warfare for well over a decade, the war in Ukraine
   serves as an especially apt choice for an analysis of ``obscured
   ripeness.{''} Likewise, Turkiye's anomalous position as the only
   substantive source of mediation in the conflict lends significance to an
   empirical examination of its motivation and behavior as a
   mediator.FindingsThis research reveals that the pervasive use of
   weaponized information in the Russia-Ukraine war has distorted and
   disordered the information environment, thereby obscuring the ability of
   third parties to determine if the conflict is or could be ripe for
   mediation. However, the condition of obscured ripeness that prevails in
   the conflict has not proven a deterrent for mediation by Turkiye, which,
   as the only mediator in the conflict, has used a transactional approach
   to mediation motivated by self-regarding interests and animated by a
   manipulative mediation strategy. In sum, this inductive analysis of
   Turkish mediation in Ukraine reveals that the use of weaponized
   information in a conflict indirectly selects on transactional mediation
   (and mediators). The significance of this finding is magnified by the
   widespread use of weaponized information in contemporary conflicts as
   well as the declining frequency of third-party
   mediation.Originality/valueThere have been few, if any, systematic
   assessments in Turkish mediation of the Russia-Ukraine war, and none
   specifically concerned with the effects of weaponized information.
   Additionally, the paper proposes a typology of mediator motivation that
   is used to structure that assessment, while also introducing a new
   concept ({''}obscured ripeness{''}) and linking that concept both to the
   existing literature on ripeness and to the use of weaponized information
   in contemporary armed conflicts. As such, this manuscript represents an
   important contribution both to the empirical and theoretical landscape
   with respect to the study of mediation and international conflict
   management.},

Title = {Climate Change and Violent Conflict in the Middle East and North Africa},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that climate change can escalate the
   risks for violent conflict through various pathways. Existing evidence
   suggests that contextual factors, such as migration and livelihood
   options, governance arrangements, and existing conflict dynamics, can
   influence the pathways through which climate change leads to conflict.
   This important insight leads to an inquiry to identify sets of
   conditions and processes that make climate-related violent conflict more
   likely. In this analytic essay, we conduct a systematic review of
   scholarly literature published during the period 1989-2022 and explore
   the climate-conflict pathways in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
   region. Through the systematic review of forty-one peer-reviewed
   publications in English, we identify that society's ability to cope with
   the changing climate and extreme weather events is influenced by a range
   of factors, including preceding government policies that led to the
   mismanagement of land and water and existing conflict dynamics in the
   MENA region. Empirical research to unpack the complex and diverse
   relationship between the climate shocks and violent conflict in the MENA
   region needs advancing. Several avenues for future research are
   highlighted such as more studies on North Africa and the Gulf region,
   with focus on the implications of floods and heatwaves, and exploring
   climate implications on non-agriculture sectors including the critical
   oil sector.},

Abstract = {Since the United States withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021 and the
   Taliban quickly took over the country, Western governments, including
   the United Kingdom, have been reluctant to engage with an Islamist
   regime that has hosted al-Qaeda and trampled on human rights. Under the
   Taliban, however, violence, corruption and narcotics traffic appear to
   have been dramatically reduced. The Taliban regime has also established
   a reasonable level of security and cracked down on corruption.
   Completely isolating the regime could have perverse security as well as
   humanitarian consequences. Short of another invasion and occupation,
   there is no prospect of a secular, Western-style government re-emerging.
   Through discreet engagement, the West should try to nudge the current
   regime away from its unworldly posture towards a more pragmatic one.},

Abstract = {Official information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on girls'
   and women's schooling in Argentina has been scarce, but it is essential
   that we examine the difficulties experienced by girls and female
   adolescents in order to draw up policies to prevent a deepening of the
   educational gender gap. The available literature indicates that
   woman-headed and woman-supported households have a higher incidence of
   poverty, unemployment, and work overloads than others and less cultural
   capital for assisting in their children's schooling. Obstacles connected
   with the pandemic appear to be linked to the lack of technical
   resources, the assumption of new caregiving or work tasks, and the
   absence of women from the crisis committees formed to deal with the
   pandemic.La informacion oficial sobre el impacto de la pandemia del
   COVID-19 en la escolarizacion de las ninas y mujeres en Argentina ha
   sido escasa. Sin embargo, es fundamental que examinemos las dificultades
   que experimentan ninas y adolescentes para asi elaborar politicas que
   eviten una profundizacion de la brecha educativa de genero. La
   literatura disponible indica que los hogares encabezados o sostenidos
   por mujeres tienen una mayor incidencia de pobreza, desempleo y
   sobrecarga de trabajo que otros, asi como menos capital cultural para
   asistir en la escolarizacion de los hijos. Los obstaculos relacionados
   con la pandemia parecen estar relacionados con la falta de recursos
   tecnicos, el incremento de nuevas tareas de cuidado o trabajo, y la
   ausencia de mujeres en los comites de crisis formados para hacer frente
   a la pandemia.},

Abstract = {The war in Ukraine represents a significant turning point in the
   evolution of Russia's foreign policy expert community. This essay
   examines how Russian experts perceive the war and its consequences,
   taking into consideration the influence of state censorship and
   repression on their practices. It explores the limited ability of
   experts to shape Russia's conduct of war and the moral choices they face
   in Putin's Russia. Drawing on the notion of boundary zones, I note the
   historical evolution of the expert community as a hybrid entity that
   bridges state and society, and analyse the varied reactions among
   experts to the war using Hirschman's framework of exit, voice, and
   loyalty. I conclude that loyalty to the political regime has become
   crucial for voicing critique within the shrinking space of legitimate
   political discourse.},

Abstract = {Neoliberalism is a normative system that endeavors to universalize
   competition and the generation of inequality as fundamental behavioral
   norms, encompassing not only corporate entities but extending to the
   whole society. The tenets of this system came under strain amid the
   coronavirus pandemic which, on one hand, has accentuated its more
   assertive traits, and on the other, compelled certain strategic
   concessions primarily in response to pressures coming from society. An
   assessment of a representative array of economic, political, and health
   care measures implemented by the neoliberal administration of Jair
   Bolsonaro during the critical period of 2020-2021, corresponding to the
   most acute phase of the pandemic, indicates that these measures were
   underpinned by a regrettable, misguided, and detrimental notion positing
   a dichotomy between economic prosperity and public health preservation.
   They were based on the idea that life is not a right for everyone, only
   for the strongest, and that individual freedom should prevail over the
   collective interest. The outcomes of this orientation, in aggregate,
   manifested themselves as a deleterious combination of high unemployment,
   declining wages, liquidity and solvency problems in businesses, and,
   most significantly, a substantial loss of human lives.El neoliberalismo
   es un sistema normativo que busca universalizar la competencia y la
   generacion de desigualdad como normas fundamentales de comportamiento,
   abarcando no solo a las entidades corporativas sino extendiendose a toda
   la sociedad. Los principios de este sistema se vieron sometidos a
   presion por la pandemia del coronavirus, la cual, por un lado, acentuo
   sus rasgos mas asertivos y, por otro, obligo a que se hicieran ciertas
   concesiones estrategicas, principalmente en respuesta a presiones
   provenientes de parte de la sociedad. Una evaluacion de una serie
   representativa de medidas economicas, politicas y de atencion medica
   implementadas por la administracion neoliberal de Jair Bolsonaro durante
   el periodo critico de 2020-2021 (correspondiente a la fase mas aguda de
   la pandemia) indica que estas medidas estaban respaldadas por una nocion
   lamentable, equivocada y perjudicial que postula una dicotomia entre la
   prosperidad economica y la preservacion de la salud publica. Se basaban
   en la idea de que la vida no es un derecho universal, solo el de los mas
   fuertes, y que la libertad individual debe prevalecer sobre el interes
   colectivo. En conjunto, los resultados de esta orientacion se
   manifestaron como una combinacion perjudicial de alto desempleo, una
   disminucion de los salarios, problemas de liquidez y solvencia en las
   empresas y, lo mas importante, una perdida sustancial de vidas humanas.},

Abstract = {With global changes, large-scale natural hazards are more frequent and
   intense, posing a particular challenge for groups in conflict. Do these
   shared external threats influence group willingness to cooperate and
   assist the adversary, and how? The literature suggests inconsistent
   expectations, from increased intergroup cooperation, to exacerbated
   animosity, to no discernable impact. We explore this question in the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a joint
   exogenous threat for both sides. Using multiple surveys and a conjoint
   experiment, we examine whether and how COVID-19 threat perceptions
   affected Jewish-Israeli preferences for collaborating with the
   Palestinians against the pandemic, including a novel exploration of
   concrete policy priorities. We find that greater COVID-19 threat
   perceptions have little effect on collaborative policy preferences,
   corroborating politics-as-usual arguments: support for out-group
   assistance, cooperation, and cost-sharing is polarized by ideological
   orientation. Our findings outline both constraints and opportunities for
   intergroup collaboration policies in conflicts facing joint outside
   challenges.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 has inflicted both beneficial and damaging effects on health
   systems responding to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Data shows that
   the positive impacts of the pandemic (including enhanced hygiene, mask
   wearing and widespread use of personal protective equipment), are likely
   to have been overshadowed by the negative effects: emerging AMR
   pathogens and mechanisms; further outbreaks and geographic spread of AMR
   to non-endemic countries; rising infections from multidrug-resistant
   pathogen; an overall higher burden of AMR. The multisectoral
   complexities of AMR and the totality of health systems challenge our
   ability to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on country
   responses to AMR. In this analysis, we synthesise international evidence
   characterising the role of the pandemic on the six key building blocks
   of health systems in responding to AMR across low- and middle-income
   countries (LMICs). We apply systems thinking within and between the
   building blocks to contextualise the impact of one pandemic on another.},

Title = {Moral Politics of Sidewalk Vending: The Struggle between the City
   Authorities and Sidewalk Vendors of the City of Manila},
Journal = {PHILIPPINE POLITICAL SCIENCE JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article used Kusaka's moral politics framework in examining the
   struggle between the city authorities and the sidewalk vendors of the
   City of Manila. It explained the development of sidewalk vending from
   the perspectives of the authorities and the sidewalk vendors from the
   time of Mayor Gemeliano Lopez Jr. (1986-1992) to the time of Mayor
   Joseph Ejercito Estrada (2013-2019). It showed the moralization of the
   perceived problem of sidewalk vending in the city and the approach of
   the authorities in eradicating sidewalk vendors. This qualitative study
   is a product of interviews with city officials, employees, and the
   different types of sidewalk vendors. It revealed that authorities
   perceived the vendors as undisciplined and undesirable illegals, while
   the vendors see the authorities as corrupt and dishonest extortionists.
   This moral opposition remains a contributing factor to the unresolved
   problem of sidewalk vending in Manila. The approach of the authorities
   to the problem evaded the social injustices experienced by the vendors
   whose welfare is a mandated responsibility of local officials based on
   the Local Government Code of 1991. The article suggests the creation of
   a mechanism of engagement between the authorities and the vendors that
   will serve as an opportunity for sidewalk vendors' participation in
   policymaking.},

Abstract = {Over the past 15 years, the EU has gradually become more involved, de
   jure and de facto, in the field of collective defense. This
   underappreciated evolution occurred in three phases: first, an initial
   phase, from the steps leading up to the Lisbon Treaty, which
   incorporated collective defense into the EU's mandate via Article 42.7
   TEU, to the first activation of this provision following the November
   2015 Paris attacks; second, a phase of indirect development, with the
   launch of policies on military mobility and hybrid threats, tangentially
   linked to collective defense; and third, a phase of direct yet
   incomplete affirmation, with calls to operationalize Article 42.7 TEU
   and the signaling of the EU as a collective defense framework during
   crises with Turkey and Russia. The EU's modest forays in collective
   defense, while resulting from both a deliberate and emergent strategy,
   have become more conscious over time and thus increasingly difficult to
   ignore},

Abstract = {Environmental management literature has extensively explored why the
   regulated community, particularly private firms, join voluntary
   environmental programs (VEPs) in which participants promise to regulate
   ``beyond compliance.{''} However, the notion of locus has been rarely
   considered a key determinant of a firm's VEP participation. This study
   examines how regional pressures encourage firms' VEP participation.
   Drawing on a dataset of over 1000 industrial facilities related to five
   government sponsored VEPs in Korea, it investigates how three types of
   regional pressures-regulators, industrial peers, and community
   members-affect firms' decision to join VEPs. The major findings are that
   firms located in the same region as their conglomerate peers, as well as
   firms located in a place where a large amount of odor pollutant is
   released, are more likely to participate in VEPs. These results
   demonstrate the impact of social attributes derived from the geographic
   location of firms on facilities' VEP engagement.},

Abstract = {Policy change often involves multiple policy subsystems, as in the case
   of clean energy transitions. We argue that trans-subsystem policy
   feedback is a central dynamic in policy change across subsystems. Policy
   in one subsystem creates benefits/costs and/or learning effects that
   mobilize actors for policy change in another subsystem, resulting in
   ``coalition cascades{''} across interdependent subsystems. If coalition
   cascades lead to the resolution of coordination problems across
   subsystems, the system reaches a tipping point in policy change.
   Coalition cascades are thus the transmission belts of trans-subsystem
   policy feedback. We illustrate our argument in the case of California's
   clean energy transition. We show how early renewable energy policy
   spilled over into the subsystems on grid policy-leading to energy
   storage policy-and on transport policy-resulting in electric vehicle
   charging policy. The article advances our understanding of the
   mechanisms underpinning trans-subsystem policy change, offering a model
   of the politics of tipping points.},

Abstract = {It is commonly argued that China's foreign policy and behaviour have
   become increasingly assertive since Xi Jinping took the reins of the
   Chinese Communist Party (CCP). This strategic transformation is seen as
   paving the way for a direct confrontation between China and the USA
   since the Trump presidency. Drawing on the logic of international
   order-building, however, this article argues that the groundwork for
   this strategic change was laid when Hu Jintao was leading the CCP and
   that what made it possible was George W. Bush's China and East Asia
   policy after 9/11. Bush's subsequent reduced interest in East Asia
   enabled China to fill the void left by an absence of US presence and
   influence in the region. This article asserts that American
   policy-makers may need to ponder what their order-building project to
   weaken and exclude an illiberal China should include.},

Abstract = {A vast literature has examined how perceptions of mobility shape demand
   for redistribution. These studies generally refer to contemporaneous tax
   policies demanded by those directly impacted. But social mobility is
   often measured as changes across generations. To account for these
   intergenerational effects, our analysis focuses on educational policies.
   We examine how social mobility at the district level explains
   legislative support for inclusive education policies. We first develop
   an electoral competition model where voters are altruistic parents,
   politicians are office seeking and the future economic status of the
   children is affected both by the degree of income mobility and by public
   education policies. We then analyze a newly compiled dataset of
   roll-call votes on California education legislation matched with
   electoral district levels of income mobility. In line with the model,
   our analysis suggests that upward mobility in a district negatively
   predicts legislative support for redistributive education bills.},

Abstract = {We compare the realised impact of terrorism and disasters linked to
   natural hazards. Using 50 years of data from two databases covering most
   of the global population, we find that natural hazard disasters were
   more than 20 times more impactful than terrorism. The former had a
   larger realised impact in all regions in both gross and per capita
   terms. The largest cross-peril difference was in Asia, where natural
   hazard disasters took 324 million lifeyears, while terrorism took 10.
   Similar results were found across countries grouped by income status and
   development status. Low- and lower-middle-income countries bore the vast
   majority of the impact of both terrorism and natural hazard disasters.
   Given the multitude of prevalent global threats, our findings are
   relevant in the allocation of scarce public resources to mitigate and
   adapt. Our results suggest that significantly greater public spending
   should be applied to natural hazard disasters than terrorism.},

Abstract = {David P. Calleo, who died on 15 June 2023 at the age of 88, was one of
   the most original scholars of his generation on subjects ranging from
   the international economy to US foreign policy, transatlantic relations,
   European politics and the history of ideas. Dean Acheson Professor of
   European Studies at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced
   International Studies (SAIS), Calleo was also, from 2008 until just
   before his death, a Contributing Editor to Survival, which published
   some two dozen of his essays and reviews. This essay, one of his
   earliest contributions, first appeared in these pages in 1999. We are
   republishing it here in full.},

Abstract = {While research on policy diffusion has gained significant interest among
   scholars worldwide, little attention has been given to policy
   reinvention in diffusion. This study aims to investigate the influencing
   factors and combination paths of policy reinvention in the Municipal
   Solid Waste Classification Policy (MSWCP). To achieve this, a
   theoretical framework encompassing internal factors, intergovernmental
   relations, and external influence has been constructed. Empirical
   analysis has been conducted on the MSWCP of 31 large- and medium-sized
   cities in China using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. Through this
   analysis, several combination paths that prompted local governments to
   reinvent policies have been identified. Furthermore, the study has
   clarified the various roles of six conditions-financial resources,
   government attention, policy experience, peer competition,
   organizational learning, and social demand-in achieving policy
   reinvention. These findings are expected to provide new theoretical and
   practical insights into the field of policy reinvention research.},

Abstract = {The transformation of Medellin in Colombia is well known to urbanists. A
   highly contested, violent and unequal city in the 1980s and 1990s,
   Medellin's Social Urbanism ushered in a series of ambitious reforms that
   reimagined public space and mobility. These were designed to address
   challenges related to violence and inequality, concerns which are
   present both in Medellin and across the Latin American region. In
   examining the relationship between architecture, politics and
   peacebuilding, we consider how the role of architecture was and is
   conceptualised in the city's socio-political transformation and how the
   changing form and use of the urban built environment contributed to
   shaping conditions for peace to emerge. Drawing on qualitative
   interviews with key stakeholders, we show that while the challenges of
   violence remain, the architectural and the political became
   intrinsically entwined to both build peace in the city and forward a new
   image of Medellin both internally and externally.},

Title = {Interpellation and the Politics of Belonging: A Psychoanalytical
   Framework},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Interpellation, the production and hailing of subjectivities, is key to
   poststructuralist international relations (IR) theory and yet with some
   notable exceptions interpellation/hailing as an analytical concept
   remains somewhat undertheorized. This paper presents a Lacanian-Zizekian
   psychoanalytical theorization of interpellation in IR, while engaging
   with the ontology and epistemology of belonging. More specifically, this
   paper develops four major psychoanalytical concepts: void/lack, fantasy,
   jouissance, and desire, as it argues that void/lack at the subjective
   and objective levels renders interpellation possible and destabilises
   it, thus accounting for the im/possibility of belonging. This paper
   illustrates the psychoanalytical framework of interpellation by
   analyzing national-populism as manifested in the Brexit discourse in the
   UK as well as the interpellation in homonationalism.},

Abstract = {The `Added Worker Effect' (AWE) theory posits that partners of the
   unemployed provide intra-household insurance by increasing their
   earnings. However, estimates of the AWE are small. Popular explanations
   include lacking need (e.g. due to generous unemployment benefits),
   capacity or willingness to increase earnings, though these explanations
   are seldom tested systematically. Using Swiss administrative data and
   difference-in-differences estimates, we find an overall AWE among only
   non-working women. We find no systematic differences in AWEs between
   couples with differing needs or capacities, but aspects related to
   willingness like marriage, long marital duration and shared biological
   children are associated with higher AWEs. Men's overall slight reduction
   in earnings upon their partners' unemployment is driven by young,
   childless, cohabiting men. Overall, compared to unemployment insurance,
   in all studied subgroups, the AWE is a minimal source of insurance.},

Title = {Electric regionalism: Path dependence, development, and the African
   power pools},

Abstract = {Low access, unreliable supply, and high-cost electricity have hampered
   many African states' ability to grow their economies. Even high-income
   states, like South Africa, are increasingly challenged to provide
   reliable electricity. To help address this shortfall, African states
   belong to five regional power pools: organizations that link together
   electricity grids of member states and create markets to buy and sell
   electricity across borders. Scholar have given scant attention to these
   power pools, and none have explored the politics behind their creation
   and maintenance. The path dependence framework reveals that the
   configuration of the power pools is directly related to the end of
   colonialism and the subsequent creation of regional organizations formed
   in the 1960's. Applying the comparative regionalism framework, I find
   the principal drivers for adding electricity to pre-existing
   organizations fall into three categories: development interests (donor
   states and development banks), mining companies, and some African
   states, especially South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
   Using organizations designed for other means might be hampering the
   region's ability to improve energy security, standards of living, and
   climate change goals. Donors and power pool members should consider
   investing more heavily in bilateral rather than regional organizations
   and in decentralized or distributed electricity systems.},

   Addressing the Dissemination of Terrorist Content Online},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 6},
Abstract = {During the negotiations of the EU Regulation on addressing the
   dissemination of terrorist content online, digital and human rights
   activists raised concerns regarding the safeguarding of fundamental
   rights. These actors were partially successful in influencing aspects of
   the final text of the Regulation, thus, raising the question of how such
   groups have managed to influence traditionally ``securitized{''}
   counterterrorism policy. This study compares the discourses employed by
   the different EU institutions and digital and human rights advocates
   during the negotiation period. Approaching this through the lens of
   politicization, this study demonstrates that whilst securitizing
   discourses persist to a certain extent, some aspects of EU
   counterterrorism law are open to contestation.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a global policy issue that is
   actively governed by international actors producing governance
   indicators. This article argues that despite the arguments about
   disruptions to governance and policy due to AI, the global rankings
   increasingly constitute a strong path dependence on AI policy, leading
   to conformity with existing policies and institutional practices of
   economic competitiveness. By analyzing the composition and data sources
   of global indices in competitiveness, innovation, human capital, and
   artificial intelligence, I will show how the global rankings now evolve
   by sharing data and concepts. Consequently, these metrics and related
   policy scripts promote the seeming continuity of current activities of
   global competitiveness. AI is discussed as a ``revolution{''} but framed
   as a matter of ``competitiveness,{''} ``openness,{''} and ``talent
   competition,{''} implying standard perceptions of economic
   competitiveness and innovation. There is also a narrative element in the
   policy script, as the future policies on AI are promoted with references
   to history that also project the past into the future. My article
   concludes that while path-dependent policy indicators and related future
   narratives give a sense of orientation, they are problematic as they
   portray a seeming continuity of activities in times of disruptions,
   delimiting policy alternatives such as AI ethics.},

Abstract = {To lobby legislators, it is important for interest groups to signal
   their ability to help legislators win elections and provide them with
   policy-relevant information. We explore for-profit companies' use of
   environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reports as a signaling
   device to promote their reputation to legislators and convey their
   ability to provide electoral and policymaking support, which is valuable
   for lobbying. To this end, we create a panel dataset by combining ESG
   reports issued by US companies and the same companies' lobbying and
   campaign contribution records from 1999 to 2017. We expect companies to
   issue more ESG reports, as well as reports containing more quantitative
   content, when they lobby. The data conform to our expectations. We also
   reason that lobbying may be more strongly related to ESG reporting when
   it is coupled with campaign contributions made by affiliated corporate
   political action committees, but the data do not support this
   expectation.},

Abstract = {Prevailing explanations for India-China border crises rely on rational
   actor models and assumes centralized decisionmaking. Instead, I argue
   that the several recent India-China border crises cannot be understood
   without separately interrogating the role of the PLA in China's national
   security policymaking. I argue that the PLA uses its operational
   independence to continuously challenge Indian forces on the contested
   border. The Indian forces, when confronted, pushed back. The several
   recent border standoffs are a manifestation of the interactions between
   the two armed forces.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a new reading of NATO's role since the start of
   the Russian invasion of Ukraine, starting from what appears to be a
   paradox. Despite its role being limited to a deterrent posture, the
   Alliance has seen its attractiveness and legitimacy strengthened since
   the outbreak of the conflict, as demonstrated by the desire of two
   neutral countries, Finland and Sweden, to join NATO. In order to
   understand this paradox, the article will show that the Alliance's
   limited action is due to the fact that its action falls within the
   framework of the UN Charter, but also to its nature as a defensive
   territorial alliance. The article will then analyse whether a recent
   internal change, the promulgation of a new strategic concept, is the
   result of the war in Ukraine. Finally, the article looks at the reasons
   behind the Finnish and Swedish applications for membership.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN POLICY ANALYSIS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {290-310},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article explores the intersection of policy implementation,
   conflict/peacebuilding, and the role of the EU PEACE program in Northern
   Ireland (NI). Conflict societies see a great investment of external
   funds, attempting to promote conflict resolution. Specifically, this
   article analyses the fourth wave of such funding in NI to examine why
   the EU PEACE program has not fully brought about its intended policy
   outcomes. Using Matland's conflict-ambiguity model of policy
   implementation, we identify how EU funds can be skewed to support local
   political interests. Simultaneously, the EU PEACE program continues to
   adhere to strict implementation criteria that makes little sense given
   the local context. Therefore, contrary to its objectives, the
   implementation of EU funding can compound rather than ameliorate
   divisions in postconflict NI. Instead of prescribing strict
   implementation criteria, EU policy could focus on improving the
   administrative capacity and discretion of local administration in
   devising locally relevant implementation strategies.},

Abstract = {The composition of cabinets under presidential regimes has constituted
   one of the top topics of the litterature in political science in recent
   years. However, nothing has been said about the proper size of those
   cabinets. That is, why some cabinets are 37 ministers large when other
   is formed by just 13 members? We carry on a theory of cabinet size under
   presidential regimes, using insights from both parliamentarist and
   presidentialist literature. Our model is composed of five hypotheses
   relying on an original dataset of 161 observations across 19
   presidential countries of the Americas. Our main finding is that the
   inclusion of independents and/or technocrats impacts significantly on
   lowering caninets' size.},

Abstract = {Conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) is an increasingly consequential
   crime to perpetrate - at least if we limit our view to reactions within
   multilateral institutions such as the United Nations (UN) Security
   Council. Turning to the state-led forum for human rights: the UN
   Universal Periodic Review (UPR), this study instead uncovers sparse and
   highly selective condemnation of CRSV. By extracting data on all
   bilateral shaming relating to sexual violence in the UPR since its
   inception in 2008, this article demonstrates that only 5\% of all
   governments take the opportunity to condemn major sexual aggressors. The
   findings should adjust our expectations on the progress rate within the
   policy field of CRSV and advance our understanding of the challenges
   tainting international negotiations on the topic.},

Abstract = {The adoption of statutory minimum wages (MWs) has been accompanied by
   institutional innovations in the relationship between governments,
   employers and unions. In the UK and Germany, MW commissions were created
   to recommend or determine the MW. Their memberships are dominated by
   trade unionists and employers. Structures that engage the social
   partners `in the shadow of hierarchy' can be efficient as well as
   politically expedient. They will be stable if, first, the social
   partners can establish a consensual basis for decisions and, second,
   this consensus position is near enough to the government's position not
   to trigger intervention. The first condition has been met but not the
   second: both in the UK and Germany, governments have overridden
   employers and unions in order to introduce higher MWs. The article
   explores why this has happened and draws out the implications for MW
   fixing and the stability of shadow-of-hierarchy arrangements.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to predict cooperation in
   negotiation through the lens of individual differences. Specifically,
   this paper examines how a social competence variable called ``political
   skill{''} relates to cooperation and subsequent effects on negotiation
   process, outcomes and negotiator reputation. The authors demonstrate how
   political skill fits in the evolving literature focusing on individual
   differences in negotiation by comparing political skill to a wide range
   of other individual difference measures. Design/methodology/approachThis
   study was conducted by assessing individual difference measures at the
   beginning of graduate-level negotiation courses and tracking negotiation
   behaviors and outcomes over several months. This approach was chosen to
   minimize the potential for short, time-limited interactions to mask
   existing relationships. It also allowed the authors to include multiple
   negotiation interactions, which takes a broader view of negotiation
   performance, and assess negotiator reputation by allowing it to emerge
   over time. FindingsThe results of this study show that political skill,
   self-rated at the beginning of this study, is significantly related to a
   negotiator's overall use of cooperative behavior as rated by peers.
   Political skill also showed a significant relationship with reputation
   for cooperativeness and aggregate outcomes in negotiations. These
   results control for other individual difference measures such as
   personality, implicit negotiation beliefs, social value orientation and
   negotiation self-efficacy. Originality/valueUsing a method that allows
   the effects of an individual difference to materialize over time, this
   study empirically establishes the connection between political skill and
   negotiation reputation, process and outcomes. The methodological
   contributions of this study explore the relations between self-rated
   individual difference variables, peer-rated cooperative behaviors and
   objective coded negotiation outcomes in evaluating political skill in
   negotiation.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Efforts to better understand what prevents institutions from changing to
   meet contemporary demands - or what facilitates the evolution of
   existing constructs to address new challenges - are of particular import
   and relevance to environmental governance. While the existing literature
   provides valuable conceptualisation and empirical evaluation of
   institutional stability and change, the lack of a consistent and
   holistic typology complicates the evaluation of institutions over time.
   In this article, we use a combined stability-change typology to assess
   the dominant modes of institutional change and stability over a
   multi-decadal timespan across three environmental governance systems -
   air quality governance in the US and China, and climate governance in
   the European Union. Across cases, we find that these modes are not
   mutually exclusive but can occur simultaneously, in concert or in
   conflict. We also find that observed patterns of change and stability
   are reflective of the social and political context in which systems
   operate, as well as the focus of the system itself (for example,
   localised air quality versus global climate change). Apart from
   providing a proof-of-concept analysis of institutional change and
   stability, our findings raise questions about the mechanisms underlying
   spatial and temporal patterns across identified modes. Indirectly, our
   findings also further highlight challenges to designing systems both
   resilient to exogenous stressors and capable of adapting to new
   situations. Our combined stability-change typology may help to advance
   understanding of whether and how such balancing has occurred in the
   past, thus facilitating future efforts to address contemporary
   challenges.},

Abstract = {Less-educated workers have the lowest participation rates in job-related
   further training across the industrialized world, but the extent of
   their disadvantage varies. Using data on 28 high- and middle-income
   countries, we assess different explanations for less-educated workers'
   training disadvantage relative to intermediate-educated workers, with a
   focus on the role of labor market allocation (i.e. job tasks, other job
   features and firm characteristics). Shapley decompositions reveal a
   broadly similar pattern for all countries: differences in labor market
   allocation between less- and intermediate-educated workers are more
   important for explaining the training gap than differences in individual
   learning disposition (i.e. cognitive skills and motivation to learn).
   Our analysis further suggests that the training gap is related to
   educational and labor market institutions and that labor market
   allocation processes play a key role in mediating any institutional
   `effects'. Strong conclusions regarding the role of institutions are
   hampered by the small country-level sample, however.},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {Recent literature on autocracies focuses on elite politics to study
   ruling party stability. I focus on the lowest level of the ruling party
   structure, party members, to introduce new data on party-based
   autocracies. Party members are unique connectors between ruling party
   and society, and ruling parties can recur to them for policy
   enforcement, political control, co-optation and legitimation to secure
   power. I present the One-Party Membership Dataset (OPAMED), a
   comprehensive dataset on party membership in autocracies, covering 42
   ruling parties across party-based regimes from 1945 to 2020, and
   introduce two new variables: party size; and party membership
   volatility. The first variable measures the membership-to-population
   ratio, while the second measures the rate of co-optation growth from one
   year to the other. In conclusion, the OPAMED provides a new, flexible
   and easy-to-use toolkit on ruling parties in party-based autocracies.},

   supportive politicians were opposed by governments of Estonia, Latvia,
   Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, the USA, EU institutions, and some NGOs.
   Germany was confronted with sharp dilemmas and remains the pivotal actor
   in this confluence. The responsible German ministry rescinded approval
   to operate the pipeline 2 days before the Russian invasion of Ukraine on
   24 February 2022. The topic encourages interaction of materialist IPE
   with other branches of International Relations, comparative politics,
   history, and law to incorporate identity-based, normative, and
   geopolitical influences on nominally economic activity and policy.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {466-486},

Abstract = {This article explores how a Powellite form of nostalgia - named for the
   anti-immigration politics of former British MP Enoch Powell - connects
   seemingly contradictory nationalist narratives known as Global Britain
   and Little England. While the former is typically aligned with an
   expansive and buccaneering national biography, the latter is held to
   operate via a more defensive and exclusionary imaginary. This article
   challenges such a binary distinction by demonstrating how the two
   discursive strands are intimately connected by nostalgic views about
   white English racial dominance, cultivated during Britain's pursuit of
   empire. Drawing on a qualitative analysis of verbal and visual sources
   from the Brexit referendum, plus 13 interviews with Leave campaigners,
   the article shows how Powellite nostalgia reproduces gendered and
   racialised colonial images of the nation amid immigration `crisis'.
   Despite the detoxifying effects of much post-referendum Brexit analysis,
   the article also demonstrates how Powellite nostalgia is shared across
   the Eurosceptic spectrum and within broader English culture, persisting
   into the post-Brexit era.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we develop a framework for understanding the different
   spheres of authority of chiefs aiming to widen the perspectives on how
   government-chief interactions affect the governance process. The
   framework is applied in our analysis of interviews with government
   actors involved in area protection in the Great Limpopo Transfrontier
   Conservation Area (GLTFCA). Our results illustrate the variety of
   approaches and perceptions towards governance with chiefs that exist
   amongst government actors within the same governance system. Although
   government actors perceive chiefs in the GLTFCA as a parallel system,
   chiefs can act as a rival, mediator, adviser, or partner to the
   government; thus, both enable or hamper government governance. The
   informal governance arrangements found in the data between government
   actors and chiefs moreover underscores the importance of qualitative
   case studies of hybrid governance systems},

   determining electoral outcomes and patrimonialism and the use of force
   in enabling ruling parties to prolong their stay in power. This article,
   which draws upon various instances of participant observation and
   interviews regarding the 2021 elections in Zambia, contributes to the
   few studies that emphasise the limits of clientelism and patrimonialism
   in African politics and the agency of voters or subordinate groups to
   hold their leaders accountable. It does so by showing how Zambian voters
   sought to secure benefits from clientelist campaigns, patrimonial rule
   and trade union campaigns to win changes in state policies, publicly
   promising reciprocity and loyalty when under the gaze of the ruling
   party actors, only to vote them out of power.},

Abstract = {Descriptions of social movement factionalism are often based on the
   dichotomous conception of lawful moderates and violent radicals. In this
   article, we nuance this distinction by illustrating the complexity of
   radical flanks through an empirically grounded analysis of protest
   tactics, in which we ask under what conditions radical flanks are likely
   to use violent protest tactics. Exploring dominant explanations of
   political violence, the article shows the necessity of understanding the
   use of violent protest tactics as part of cognitive and relational
   processes. The use of violent tactics varies greatly across frames and
   protest issues, pointing to how different logics of protest are tied to
   different frames. Also, the use of violence is affected by the presence
   or absence of moderate allies; the likelihood of violence clearly
   decreases when radicals and moderates form coalitions when organising
   protests. The analysis is based on a protest event data set covering
   over 3,900 nonviolent and violent events by the Radical Left-Libertarian
   Movement in Sweden, 1997-2016. Notably, the results hold over this
   entire twenty-year period, suggesting that they are robust and provide a
   better explanation than historically contingent causes.},

Abstract = {From Trump's America to Putin's Russia, from climate change denial to
   corona denial, so-called post-truth politics are experiencing a global
   rise. How can we understand and explain this phenomenon? In the attempt
   to answer this question, this article advances two core claims. First,
   it suggests that post-truth politics is (despite its name) marked not
   only by the denial of claims to objective truth, but also by the
   naturalization of one specific truth claim: namely, the cynical belief
   that self-interests are behind all public discourse. Second, it locates
   the social sources of this dogmatic cynicism in the global expansion of
   neoliberal competition.},

Abstract = {Objective/context: The paper examines the contribution of think tanks
   (TTs) to debating ideas and their relationship with the environment.
   Specifically, it analyzes the variations introduced by the electoral
   campaign in the political positions of TTs and the role of ideology and
   party affiliation as possible determinants. Methodology: The content of
   the web pages of ten TTs is monitored before and during the electoral
   campaign for the 2021 presidential elections in Chile, where numerous
   TTs have become protagonists. For each TT, attention to socio-political
   issues is analyzed, and the trend of their positions is recorded.
   Conclusions: The analysis shows that TTs adapt their communicative
   agenda to the electoral campaign and that their ideology is a principal
   variable in this strategy. Originality: Evidence is provided on the
   entry of TTs in electoral campaigns with differences between
   conservatives and progressives.},

Title = {Labor Markets in Contexts of War: Recruitment and Trafficking of Child
   Soldiers in Colombia},
Journal = {COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {65-91},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Objective/context: The article aims to analyze child recruitment as a
   form of human trafficking. Beyond the theoretical perspectives that
   focus on security or rights, it addresses the topic as a form of unfree
   labor. By means of a case study focused on child recruitment by
   right-wing paramilitary groups in Colombia, the paper analyzes how
   children entered and exited illegal armed groups, the functions they
   performed, and the exploitation they endured. The research argues that
   child recruitment operates as a large-scale labor-market uptake in the
   wartime social order, where the ``employers{''} are paramilitary groups,
   and the labor force, in part, consists of children and adolescents.
   Methodology: This case study relies on different sources of information:
   a database on child recruitment provided by the special Justice and
   Peace Unit of the Colombian Attorney General's Office (989 cases between
   1981 and 2005), sentences of Peace and Justice, testimonials given by
   victims in judicial processes, and semi-structured interviews with
   different actors. Conclusions: The paper shows that child recruitment as
   a form of trafficking is functional to wartime social order in contexts
   of poverty and inequality. There is demand and supply; thus, both girls
   and boys, who worked as soldiers, are not only victims but also agents
   that make decisions in challenging conditions. Therefore, if the
   socioeconomic options for these children, even after their
   demobilization from the armed group, are still a choice between bad and
   worse, joining a violent (no longer ``armed{''} but ``criminal{''})
   group will remain a feasible alternative. Originality: The article
   contributes to the academic literature on a recent topic, such as the
   overlapping between child recruitment and human trafficking in armed
   conflict and post-conflict situations. It also contributes to the
   literature on ``unfree labor,{''} as the study focuses on an actor
   (illegal armed groups) that has not been analyzed until now. Finally,
   the research demonstrates the limits of understanding human trafficking
   (and child recruitment as a form of trafficking) as a problem of
   security or rights entitlement. It highlights the analytical and
   political advantages of categories such as ``unfree labor{''} to provide
   effective solutions for the prevention and reintegration of child
   soldiers.},

Abstract = {Terrorist designation has increasingly become an important
   counterterrorism tool used by intergovernmental organizations and state
   governments. This article examines the determinants of terrorist listing
   and argues that terrorist listing is driven by security as well as
   political concerns. While countries tend to designate groups that pose a
   greater security threat, terrorist listing can also be influenced by
   interstate relationships including alliance ties and state rivalry. We
   test these arguments using a dataset on 35 countries that currently
   maintain their own lists of designated terrorist organizations. Our
   findings show that governments are more likely to list groups that have
   a record of attacking their domestic interests. Domestic groups are more
   likely to be designated than foreign groups. Moreover, countries are
   more likely to designate groups that are designated by their allies,
   even when these groups do not pose a direct threat. Our study
   contributes to the literature on terrorism and more broadly
   international security by systematically examining the determinants of
   terrorist designation and explaining the heterogeneity of terrorist
   lists across countries.},

Abstract = {Air pollutants allegedly originating from China have become a thorny
   issue in South Korea. Despite a neutral view of the topic on the part of
   the South Korean government, recent public polls show a high correlation
   between the air pollution issue and negative sentiment toward China. How
   has the media reported on China regarding air pollutants in South Korea?
   What is the effect of media reports on air pollution on anti-Chinese
   sentiment and foreign policy attitudes? By examining news headlines and
   Twitter data in 2015 and 2018, this work finds that media reports
   blaming China for air pollution doubled during the 2015-2018 period.
   Discourse surrounding air pollution also shifted: negative sentiment
   directed at both the Chinese government and the Chinese people increased
   in 2018 compared to 2015. In addition, an original online survey
   experiment shows that China-blaming articles have a causal effect on
   increasing related resentment, particularly toward Chinese people, and
   that this effect is moderated by age group. Such articles have also had
   negative effects on foreign policy attitudes via increased anti-Chinese
   sentiment; greater hostility toward the Chinese people is found to have
   a causal effect on reduced support for strengthening relations with
   their country.},

Abstract = {This article draws from two cases of participatory budgeting (PB) in
   Poland and Finland to explore PB as an inclusive practice of involving
   children and youth in local governance. Scrutinizing interpretations of
   facilitators involved in the creation of PB, we analyze the motivation
   for incorporating children and youth into governance and how their
   engagement was conducted from the view of ownership. We identify
   ownership as a central element of inclusion when children and young
   people are invited to participate in public matters. Our
   conceptualization distinguishes four analytical dimensions of ownership:
   ownership of (1) process, (2) issue, (3) action produced, and (4)
   decision-making. Additionally, we argue that from the view of PB
   facilitators, encouraging the ownership of children and young people to
   PB involves four functions: carrying out a legally mandated task,
   identifying topical issues, developing tools of support, and
   constructing a motivational link between school and society. We
   highlight that ownership can potentially contribute to the challenges of
   engagement experienced in PB initiatives. However, promoting ownership

   Informants},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 23},
Abstract = {Understanding a potential informant's motivation can lay the foundation
   for managing the risks and opportunities associated with the
   informant-handler relationship and operational deployments. The present
   research explored the self-disclosed and handler-assessed motivations of
   U.K. informants authorized to report against domestic extremists.
   Informants reported being motivated overwhelmingly by both ideological
   and financial considerations. Those reporting on right-wing domestic
   extremism primarily reported for financial reasons, while those
   reporting on left-wing extremism did so primarily for ideological
   reasons. The findings also revealed that motivation is neither one
   dimensional nor unchangeable, with most informants declaring financial
   and ideological reasons for informing. Handlers were accurate at
   identifying informants' primary motivation, with a minority of the
   handler assessments revealing a perceived change after a six-month
   period. By designing recruitment approaches around ideological and
   financial motivational hooks, law enforcement and intelligence agencies
   may increase the probability of recruitment success, as well as enhance
   both the effectiveness and longevity of their informant-handler
   relationship.},

Title = {The genealogy of integrationism: Ideational foundations of the politics
   of immigrant integration},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {This article traces the idea of ({''}immigrant{''}) ``integration{''}
   from its roots in classical political philosophy and the birth of the
   modern nation-state, to its current relevance in the European political
   agenda and, relatedly, its centrality in the newly consolidated field of
   Migration Studies. I examine the ontological (i.e., philosophical and
   sociological) and political rationales behind the idea that migrants
   need to ``integrate into society{''}, and the different varieties of
   political solutions that are offered in this sense. The paper asks: How
   did the migrant come at the center of the idea of an integrated society?
   And how did integrationism become consolidated as the hegemonic idea of
   governing diverse societies in post-migration contexts in Europe?
   Employing an extensive list of secondary literature, documentary data,
   policy analysis of the EU-level Framework on migrant integration, and
   discourse analysis of integration-related research publications, I
   attempt a genealogy of the idea of ``integration{''} as it traveled
   across the North Atlantic West and between academia and government. The
   paper shows how the production of the subject of integration-the misfit
   ``immigrant{''} figure-is historically marked by a consensus across the
   learned and the governing elites that identifies the preservation of a
   homogenous national social order as a societal goal. I argue that the
   scientification of integration governance via the ``evidence-based
   policy{''} paradigm (most notably promoted by EU institutions)
   normalizes, naturalizes and aims to depoliticize the otherwise highly
   normative and contested question of migrant integration.},

Abstract = {A challenge for constitutional processes is to facilitate popular
   participation, including among marginalised groups. Uneven inclusion is
   highly likely `upstream', in the early stages when ground rules and
   foundational principles guiding constitutional change are fleshed out,
   and particularly so in deeply divided societies. This article explores
   the obstacles to such inclusion in constitutional discussion in Northern
   Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit, asking what `other'
   voices (including women's groups, ethnic minorities and youth)
   experience as barriers to participation and how they suggest these
   barriers can be overcome. We categorise barriers as situational,
   emotional and discursive, and show that discursive obstacles are
   experienced as the principal barrier to participation. We argue that an
   inclusive process requires not simply new institutional frameworks and
   agendas for deliberation, but also an overhaul of channels between
   policymakers and grassroots, enabling policymakers to communicate policy
   constraints and facilitating grassroots' critique into policy.},

Abstract = {In liberal democracies, interest groups and political parties constitute
   the primary organizational carriers of citizens' preferences into the
   decision-making of the executive and legislative institutions. While
   political science research has put extensive efforts into understanding
   both channels of representation, their combined effect for citizen
   representation has only recently come into focus. In particular, we lack
   knowledge of the ideological alignment of citizens, parties and interest
   groups on overarching economic Left-Right and socio-cultural dimensions.
   We address this gap via an original cross-national survey of interest
   groups, which includes the self-placement of groups on the Left-Right
   and Gal-Tan dimensions. The configuration of groups on these dimensions
   are compared with Chapel Hill Expert Survey data on parties, and
   information on the preferences of citizens from the European Election
   Studies. Our findings indicate that interest groups have the potential
   to supplement multidimensional gaps in representation between the
   political party system and citizen preferences.},

Abstract = {The Order of Nine Angles (O9A)-a trans-national esoteric Satanist
   movement-is of growing interest to researchers and law enforcement
   because of its apparent connections to violent extremist individuals and
   groups. This article presents a primary source-driven exploration of
   O9A's cosmology, practice, and movement intended to inform objective
   discussions about the movement's nexus to violent extremism, and to help
   readers better understand the terms and concepts contained in O9A texts.
   At the heart of O9A's outlook lies a perspective on human and spiritual
   evolution holding that the true ethos of Western civilization is pagan
   but has been corrupted by Judeo-Christian values. O9A thus believes
   Western society is irredeemable in its present form and seeks to
   inculcate ``heretical `` acts that can break the shackles of
   Judeo-Christian constructs and contribute to societal breakdown. As this
   article establishes, O9A's philosophy and practice have meaningful
   overlaps with violent extremism but clearly identifiable acts of violent
   extremism are less easy to discern at the movement level.},

Abstract = {The counterinsurgency era that dominated American military discussion
   post-9/11 has passed. The desire to move on, particularly since the loss
   of Afghanistan in August 2021, has left unsettled a conversation on
   counterinsurgency that, both among supporters and detractors, was often
   dangerously narrow. Too hastily embraced and too rapidly abandoned,
   counterinsurgency generated false promises and then became the scapegoat
   for poor strategy. This article examines the counterinsurgency era that
   was and demonstrates how fad-like engagement with the topic in both
   military and academic circles subverted the supposed learning process
   taking place. It argues that the lessons from this engagement are mostly
   misleading or at least incomplete, but it also notes that there is
   minimal appetite to look deeper into a topic now deemed toxic. Therein
   lies significant danger.},

Abstract = {In this intervention, we call for extending the critical lens of
   intersectionality to the field of climate justice. We do so by
   identifying the theoretical and methodological links through which
   intersectionality can benefit climate change studies. These include
   common roots in radical theory, a focus on marginalized populations,
   challenging dominant epistemologies and ontologies, similar strategies
   for pursuing social justice, de-emphasizing of positivist methodologies,
   while at the same time deploying similar research methods, embracing
   cross-scalar and spatio-temporal analysis, and strong emphasis on
   interdisciplinarity and cross-sectoral alliances. We conclude with a
   number of potential questions to inform future research on these
   linkages and to encourage fellow scholars to consider what we see as an
   indispensable theoretical and methodological synergy of
   intersectionality and climate justice for a more equitable present and
   future.},

Abstract = {This article recounts the events surrounding the November 2015 Paris and
   March 2016 Brussels attacks, as it follows the Zerkani network that
   perpetrated them and scrutinizes the governance responses therein. It
   demonstrates that the events surrounding the attacks involved law
   enforcement and intelligence from several EU Member States, who failed
   to cooperate adequately, implying that better preparedness and
   cooperation may have yielded different results in tackling the Zerkani
   network and demonstrating the functional necessity of European
   cooperation on counter-terrorism. This article argues that, as a result
   of the failures and missed opportunities preceding and surrounding the
   Paris and Brussels attacks, a European counter-terrorism and
   intelligence culture has developed due to the realization of national CT
   practitioners that cooperation among them was necessary to tackle the
   threat.},

Abstract = {Climate emotions have become an increasingly salient issue since the
   beginning of the 2000s. This paper draws on data from in-depth
   interviews from the United States (USA) and Finland to provide insight
   into the complex dynamics of climate emotions in 23 environmentally
   active young people in these two countries. The analysis centers on two
   main themes: (a) complex dynamics of climate emotions and (b) identities
   and felt social expectations. The results support recent research about
   the importance of anger, grief, and guilt as very common climate
   emotions among active people, although a broad range of emotions was
   recognized by the participants. Some observations were made about the
   role of cultural factors in these two countries. Through this analysis,
   this article contributes to the understanding about the ways in which
   identities and felt social expectations shape climate emotions,
   including feelings of inadequacy and obligation. Analysis of the
   experiences of this limited number of young people shows the prevalence
   of feelings of inadequacy and thus supports the recent arguments about
   the need to provide young people tools to set their responsibility in
   context, in order to avoid negative consequences of the felt pressures.},

Abstract = {The Bolsonaro government combines authoritarianism with a model of
   capitalism that destroys social rights. Despite the expansion of the
   neoliberal reforms put in place during the 1990s and the decline of the
   inclusionary policies of the 2000s, there is a causal link between the
   content of neoliberal public policies, the drop in the level of
   political participation in their implementation, the militarization of
   the Bolsonaro government, and the decay of democratic institutions in
   Brazil. O governo Bolsonaro combina o autoritarismo com um modelo de
   capitalismo destruidor de direitos sociais. Alem do aprofundamento das
   reformas neoliberais dos anos 1990 e da regressao das politicas de
   inclusao dos anos 2000, ha uma relacao de causalidade entre o conteudo
   de politicas publicas neoliberais, a reducao do nivel de participacao
   politica em sua implementacao, a militarizacao do governo Bolsonaro e a

Abstract = {Sustainable Finance Roadmaps (SFRs) have emerged internationally as an
   instrument for sustainable finance reform. However, there is variation
   among countries over who leads the SFR process. This article focuses on
   Aotearoa New Zealand where the process was led by an intermediary, the
   Sustainable Finance Forum, a multistakeholder process which convened
   stakeholders for SFR development. This case study contributes to the
   literature on intermediaries in sustainability transitions by showing
   intermediation in the financial sector. Empirical analysis demonstrates
   that intermediation functioned as a strategic intervention to overcome
   regime-level barriers to transition by visioning, convening and
   coordinating stakeholders, and developing transition pathways, albeit
   with challenges in terms of Maori representation and government
   participation. This case study shows how intermediaries adapted to the
   distinctive demands of early transition phases, especially by a process
   of reproduction where one intermediary created another.},

Abstract = {It is unsurprising that the Red Sea region has come into sharper
   strategic focus for great powers as well as regional powers, given that
   12\% of global seaborne trade, 40\% of Europe's trade with Asia and the
   Middle East, and 8\% of seaborne hydrocarbons pass through the Red Sea.
   Yet the region is chronically underdeveloped and conflict-ridden.
   Overlapping rivalries involving Iran, Israel and the Gulf Cooperation
   Council countries pose risks of intensifying regional discord. The
   United States has prioritised empowering its regional partners and
   strengthening emerging Israel-Gulf security synergies to counteract
   Iran's activities and check China, which has become a key economic actor
   in the region and opened its first overseas military base, in Djibouti,
   in 2017. Given the potential divergence between American and regional
   concerns, however, neither US nor regional involvement appears likely to
   stabilise the region.},

Pages = {105-119},
Abstract = {Over the past 2 or 3 years, the European Commission has been gradually
   introducing further regulations with the ultimate goal of establishing
   European standards for Environmental Social and Governance (ESG)
   reporting. The aim of this paper is to discuss the regulations contained
   in the recently adopted Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive
   (CSRD), which became effective in January 2023 and to provide a deeper
   understanding of the distinctive characteristics of Polish transport
   companies and their value chain relationships with other entities. As an
   introduction to the main provisions of the recently introduced CSRD, the
   authors will first outline its core principles. They will then present
   the fundamental issues related to the value and supply chain and the
   European Commission's (EC) newly introduced notion of the chain of
   activities. The article concludes with recommendations for companies.
   In order to achieve the research objective, the article uses
   quantitative and qualitative research methods. Statistical methods point
   to the importance of Polish transport companies in the European Union.
   Qualitative methods were used to review legislative documents of the
   European Union related to this topic.
   Our findings contribute to growing, but still limited literature on
   European regulations in the area of ESG reporting and impact of these
   regulations on companies.},

Title = {The Transformation of Polish-Ukrainian Relations in the Context of
   Migration Policy Implementation},
Journal = {STUDIA EUROPEJSKIE-STUDIES IN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {133-152},
Abstract = {In 2022, Russia's war against Ukraine shook the world and kickstarted an
   active humanitarian operation to save war-affected Ukrainians. All the
   neighbouring countries of Ukraine were forced to react actively.
   However, the subsequent refugee crisis affected Poland the most.
   Currently, Poland is playing the most important role among the countries
   receiving war refugees from Ukraine, which raises obvious questions
   about future developments and possible future challenges in relations
   between Ukraine and Poland and, above all, migration policy itself.
   The objective of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of
   Poland's policy in the field of accepting refugees and to examine the
   relevant legislation and procedures related to Ukrainian refugees,
   thereby shedding light on the assistance and support mechanisms put in
   place by the Polish authorities. Furthermore, this study seeks to draw
   insightful conclusions regarding the impact of Ukrainian refugees on
   Poland's economic and social spheres, in addition to exploring the
   refugees' integration into various aspects of daily life.
   A critical aspect of this research involves a comparative analysis to
   ascertain whether Poland's policy towards Ukrainian refugees has
   undergone any significant changes since the beginning of the full-scale
   invasion on February 24(th), 2022. This timeline provides a crucial
   backdrop for understanding how evolving geopolitical dynamics may have
   influenced Poland's approach.
   This research employs a multidisciplinary approach,utilising
   acombination of data collection, policy analysis, and an extensive
   review of relevant literature to provide a comprehensive and nuanced
   understanding of the complex issue at hand.},

Abstract = {The effects of climate change over the Arctic region have attracted
   manifold interests in the last decades from several state and non-state
   actors. Due to a flawed institutional capacity to promote a
   multi-stakeholder approach in Arctic affairs, the main governance
   mechanism over the Arctic - the Arctic Council - is incapable of dealing
   with related geopolitical tensions. Based on document analysis and
   specialized literature, we discuss the implications and challenges of
   Brazil-China cooperation over Arctic affairs. We argue that both
   countries have multi-domain interests over the region (science,
   economics, environment, among others) and that such a cooperation can
   serve those interests. We also highlight that engaging in such an
   initiative can create strategic synergies for both countries and
   contribute to their common agenda of geopolitical rebalance of
   international order. Finally, we argue that such a cooperation is
   capable of stimulating an institutional reform of the Arctic Council
   towards a multi-stakeholder approach in the governance, as well as
   advance community interests of this polar area.},

   Union and Selected Neighbouring Countries},

Abstract = {Although Western Balkan economies are still on the list of EU candidates
   or potential candidate countries, they do have some integration with EU
   economies. The EU is the leading trading partner of the Western Balkans
   and is one of the top destinations for the flow of people. The Western
   Balkan economies have been trying to address their populations' ongoing
   emigration (the so-called ``brain drain{''} phenomenon) by implementing
   targeted economic policies. Since one of the main contributors to
   economic growth is the ability to create innovation, it is crucial to
   building innovation potential. The main challenge for innovation policy
   is to provide a favourable environment for entrepreneurship and economic
   growth to create jobs. Thus, this paper aims to examine innovation
   potential - an innovation input - as it creates the conditions needed
   for innovation development. The results of analysing the data (on
   research and development spending, human resources, an environment
   friendly to innovation, and intellectual property rights) indicate that
   the Western Balkan countries are lagging behind the EU in many aspects
   of innovation potential, so they should still develop their strategies
   towards creating higher innovation potential. Thus, they will be able to
   have a higher level of innovation and, as a result, be more competitive
   in economic terms.},

Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Number = {3},
Pages = {492-499},
Abstract = {The article is inspired by a newspaper article by Auke Lont, Harald
   Norvik and Peter Melby in which they proposed that income from future
   oil extraction should be spent on climate measures in other countries
   rather than being deposited in Norway's petroleum fund. The article
   describes Norwegian oil policy from the early 1960s to present. It has
   been very successful and benefited Norway, yet Norwegian oil production
   has also contributed significantly to CO2 emissions. This is the moral
   justification for the suggestion that future Norwegian oil revenues
   should be used on climate measures.},

Title = {Casting a shadow over war zones? Hard truths about the ICC's efforts to
   deter wartime atrocities},

Abstract = {Twenty years after the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
   (ICC or Court) entered into force, the ICC's role in preventing atrocity
   crimes remains controversial, with skeptics arguing that it is
   unrealistic, pessimists that it overlooks the potential of the Court to
   escalate conflicts, and optimists contending that it can work for both
   government and rebel leaders. I argue that during civil wars the ICC is
   only likely to deter rebel forces, given that Court officials are likely
   to have an easier time pursuing their leaders should they commit
   atrocity crimes. This article systematically evaluates these competing
   claims by providing the most extended look yet at the ICC's record in
   African civil wars, the primary focus of the Court's efforts to date. I
   find that existing perspectives do not tell the full story of the ICC's
   impact in war zones. The results suggest that the ICC has failed to
   deter African government forces. However, I uncover highly suggestive
   evidence that the more actions the ICC takes to pursue suspected war
   criminals during ongoing conflicts, the more likely it is to deter
   rebels. Notably, most of these ICC actions have targeted rebels.
   Importantly, I find no indication that the ICC is associated with
   increased civilian killings by either government or rebel forces. With
   the permanent ICC, the shadow of criminal prosecution now extends to
   modern-day conflicts. This study helps to broaden our understanding of
   how and when the ICC might contribute to deterrence.},

Title = {The Human Rights Action Plan and the Representation of Turkey's
   Non-Muslim Minorities},
Journal = {JOURNAL ON ETHNOPOLITICS AND MINORITY ISSUES IN EUROPE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-93},
Abstract = {In March 2021, Turkey's president announced a new Human Rights Action
   Plan (HRAP), supported by the Council of Europe, to reform the judiciary
   system and strengthen democratic participation. Although the human
   rights claims of Kurds and Alevis have been prominent, the HRAP mentions
   neither by name. Instead, it includes articles about improving the
   rights of religious minorities by fighting discrimination and hate and
   to advance pluralism, revising the Foundations Law regarding the
   establishment and election of boards of directors of non-Muslim
   community associations, and providing leave for religious holidays
   regardless of faith. Given the current distrust between non-Muslim
   groups and the Turkish state, this study analysed the political
   attitudes of Turkey's non-Muslim minorities to understand how they
   develop creative solutions to protect their rights. To do so, we
   interviewed Armenian deputies in Turkey's parliament and prominent
   figures from the Greek Orthodox, Armenian, and Jewish communities, and
   also reviewed in-depth the minority deputies' parliamentary work between
   2015 and 2021. We found that the HRAP was widely discussed by both
   minority and opposition parliamentary deputies. However, they did not
   strongly welcome any of its provisions because the government had
   previously ignored or delayed their demands. As a result, while the new
   foundations law announced in June 2022 created hope for democratic
   representation, the law also reflects the Turkish state's historical
   distrust of minorities, and with its constraints on election districts
   the process turned to a bittersweet joy.},

Abstract = {Citizens can either support or resist new tax and/or nontax policies for
   revenue-raising in the budgetary process. The relationship between
   citizens' role , revenue diversification is an important but
   under-researched topic. Therefore, to fill this gap in the existing
   knowledge, this study aims to explore the relationship between citizen
   participation and revenue diversification. Using the 2012 ICMA data
   paired with multiple data sources, this exploration offered empirical
   evidence that citizen participation has significant positive effects on
   the levels of tax and nontax revenue diversification. Further, the
   results confirm that local governments with a commitment to citizen
   participation are more likely to diversify their revenue structures.},
