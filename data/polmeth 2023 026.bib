Abstract = {ASEAN has arguably been one of the most successful regionalisms, which
   since its inception has undergone several profound challenges, including
   the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In response to the fierce competition
   among major powers and the economic and social challenges, ASEAN has
   concentrated on sustainable development to promote unity and centrality.
   Sustainable development cooperation aligns with the interests of ASEAN
   states and helps to promote the construction of the ASEAN community and
   strike a balance of power on the world stage. Nevertheless, there may be
   a need for more efforts to resolve the challenges facing sustainable
   development.},

Abstract = {Established in 1992, the High Commissioner on National Minorities of the
   Organization for Co-operation and Security in Europe has made
   significant contributions to conflict prevention and management in
   multi-ethnic societies. In this article, I trace how, over the three
   decades of its existence, the institution has adopted the notion of
   ``integration with respect for diversity{''} as the guiding principle of
   its work. I demonstrate that successive High Commissioners have relied
   on three main tools in their efforts-mediation and facilitation,
   advising on legislation and policy making, and capacity building-and
   illustrate this approach with examples from across the OSCE area before
   providing two detailed case studies of how the institution has supported
   Kyrgyzstan and Moldova in the development of their respective national
   integration strategies. I conclude that the sustainability of positive
   change that follows from the engagement of the High Commissioner depends
   significantly on the institution's ability to build local capacity to
   manage the process of integration with respect for diversity in the long
   term and with a wide range of national and international governmental
   and non-governmental stakeholders.},

Abstract = {The essay examines Masaryk's notion of enlightened humanism and freedom
   in his Czech Question and Humanistic Ideals, major contributions to
   Czech philosophical discourse of the nineteenth century. The work shows
   that the aim of Masaryk's concept was first of all to complete the
   `unfinished programme' of cultural and political revival of the Czech
   nation and secondly, to resolve the political crisis of that time using
   the `idea of humanism', which Masaryk viewed as the highest metaphysical
   and teleological principle legitimising the meaning of Czech and world
   history, which Masaryk, like Kant, placed above politics, culture,
   science, and law. The work points out that Masaryk's concept also
   pursued another goal: to present a critical analysis of the greatest
   problems of the historical, political, and cultural development of the
   Czech society in the nineteenth century and to outline a programme of
   its reform based on the philosophy of history. Another part of the study
   emphasises that Masaryk highlighted the timeless importance of
   humanistic ideas, pointed to their ethical foundation, and described
   them as ahistorical quantities with universal validity. In conclusion,
   the author emphasises that Masaryk's notion of the `idea of humanism' as
   the philosophical foundation of Czech national revival and modern Czech
   and world history remains valuable and inspiring to this day. As a
   critically thinking author, Masaryk tried to find the political, social,
   and cultural foundations of the development of modern Czech society in
   both the conditional spheres of the secular and historical, as well as
   the unconditional realms of the ideal and metaphysical.},

Abstract = {After conflict, many ex-combatant men experience the spoils of war as
   their rebel groups transition into political parties and elect former
   members to party seats. However, it is unclear whether these
   opportunities are reserved only for male ex-combatants. This article
   considers when and why voters might support former rebel women running
   for political office. It argues that the election of these women will
   depend on their roles within rebel groups, as well as their use of
   violence during conflict. The article presents a novel dataset on the
   election of former rebel women to rebel parties from 1970 to 2020. The
   results indicate that women's roles as combatants and leaders in rebel
   groups are associated with higher levels of election for rebel women. In
   contrast, rebel women's ties to violent tactics such as terrorism and
   sexual violence during war are associated with a lower level of election
   for rebel women after conflict. The interactions between rebel women's
   roles and ties to violence are tested; the results suggested that,
   regardless of elite roles, rebel women's electoral chances are hurt by
   extreme forms of violence, demonstrating the salience of the negative
   stigmas attached to violent women. The findings also demonstrate that
   while many former rebel women are marginalized after war, a select few
   experience political gains.},

Title = {Interactions among national and supranational identities: mobilizing the
   independence movement in Scotland},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 13},
Abstract = {As nationalism rises worldwide, understanding the relevance of national
   identities is at a premium in both the study of mass political behavior
   and the analysis of social movements. Drawing on research in social
   psychology, this study explores interactions among national and
   supranational identities using the concepts of identity interference
   (i.e., negative interactions) and identity complementarity (i.e.,
   positive interactions). These interactions extend beyond the direct
   effects of identity considered in many previous studies. Focusing on
   interactions centers the analysis on the contextual aspects of identity
   during nationalist mobilizations. Survey data from Scotland demonstrate
   that interactions among Scottish, British, and European identities were
   consequential for mobilizing support for Scottish independence in 2019.
   Strong evidence indicates interference between Scottish and British
   identities. European and Scottish identities complement one another
   among independence supporters but not in the general population. The
   possibility of interference between European and British identities is
   backed by only mixed results. The timing of this study in the aftermath
   of the Brexit referendum was likely relevant to its findings on European
   identity. Overall, this research illustrates the benefits of widening
   the empirical examination of multiple identities in the social sciences.},

Abstract = {Coordination mandates are used to steer collective action between local
   government agencies. When higher levels of government allow agencies to
   choose how to work together, the organizational forms and institutional
   arrangements they adopt likely influences their ability to achieve
   mandated coordinated outcomes. How group-level interactions influence
   achievement of coordinated outcomes is not well understood. California's
   Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) provides opportunity to
   shed light on this topic. SGMA is a state-legislative mandate that
   requires local agencies who share groundwater basins to undertake
   groundwater sustainability planning. The mandate affords agencies leeway
   in deciding how they engage with one another so long as they meet
   multiple requirements for coordinated outcomes. Drawing on institutional
   theories of collective action and ethnographic data collected from 2018
   to 2022, we employ multi-value Qualitative Comparative Analysis to
   examine how configurations of organizational forms and institutional
   arrangements adopted by agencies in eighteen groundwater basins
   influenced their achievement of coordinated outcomes. Our findings
   highlight the importance of adopting collaborative institutional
   arrangements. Yet, the specific configuration of collaborative
   institutional arrangements varies depending on the type of coordinated
   outcomes agencies are mandated to achieve. These findings point to the
   need for mandates to require adoption of collaborative institutional
   arrangements, the specific configurations of which will be dictated by
   the requirements of the mandate.},

Abstract = {The full-scale adoption of digital technologies in Filipino social life
   became more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. The abrupt emergence
   of this global catastrophe challenged many to shift to digital
   infrastructures instantaneously, similar to how local government units
   (LCU s) implemented their e-governance initiatives. Following a case
   study design, this article sought to find out how local governments
   carry out digital innovations, specifically the Province of South
   Cotabato which can be considered exemplary in this area based on awards
   it received. A total of 524 Facebook posts, gathered from the first
   quarter of 2021, were examined using quantitative content analysis.
   Findings of this study revealed that the LCU s (city, municipality and
   province) demonstrated ``prioritization,{''} ``appropriation,{''} and
   ``amplification{''} in fulfilling adjunct roles of being public
   administrators and content creators at the same time.},

Abstract = {The article explores the different meanings behind the narratives of
   ``family,{''} ``childcare,{''} and ``child protection{''} in the public
   discourses against the National Strategy for the Child (NSC) 2019-2030
   in Bulgaria. These meanings are seen as reflecting the intertwining and
   cumulative effects of transnational and local influences in the
   anti-gender movement. Using frame analysis as an approach in social
   movement studies, the aim is to analyse the main ideas of the NSC
   opponents-conservative far-right non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
   and citizens who joined the discussion during the public debate on the
   Strategy in January 2019. We differentiate between the discourses of the
   NGOs and the critical citizens, paying attention to the way they use the
   narrative of return-return to traditional family forms and child-rearing
   models. The conservative NGOs declared themselves to be defenders of
   Bulgarian children and families against the liberal policies of the
   European Union (EU) and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
   (LGBT) lobbies. The citizens' discourse is directed against the
   child-centred philosophy of the Strategy, seen as a threat to both the
   children themselves and parents' rights, but rarely mentions LGBT and
   gendering as a danger. The discussion revealed the deep distrust of
   citizens and parents towards the state and its institutions, which was
   amplified and instrumentalized by the far-right NGOs who mobilized and
   organized a mass social movement against the Strategy.},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This paper aims to map out a framework for thinking critically about
   race and coloniality in policymaking, through utilizing what I am
   calling a reparative public policy procedural approach. Demands for
   reparations have long aimed to address racialized inequalities set up
   through slavery, genocide and colonialism. Yet while being sort as an
   outcome of public policy by those impacted by colonization, slavery and
   genocide, reparations can also inform the process of policy making in
   liberal democracies. Through drawing on insights from the literature on
   reparations, I seek to illuminate the way coloniality and racism are
   written into aspects of liberal democratic policymaking, but also how a
   reparatiive approach to public policy making can help policy makers in
   liberal democracies find ways to challenge and transform such practice.
   This is what I am calling a reparative public policy approach - a
   framework for policymakers that draws attention to a presumed neutrality
   of policy-making processes which are maintained through methodological
   nationalism, deployment of liberal time, accumulation through
   dehumanization and racialization, and the universalism of liberal
   democratic governance.},

Abstract = {The role of online discussions in rallying investors has been
   highlighted by the GameStop frenzy of 2021. We know little, however,
   about the effect of online discussions on investor survivorship.
   Previous studies have emphasized the role of communication with respect
   to market entry, but not with respect to market survival. Survivorship
   studies, in turn, have largely focused on the role of financial factors
   in the investors' decision to quit trading, but have not investigated so
   far how social interactions and communication impact the decision to
   quit or stay. Using a dataset covering 1.1 million observations for
   4,731 traders over 18 months, we examine the role of online discussions
   in traders' decisions to stay in the market. We find that traders who
   actively engage in them tend to be 16 per cent to 30 per cent less
   likely to quit trading. We identify a positive Granger-causal
   relationship between online discussions and the probability of survival.
   Our results are robust to alternative measures of communication and
   different sets of control variables. Based on this evidence, we draw
   attention to the necessity of studying the nexus between finance and
   social media as an important component of platform capitalism.},

Abstract = {Previous research claims that `the most significant risk' to achieving
   climate change mitigation goals is the `governance trap', whereby
   governments and the public attribute responsibility for action to one
   another. While it is well documented that individuals call for political
   action on climate change, there is limited knowledge about how
   politicians attribute responsibility for climate change mitigation. The
   present study examines whether there is evidence of a `governance trap'
   in Norway, by using two online surveys to compare how politicians (N =
   1211) and the population (N = 2030) attribute responsibility for climate
   change mitigation to individuals, the local and regional authorities,
   the national authorities, the international community, and business and
   industry. Contrary to expectations, politicians and the population
   attribute responsibility to the actors in the same order. Thereby, the
   study contests the assumption that governments attribute primary
   responsibility for climate change mitigation to the population.},

Title = {Public perception of terrorism attacks: A conjoint experiment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Abstract = {In democratic societies, governments cannot act in isolation from public
   opinion. This is especially true regarding terrorism, where public
   perception is the instrument targeted by terrorists to achieve their
   political goals. Nevertheless, governments must also be able to resist
   public pressure and preserve individual rights. All this suggests that
   researching public perception of terrorist attacks is crucial. We make
   an important contribution in this direction by measuring the importance
   the public assigns to various attributes of terrorist attacks. Using
   novel methodology (conjoint experiment) and survey data from the UK and
   The Netherlands (N = 6,315), we find that people are concerned with
   attacks by immigrants (in the Netherlands), and by individuals acting as
   part of a terror cell, and with jihadist motivation. Furthermore, past
   experience with specific terrorist tactics drive preference to address
   such attacks more than others. In both countries people strongly focus
   on the severity of attacks, and under-weigh probabilities. The terror
   attack in the Netherlands in 2019 provided an opportunity to examine
   perception right after an actual attack. Also there we have found that
   people's concerns are driven by experience with specific attacks. A
   better understanding of terrorism perception can inform policymakers
   about the gap between optimal strategies to combat terrorism and the
   expectations of the public.},

Abstract = {The article argues for a revised research on behavioral public policy
   focused on the core claim and sine qua non of a behavioral
   ``revolution{''}: the ability to produce equal or better outcomes with
   less stringent policy designs than in traditional solutions, at least
   for certain types of problems. Three contributions to such an agenda are
   proposed. First, the article argues that the growing focus on the
   evaluation of real-world behavioral policy programs, as opposed to
   experimental studies within specialized areas of research, calls for a
   corresponding theoretical orientation toward existing literature on
   policy tools and design. Second, a doctrine of policy design is
   extrapolated from the broader behavioral paradigm and specified in
   relation to four general areas of application. These provide an
   essential context for the evaluation of the behavioral claim to improved
   policy design and highlight that behavioral successes may well, contra
   this claim, be a result of a de facto increase in stringency vis-a-vis
   traditional responses. Third, the article proposes a new and
   substantially revised inventory of the behavioral toolbox, which
   specifies the stringency, mechanisms, and potential costs of different
   behavioral tools and techniques, which is both essential to the
   evaluation of the behavioral claim and necessary to overcome the
   arbitrariness and mistakes of existing inventories.},

Abstract = {Hamas launched its shocking infiltration of Israel and massacre of
   Israelis exactly a half century after the surprise attack by Egyptian
   and Syrian forces on Yom Kippur in 1973. The parallels with respect to
   America's role, however, are potentially misleading. While strongly
   supporting Israel, the Biden administration has tried to summon the
   political imagination and diplomatic patience to conjure a better future
   from disaster - something the Nixon administration and its successors
   managed to do in the 1970s. But 50 years with no net progress on the
   Palestinian question have left Israel, and by extension the US, with
   fewer sympathisers. The longer this war continues and the more civilians
   it kills, the greater the reputational damage to both countries. Whether
   the US and its allies can emerge from the Gaza crisis in a stronger
   position - as they did from the Yom Kippur War - is a question at which
   history can only hint.},

Abstract = {Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) to post-conflict countries is
   difficult. After conflict ends, governments struggle to perfectly
   enforce the institutions which otherwise shield investors from political
   instability. Reflecting this governance problem, this article presents a
   new explanation linking United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operations to
   subnational allocations of FDI in post-conflict countries. I
   specifically argue that deployments of UN peacekeeping police credibly
   signal to foreign firms where future political instability is least
   likely to disrupt their operations. Data from Liberia's extractive
   sector support my argument. Increasing the local deployment of UN police
   encourages foreign firms to establish new natural resource concessions,
   particularly in areas where the government's capacity to uphold the rule
   of law is weak.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyse the relationship between
   Qatar's foreign policy and foreign aid in the Horn of Africa (HoA), with
   a particular focus on Somalia. Since the 2017 blockade, the HoA has
   become increasingly important to Qatar's foreign policy and aid efforts,
   intensifying political and economic competition with other Gulf players.
   This research describes Qatar's foreign policy strategies and tools in
   the HoA from 2011 to 2021, observing the evolution of humanitarian aid
   interventions in Somalia and the impact of Gulf competition in the
   country. The research aims to combine neoclassical realism with
   small-state theory in the analysis of foreign aid, examining Qatari
   foreign aid interventions in Somalia as a foreign policy tool for
   exercising autonomy and as an outcome of the Qatari elites'
   decision-making process.},

Abstract = {Schedule C and noncareer Senior Executive Service positions hold
   significant influence over policy outcomes, yet they have received
   limited scrutiny compared to advise and consent (PAS) appointments. Such
   appointments offer understudied avenues for presidential control over
   the bureaucracy. Through a comprehensive analysis of more detailed data
   than has been employed to date, we reveal that these appointments are
   responsive to broader political dynamics, particularly those relevant to
   PAS appointments, including inter- and intrabranch conflicts, agency
   ideology, Senate workload, and the political calendar. However,
   statutory constraints and agency characteristics - such as the
   managerial expertise of appointed agency leadership - also shape their
   utilization. While unilateral appointments provide an advantage to
   Presidents, executives are constrained when using them to overcome
   legislative opposition or reshape resistant agencies. These lower-level
   appointments reflect the wider political landscape, granting the
   President significant - but not unrestrained - opportunities to exert
   influence on both the bureaucracy and policy outcomes.},

Abstract = {Realist thinkers in political philosophy often criticize ideal theorists
   for neglecting or eliminating the fact of politics in their work. This
   is supposed to be problematic because we should never expect to overcome
   politics. Any theory that attempts to do so is said to be unrealistic,
   naive, and impractical. Although much has been said in the dispute
   between realists and ideal theorists in recent years, this particular
   line of criticism, which should be distinguished from other criticisms
   of ideal theory, has not been clearly or explicitly addressed by ideal
   theorists in the literature. I deal with this issue by examining the
   ideal theory of John Rawls, which has been a prominent target of realist
   criticisms. My aim is to see where politics exists, or might exist, in
   Rawls's theory, and whether this politics satisfactorily answers to the
   various aspects of the realist's critique. My analysis suggests that
   there may be no inherent or necessary conflict between ideal theory and
   real politics, after all.},

Abstract = {What motivates rebel groups to engage with international humanitarian
   actors? We argue that international humanitarian engagement with rebels
   will likely emerge when rebels seek domestic legitimacy vis-a-vis
   civilians as well as the government. Two indicators of domestic
   legitimacy-seeking rebels are particularly relevant. One is socially
   based rebel governance with civilian-connecting experiences. The other
   is modulated political incentives vis-a-vis the government. The case of
   United Nations Action Plans aimed at reducing child soldiering is the
   empirical domain, the lens through which we illustrate the phenomenon
   and process of humanitarian engagement with rebels. By tracing the
   engagement trajectory of three rebel groups in the Philippines, we show
   that rebels seeking domestic legitimacy with specific governance
   experiences are more likely to accept engagement with international
   actors than other types. Our study has implications for rebel
   governance, humanitarian politics, and violence-restraint in civil
   conflicts worldwide.},

Abstract = {The recent epistemological turn in populism studies has produced many
   valuable insights pertaining to populist knowledge practices, conspiracy
   theories, information bubbles, and cognitive biases. However, various
   elements of populist epistemology are still studied separately, and
   there are no common theoretical assumptions that would arrange them into
   a comprehensive epistemic theory of populism. Thus, apart from
   presenting a preliminary mapping of recent changes in the field, the
   article proposes a basic theoretical framework for an epistemic approach
   to studying populism by conceptualising populism as a set of epistemic
   interventions: discursive and non-discursive practices that construe the
   people as a political subject and result in the emergence of a populist
   epistemic community. The article discusses how the latter concept may
   help to link discursive, performative, communicative, and cognitive
   elements of populism, along with describing key features of populist
   epistemic communities and indicating possible directions for future
   research on populist epistemology.},

Title = {Resource nationalism and energy transitions in lower-income countries:
   the case of Tanzania},

Abstract = {As the world approaches the 2030 year marker for the implementation of
   17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as defined by the United
   Nations, the global urgency for sustainable and energy sources grows.
   Lower-income countries, however, confront a choice between cleaner
   energy and ensuring cheap and reliable energy. This raises the question
   of how some countries can find a balance between meeting their global
   climate change commitments and meeting urgent energy generation needs.
   This article uses resource nationalism as a lens to examine Tanzania's
   energy transition dynamics. It seeks to understand why renewable sources
   such as wind and solar have been promoted in government policy but have
   not attracted much developmental support and investment. The authors
   argue that resource nationalism provides context within which to
   understand why the state has been quick to promote energy projects
   (notably geothermal, coal, natural gas and hydroelectric) where it has
   direct investment interests, as opposed to large wind and solar projects
   where private - often foreign - investors are dominant.
   A l'approche de l'echeance de 2030 pour la mise en oe uvre des 17
   objectifs de developpement durable (ODD) definis par les Nations unies,
   il devient de plus en plus urgent de trouver des sources d'energie
   durables. Les pays a faible revenu sont toutefois confrontes a un choix
   entre une energie plus propre et la garantie d'une energie bon marche et
   fiable. Cela souleve la question de savoir comment certains pays
   oscillent entre leurs engagements mondiaux en matiere de changement
   climatique et la satisfaction des besoins urgents en matiere de
   production d'energie. Cet article utilise le nationalisme des ressources
   comme grille d'analyse pour examiner la dynamique de la transition
   energetique en Tanzanie. Elle cherche a comprendre pourquoi les sources
   renouvelables telles que l'energie eolienne et solaire ont ete promues
   dans la politique gouvernementale mais n'ont pas attire beaucoup
   d'investissements ou de soutien au developpement. Nous soutenons que le
   nationalisme des ressources fournit un contexte permettant de comprendre
   pourquoi l'etat s'est empresse de promouvoir des projets energetiques
   (notamment la geothermie, le charbon, le gaz naturel et
   l'hydroelectricite) dans lesquels il a des interets d'investissement
   directs, par opposition aux grands projets eoliens et solaires dans
   lesquels les investisseurs prives - souvent etrangers - sont dominants.
   A medida que o mundo se aproxima do marco de 2030 para a implementacao
   dos 17 Objetivos de Desenvolvimento Sustentavel (ODS), conforme definido
   pelas Nacoes Unidas, a urgencia global por fontes sustentaveis e de
   energia cresce. No entanto, os paises de rendimentos mais baixos
   confrontam-se com a escolha entre uma energia mais limpa e a garantia de
   energia barata e fiavel. Isto levanta a questao de como alguns paises se
   equilibram entre os compromissos globais em materia de alteracoes
   climaticas e a satisfacao das necessidades urgentes de producao de
   energia. Este artigo usa o nacionalismo de recursos como lente para
   analisar a dinamica da transicao energetica da Tanzania. Procura
   compreender por que razao as fontes renovaveis, como a eolica e a solar,
   tem sido promovidas nas politicas governamentais, mas nao tem atraido
   muito apoio e investimento para o desenvolvimento. Argumentamos que o
   nacionalismo de recursos fornece o contexto para entender por que o
   Estado tem sido rapido em promover projetos de energia (notadamente
   geotermica, carvao, gas natural e hidreletrica) onde tem interesses de
   investimento direto, em oposicao a grandes projetos eolicos e solares
   onde os investidores privados - muitas vezes estrangeiros - sao
   dominantes.},

Abstract = {For a long time, Taiwan was confined to being an object of the EU's
   China policy, but the EU increasingly treats Taiwan as a partner in its
   own right. EU-Taiwan relations are in their most dynamic stage since the
   EU opened its representative office in Taipei in 2003. But the `One
   China policy' still constrains EU-Taiwan relations, as the EU only
   recognizes the People's Republic of China as a sovereign state and not
   Taiwan. The article analyzes EU-Taiwan relations through the lens of
   Normative Power Europe. Taiwan has gained more attention and support in
   the EU, because Taiwan is Asia's most liberal democracy. Furthermore,
   Taiwan also fits well into the EU's geo-economic strategy of de-risking.
   China's increasingly aggressive policy towards Taiwan and strong support
   from the United States for Taiwan strengthen the EU's support for
   Taiwan, too.},

Abstract = {Since the UNFCCC Paris Agreement came into force after 2015
   international climate policy rests on three pillars: mitigation,
   adaptation and loss and damage. However, while there are clear
   agreed-upon metrics to measure emissions, base mitigation goals against
   and hold countries and companies accountable to, the evidence base for
   the impacts of climate change to inform adaptation and loss and damage
   is very different. There are no agreed-upon metrics, nor are there
   guidelines or criteria to delineate the impacts of climate change from
   other drivers of losses and damages. This imbalance is reflected in the
   lack of ability to set and enforce goals. With a new body of scientific
   evidence introduced in the IPCC, we argue that this can change.
   Especially with an increasing number of climate litigation cases being
   recognised as a legitimate root to justice, and thus being given due
   consideration in courts, the imbalance in evidence could change and put
   adaptation and loss and damage on more equal footing with mitigation.},

Abstract = {In recent years, scholars have grappled with the risks and conditions of
   nuclear-conventional entanglement. One of the examples of entanglement
   discussed in the academic literature is U.S. nuclear command and control
   satellites, which have historically served both nuclear and conventional
   missions. From 2017 to 2019, the U.S. Air Force made a series of
   programmatic decisions that would, at least in part, reverse this
   entanglement, separating nuclear from non-nuclear spacecraft. This
   reversal of nuclear-conventional entanglement in outer space poses
   strategic consequences, but it was less a strategic choice made by U.S.
   leadership than the result of acquisition reforms and bureaucratic
   dynamics.},

Title = {Defaulting Differently: The Political Economy of Sovereign Debt
   Restructuring Negotiations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {Negotiations to restructure sovereign debt are protracted affairs, and
   their outcomes, known as ``haircuts,{''} range from 0 to 80 percent
   creditor losses. Haircuts impact states' ability to borrow, cost of
   borrowing, and economic recovery; they also redistribute income-between
   states and creditors and between domestic interest groups. I
   conceptualize the interaction between governments and private creditors
   as a bargaining game where the government's will to repay is private
   information. Creditors can make inferences about repayment based on the
   government's political economy, but distributional signals are muddled
   when there are multiple veto players. Where additional uncertainty
   persists, governments can issue a public declaration of default,
   triggering costs in international financial markets. This costly signal
   separates governments that are willing to repay from those that are not
   and extorts greater concessions as a result. Using data on haircuts and
   public default declarations in market-based restructurings from 1980 to
   2009, I find that governments are more likely to engage in costly
   signaling when they face heightened domestic constraints. When
   governments issue public declarations, they are subsequently rewarded
   with higher haircuts. Defaults do not all look the same, and the
   economic consequences are varied.},

Abstract = {The article explores EU sectoral integration in the Eastern
   Neighbourhood. It shows that extant approaches to explaining EU
   meso-level engagement with third countries - differentiated integration
   and functional cooperation - fall short of capturing all dynamics at
   play. Drawing on the literature of `Europeanisation,' it develops a
   novel conceptual framework for the study of EU sectoral integration
   entailing four avenues - rules, institutions, practices and knowledge -
   and two features - local ownership and cross-fertilisation. Through an
   in-depth empirical study of Frontex-Moldova relations, the article
   demonstrates that engagement in border management remains below the
   threshold of differentiated integration by precluding institutional
   inclusion but reaches beyond functional cooperation through combining
   integration concerning practices and knowledge. Furthermore, unlike
   differentiated integration, it allows for local ownership, and contrary
   to functional cooperation, it enables cross-fertilisation, even if these
   features are absent from the macro-level cooperation context. Thus, the
   article contributes to the refinement of the theoretical framework of
   European integration.},

Abstract = {As this special issue looks at how the pandemic has changed research
   practice in the fieldwork, this article looks at how the ``Covid-19
   effect{''} integrated ethnographic research in Tunisia. This article
   addresses the challenges related to the pandemic in Tunisia, to
   reconstruct the context that favored the implementation of certain
   research strategies. In this frame, this study presents six virtual
   interactions with six pious Muslim women recruited through the
   ``snowball{''} method. There were a pious woman from the Imam Malik
   Quranic Association contacted via Facebook, two qa'idhat from the
   non-electoral party Hizb ut-Tahrir and three wa'idhat, officials from
   the Ministry of Religious Affairs, interviewed by telephone. Finally,
   this article reflects on the possibility of conducting ethnography in
   times of pandemic, and focuses on the opportunities of conducting
   virtual interviews.},

Abstract = {Around the world, we witness not only growing levels of economic
   inequality but also the rise of protests whereby people from different
   social classes are demanding a more equal society. Our research uses a
   person-centered approach to examine subgroups of participants in a
   social movement against inequality on the basis of their social class,
   intention to participate in conventional and/or radical collective
   actions, and social identification with the movement. We used
   longitudinal data from the Chilean student movement (two time points;
   total N = 1226) to conduct latent profile and latent transition
   analysis. We identified four profiles of participants: (1) inactive
   supporters (mostly from the upper class), (2) low radicals (mostly from
   the middle class), (3) moderate radicals (mostly from the middle class),
   and (4) high radicals (mostly from the middle class). The four profiles
   were generally stable over the one-year period. We further found that
   group efficacy and a ``nothing to lose{''} mindset predicted the profile
   membership of participants. Group efficacy also predicted transitions of
   participants between different profiles. Our findings highlight the key
   role that the middle class plays in diverse forms of collective action.},

Abstract = {With current global issues that destroy people's hope and create fear,
   public policy should become more emotionally sensitive. We argue that,
   under the umbrella of critical policy studies, incorporating
   interpretive policy inquiry into the policy process helps promote
   emotionally sensitive public policy that can increase hope to cope with
   fear. Accordingly, we propose a framework for fostering an empathetic
   policy process. The framework shifts the focus from expert knowledge of
   problems and solutions to the shared fearful and hopeful feelings and
   wishful and willful intentions. This article illustrates the
   operationalization of this policy framework through the Chiang Mai City
   Lab program (Thailand) case that attempted to address hope and fear
   through public policy in response to COVID-19. Although the practice
   cannot transform the techno-authoritarian policy culture here, we can
   draw lessons from articulating new narratives and emotionally sensitive
   methods in real-world policy.},

Abstract = {This article revisits the right to development (R2D) paradigm. It
   conceptu-alizes development using a rights-based model, noting the
   failure of the conventional paradigm that focuses one-sidedly on
   economic growth. It interrogates the dialectics on the existence of a
   R2D, with its correlative duty-bearers, under particular international
   law, with rigorous analysis of some global instruments. The article also
   interrogates the related concept of international cooperation under the
   UN Charter and other primary legal instruments. It notes the modest
   strides in the long advocacy for the recognition of a R2D but suggests a
   shift in the current paradigm in rec-ognition of the multidimensional
   realities in the international landscape.},

Abstract = {Assessing the impact of Brexit involves disentangling the extensive and
   complex web of rules and relations that developed over decades of EU
   membership and integration, as well as analysing the effects on
   businesses, citizens, and the state. For scholars, the exercise is all
   the more challenging because Brexit has been a `moving target'.
   Nevertheless, what does emerge is the transformational reach of Brexit
   for the UK, with implications for its polity, politics, and policies.
   The UK seems at a crossroads. Relations with the devolved
   administrations will need to be rethought even as the Westminster model
   appears reinforced. The UK is still grappling with balancing newfound
   regulatory autonomy and managing divergence from the EU, and its role in
   the world is still in flux. For the EU, Brexit did not transform into a
   full blown existential (disintegrative) crisis. It still faces potential
   existential crises, but these are not because of Brexit.},

Abstract = {Social media has become an outlet for extremists to fundraise and
   organize. While governments deliberate on how to regulate, some social
   media companies have removed creators of offensive content
   -deplatforming. I estimate the effects of deplatforming on revenue and
   viewership, using variation in the timing of removals across two
   video-streaming companies - YouTube, and its far-right competitor,
   Bitchute. Being deplatformed on Youtube results in a 30\% increase in
   weekly Bitcoin revenue and a 50\% increase in viewership on Bitchute.
   This increase in Bitchute activity is less than that on YouTube, meaning
   that deplatforming works in decreasing a content creator's overall views
   and revenue.},

Abstract = {Secret police are generally viewed as key institutions in autocrats'
   repression apparatus. However, we lack clear empirical evidence on the
   link between secret police and repression. Instead, recent studies
   indicate that the surveillance provided by secret police reduces
   physical human rights abuses. This paper re-examines the relationship
   between secret police and physical state repression. We identify four
   mechanisms linking these variables, deterrence, targeting,
   organizational practices, and institutional self-preservation. These
   mechanisms provide contrasting expectations for the overall relationship
   but also contextual expectations on when secret police may (not)
   increase repression. To test these expectations, we collect data on the
   global existence of secret police. Results indicate that secret police
   are associated with increased physical repression, particularly when
   they must develop a reputation to deter dissidents or when multiple
   rival security organizations exist. In contrast, older, more established
   secret police or ones without institutional rivals are not associated
   with physical repression.},

Abstract = {In late developing states, labor markets are often segmented as a result
   of import substitution and political coalitions centered on the formally
   employed. Building on insider-outsider and moral economy frameworks from
   political economy, we theorize that in such contexts labor market
   insiders develop strong expectations about welfare provision and public
   transfers that make them more likely to riot against proposed austerity
   measures. We test our argument with the case of Egypt during the 1977
   Bread Intifada, when the announcement of subsidy cuts sparked rioting
   across the country. To conduct our analysis, we match an original event
   catalog compiled from Arabic-language sources with disaggregated
   employment data. Spatial models, rich micro-level data, and the sudden
   and short-lived nature of the rioting help us to disentangle the
   importance of an area's labor force from its location and wider
   socio-economic context. As we show, despite the diffuse impact of the
   subsidy cuts, rioting was especially concentrated in areas with labor
   market insiders - and this is after accounting for a range of plausible
   alternative explanations. The results suggest that moral economies
   arising from labor market segmentation can powerfully structure violent
   opposition to austerity.},

Title = {The Imagined City: Great Flood of 1997 as a Foundation Story of Wroclaw},
Journal = {EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-51},

Abstract = {Wroclaw started its existence on the ruins of German Breslau, several
   dozen years ago, as a result of the Potsdam Conference. The article is a
   voice in the discussion about the situation of the city, which, deprived
   of the possibility to draw on its foreign cultural heritage (the
   existence of which was ignored in official studies), still struggles
   with the problem of defining its identity. I present this issue, based
   on the actions taken by the elites since the beginning of the Polish
   city of Wroclaw. These elites have been creating successive narrative
   ``identity projects{''} for Wroclaw's citizens. The main thread of my
   analysis is the city's foundation story, built in relation to the flood
   that Wroclaw experienced in 1997. According to this story, the fight
   against the water flooding the city became a watershed moment in the
   city's history; it was a shock, thanks to which the citizens of Wroclaw
   finally became conscious citizens, felt an emotional bond with their
   city and took responsibility for the testimonies of its pre-war,
   non-Polish past. All this happened several decades after creating
   Wroclaw in 1945 and promoting, for decades, its unquestionable
   Polishness. I confront this foundation story with the image of this
   flood that emerges from the statements of ordinary residents of the
   city. The flood of 1997, as seen by ordinary citizens of Wroclaw, is
   built from memories of the mundane but acute impediments of everyday
   life, neighbourly support and post-flood waste.},

Abstract = {Objective/context: This article examines attitudes towards gender quotas
   by right-wing leadership in Chile and assesses gender gaps in supporting
   affirmative action. Methodology: The study uses original data from a
   survey of leaders of Chile Vamos, a right-wing political alliance in
   Chile. A series of logistic models with finite-sample corrections are
   estimated to examine the attitudes of right-wing leaders towards gender
   quotas and support for affirmative action policies. The models control
   for various demographic and political factors that may affect attitudes
   towards affirmative action. Conclusions: The findings for right-wing
   women in Chile are similar to those for Northern democracies. Right-wing
   elites show a significant gender gap on issues related to affirmative
   action and gender equality. Right-wing women are more likely to support
   affirmative action policies than their male counterparts. Originality:
   Quotas increase women's autonomy and recognize that women are
   historically disadvantaged. The findings of this article support the
   importance of descriptive representation to the extent that attitudes of
   right-wing women differ significantly on issues close to their gender.},

Abstract = {We combine two dominant approaches to studying how issues influence
   elections: one that emphasizes parties' issue positions, and the other
   parties' issue ownership. Research from the latter approach shows that
   voters ascribe greater economic competence to right-wing parties. Based
   on this finding, we argue that parties enhance their economic issue
   ownership when voters perceive them shifting to the right. In the
   following step, we show that perceived rightward shifts of parties also
   lead to subsequent increases in electoral support. We analyze economic
   ownership survey data and election outcomes in 15 democracies over the
   period 1986-2015 that supports the expectations that parties' perceived
   rightward shifts result in increases in economic ownership and
   subsequent vote shares. We also show that the right-shift vote gains are
   strongest during recessions when voters prioritize parties' economic
   competence.},

Abstract = {This paper exploits the sharp escalation of violence in Colombia in the
   1980s associated with the emergence of drug cartels to provide novel
   evidence on the long-run effects of violence exposure throughout the
   life-course, on children's educational attainment and academic
   achievement using administrative data. I find that, a higher homicide
   rate in early-childhood is associated with a higher probability of
   school dropout and conditional on completing high school, lower scores
   on a national end-of-high school exam. Results are robust to several
   falsification tests, and analyses of potential sources of selection
   bias. I provide supportive evidence that changes in fetal, child, and
   adolescent health outcomes are important potential mechanisms.},

Abstract = {In governance networks, some actors might have more influence than
   others in the group's collective decision-making. This paper
   investigates whether an actor's prosocial and/or self-interested
   motivations to participate in a governance network help predict its
   level of influence in the group. We argue that information exchange is
   an important mediator in this relationship because an actor's tendency
   to actively diffuse information will depend on its motivations; while
   other participants being exposed to information from an actor are likely
   to increase the actor's influence on them. Using a unique relational
   dataset from 10 anti-corruption multi-stakeholder partnerships (MSPs) in
   Latin America, Africa and Eurasia, we find that self-interested actors,
   rather than prosocially motivated ones, take the lead in
   information-exchange activities. The data also shows how this central
   role in turn increases perceived influence of self-interested actors
   among other participants, conditioning potentially the direction of
   agreed-upon collective objectives.},

Abstract = {While emotions are an inherent component of the human experience that
   influence behavior, values, and beliefs, they have largely been left out
   of policy process studies theoretically and methodologically. Using the
   Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), with its focus on how individuals
   coalesce into coalitions around a set of common beliefs, we begin to
   situate emotions as a critical component of belief systems and discourse
   about public policies. This study analyzes legislative testimony from
   four policies debated during the 2021 Colorado Legislative Session using
   discourse analysis to identify the emotions and coalitional beliefs. We
   find that policy actors express emotions and beliefs similarly to other
   policy actors in the same coalition and differently from policy actors
   in the opposing coalition. We conclude this paper by discussing the
   theoretical and methodological contributions of including emotions in
   the ACF. The move to incorporate the analysis of emotional expressions,
   and hence the study of affect, into the ACF mirrors the ongoing
   incorporation of how people feel in politics and not just how they
   think.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the ``politics of experts{''}-or the struggle
   between scientific advisers to gain visibility and influence-in the
   early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and the UK. Modifying
   classic studies of policy communities of interest groups and civil
   servants, we classify relevant policy experts in the two countries into
   the following categories: ``core insiders,{''} ``specialist
   insiders,{''} ``peripheral insiders,{''} and ``outsiders.{''} Within
   these categories, we distinguish between ``high-profile{''} and
   ``low-profile{''} experts, depending on media exposure. The comparison
   between the UK and Italian cases helps to identify how actors interpret
   and follow formal and informal ``rules of the game.{''} We identify a
   contest between experts to influence policy with reference to two
   competing ``rules of the game.{''} The first set of rules comes from
   government, while the second comes from science advice principles. These
   rules collide, such as when governments require secrecy and
   nonconfrontation and scientists expect transparency and independent
   criticism. Therefore, experts face dilemmas regarding which rules to
   favor: some accept the limits to their behavior to ensure insider
   access; others are free to criticize the policies that they struggle to
   influence.},

Abstract = {From late August to early December 1990, Iraq held hundreds of Western
   and Japanese civilians at strategic sites as ``human shields{''} against
   the Gulf War coalition. While there is a consensus that these foreign
   nationals would have influenced the coalition's offensive had they not
   been released before the onset of hostilities, their impact remains
   poorly understood. This note draws on newly available archival records,
   among other sources, to throw new light on this old question. The record
   shows that leaders were reconciled with the prospect of hostage
   casualties and the expected political fallout. Military necessity and
   limited intelligence about the hostages' whereabouts precluded avoiding
   every shielded target. At the same time, public opinion was divided on
   the hostage problem, especially in the United States. In response,
   leaders planned to take special precautionary measures and mount a
   rescue operation in Kuwait City. These measures, overall, appeared to
   exceed those employed for other targets, and exposed coalition forces to
   additional risks. US decision-makers may also have been motivated by the
   belief that proceeding undeterred could discourage others from resorting
   to the same stratagem in the future. The findings advance research on
   the Gulf War and the problem of human shields in war.
   Desde finales de agosto hasta principios de diciembre de 1990, Irak
   mantuvo a cientos de civiles occidentales y japoneses en lugares
   estrategicos para que sirvieran como \& DLANGBRAC;escudos humanos \&
   drangbrac; contra la coalicion de la guerra del golfo. Aunque existe un
   consenso de que estos ciudadanos extranjeros habrian tenido influencia
   sobre la ofensiva de la coalicion si no hubieran sido liberados antes
   del inicio de las hostilidades, sigue sin existir un claro entendimiento
   sobre el impacto que tuvieron estos ciudadanos. Este articulo se basa en
   registros de archivo que han quedado disponibles recientemente, entre
   otras fuentes, con el fin de arrojar una nueva luz sobre esta vieja
   pregunta. Los registros demuestran que los lideres habian aceptado la
   perspectiva de bajas de rehenes y las consecuencias politicas esperadas.
   La necesidad militar, asi como la limitada informacion sobre el paradero
   de los rehenes, impidieron evitar todos los objetivos protegidos. Al
   mismo tiempo, la opinion publica estaba dividida sobre el problema de
   los rehenes, especialmente en los Estados Unidos. Como respuesta, los
   lideres planearon tomar medidas especiales de precaucion y organizar una
   operacion de rescate en la ciudad de Kuwait. Estas medidas, en general,
   parecian exceder las empleadas para otros objetivos y exponian a las
   fuerzas de la coalicion a riesgos adicionales. Los responsables
   estadounidenses de las decisiones pudieron tambien haber estado
   motivados por la creencia de que proceder de forma decidida podria
   desalentar a otros de recurrir a la misma estratagema en el futuro. Las
   conclusiones proporcionan avances acerca de la investigacion sobre la
   guerra del golfo y el problema de los escudos humanos en la guerra.
   Entre fin aout et debut decembre 1990, l'Irak a detenu des centaines
   d'Occidentaux et de Japonais a des emplacements strategiques comme \&
   DLANGBRAC; boucliers humains \& drangbrac; pour se proteger de la
   coalition de la guerre du Golfe. Bien qu'il existe un consensus sur le
   fait que ces ressortissants etrangers auraient influence l'offensive de
   la coalition s'ils n'avaient pas ete liberes avant le debut des
   hostilites, la comprehension de leur incidence reste lacunaire. Cette
   note s'appuie sur des documents d'archives disponibles depuis peu, entre
   autres sources, pour aborder cette vieille question sous un nouvel
   angle. D'apres ces documents, les dirigeants s'attendaient a la mort
   d'otages et donc, a des retombes politiques. Les besoins militaires et
   le manque de renseignements concernant le lieu de detention des otages
   ne permettaient pas d'eviter ces cibles aux boucliers humains. Dans le
   meme temps, l'opinion publique se trouvait divisee sur la question des
   otages, notamment aux etats-Unis. Par consequent, les dirigeants avaient
   l'intention de prendre des mesures de precaution particulieres et
   d'organiser une operation de sauvetage dans la ville de Koweit. Dans
   l'ensemble, ces mesures semblaient superieures a celles employees pour
   d'autres cibles et exposaient les forces de la coalition a davantage de
   risques. Il est aussi possible que la motivation des decideurs
   americains s'explique par leur conviction qu'agir sans se laisser
   dissuader pourrait en decourager d'autres d'avoir recours au meme
   stratageme a l'avenir. Nos conclusions font progresser la recherche sur
   la guerre du Golfe et le probleme des boucliers humains en temps de
   guerre.},

Title = {A PROBLEM of RULES: Sexual Exploitation and UN Legitimacy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Twenty years ago, the UN adopted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual
   exploitation and abuse (SEA) by its personnel. After prohibiting sex
   with children and the exchange of sex for ``cash, food and things,{''}
   it ``strongly discourages{''} sexual relationships with beneficiaries
   because ``they are based on inherently unequal power dynamics{''} and
   undermine the UN's credibility and integrity. Taking inspiration from
   critical feminist project of understanding what happens when feminist
   ideas and projects become institutionalised, I consider the
   effectiveness and unintended consequences of the policy's discouraged
   relationships standard. I argue that by centring an ``inherent power
   imbalance{''} between peacekeepers and local people, the policy
   undermines the UN's capacity to meaningfully address that imbalance in
   practice. Moreover, the discouraged relationships standard diminishes
   the policy's perceived legitimacy among staff, with ramifications beyond
   the prevention and punishment of sexual misconduct. Based on research in
   Bosnia-Herzegovina, Timor-Leste, Geneva, and New York, this article
   generates insights about the persistent challenges to preventing and
   punishing SEA and situates them in relation to broader questions around
   how international missions view and interact with local populations, and
   how this affects the integrity and effectiveness of their work.},

Abstract = {Historical institutionalism has fruitfully moved beyond its initial
   focus on institutional effects to incorporate change. I argue, however,
   that the resulting advances have become misaligned with their conceptual
   bases. ``Institutions as rules{''} was a useful first approximation, but
   it cannot accommodate changes in institutionalized practices occurring
   while sources of law remain the same. I propose reconceiving legal rules
   (material objects) and institutions (behavioral dispositions) as
   distinct elements that nonetheless remain fundamentally associated
   through the belief-shaping actions of specific groups. While rules
   change with the introduction of officially recognized materials, legal
   institutions change in response to new beliefs regarding what could pass
   as officially permissible. Far from a mere exercise in conceptual
   precision, the proposals draw distinctions that matter for description
   and explanation. In that regard, I show how the current literature
   mischaracterizes court-led change and how we might advance on the
   underexplored issue of collective meaning-making amidst unequal legal
   expertise.},

Abstract = {Do home ownership and house prices impact the shaping of individual
   perceptions on inequality and belief in meritocracy? We argue that home
   ownership and rising asset prices increase the salience of an
   individual's own relative economic position, which in turn facilitates
   belief in meritocracy. We expect that, when house prices increase,
   homeowners are likely to strengthen their belief in meritocracy and
   defend their position by rationalizing that income distribution in
   society is fair and that economic success and failure are primarily
   determined by individual efforts. Our analysis of both a Korean panel
   survey and a cross-national survey finds strong and robust evidence of
   the asset price effect. Our findings suggest that the housing price
   effect on economic ideology is a general pattern, which implies that
   there are social and political consequences to the asset price effect.},

Abstract = {States conduct unclaimed coercive acts, imposing costs on adversaries to
   signal resolve but denying (or not claiming) responsibility. Some
   scholars posit that unclaimed acts have considerable potential to coerce
   targets, while containing escalation risks. Others suggest that
   unclaimed coercive efforts tend to fail and trigger escalation. We
   assess these competing perspectives about the effects of unclaimed
   attacks with a vignette experiment exposing US-based respondents to a
   scenario where, after Russia warns of unpredictable consequences if NATO
   continues providing weapons to Ukraine, an explosion occurs at a NATO
   base in Poland used to funnel weapons to Ukraine. Intelligence agencies
   and independent analysts identify Russia as the likely culprit, while
   not ruling out the possibility of an accident. We randomize whether
   Russia claimed or denied responsibility for the explosion and find that
   unclaimed acts have lower coercive leverage than claimed ones, but the
   two do not significantly differ in escalation risk.},

Abstract = {IntroductionThe global coronavirus pandemic offers a quasi-experimental
   setting for understanding the impact of sudden exposure to heightened
   existential risk upon both individual and societal values. MethodsWe
   examined the effect of the pandemic on political attitudes by comparing
   data from eight countries surveyed before and after the worldwide spread
   of COVID-19 in March 2020 with continuous weekly polling tracker data
   from the United Kingdom from 2019 to 2021. Multilevel models were used
   to explore the drivers of change, and the results indicated that
   reported emotions of fear and stress were positively associated with
   institutional approval during periods of greater pathogen risk.
   ResultsOur findings revealed that support for political and technocratic
   authority, as well as satisfaction with political institutions, rose
   significantly above long-term historical baselines during the pandemic.
   DiscussionThe results support the hypothesis that exposure to
   existential risk results in greater support for authority and that
   individual feelings of insecurity may be linked to less critical citizen
   orientations.},

Abstract = {IntroductionThe gender gap in populist radical right voting-with women
   being less likely to support populist radical right parties than men-is
   well-established. Much less is known about the interplay between gender,
   masculinity and populist radical right voting. This study investigates
   the extent to which masculinity affects women and men's likelihood of
   supporting populist radical right parties. Focusing on sexism as a link
   between masculinity and populist radical right support, we put forward
   two mechanisms that operate at once: a mediating effect of sexism
   (sexism explains the association between masculinity and populist
   radical right voting) and a moderating effect of sexism (the impact of
   masculinity is stronger among citizens scoring high on sexism compared
   with citizens with low levels of sexist attitudes). MethodsWe draw on an
   original dataset collected in Spain at the end of 2020 to investigate
   support for the Spanish populist radical right party VOX. ResultsWe find
   support for hypothesized mechanisms, mediation and moderation, chiefly
   among men. First, sexism explains about half of the link between
   masculinity and populist radical right support for this group,
   confirming the hypothesized mediation effect. Second, masculinity has a
   significantly stronger impact on the likelihood of supporting VOX among
   men scoring high on sexism, which in turn substantiates the presence of
   a moderation effect. DiscussionExisting research so far has examined the
   empirical connections between how individuals perceive their levels of
   masculinity, sexism, and PRR voting separately. Our study offers a first
   step in unpacking the relationship between masculinity and PRR support
   by focusing specifically on how sexism relates to both these variables.},

Title = {Role of the China South-South cooperation hegemonic strategy as an
   ``early emulation{''} in a context of systemic chaos},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {This study seeks to contribute to the thesis that China is directing its
   efforts toward the construction of a set of institutions that are
   presented as an alternative interstate subsystem to the one that emerged
   in the second postwar period. In this research, we made progress in
   locating the main elements from which we prefigure one of the features
   of that project. This is the strategy that, based on the cooperation
   scheme implemented by China through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
   the Global Development Initiative (GDI)(1) and the Global Security
   Initiative (GSI),(2) manifests itself in a kind of ``early emulation{''}
   of the North American hegemonic strategy of the second postwar period.
   ``Emulation{''} of the United States (US) is synthesized in a double
   process: first, in the way in which China is currently articulating an
   institutional framework under the intensification of the present
   systemic chaos, that is, in a previous or ``early{''} moment with
   respect to that in which we could consider the clear rise of a new
   hegemonic power. This framework operates under the logic of a political
   dialog that allows trade agreements and promotes a development strategy
   based on structural change. Second, in a similar way to the multilateral
   consensus that underpinned the US project based on the promotion of
   ``development{''} from the north to the south and with a fundamental
   role for cooperation and aid, China today deploys a similar argument
   promoting the scope of ``a community of shared future{''}(3) with its
   strategic partners and to which more and more states look to join, where
   the GDI and the GSI are fundamental axes.},

Abstract = {Scholars working on sovereignty in the EU have been quick to dismiss the
   French governments' European sovereignty discourse as a metaphor. In
   this article, we situate our argument and methodology within the broader
   literature on sovereignty conflicts in the EU. We demonstrate that the
   use of sovereignty regarding European integration has evolved in French
   Presidents' discourses throughout the Vth Republic. Far from being an
   invention of President Macron, the term European sovereignty builds on
   existing discourses by past French presidents since the Mitterrand
   years. The term European sovereignty has so far been successful and
   aligned with a more general tendency towards `rebordering' the EU.
   Important normative issues however remain. Legitimizing the EU on the
   basis of security concerns can threaten its liberal and cosmopolitan
   foundations. Second, redefining sovereignty as a capacity to act rather
   than a legitimate right to rule may prove to be unsustainable.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic publicly exposed the urgent need for seasonal
   workers in agriculture. In Germany, an entry ban and entry quotas for
   seasonal workers at the beginning of the pandemic caused major
   attention. Taking this moment as magnifying glass, the article asks how
   the German seasonal labour migration regime is constructed (legally) and
   legitimated (discursively), and in how far the pandemic has caused
   shifts within this regime. Based on an analysis of the legal framework
   and the political discourse around seasonal work from 2018 to 2020 in
   Germany, the seasonal labour migration regime is characterised as
   just-in-time migration tailored to the needs of agricultural business,
   where migrants' work force is not absorbed homogenously by precarious
   labour sectors, but rather specific groups of migrant workers are
   integrated differently through mechanisms of differential inclusion.
   Within this regime, seasonal workers function as outsourced labour,
   whose reproduction costs remain abroad. On the discursive level, the
   article shows how seasonal workers are produced as `wanted migrants' by
   linking seasonal migration to the interests of the `homeland'. While the
   pandemic momentarily caused some shifts on the discoursively level, the
   article shows that the seasonal labour regime as a whole remains rather
   stable in time.},

Abstract = {Do United Nations peacekeeping operations improve the security of
   humanitarian aid workers during conflict? Answering this question is
   important given the critical assistance that humanitarian personnel
   provide in conflict zones, the increased integration of humanitarian
   activities in UN operations in recent decades and the growing incidence
   of attacks against aid workers worldwide. Researchers have found that
   the presence of peacekeepers does not positively affect aid worker
   security and may even make humanitarian personnel more vulnerable to
   violent attacks. However, previous studies have not examined whether the
   effect of peacekeeping operations on aid worker security is influenced
   by the personnel composition of UN missions. I hypothesize that
   operations with more troops are likely to reduce attacks against aid
   workers, while similar security gains are unlikely to be realized with
   larger numbers of police or observers. This is due to troops' specific
   capabilities, which increase their ability to mitigate high-intensity
   conflict environments and protect humanitarian personnel traveling on
   roads. Statistical analyses of monthly data between 2000 and 2015
   indicate that greater numbers of UN troops, but not police and
   observers, are correlated with fewer attacks against aid workers. The
   implications of these findings are discussed, with an eye toward
   addressing challenges facing the UN's force-generation process.},

Abstract = {The ubiquity of Sino-US strategic competition calls for uncovering its
   underpinnings by systematically comparing their grand strategies. This
   article examines how both governments have constructed their countries'
   national interest since the 2008 global financial crisis. Through
   quantitative content analysis, it traces the relative salience of
   different components of the construction of the national interest
   detailing differences and shifts in emphasis and divergences within both
   governments. Whereas the Chinese government increasingly emphasized
   taking on a leadership role in international affairs, the US government
   became more concerned about the country's security and economic
   standing. Between Chinese actors, the most pronounced divergence
   appeared regarding the importance of territorial defense. US actors
   disagreed about the importance of promoting the country's values abroad.
   These findings suggest that a long-term perspective is needed to uncover
   the underpinnings of great power competition. Researchers and
   policy-makers must listen to different foreign policy actors, even under
   centralized authoritarian rule.},

Abstract = {Using flows of biophysical resources between countries, new research has
   defied conventional methods of analysing trade in terms of cash flows.
   Labelled `ecologically unequal exchange', this research quantifies net
   resource transfers from global South to global North countries. This
   article explores the unequal exchange implications for Africa as a
   primary exporter of physical resources, and hence one of the biggest
   losers from ecologically unequal exchange. As well as ecologically
   unequal exchange, the article employs the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis and
   the Growing Smile model to argue against export-oriented
   industrialisation models of development, and for the political
   restructuring of the uneven global value regime.},

   Hamas and the 2006 Palestinian Elections (Routledge, 2019), which
   provides an indepth interrogation of the EU's boycott of Hamas following
   their 2006 electoral success. The author argues that the book's major
   contribution is to present an alternative way of knowing the world by
   disrupting dominant forms of knowledge about world politics, thereby
   making it possible to hear the voices of those who are normally
   silenced. In turn, this alternative knowledge may serve to become a
   terrain for transformative political action - not by EU diplomats - but
   by global civil society.},

Abstract = {This article examines gender equality policy in Britain, pre-and
   post-Brexit. Through a gendered analysis of European Union (EU)
   directives over forty years, we examine which policies have been key to
   Britain's gender equality agenda. We find that the EU's gender equality
   framework has been particularly integral to the advancement of
   `class-based' policies, which seek to ameliorate inequalities that arise
   from the sexual division of labour. Taken together, we argue that the
   impact of Brexit risks directly rolling back these class-based gains.
   This is as a result of a shift away from a more consensual style of
   policymaking at the supranational level, towards a top-down, adversarial
   and masculinised Westminster Model, which marginalises women from
   decision-making fora. As it stands, advancements in gender equality
   policies are unlikely to be regained in the current political climate
   due to the absence of the stimulus of the EU for domestic gender
   equality reform.},

Title = {A Typology of Ontological Insecurity Mechanisms: Russia's Military
   Engagement in Syria},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Because of the novel explanations it generates for states' security- and
   identity-related behavior, the concept of ontological security has been
   used increasingly in the International Relations (IR) literature in
   recent years. However, the abundance of interpretations of the concept
   means that it is often used in conflicting ways. To counter the risk of
   conceptual stretching and provide the foundation for a common research
   agenda, this article constructs a typology of ontological security
   mechanisms. Two dimensions of ontological insecurity are highlighted:
   the sources and the causes of anxiety. We argue that the source of
   anxiety can be reflexive, relational, or systemic, while the cause of
   anxiety can be either shame or discontinuity. These two dimensions
   produce six mechanisms of ontological insecurity that reflect how the
   concept is used in the contemporary ontological security literature in
   IR. By specifying these mechanisms, we argue that the typology offers IR
   scholars the ability to produce even more nuanced and fine-grained
   explanations of state behavior driven by ontological insecurity.
   Finally, to demonstrate the utility of this typology, the article
   provides an illustrative case study of Russia's engagement in the
   conflict in Syria in 2015-2017.},

   options. Methodology: Based on a definition of the concept of crisis, a
   model of analysis is proposed that traces significant governance
   processes and crisis factors at the systemic, regional, and domestic
   levels, using a series of indicators that allow interpreting their
   impact on Latin American regionalism projects and their effects in the
   form of crisis. Conclusions: The findings suggest the existence of
   structural conditioning factors that exceed the established paradigms
   and political dynamics that were unable to overcome their
   contradictions, which led to a triple crisis of results, model, and
   expectations, the effects of which directly affect the credibility of
   the projects. The crisis, therefore, does not appear as a mere question
   of political will but as a complex combination of multiple factors
   involving states and other national and international actors and social
   forces. Originality: The article broadens the analytical perspectives of
   Latin American regionalism by proposing a novel approach that helps
   better understand its particularities vis-a-vis other regionalisms and
   opens the possibility of continuing and deepening the empirical analysis
   of each specific regionalism.},

Abstract = {In 2017, member states established the European Public Prosecutor's
   Office (EPPO), an EU body investigating and prosecuting offences against
   the EU financial interests. This article analyses the relation between
   the institutional design of the EPPO and sovereignty concerns of member
   states. Combining the core state powers framework with literature on
   Council negotiation dynamics, it argues that the Council was divided
   regarding how far-reaching the authority of this new body vis-a-vis
   member states should be or to what extent member states should retain
   control over the body. A qualitative discourse analysis shows that the
   competition between states sharing a supranational position regarding
   the EPPO and those sharing an intergovernmental position resulted in the
   creation of a complex and ambiguous body. These findings contribute to
   the literature on agencification of Justice and Home Affairs as well as,
   more broadly, to scholarship on the construction of new types of
   authority.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, gender equality goals have been adopted widely in
   global policymaking, creating a demand for specialized knowledge and
   evidence to support the design and implementation of gender equality
   policies. Bridging feminist scholarship on gender expertise and
   practice-theoretical literature on knowledge production, this article
   examines a knowledge production initiative of the World Bank, the Gender
   Innovation Laboratories (GILs). While research has examined the position
   of gender experts and the content of gender expertise in global
   governance, it has overlooked how knowledge about gender is produced. In
   this paper, we use a practice-theoretical approach-assemblage
   thinking-to study the practical work mobilized in the GILs to produce,
   maintain, and disseminate knowledge about gender inequality. Drawing on
   interviews with lab researchers, documents, and online materials, and
   focusing on the epistemic practice of impact evaluations, our analysis
   demonstrates the work invested in assembling them, such as forging
   alignments with and securing support among stakeholders, activating
   repertoires of expertise, and translating results into material objects.
   These practices produce gender inequality as a governance object, which
   is amenable to technical policy interventions, which facilitates certain
   forms of action to address it. Yet, they simultaneously silence more
   political solutions to gender inequalities.},

Abstract = {The provision of public services by for-profit and non-profit
   organizations is widespread in OECD countries, but the jury is still out
   on whether outsourcing has improved service quality. This article seeks
   to nuance existing debate by bringing to the fore variation in service
   quality between different types of non-public providers. Building on
   theories of dimensional publicness and incomplete contracts, we argue
   that different forms of non-public ownership are associated with varying
   intensity of incentives for profit maximization, ultimately affecting
   service quality. Using residential elder care homes in Sweden as our
   universe of cases, we leverage novel panel data for 2,639 facilities
   from 2012 to 2019, capturing the ownership type of the care home
   operators, against a set of indicators pertaining to inputs, processes,
   and outcomes. The results suggest that non-public providers with
   high-powered incentives to make profit, such as those owned by private
   equity firms and publicly traded companies, perform worse on most of the
   selected indicators compared to private limited liability companies and
   nonprofits. Our findings that the intensity of quality-shading
   incentives is not the same for all non-public providers have important
   implications for government contracting and contract management.},

Abstract = {This article is the result of research based on the agreement signed in
   2022 between the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Policy
   (MIDEPLAN) of Costa Rica and the Latin American Center for Development
   Administration (CLAD). Its purpose was to develop the ``Design and
   management of public policies in the framework of the SDGs{''}. The
   institutional approach was applied and it was considered that good
   performance in meeting the SDGs would not be achieved if there is no
   strong institutional architecture to ensure governance and institutional
   capacity. The research considers two premises. On one hand, the need to
   strengthen institutions to ensure the viability of planning and improve
   SDG performance through public policies. On the other hand, the
   importance of adopting the challenges faced by the country, as well as
   its financial capacity, as criteria for planning and prioritization of
   institutions. It also draws from the case of Costa Rica a series of
   proposals that may be useful for the region. The conclusions and
   proposals include: 1) the need to create a transversal axis of
   governance based on the guidelines and indicators of international and
   supranational bodies; 2) the methodology and meaning of public policies
   must be specified; 3) the obligation to orient public policy indicators
   to the achievement of the common good; 4) the necessary linkage of
   public policies with the budget; 5) the need to implement a mechanism
   for monitoring policy compliance that includes common elements for all
   policies; 6) that the achievement of the SDGs is favored by aligning
   them with national and, where appropriate, international strategic
   plans, such as the 2030 Agenda; and 7) that the SDGs would be
   accelerated by the introduction of innovation and digitalization
   processes. The territorial aspect should also be taken into account and
   multilevel planning should be established.},

Abstract = {This article aims to map the political economy of top personal income
   tax rate setting. A much-discussed driving factor of top rate setting is
   the corporate tax rate: governments may prefer to limit the differential
   between both rates in order to prevent tax-friendly saving of labour
   incomes inside corporations. Recent studies have highlighted several
   other driving factors, including budgetary pressure, partisan politics,
   and societal fairness norms. I compare these and other potential
   determinants in the long run (1981-2018) by studying tax reforms of 226
   cabinets in 19 advanced Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
   Development (OECD) countries using regression models. I find little
   evidence for the effects of economic, political, and institutional
   factors; instead, the main determinant of the top rate is the corporate
   tax rate. As corporate tax rates are still declining under competitive
   pressure, the recently set minimum rate of 15\% will not stop tax
   competition from constraining progressive income taxation.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an introduction to this Special Issue on the United
   Nations report Our Common Agenda. The report, for which the
   Secretary-General consulted widely, contains around 90 proposals and
   recommendations, propagating solutions at the national, regional and
   global levels and across four broad areas: (i) renewed solidarity
   between peoples and future generations in order to strengthen social
   cohesion, (ii) a new social contract anchored in human rights; (iii)
   better management of critical global commons; and (iv) global public
   goods that deliver equitably and sustainably for all. With some
   exceptions, the Our Common Agenda report has been very well received
   both internationally and by UN Member States. The members of the Una
   Europa Global Governance Research Group wrote a number of brief articles
   commenting on diverse salient aspects of the Our Common Agenda OCA
   report and its implementation, and how these touch on a variety of
   issues of global governance, which are being presented in this Special
   Issue. This introduction provides an overview of the topics that are
   covered and their main findings.},

Abstract = {One potentially morally justified use of torture is found in
   philanthropic torture of a perpetrator (PTP): scenarios in which a
   perpetrator has instigated significant pending suffering against
   innocents and in which the suffering can be prevented by means of the
   perpetrator's cooperation. These situations involve a clash of two
   intuitions: that torture is in some strong and obvious sense absolutely
   morally wrong, and that torture or harm of an immoral perpetrator may be
   permissible to prevent equally abhorrent, if not greater, moral wrongs.
   My view is that a dually grounded view-permissible on theoretical
   grounds but wrong on practical grounds-can do justice to the conflicting
   intuitions we have about torture in cases of PTP. Further, I hold that
   practical ``absolutism{''} will only be mostly or likely absolute, but
   that we should accept as adequate this ``near absolutism{''}-it will
   give us the practical result we seek while also satisfying the intuition
   that we may act in otherwise untoward ways to prevent horrific moral
   harms.},

Abstract = {The Forgiveness Project is an organisation whose peace activism is
   devoted to the collection and curation of testimonies that bear witness
   to the transformative power of nonviolent, restorative responses to
   (violent) conflict, crime, and injustice. To the `Testify' feature for
   International Politics Reviews, this conversational piece contributes a
   discussion of The Forgiveness Project, and its understanding of,
   reliance upon, and use of stories in the pursuit of peace. A
   conversation between Christopher Peys and Marina Cantacuzino, MBE, this
   dialogue aims to highlight how this award-winning advocacy organisation
   is doing global politics in a grassroots, bottom-up manner through its
   use of storytelling. This dialogue between Peys and Cantacuzino not only
   explores the non-prescriptive, narratively-driven theory of activism
   that informs the work of The Forgiveness Project, but it also uses
   affect theory to theorise forgiveness as a deeply divisive
   ethico-political value and form of practice.},

Abstract = {One of the unresolved puzzles in the civil resistance and contentious
   politics literatures is why some movements that begin seeking limited
   redress in a certain policy space escalate their claims to demand the
   ousting of a national leader or the entire regime, a process the article
   terms `demand escalation'. For instance, in the summer of 2019,
   thousands took to the streets of Hong Kong to protest about a proposed
   extradition bill that would allow criminal suspects to be sent to
   mainland China to face trial in courts controlled by the Communist
   Party. However, even after Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, announced the
   formal withdrawal of the controversial bill, protests continued with
   some calling for greater democracy and others demanding Lam's
   resignation. Whereas most of the literature on civil resistance treats
   demands as fixed and focuses on different methods of struggle to pursue
   predefined ends, this article shows that demands can change as a result
   of the state-dissent interaction. The article argues that movements are
   more likely to escalate their demands when the state responds to the
   initial nonviolent action with a disproportionate use of force, because
   such an action intensifies the grievances the protesters have against
   the state and betrays the remaining trust that people might have had in
   the government. The analysis of a new quantitative dataset that
   catalogues both reformist and maximalist opposition campaigns globally
   supports this claim. By incorporating non-maximalist campaigns into the
   analysis and not treating demands as fixed, this article adds to our
   understanding of mass campaigns and highlights an overlooked means by
   which nonviolent campaigns can up their ante without resorting to
   violence.},

Abstract = {The progressive governments of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico and
   Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela followed a strategy of
   selective treatment to win over some businesspeople and neutralize
   others in order to weaken the opposition of a hostile business class.
   This approach had advantages and downsides. It succeeded in gaining
   support from business representatives for government initiatives in
   moments of difficulty and crisis and reducing the firepower of the
   commercial media. It was also, however, conducive to corruption. Many
   nonhostile businesspeople proved to be unreliable allies as they ended
   up withdrawing their support for the government. These capitalists were
   a far cry from the progressive ``national bourgeoisie{''} with which
   Communists and other leftists attempted to form alliances in the
   twentieth century, but proestablishment actors attacked many of them,
   including such leading capitalists as Gustavo Cisneros in Venezuela and
   Ricardo Salinas in Mexico, who in some cases were considered
   ``traitors.{''} In Mexico, major businesspeople before and after the
   left's rise to power played a more overtly political role than, for the
   most part, in Venezuela. Chavez attempted to define the behavior of
   progressive businesspeople, which included limits on profits, and also
   promoted the formation of politically progressive business
   organizations. Los gobiernos progresistas de Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador
   en Mexico, y Hugo Chavez y Nicolas Maduro en Venezuela, siguieron una
   estrategia de trato selectivo para ganarse la confianza de algunos
   empresarios y neutralizar a otros con el fin de debilitar la oposicion
   de parte de una clase empresarial hostil. Este enfoque implico tanto
   ventajas como desventajas. Logro obtener el apoyo de los representantes
   empresariales para iniciativas gubernamentales en momentos de dificultad
   y crisis, asi como reducir el impacto negativo de los medios de
   comunicacion comerciales. Sin embargo, tambien dio lugar a la
   corrupcion. Muchos empresarios no hostiles resultaron ser aliados poco
   confiables y, eventualmente, retiraron su apoyo al gobierno. Estos
   capitalistas estaban muy lejos de constituir la ``burguesia nacional{''}
   progresista con la que los comunistas y otros izquierdistas intentaron
   formar alianzas en el siglo XX. Sin embargo, actores a favor del status
   quo atacaron a muchos de ellos, incluidos capitalistas prominentes como
   Gustavo Cisneros en Venezuela y Ricardo Salinas en Mexico, quienes, en
   algunos casos, fueron vistos como ``traidores{''}. En Mexico, los
   principales empresarios antes y despues del ascenso de la izquierda al
   poder desempenaron un papel mas abiertamente politico de lo que ocurrio,
   mayoritariamente, en Venezuela. Chavez intento definir el comportamiento
   de los empresarios progresistas, lo cual incluyo poner un limite a sus
   ganancias, y tambien promovio la formacion de organizaciones
   empresariales politicamente progresistas.},

Abstract = {The regulation of military applications of artificial intelligence (AI)
   is a growing concern. The article investigates how the EU as a
   multi-level system aims at regulating military AI based on epistemic
   authority. It suggests that the EU acts as a rule-maker and a rule-taker
   of military AI predicated on constructing private, corporate actors as
   experts. As a rule-maker, the EU has set up expert panels such as the
   Global Tech Panel to inform its initiatives, thereby inviting corporate
   actors to become part of its decision-making process through the
   front-door. But the EU is also a rule-taker in that its approach to
   regulating on military AI is shaped through the backdoor by how
   corporate actors design AI technologies. These observations signal an
   emerging hybrid regulatory security state based on `liquid' forms of
   epistemic authority that empowers corporate actors but also denotes a
   complex mix of formal political and informal expert authority.},

Abstract = {While current levels of economic inequality in Africa receive ample
   attention from academics and policymakers, we know little about the
   long-run evolution of inequality in the region. Even the new and
   influential `global inequality literature' that is associated with
   scholars like Thomas Piketty, Branko Milanovic, and Walter Scheidel has
   had little to say about Africa so far. This paper is a first effort to
   fill that void. Building on recent research in African economic history
   and utilizing the new theoretical frameworks of the global inequality
   literature, we chart the long-run patterns and drivers of inequality in
   Africa from the slave trades to the present. Our analysis dismantles
   mainstream narratives about the colonial roots of persistent high
   inequality in post-colonial Africa and shows that existing inequality
   concepts and theories need further calibration to account, among others,
   for the role of African slavery in the long-run emergence and vanishing
   of inequality regimes.},

Abstract = {A distinguishing feature of the modern state is the broad scope of
   social welfare provision. This remarkable expansion of public assistance
   was characterized by huge spatial and temporal disparities. What
   explains the uneven expansion in the reach of social welfare? We argue
   that social welfare expansion depends in part on the ability of the
   governed to compel the state to provide rewards in return for military
   service-and crucially, that marginalized groups faced greater barriers
   to obtaining those rewards. In colonial states, subjects faced a
   bargaining disadvantage relative to citizens living in the colony and
   were less likely to win concessions from the state for their wartime
   sacrifices. We test this argument using a difference-in-differences
   research design and a rich data set of local spending before and after
   World War I in colonial Algeria. Our results reveal that social welfare
   spending expanded less in communes where the French subject share of the
   population was greater. This paper contributes to the state-building
   literature by highlighting the differential ability of the governed to
   bargain with the state in the aftermath of conflict.},

Abstract = {Research on nuclear repository siting often suggests that the dominance
   of key actors in siting processes should be counterbalanced by greater
   inclusion of disadvantaged local publics. Often, public consent is
   represented as guarantee of `fairness'. I problematize this notion by
   showing how consent is pursued by the implementer in Sweden. I invoke
   industry's written material distributed to citizens in the repository
   candidate community of osthammar, showing that Swedish municipalities'
   right of veto in siting inquiries and public opposition have resulted in
   a creative industry siting strategy, which has abandoned overt coercion;
   implementers now aim to create consent by tending to local interests and
   culture. Despite the sensitivity to local publics' wishes, however,
   particular problems remain. Inspired by a theory that understands
   consent-building as a specific form of power, I conclude that the
   inclusion of local interests is no panacea for `fairness' and propose
   new routes for research.},

   North Africa within it, have certainly become a core part of China's
   global design. This volume aims to explain the process of Chinese
   expansion in the Middle East from an `inside-out' perspective. It
   includes a series of country-specific case studies aimed at evaluating
   how local actors and their agencies have shaped China's role in the

Abstract = {Regulation is a prominent tool in what Kruck and Weiss call the
   Regulatory Security State. Safeguarding security entails shaping tech
   companies' behaviour through arms-length rules, rather than wielding
   state capacity directly - a power shift away from state actors. As I
   argue, this dynamic also works in reverse: securitization of digital
   technology imposes security provision - a traditional state rationale -
   on regulatory domains hitherto dominated by commercial motivations.
   There is not only more regulation in security; there also is more
   security in regulation. This dynamic challenges the EU's global
   regulatory entanglements. I use budding EU regulation of artificial
   intelligence (AI) to illustrate this struggle: do AI's military
   implications weigh so heavily that its regulation should largely be seen
   through that lens? And should a transatlantic security alliance trump EU
   ambitions to craft its own AI governance approach? This fight is
   undecided yet. But given AI's general-purpose character, its outcome
   will reverberate throughout society at large.},

Title = {Comparing regulatory processes in genome editing and autonomous

Abstract = {This study compares the regulation of two emerging technologies, the
   CRISPR genome-editing system and Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV)
   in the United States. The study draws on 33 in-depth interviews with
   innovation and governance experts to study the relationship between
   their regulatory environments and developing beliefs about these
   technologies. Using sociotechnical imaginaries as a framework, we
   explore how social actors envision technologically driven futures and
   the social order that enables them. These imaginaries are essential to
   emerging technologies, where experts build a framework of potentialities
   for innovation still underway. While scholarship has documented how
   sociotechnical imaginaries arise among policymakers, groups of
   scientists, state and local stakeholders, and public actors in different
   countries, less has been said about how regulatory organizations and
   their actors shape expectations around technologies that are in the
   early and middle stages of development. This article finds that
   regulatory institutions shape emerging imaginaries along three related
   axes: the distribution of authority, technological novelty, and risk.
   Interviewees negotiate these three contingencies differently based on
   relevant extant regulatory structures and ideologies, resulting in
   distinct imaginaries around each technology. CRISPR actors envision
   genome editing as largely diminishing biomedical harm and eventually
   suitable for health markets, while CAV actors diverge on whether
   self-driving cars alleviate or exacerbate risk and how they may enter
   roads. That organizational structures and practices of regulation inform
   broadly held sociotechnical imaginaries bears significance for studies
   of innovation trajectories, suggesting regulators can take an active
   role in shaping how risks and benefits of emerging technology are
   defined.},

Abstract = {How do autocratic regimes use political propaganda to facilitate policy
   reversals of major significance? In this article, we demonstrate how the
   authoritarian regime in China dynamically uses propaganda to accomplish
   rapid discursive shifts in the context of major policy changes. Using a
   structural topic model for unsupervised machine learning to analyze
   extensive propaganda materials, we explore how the Chinese Communist
   Party facilitated the reversal of its One-Child Policy in 2015 by
   deploying a systematic, precise, multi-dimensional, and multi-layered
   discursive engineering project. Our findings demonstrate that instead of
   a monolithic and rigid operation, China's state propaganda is a
   strategic and flexible discursive engineering project tailored to
   contingent factors, such as the nature of the policy being advocated,
   the level of the propaganda venue, and the needs, mentality, and tastes
   of carefully targeted audiences. This coordinated maneuver of state
   narrative is key for the effective and smooth policy reversal of major
   significance.},

Abstract = {The multilateral trading system, first established formally in 1947 with
   the goal of bringing about sustainable peace and greater prosperity
   through increased cross-border commerce underpinned by globally agreed
   upon rules, has contributed significantly to economic development and
   reduced poverty. However, as the global trading system enters the 2020s
   it cannot rely on past success and must adapt to a rapidly changing
   world, one that requires both more and different kinds of inclusion in
   order to address new challenges around inequality and global economic
   and geopolitical shocks. To address these new challenges the World Trade
   Organization (WTO) must be updated and reformed by its member
   governments, who must also recognise that many current global challenges
   have linkages across trade, tax, environment, and health areas which
   require increased coordination across global bodies. Further, the
   challenges of growing domestic inequality in many countries, while a
   domestic policy concern, will have significant impact on the political
   will to undertake the necessary updating and reform of the multilateral
   trading system and the required enhanced coordination with other
   international bodies and agreements. The recent positive outcomes from
   the WTO's 12th Ministerial Conference in June of 2022 show that global
   cooperation on trade issues is possible. Building on this success, the
   WTO can reshape itself to be fairer and more resilient and better able
   to address current global and domestic challenges.},

Title = {Can the `downward spiral' of material conditions, mental health and
   faith in government be stopped? Evidence from surveys in `red wall'
   constituencies},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICS \& INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {131-148},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {If policy preferences follow material interests, the experience of
   socioeconomic disadvantage ought to increase support for redistributive
   policies. However, experiencing disadvantage might also reduce faith in
   government's ability to make things better, indirectly reducing support
   for redistributive action, and leading to a spiral of widening
   disadvantage and increasing political disengagement. Indeed,
   disadvantaged communities sometimes favour right-wing platforms over
   those offering redistribution, as in the taking of `red wall'
   constituencies in the North and Midlands of England by the UK
   Conservative party in 2019. This article uses quantitative data from a
   survey of `red wall' voters (n = 805) to examine the bases of people's
   perceptions of redistributive policies. We find that even a radical
   redistributive policy, Universal Basic Income (UBI), receives
   consistently high levels of support (69.45 SD 27.24). Lower
   socioeconomic status, greater financial distress and greater risk of
   destitution all increase support. These effects are partly mediated by
   mental distress, which is markedly higher among the less well off.
   However, the same socioeconomic factors also reduce faith in government,
   which in turn is associated with lower support. Thus, those who stand to
   benefit most from redistribution are aware of their material interests,
   but are also the least confident in the ability of government to improve
   their lives. As such, there is a clear political challenge for
   progressive politicians: those whose support they depend upon require a
   significant redistributive offer, but also need to be persuaded of the
   viability of reform to support progressive change.},

Abstract = {We examine the middle-level elite of the Italian Democratic Party
   (Partito democratico, PD) and its founding parties, Democrats of the
   Left (Democratici di Sinistra, DS) and The Daisy (La Margherita, DL),
   over fifteen years (2004-2019). Our original dataset on national
   delegates comes from 2373 questionnaires collected at eight national
   party congresses. Inspired by Whiteley and Seyd's concepts of low and
   high-intensity participation, we evaluate the relative weight of the
   various types of incentive in the two (internal and external) forms of
   party activism. Party activism is central to understanding the profound
   cultural, organisational, and electoral crisis that has put the PD at a
   crossroad and has led current secretary Letta to call for a `Constituent
   Congress of the New PD'.},

Abstract = {During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union implemented
   multiple arms control treaties that depended on National Technical Means
   (NTM) for verification. Since NTM included covert satellite
   reconnaissance systems that gathered a sizeable portion of American
   intelligence on the USSR, the US government kept the details about its
   NTM ambiguous. Consequently, US diplomats had to negotiate a
   verification framework dependant on NTM without compromising sensitive
   space-based intelligence capabilities. This article uses newly
   declassified documents to explore how Washington and Moscow navigated
   the boundaries of secrecy concerning space reconnaissance to create a
   robust arms control verification regime.},

Abstract = {This study widely replicates the original studies by Zhan and Tang to
   verify the impact of political opportunities and the resources of
   organizations on policy advocacy, which uses a much larger sample of
   nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who engage with social work. The
   main findings of the present study are similar to those of the original
   studies. First, the study finds that the higher the level of government
   support, the more likely NGOs is to engage in policy advocacy. Second,
   the NGOs with stronger political connections are more active in policy
   advocacy. Third, the income of an organization also has a positive
   effect on policy advocacy. However, the number of full-time staff,
   location, and the level of registration of an organization does not have
   a significant effect on policy advocacy. The study increases the
   understanding of policy advocacy and the relations between the state and
   society in China.},

Abstract = {Russia's aggression against Ukraine has shown that what has been viewed
   as Central and Eastern European countries' Russophobia is in fact their
   sensitivity to the challenge or/and threat that Russia poses to its
   neighbors. The West, which until February 2022 has defined Russia as a
   partner or at best a problematic neighbor, has been repeatedly receiving
   signals that the Kremlin does not accept violations of its sphere of
   influence, the former USSR. Each time, they were ignored or downplayed.
   Author explains the background of Russia's revisionist turn, which she
   claims is the key. Following the neorealist paradigm, she presents the
   factors that have led Russia to alter the post-Cold War order, challenge
   the West, and demand recognition of the post-Soviet area as its zone of
   exclusive interests.},

Abstract = {Can experience with one set of policies result in support for a set of
   different, but related, policies? To show how this is possible, we
   develop a new dimension of policy feedback effects missing from prior
   studies - outcome distance. We then examine what we call a
   middle-distance outcome and apply this concept to the case of welfare
   attitudes in the United States. A novel counterfactual survey design is
   used to estimate the within-subject effects of experience with
   pandemic-related relief efforts (that is, stimulus checks, unemployment
   assistance) on attitudes towards broader welfare programmes like TANF,
   SNAP, SSI and Medicaid. The evidence suggests that attitudes towards
   broader welfare initiatives may have become more supportive as a result
   of the pandemic and associated policies, implying that specific policies
   and events can have feedback effects on outcomes that are some
   medium-distance away, such as other policies of a similar type. Future
   research ought to further explore this proposed dimension of feedback
   effects.},

   Germany},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {77},
Number = {3},
Pages = {527-563},
Abstract = {Most autocracies restrict emigration yet still allow some citizens to
   exit. How do these regimes decide who can leave? We argue that many
   autocracies strategically target anti-regime actors for emigration,
   thereby crafting a more loyal population without the drawbacks of
   persistent co-optation or repression. However, this generates
   problematic incentives for citizens to join opposition activity to
   secure exit. In response, autocracies simultaneously punish dissidents
   for attempting to emigrate, screening out all but the most determined
   opponents. To test our theory, we examine an original data set coded
   from over 20,000 pages of declassified emigration applications from East
   Germany's state archives. In the first individual-level test of an
   autocracy's emigration decisions, we find that active opposition
   promoted emigration approval but also punishment for applying.
   Pensioners were also more likely to secure exit, and professionals were
   less likely. Our results shed light on global migration's political
   sources and an overlooked strategy of autocratic resilience.},

Title = {Effect of Covid-19 Lockdown on Women and Girls in Nigeria: Experiences
   of Gender-Based Violence, Insecurity and Wellbeing},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Abstract = {This study aimed to explore the experiences of gender-based violence,
   insecurity, and health effect of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown among
   women and girls three to six weeks into lockdown measures in Nigeria.
   This was a cross-sectional survey carried out in Nigeria among 1,243
   women and girls aged between 10 and 79 from April to May 2020. Data was
   collected using an online web-based survey platform and analyzed using
   Microsoft Excel and Epi-Info. There was a statistically significant
   difference in the experience of violence before and during the COVID-19
   lockdown among women and young girls in Nigeria (P = 0.002). During the
   COVID-19 lockdown, respondents experienced physical (74, 30.8\%), sexual
   (120, 50\%), and emotional violence (46, 19.2\%). Al-though various
   forms of insecurity were experienced among the respondents, the most
   common form experi-enced was financial insecurity (960, 77\%). 738
   respondents (58\%) feared getting infected by the virus while 662 (52\%)
   had increased anxiety during this period. The findings highlight some
   negative unforeseen effects of the lockdown measures taken to reduce the
   spread of the COVID-19 virus and protect the people. This has import-ant
   implications for decision-making for future pandemics and the provision
   of possible mitigating factors.},

Title = {Uncertain Readiness: Process Design and Complexity Management in Peace
   Negotiations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {The reasons behind the development and outcomes of peace negotiations
   remain a subject of debate among scholars and practitioners. Structural
   conflict conditions of the conflict are often emphasized as key
   explanatory variables. However, this approach often neglects the actual
   intricacies of peace talks once they are in place and, instead,
   correlates negotiation outcomes with variables that are not actively
   part of them. Drawing on conflict resolution theory and the theory of
   complexity, the article proposes a theory for understanding the dynamics
   of peace negotiations. The main argument is that in a complex
   environment like one of peace talks, decisions on process design can be
   a key determinant of the effort devoted by the parties, and thus, of the
   negotiations unfolding. One contribution of this approach is the
   recognition of the potential of a negotiation to transform the
   relationship between the parties from one of conflict to one of
   cooperation in a joint effort to work toward a negotiated solution,
   provided that the complexity of the negotiation and the uncertainties
   associated to it are properly managed. Negotiation process design can
   provide some of the tools to do so. Similarly, this approach makes it
   possible to understand the existence of negotiations in which the
   parties are interested in keeping the dialogue open, regardless of some
   conditions of the conflict, for instance, alleged lack of ripeness. As
   an example, the paper studies the case of the Colombian government's
   parallel peace negotiations with the FARC and the ELN in the period
   2010-2018, which shows the possible role of process design variables in
   the different paths of these two negotiations.},

Abstract = {Migration, in general, is not a salient political issue in West Africa.
   However, one migration aspect that remains highly controversial and
   unpopular is cooperation on the deportation of undocumented emigrants
   with the EU and its member states. In this paper, we set out a typology
   of justification frames for studying how political actors in West Africa
   might frame their support or opposition to cooperation on deportation.
   We distinguished three types of justifications: identity-related, moral,
   and utilitarian. While the moral (human rights) and utilitarian
   (political, economic, securitarian, labor) frames are rather classic
   justifications in migration politics and governance, our analysis shows
   that identity-related ('neo-colonial resistance' and `neo-colonial
   compliance') justification frames highlight how historical path
   dependencies matter in understanding the drivers of (migration) politics
   and governance in West Africa. This is particularly evident when the
   images of cuffed and shackled deportees from Europe evoke memories of
   dark historical pasts.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between changes in manufacturing
   employment and political discontent in European regions, using a
   multilevel hybrid model and data from the European Social Survey and
   European Commission. The analysis reveals that within regions, a
   decrease in manufacturing jobs leads to greater political discontent,
   but this relationship is not observed when comparing variation in
   manufacturing levels across regions. Additionally, the analysis
   demonstrates that this discontent manifests more as dissatisfaction with
   the government, rather than distrust in political institutions and
   actors. Native-born, lower social classes and individuals living in
   rural areas display more discontent, even after considering material
   factors. The study highlights the role of declining social status and
   identity threats due to manufacturing job losses as a likely driver of
   political discontent. It calls for more research on the effects of
   manufacturing transitions in Europe on the formation of political
   attitudes among various social groups.},

Title = {An intersectional analysis of contestations within women's movements:
   the case of Scottish domestic abuse policymaking},
Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},

Abstract = {While policy scholars have elaborated on the ways in which social
   movements operate within discursive struggles over meaning-making to
   generate policy change, less attention has been paid to contestations
   within movements. This oversight is remarkable given that the process of
   shaping shared understandings and framings of policy problems is
   political and, thus, a site of epistemic power struggles. This article
   offers sharpened analytical tools to study internal framing politics,
   advancing an integrated feminist institutionalist approach. It
   empirically demonstrates the merits of this approach by applying it to a
   so-called `feminist policy success' case: Scottish domestic abuse
   policymaking. Domestic abuse experts often hail Scottish domestic abuse
   policies as `world-leading' due to their gendered and feminist policy
   constructions, which can be credited to successful feminist mobilisation
   around devolution. However, this article disrupts the dominant narrative
   by teasing out for whom the framing of policy has been a success within
   the movement, uncovering points of contention. Drawing on policy
   analysis and elite interviews, the study identifies and traces an
   enduring intramovement contestation around the dominance of gendered
   frames and subsequent marginalisation of intersectionality. It argues
   that while the women's movement has made considerable gains in
   integrating feminist concerns in policy, framing opportunities have not
   been equally shared, marginalising some actors and their frames. The
   Scottish case demonstrates how and why we should not underestimate the
   real and (un)intended consequences of intramovement contestations.
   Beyond the Scottish context, this article calls for scholars to account
   for diversities in identity, agency and claims-making within movements.},

Abstract = {This paper draws on three case studies to examine some of the challenges
   and tensions involved in the use of Autonomous Decision-Making Systems
   (ADMS). In particular, the paper highlights: (i) challenges around the
   shifting ``locale{''} of the decision, and the associated consequences
   for stakeholders; (ii) potential implications for stakeholders from
   regulation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); (iii)
   the different values that stakeholder groups bring to the ``decision{''}
   question; (iv) how complex pre-existing webs of stakeholders and
   decision-making authorities may be disrupted or disempowered by the use
   of an automated system and the lack of evaluation of possible
   consequences; (v) how ADMS for non-technical users can lead to
   circumvention of the boundaries of intended system use. We illustrate
   these challenges through case studies in three domains: adult social
   care, aviation, and vehicle driver monitoring systems. The paper closes
   with recommendations for both practice and policy in the deployment of
   ADMS.},

Title = {Indonesian Jihadi Training Camps: Home and Away},
Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 15},
Abstract = {This article looks at Indonesian training in foreign camps in
   Afghanistan, the Philippines, and Syria as well as domestic training
   camps and opportunities in Ambon, Poso, Aceh, and Java. It examines the
   roles that these camps played not only in building military capacity but
   also with respect to ensuring organizational continuity, building
   networks, and fulfilling the obligation of jihad. This article argues
   that jihadi military training both in Indonesia and abroad has not only
   served to acquire the necessary skills to fight repressive regimes but
   also to acquire the capacity to defend the Islamic state the jihadis
   were seeking to establish. It further argues that foreign training camps
   provided opportunities for intensive training with heavy weapons and the
   experience of being part of a global jihad while domestic training camps
   served caderization, the defense of Muslims in conflict areas, and as
   preparation for foreign training camps. And finally, this article
   demonstrates that both domestic and foreign training camps provided
   opportunities for network-building, leading to new training
   possibilities.},

Abstract = {This article explores the long-term macroeconomic impact of the war in
   Ukraine. Exploiting a new stock measure of human capital combining the
   quality and quantity of education and adult skills, this article
   quantifies the long-term effect of the war on aggregate productivity
   through the human capital channel. Results suggest that losses in
   long-run aggregate productivity could be at about 7\% if the war lasts
   two years. These adverse effects come from school closure and the
   resulting decline in student learning outcomes and losses in workers'
   skills, which, without remedial policy action, could persist for
   decades.},

Title = {Adaptive Political Economy: Toward a New Paradigm},
Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Number = {5},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The conventional paradigm in political economy routinely treats living,
   complex, adaptive social systems as machine-like objects. This treatment
   has driven political economists to oversimplify big, complex social
   processes using mechanical models, or to ignore them altogether. In
   development, this has led to theoretical dead ends, trivial agendas, or
   failed public policies. This article proposes an alternative paradigm:
   adaptive political economy. It recognizes that social systems are
   complex, not complicated; complexity can be ordered, not messy; and
   social scientists should be developing the concepts, methods, and
   the-ories to illuminate the order of complexity, rather than
   oversimplifying it. The author illustrates one application of adaptive
   political economy by mapping the coevolution of economic and
   institutional change. This approach yields fresh, important conclusions
   that mechanical, linear models of development have missed, including
   that market-building institutions look and function differently from
   market-sustaining ones},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the rising strategic significance of the South
   China Sea for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the
   major powers. It traces the origins of the South China Sea (SCS )
   dispute, and the claimants that are directly involved (China, Vietnam,
   Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei). It then examines why balance of
   power considerations have influenced and continue to influence the role
   of regional states as well as the major external powers (China, United
   States, India, and Japan, together with other interested middle powers
   such as Australia and Canada). It argues that the SCS is an
   international maritime regime (global commons), and therefore subject to
   the principles and practice of International Law, specifically United
   Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS ). Any attempt at
   nationalisation of the SCS will be rejected under international law, as
   evidenced by the 2016 decision of the Permanent Court of Arbitration
   (PCA ), with respect to the submission in 2013 by the Philippines on its
   dispute with China, for compulsory arbitration by the The Hague Court.
   It notes the lack of unity in ASEAN over how to deal with China's
   assertive conduct in the SCS. It suggests that only a dynamic balance of
   power approach, which includes external power engagement with regional
   interests, will create the necessary space for diplomacy and dialogue by
   upholding the primacy of the rule of law, freedom of the open seas, and
   the legitimate rights and interests of all claimant states. It concludes
   that law, politics, diplomacy, and deterrence are interactive variables
   requiring strategic management to promote shared interests, stability
   and security in the South China Sea.},

Title = {International Dimensions of Democratization},
Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {75},
Number = {5},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Since the 1970s, international influences on democratization have
   received increasing attention from scholars and policymakers. Scholars
   pointed to multiple mechanisms by which international factors could
   influence the transition to and the consolidation of democracy. While
   the arguments mostly pointed to positive influences, the optimism of the
   post- Cold War era have given way to concern about international sources
   of authoritarianism and democratic backsliding. The authors provide a
   framework for thinking about what we know about international forces and
   democratization, outlining several unanswered questions. Several
   research challenges remain, including how to best assess mechanisms
   linking international processes and actors to democracy (and
   democratization); while others concern threats to those democratic
   transitions via democratic backsliding. The article concludes by calling
   for more integration of existing theoretical frameworks on international
   factors and democracy with the current wave of research on
   authoritarianism and democratic backsliding.},

Abstract = {Security sector reform often involves integrating marginalized groups
   into the police. Extensive discussion surrounds the benefits of
   inclusion to the marginalized group, but we know little about impacts on
   the dominant group. I argue that exposure to out-group police can
   increase dominant group civilians' trust in the out-group, opening the
   door for further reforms and increasing the likelihood of peace. I
   explore dominant group citizens' responses to out-group police officers
   in Israel. First, using a survey experiment, I find no evidence that
   exposure to Arab (marginalized) police officers leads to backlash by
   Jewish (dominant) civilians. Then, drawing on multiple surveys and panel
   data on the identity of officers at every station over six years, I find
   that exposure to Arab police is associated with increased trust in Arabs
   among Jews. This trust extends to both everyday situations like
   willingness to live next door to an Arab and to beliefs about Arabs'
   intentions to commit political violence. Collectively, these results
   contradict fears that backlash by the dominant group might spoil peace,
   opening the door for police integration as an important part of peace
   processes.},

Abstract = {Populist radical right parties, such as Spain's VOX, transitioned from
   advocating explicitly racist and xenophobic ideologies to engaging in a
   cultural war. This change has gained particular prominence in Spain,
   given the dual challenges of immigration from Africa and the one
   resulting from the ongoing war in Ukraine. This study aims to analyze
   the contrasting representations of illegal immigrants and refugees on
   VOX's Instagram account using Critical Discourse Analysis. The findings
   reveal that VOX characterizes illegal immigrants as young, African
   Muslim men frequently displaying aggressive or threatening behaviours.
   In contrast, refugees, consisting of Ukrainian white women, children,
   and elderly persons, are depicted as embodying civilized conduct.},

Abstract = {For energy transition, infrastructure construction is often
   indispensable but also contested and potentially problematic for social
   cohesion. Through a game theoretical lens, we examine the basic
   configuration of infrastructure conflicts. Informed by the empirical
   example of German electricity grid planning, we discuss three approaches
   to resolve multilevel infrastructure conflicts, (1) technocratic
   decision-making, (2) participatory decision-making, and (3)
   redistribution and compensation, as well as the conditions under which
   we can expect them to mitigate conflicts. Each of the three approaches
   has been tried out in German grid planning over time, which allows us to
   analyze whether the respective conditions were met and why the
   approaches were (not) able to resolve existing conflicts. We demonstrate
   that enduring conflicts in German grid expansion are not caused by a
   fundamentally ill-defined decision-making procedure but rather by a
   particularly ``wicked{''} conflict structure that can hardly be resolved
   within planning procedures.},

   a Digital Colony},

Abstract = {Giving policies pompous names, such as `Digital Spain 2025', `National
   Artificial Intelligence Strategy' (ENIA) or `Spain 2050', the Spanish
   government wants to roll out a new sovereign power deployed outwards and
   integrated into the global digital, financial and military sphere. The
   article argues that this process, which requires handing over legal,
   social, financial, and economic powers to private corporations, has
   transformed the country into an incipient `digital colony,' a territory
   for data mining and the surveillance of society situated on the
   periphery of the capitalist world economy. On the way to becoming a
   digital colony, the privatisation of nation-building and popular
   sovereignty has involved discriminating against minority nations and
   executing repressive law enforcement policies.},

Title = {Opposition ``strategy mobility{''} - a dimension still missing in the
   critical policy mobility literature},
Journal = {CRITICAL POLICY STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {637-647},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Critical policy mobility research has transformed the field of policy
   transfer and diffusion studies. Scholars from critical epistemological
   traditions in different disciplines such as geography, sociology,
   political economy and public policy have examined the politics of policy
   transfer for more than a decade. Apart from challenging the affirmative
   normative assumptions underlying traditional policy transfer research
   ({''}policy learning{''}), scholars have taken a wide variety of policy
   actors and agencies into account, considered South-South and South-North
   policy circulation and recognized the relevance of policy mutation and
   failure. While transnational actors involved in policy mobility and
   issues of global governance have moved higher on the agenda in the
   recent past, opposition forces and resistance to policy mobility
   organized across borders remain on the margins. A new focus on
   opposition ``strategy mobility{''} is required to address actors and
   agencies that aim to roll back past policy mobility processes, or to
   prevent new efforts to promote policy transfers. Examples from diverse
   and highly contested policy areas like gender, climate mitigation and
   public health serve to illustrate the innovative potential of a new
   focus on strategy mobility to enhance the understanding of the contested
   character of policy mobility, and to yield a new perspective of global
   policy conflict studies.},

Abstract = {Outer space offers great potential, in terms of technological
   developments, access to natural resources and possibilities of
   exploration of and beyond the Moon. However, the exponential growth in
   the number of satellites, actors and types of space activities creates
   challenges for the continued Safety, Sustainability and Security (S3) of
   space activities. These challenges can be summarized as Congestion,
   Competition and Contestation in space, with all these trends converging
   (C4). This article explores how the European Union (EU) has over the
   past two decades been developing a space policy and how it can
   contribute to an effective, equitable and sustainable global governance
   of outer space. It argues that the EU is building a solid backbone to
   become a relevant power in global space governance across its different
   policies, but also that there is more potential to be realized,
   especially concerning the shaping future space law and governance.},

Abstract = {The European Union influences the governance of the Arctic and the
   Antarctic, whose Global Spaces constitute a part of broader complex
   governance patchworks. This influence derives both from the EU's role in
   global governance but also builds on some member states being Arctic
   states and Antarctic Treaty parties. The objective of this article is to
   propose an innovative conceptual approach - built on political geography
   and critical geopolitics - to better capture the EU's presence and its
   visions for an EU-preferred shape of polar governance. We propose that
   the EU is an important participant to the process of `polar spatial
   ordering' and has its own set of objectives, namely, to establish
   permanent EU-polar linkages and render itself a necessary
   element/participant of polar (geo)politics. These aims are supported or
   pursued via diverse geo-policies. However, the EU's overarching visions
   - cross-sectoral geo-strategies - regarding its preferred shape of polar
   spaces remain underdeveloped.},

Abstract = {Faced with defending against myriad online threats, businesses are
   increasingly turning to insurers to purchase cyber-insurance policies
   that will shield them from bearing the full costs of these incidents.
   Eager not to miss out on the expanding market, insurers have
   aggressively ramped up their cyber-insurance offerings, and in doing so,
   have assumed enormous responsibility-and power-as the arbiters of what
   types of state-sponsored cyber-attacks are covered by insurance. This
   article argues that insurance companies are influencing multilateral
   processes and setting de facto standards around responsible state
   behavior in cyberspace through their policies on risk and liability for
   serious cyber-operations and ``cyber-war.{''} It approaches this issue
   through the lens of the 2017 Russian NotPetya cyber-attack which led to
   significant legal disputes between many insurers and their policyholders
   about whether Russia's behavior constituted a ``warlike action{''} and
   was therefore excluded from insurance coverage under standard war
   exclusions.},

Abstract = {Michael Jacobs and Andrew Hindmoor's analysis of `Labour, left and
   right' is a salutary corrective to `electoral-ideological' accounts of
   party strategy in Britain, and rightly urges scholars to pay more
   attention to substantive `policy reasoning'. Jacobs and Hindmoor's
   account of Labour policy is only partly convincing, however, because it
   is based on a sharp distinction between left-wing `structural reform'
   and moderate `redistributive' strategies which is difficult to justify
   historically, and understates the importance of social policy
   commitments to Labour's positioning. This article argues that Labour's
   policy trajectory since the 1980s is better understood through a fiscal
   lens, which reflects the importance of costings debates in UK general
   election campaigns and of Shadow Chancellors in opposition
   policy-making. Shifts in Labour's positioning can thus be explained by
   looking at the interplay between the party's economic thought, the
   leadership's perception of its electoral needs, and the changing
   budgetary context.},

Abstract = {Despite our fascination with dog-whistling, neither dog-whistling
   itself, nor the relationship between dog-whistling and democracy are
   well understood. This article separates the content from the technique
   of dog-whistling and develops a more precise conceptualisation of that
   phenomenon in order to untangle the ambiguity about it. Dog-whistling,
   it argues, should not be reduced to racism or verbal communication
   tactics but can be combined with various different worldviews, and can
   encompass a multiplicity of verbal and non-verbal communicative means
   which surreptitiously nudge or wink at a specific subgroup. Contra the
   prevalent conviction that dog-whistling is antithetical to democracy in
   toto, the article suggests that some manifestations of that phenomenon
   constitute a `lesser vice' vis-a-vis a politics of zealous candour, and
   an ineluctable feature of democratic politics. This recognition has
   important implications for democratic theory, and recent lamentations
   that ours is an age of moral crisis, marked by the rise of post-truth
   politics.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper examines the decline of the largest working
   parliamentary democracy in India overtime, but accelerating since 2014
   as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), under the leadership of Prime
   Minister Narendra Modi at the Center (as the federal government is
   commonly known).Design/methodology/approachIt is eclectic. Original
   constitution, along with commentaries, are studied. News outlets,
   government pronouncements, journal articles, and other media outlets -
   electronic and print - are also sourced.FindingsThe findings show how
   three important features in democracy - elections and their outcomes,
   control of information, and suppression of dissent are widely used to
   undermine constitutional democracy.Originality/valueDemocracy can be
   undermined without altering the Constitution itself. It also explains
   the irony of Modi's popularity, given the undemocratic practices. As he
   may continue in office for some time to come, commanding a log-rolling
   majority, the need of the hour is a united, constructive and effective
   opposition to ensure a healthy working democracy.},

Journal = {POLITICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The concept of `sportswashing' serves as a short-hand way of criticising
   non-democratic regimes for using investment in sport, sports clubs, and
   sports events to detract from illiberal practices in their home
   countries. This article makes a contribution to the extant literature
   and debates on `sportswashing' in three key ways by (1) showing that,
   paradoxically, without the encouragement and opportunities afforded by
   notionally democratic global capitalism and the `West', `sportswashing'
   strategies would not be available to non-democratic regimes; (2)
   highlighting the `mechanisms' by which `sportswashing' actually occurs
   and how it ought to be understood as an initial step on a long-term
   journey towards `soft power' gains. The article does this by (3)
   examining two empirical examples of `sportswashing': first, the 2022
   Qatar World Cup and the broader international sports investment
   strategies pursued by Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Second, we introduce the
   WWE partnership with Saudi Arabia to demonstrate that `sportswashing'
   can be rendered bidirectional such that both participants reap a
   reputational boost, inverting the presumed reputational damage that
   otherwise constitutes the main disincentive to participation by Western
   capital. Such a process embeds non-democratic regimes in the sports
   industry leading to their becoming `normalised' in international
   business.},

Abstract = {This research explores how anticipatory policymaking played out in
   Finnish higher education reform. The study applies a discourse theoretic
   framework to explore how policy narrative might prove attractive to
   subjects by mobilizing ideas, norms, and fantasies through affective
   identification. Fantasies frame and stabilize our sense-making
   practices, thereby providing affective belonging and (ir)rationale for
   our actions. As an empirical case, the analysis of the Vision
   Development 2030 reform elucidates how the policy documents construct
   fantasmatic narratives (with reference to obstacles, threats, and
   plenitude to come) that set the terms of debate in articulating the
   `problem' of Finnish HE and in supplying the favorable policy solutions.
   Scrutinizing a range of ideological fantasies, such as articulating
   gloomy forecasts and reactivating cognitive and affective memories of
   past successes, Vision Development sought to evoke subjects' latent
   emotions and desires, mobilizing them toward a reproduction of the
   techno-managerialist order. Applying poststructuralist discourse theory
   and the concept of fantasy in policy studies, the role of desire and
   affective rhetoric in anticipatory future-making can be critically
   evaluated and the implications of such policy doctrines contemplated.},

Journal = {GLOBAL POLICY},

Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {149-165},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Pervasive uncertainty has stretched the fabric of global governance to
   its limit. The shape and form of future global governance is far from
   clear - yet we need to explore how it may play out, so that we can not
   only prepare for it but also overcome possible pernicious trajectories.
   Scenario thinking can be used to rigorously explore different possible
   outcomes. In this article, we present an exercise applying scenario
   thinking to global governance. These scenarios should help policymakers
   to understand which policies may or may not work in the diverse possible
   futures. They may also help policymakers to consider how their
   organisation, state, or institution could be affected if the global
   governance of a specific issue evolves in one direction or another.
   Civil society members or private companies may want to probe how robust
   their strategies would be in different global governance configurations.
   The article synthetically presents key contextual premises and
   uncertainties which are given as follows: four broad scenarios for the
   world in 2035; four corresponding scenarios for global governance; and
   scenarios for the global governance of four macro-sectors: trade,
   security, climate change, and finance.},

Abstract = {Economic conflicts among military allies may undermine their strategic
   alignment. Economic disputes in a wide range of areas - from weapons
   procurement to international trade to access to natural resources - go
   back to the very beginning of NATO. In recognition of these challenges,
   Article 2 of the NATO treaty calls upon the member states to `eliminate
   conflict in their horizontal ellipsis economic policies'. Examining the
   causes of such conflicts and efforts to resolve them hold the promise of
   yielding policy-relevant insights for contemporary public officials and
   defence strategists as they navigate the current geopolitical
   environment, including `de-risking' economic relations with a more
   assertive China. One ally may need to make `side-payments' to others in
   order to maintain strategic alignment on key security issues.},

Abstract = {In responding to Hamas's devastating 7 October 2023 attack on Israel,
   the United States has two strategic interests: a geopolitical interest
   in preventing the conflict from widening; and a reputational interest in
   forestalling an even worse humanitarian catastrophe. Although the Biden
   administration has not questioned whether Israel should act decisively,
   it has counselled caution and deliberation to buy time for hostage
   negotiations and to minimise civilian casualties while deploying US
   military assets to deter Iran and Hizbullah from directly initiating
   hostilities against Israel. The unprecedented horror of the attack makes
   the argument for Israeli restraint more difficult to make, but questions
   will undoubtedly arise as to how the US can move Israel away from a
   maximally aggressive posture to preserve its bona fides with the rest of
   the world, including some American voters. The US would best cast the
   crisis as an urgent prompt to a more agreeable future based on an
   affirmative, multilateral plan.},

Abstract = {How do we account for the ability or otherwise of regional organisations
   in the global South to enable equitable and inclusive responses to the
   COVID-19 pandemic? We answer this question with a focus on Africa and in
   relation to the rights of women and girls. Drawing on theoretical
   insights from Feminist Global Health Security and from data on the
   African Union, other regional organisations in Africa and from
   non-governmental organisations, local activists and medical centres, we
   show that regional organisations acted quickly to identify the gendered
   socio-economic and health needs of women and girls and alerted member
   states to their responsibility to consider gender rights in their policy
   responses. But weak gender norms led to a disconnect between this early
   recognition of the importance of policies to protect women and girls and
   the behaviour of regional organisations, which could not lead a gender
   sensitive response or engineer one in member state governments.},

Abstract = {With heated political and public debate over government vaccine
   mandates, COVID-19 offers an opportunity to better understand the role
   of policy justifications on people's perceptions towards a policy.
   Through this study, we aim to move beyond the partisan and ideological
   arguments for and against vaccine mandates to illustrate how
   individuals' worldviews, based on Cultural Theory, can better explain
   why people have different perceptions towards vaccine mandates. Using
   the judiciary and judicial reasoning as the setting, and controlling for
   individuals' preexisting opinion on COVID-19 vaccines, we hypothesize
   that people who prefer vaccine mandates will agree with judicial
   reasoning that appeals towards individualistic and hierarchical
   statements. Additionally, we hypothesize that those who have confidence
   in the judiciary will agree with individualistic and hierarchical
   statements. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a conjoint survey
   experiment through Amazon Mechanical Turk. The results confirm the
   hypotheses.},

Abstract = {The resurgence of populism has presented a grave threat to democratic
   governance across the globe. Drawing on a cross-national dataset of 155
   countries from 1960 to 2020, we leverage the leadership turnovers within
   countries and use fixed effects models to estimate the effect of
   populist leadership on corruption. We find that populist leadership is
   associated with a substantial increase in executive corruption, but not
   other types of corruption. We also provide evidence that populist
   leaders are more likely to undermine judicial and legislative
   constraints, which in turn opens the door for massive executive
   corruption. We further show that whereas affluent resources exacerbate
   populist leaders' corruption, high-quality bureaucracies, strong
   opposition parties, vigorous civil society organizations, and critical
   media work to mitigate the effect of populist leadership on corruption.
   This study contributes to the understanding of the nexus between
   populism and corruption and, more broadly, coping strategies for
   democratic backsliding.},

Abstract = {Policy diffusion is an important element of the policy formation
   process. However, understanding of the micro-level interactions
   governing policy spread remains limited. Much of the literature focuses
   on macro-level proxies for intergovernmental connectivity. These proxies
   outline broad diffusion patterns without specifying the micro-level
   mechanisms that govern how individuals facilitate that diffusion. The
   role of stakeholders in diffusion in the policy subsystem is also poorly
   understood. We construct a panel dataset covering the spread of the US
   ecotourism programs from 1993 to 2016 to investigate how micro-level
   movement within stakeholder networks explains state-level policy
   diffusion over time. Using fixed-effects regression, we find that
   stakeholder movement significantly drives diffusion, acting as a
   mechanism of knowledge transfer. Our findings provide a more precise
   theoretical understanding of how policy knowledge diffuses at the micro
   level, empirically explain the role of policy stakeholders in diffusion,
   and highlight the value of citizen-science data for policy research.},

Abstract = {This article deploys the term `green imperialism' to denote the
   specificities of contemporary imperialism within the context of the
   hoped-for global transition towards low-carbon capitalist economies and
   societies in the coming decades. The Democratic Republic of the Congo
   (DRC) provides a modern exemplar of green imperialist dynamics in
   action. Hegemonic powers are seeking to position the Congolese economy
   as an exporter of low-cost, low-carbon metals and an open market for the
   entry of renewable energy finance and technologies. To date, the
   political response to green imperialism in the DRC has reproduced a
   model of mining-led national development that historically has delivered
   little by way of material improvements for most of the population, thus
   undermining the prospects of prosperity in the country. Albeit this time
   around there is the possibility of expanded access for some to renewable
   forms of energy as a foreign-owned private commodity, with all the
   limitations and contradictions this new model of energy delivery
   entails.
   Dans cet article, le terme << imperialisme vert >> est utilise pour
   designer les specificites de l'imperialisme contemporain dans le
   contexte de la transition mondiale esperee vers des economies et des
   societes capitalistes a faible emission de carbone dans les decennies a
   venir. La Republique democratique du Congo (RDC) est un exemple moderne
   de dynamique imperialiste verte en action, les puissances hegemoniques
   cherchant a positionner l'economie congolaise en tant qu'exportateur de
   metaux a faible cout et a faible teneur en carbone et en tant que marche
   ouvert a l'entree des financements et des technologies d'energie
   renouvelable. La reponse politique a l'imperialisme vert en RDC
   reproduit un modele de developpement national base sur l'exploitation
   miniere qui, historiquement, n'a apporte que peu d'ameliorations
   materielles a la plupart des Congolais, sapant ainsi les perspectives de
   prosperite dans le pays. Cependant, cette fois-ci, il s'agit d'un modele
   avec la possibilite d'un acces elargi pour certains aux formes d'energie
   renouvelable en tant que marchandise privee detenue par des etrangers,
   avec toutes les limitations et contradictions que ce nouveau modele de
   fourniture d'energie implique.
   Neste artigo, o termo `imperialismo verde' e utilizado para denotar as
   especificidades do imperialismo contemporaneo no contexto da esperada
   transicao global para economias e sociedades capitalistas de baixo
   carbono nas proximas decadas. A Republica Democratica do Congo (RDC)
   fornece um exemplo moderno da dinamica imperialista verde em acao, com
   potencias hegemonicas procurando posicionar a economia congolesa como
   exportadora de metais de baixo custo e baixo carbono e como um mercado
   aberto para a entrada de financiamento e tecnologias de energia
   renovavel. A resposta politica ao imperialismo verde na RDC esta a
   reproduzir um modelo de desenvolvimento nacional liderado pela mineracao
   que, historicamente, pouco tem proporcionado em termos de melhorias
   materiais para a maioria dos congoleses, minando assim as perspetivas de
   prosperidade no pais. Ainda que desta vez com a possibilidade de acesso
   alargado de alguns a formas renovaveis de energia como mercadoria
   privada de propriedade estrangeira, e todas as limitacoes e contradicoes
   que este novo modelo de fornecimento de energia implica.},

Abstract = {The American president is the pontifex maximus of the American Civil
   Religion (ACR). While each U.S. president has their own `take' on ACR,
   they all endorse democratic values and serve as national pastors. All
   until Donald J. Trump. This article argues that Donald Trump is the
   first pontifex minimus in American history: the first leader to
   self-consciously endorse an anti-democratic civil religion as president.
   After providing the necessary background in ACR studies and the
   presidency, it explores Trump's religious values (derived from Norman
   Vincent Peale's power of positive thinking) and his political beliefs
   (especially his deep hostility toward democratic governance). It
   documents both throughout his presidency, but argues that they mature in
   the waning days of his term. Trump's decision to strike at the heart of
   the election ritual-the time during which American politics is at its
   most vulnerable-establishes him as the pontifex minimus of the civil
   religion of the Big Lie (CRBL).},

Title = {Authoritarian Norm Contestation and International Broadcasting: RT' s
   norm contestation strategy during the Ukraine Crisis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 29},
Abstract = {Norm contestation is a burgeoning area of research within International
   Relations (IR), particularly in the context of the evolving multi-order
   world. While critical constructivists have shed light on the dialogical
   nature of norm evolution and the significant role of discourses in norm
   construction, they have given little attention to the communicational
   process underlying these discourses. This paper argues that state-funded
   international broadcasters play a pivotal role in the contestation of
   the validity, meaning, and applicatory parameters of international
   norms. Unlike institutional contexts, international broadcasters do not
   contest norms through arguments but by projecting narratives using
   strategic assemblages of verbal, aural, and visual elements. Through an
   analysis of RT's coverage of the Ukraine Crisis (2014), the paper
   explicates how Russian state-sponsored propaganda has employed
   techniques such as liberal performance, liberal mimicry, civilizational
   essentialization, and counter-norm entrepreneurship to advance a
   favourable understanding of norms for Russia. The paper aims to
   contribute to the scholarship on norm contestation by authoritarian
   states, particularly by applying and attesting to Bettiza and Lewis's
   (2020) typology of norm contestation. Furthermore, it seeks to explore
   and theorize the relationship between norms and narratives in the
   ever-shifting global media ecology.},

Abstract = {International relations theory has long suggested that uncertainty
   during militarized crises pushes states to adopt escalatory behavior.
   However, the leadup to the Russo-Ukrainian War challenges this view,
   with Kyiv downplaying the risk of conflict and adopting a cautious
   foreign policy. I argue that Ukrainian behavior in the leadup to the war
   demonstrates the need to disaggregate between types of uncertainty.
   While uncertainty over an adversary's intentions and capabilities can
   push a state to adopt escalatory behavior, uncertainty regarding a
   potential adversary's military strategy and regarding the level of
   support it can expect from third parties incentivizes a state to assume
   a more cautious posture. The piece concludes with a reflection on
   disciplinary blind spots regarding the impact of uncertainty on state
   decision-making and offers suggestions for overcoming them.},

Title = {Twitter as political acclamation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Acclamation as political form of communication has been used to
   understand political phenomena by a range of 20th century thinkers and
   recently has been used to analyze social media. However, if the notion
   of social media as acclamation is to be fruitful, it should be closely
   connected to inherent features of social media as technology and should
   be available to empirical analysis. To do so, this study follows a
   mixed-method approach. First, we offer a theoretical analysis of
   acclamation and how it links to each of the constituent parts of social
   media. Next, we build upon this theoretical analysis to study
   acclamation and social media as a matter of empirical data analysis to
   analyse the Tweets of the US-Presidents Obama, Trump and Biden. We apply
   regression models to measure the effects of acclamation. Our results
   show that acclamation is an essential feature of political communication
   but different for each President. This is in parts caused by the
   algorithms of Twitter which have different effects on the communication
   of the three Presidents. Our findings expand the idea of social media as
   acclamation and prove its relevance to the current political discourse.},

Title = {The Gendered Peace Premium},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {The adage that ``only Nixon could go to China{''} suggests hawkish
   leaders face fewer domestic political barriers to pursuing conciliation
   with foreign adversaries. Since hawks are viewed as less ideologically
   predisposed to peace than doves, their efforts at rapprochement are more
   likely to be perceived as in the national interest. We explore how this
   conventional wisdom intersects with prominent gender stereotypes about
   women's role in national security. Do gender stereotypes that women are
   inclined toward peace make it more difficult for women leaders to pursue
   conciliation? In a series of survey experiments, we find evidence of a
   gendered peace premium-a penalty women leaders face for pursuing peace.
   When women leaders seek rapprochement with foreign adversaries, they are
   perceived as acting ``according to type.{''} Consequently, women's
   conciliatory policy proposals are viewed as less likely to be in the
   national interest than identical policies pursued by male leaders.
   Partisanship dynamics significantly moderate the gendered peace premium,
   and policy success can attenuate women leaders' disadvantage. While this
   discriminatory dynamic does not make it impossible for women leaders to
   seek and achieve peace, it does make it more difficult and politically
   costly than some perspectives assume.
   El proverbio de que << solo Nixon podria ir a China >> sugiere que los
   lideres de linea dura se enfrentan a menos barreras politicas internas
   para buscar la conciliacion con adversarios extranjeros. Dado que los
   lideres de linea dura (halcones) son vistos como menos predispuestos
   ideologicamente a la paz que los lideres de linea moderada (palomas),
   resulta mas probable que sus esfuerzos de acercamiento se perciban como
   de interes nacional. Estudiamos como esta sabiduria convencional se
   cruza con los estereotipos de genero prominentes sobre el papel de las
   mujeres en la seguridad nacional. Provocan los estereotipos de genero,
   que sugieren que las mujeres se inclinan mas hacia la paz, que resulte
   mas dificil para las mujeres lideres buscar la conciliacion? Encontramos
   evidencias, a traves de una serie de experimentos de encuesta, de una <<
   prima >> de genero en materia de paz, es decir, una penalizacion a la
   que se enfrentan las mujeres lideres por buscar la paz. Cuando las
   mujeres lideres buscan un acercamiento con adversarios extranjeros, se
   percibe que actuan << de acuerdo con el tipo >>. En consecuencia, se
   considera que las propuestas de politica conciliatoria por parte de las
   mujeres tienen menos probabilidades de ser de interes nacional que
   aquellas politicas identicas aplicadas por los lideres masculinos. La
   dinamica del partidismo modera significativamente la << prima >> de
   genero en materia de paz, y el exito de las politicas puede atenuar las
   desventajas que tienen las mujeres lideres. Si bien esta dinamica
   discriminatoria no provoca que sea imposible que las mujeres lideres
   busquen y logren la paz, si la hace mas dificil y politicamente costosa
   de lo que algunas perspectivas suponen.
   L'adage << only Nixon could go to China >> (seul Nixon pouvait aller en
   Chine) suggere que les dirigeants belliqueux sont confrontes a moins
   d'obstacles politiques dans leur pays quand il s'agit de poursuivre la
   conciliation avec des adversaires etrangers. Les acteurs belliqueux
   etant percus comme possedant moins de predispositions ideologiques pour
   la paix que les acteurs pacifistes, leurs efforts de rapprochement
   seront plus facilement percus comme correspondant a l'interet national.
   Nous analysons la relation de cette pensee conventionnelle avec les
   stereotypes genres predominants quant au role de la femme en securite
   nationale. Les stereotypes genres selon lesquels les femmes seraient
   plus enclines a la paix compliquent-ils la tache des femmes qui tentent
   d'obtenir la conciliation ? Dans une serie d'experiences de sondage,
   nous trouvons des preuves d'une prime de paix genree, c'est-a-dire une
   penalite que les dirigeantes risquent lorsqu'elles poursuivent la paix.
   Quand les dirigeantes tentent d'obtenir un rapprochement avec des
   adversaires etrangers, on estime qu'elles agissent << conformement a
   leur type >>. Par consequent, les propositions de conciliation des
   femmes sont moins souvent considerees comme etant dans l'interet
   national que des politiques identiques soutenues par des dirigeants. La
   dynamique partisane pondere de facon consequente la prime de paix
   genree, et la reussite politique est susceptible d'attenuer le
   desavantage des dirigeantes. Bien que cette dynamique discriminatoire ne
   signifie pas qu'il est impossible pour des dirigeantes de souhaiter et
   d'obtenir la paix, elle rend les choses bien plus difficiles et
   couteuses sur le plan politique que certaines perspectives le pensent.},

Abstract = {Although a number of texts have focused on the role of emotion in the
   dynamics of political mobilization, their focus has been predominantly
   on the initial stages of protest in the context of democratic or partly
   free societies. Using the case of the 2020-21 anti-police violence
   protests in Belarus, this article analyzes the role of emotional
   community in nondemocratic, authoritarian environments where vocal
   criticism is becoming increasingly risky, but the level of societal
   discontent remains high. Relying on mass media publications, comments on
   social media platforms, and ethnographic listening in Minsk, the article
   analyzes the emotional aspect of a protest that was followed by mass
   repressions. Two processes are identified that affect both protesters'
   emotional community and supporters of the regime: emotional split from
   the opposite side and the psychologization of resistance to violence.
   These two concepts are useful for understanding the emotional dynamics
   of protest in authoritarian contexts but also have wider application
   beyond such settings.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the nature and implications of the European
   Union (EU)'s recent discourse and policy approach towards Internet
   standards. Internet is a network of interconnected networks that can
   communicate with one another thanks to shared protocols, most often
   produced by standard-developing organisations. This research analyses
   the effects of the discursive turn of the EU - as part of its new
   digital sovereignty agenda - and investigates whether it has
   materialised into actual changes in the way the EU engages with the
   making process of Internet standards since 2019. This article shows that
   the EU's approach towards these arenas has been and remains
   inconsistent. It argues that the EU's increasing `digital assertiveness'
   and digital sovereignty discourses have led to a few noticeable policy
   evolutions, whose effects remain largely unintended and that could
   further normalise state-based interventions in the Internet
   architecture.},

Abstract = {As a cold war with China heats up, the U.S. and other members of the G7
   need new approaches to their science and technology innovation (STI)
   policies. Dominance on the innovation frontier is no longer possible
   through traditional techno-nationalist policies that view nations as
   `competing' through exclusive STI development. Instead, we must
   recognise that talent and intellectual property are globally
   distributed, and thus build global collaborations that draw on the
   world's greatest talent while providing benefits equitably in a global
   STI commons. We need to recognise this new reality, not only for the
   benefits this would confer on humankind, but also to contend with
   China's growing STI capabilities and, eventually perhaps, integrating
   China into a system of global collaboration. Additionally, and
   importantly, national policies must recognise the geographically
   untethered operations of multinational enterprises that are the
   developers and/or repositories of STI but have weak ties to any one
   nation, thus blunting policies that try to contain STI within a
   country's borders. In this paper, we suggest approaches to advance these
   goals for global STI based on theories and cases of collective action.},

Abstract = {IntroductionThis paper analyzes the extent to which the EU's involvement
   in Kosovo's political and economic development has contributed to the
   country's progress toward democratization and European
   integration.MethodsThe study employs a comparative analysis of the EU's
   engagement with Kosovo versus other Western Balkan countries. It also
   utilizes a case study approach to identify the unique challenges
   presented by Kosovo's contested statehood. Data sources include official
   EU reports, agreements, commentary from experts, and economic
   indicators.ResultsThe findings show the EU has played a pivotal role in
   Kosovo through deploying its assistance instruments, facilitating the
   normalization dialogue with Serbia, and laying out a potential accession
   path. However, non-recognition by five member states, disputes with
   Serbia, and struggles meeting EU reform criteria impact Kosovo's
   integration prospects.DiscussionDespite its substantial involvement, the
   EU faces credibility issues in Kosovo due to ongoing hurdles thwarting
   Kosovo's advancement toward accession. The EU must increase its leverage
   over Serbia, incentivize internal reforms, and align member state
   positions to support Kosovo's European integration. A clearer pathway to
   membership in Kosovo would reinforce the EU's role in fostering peace,
   democracy, and prosperity in the Western Balkans.},

Abstract = {To steer public opinion, autocracies prioritize state media reports of
   political news while marginalizing commercial and foreign media. Can
   this dominance guarantee people's trust in state media news? We contend
   that rumors, circulated via informal channels and resistant to state
   information control, present a formidable challenge to public trust in
   state media news. Our two survey experiments in China pitted news of
   varying information quality (e.g. informative/detailed reports vs
   cursory mentions of events) from state media sources against rumors,
   showing that state media news can retain high levels of trustworthiness
   only if its information quality is high; however, low-quality state
   media news resulting from information control diminishes its
   trustworthiness and prompts people to believe rumors. Low-quality rumors
   have more negative effects than high-quality rumors on news
   trustworthiness and citizens' satisfaction with government policies.
   Thus, information control can paradoxically erode trust in state media,
   which often represent the government in autocracies.},

Abstract = {How can and should post-conflict cities be rebuilt after traumatic
   violence and forced displacement? Five years following Mosul's
   liberation from the extremist reign of Islamic State, controversy
   surrounds attempts to revive the city's rich cultural heritage and
   pluralistic past. This paper examines Mosul's ongoing reconstruction
   initiatives, shaped by competing memory narratives and actors (local and
   international) vying for the right to reimagine the city. It explores
   how violent urbicide has ruptured Moslawi's identity and belonging,
   contributing to fragmented memories of the past and diverging
   aspirations for the future. Drawing on diverse perspectives from
   inhabitants within the city and its periphery, the article suggests that
   urban recovery must balance heritage restoration as a means to reviving
   traditions of co-existence while still acknowledging the traumatic
   memories of destruction and erasure. The opportunities for `building
   back better' must navigate fine margins between local sensibilities,
   international support and the illusive search for social recovery.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {433-451},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {This article explores four fundamental dimensions of how administrative
   states present moral hazards that reach deeply into the distortion of
   governmental structures, institutions and processes. These dimensions
   are (1) the undermining of governmental structural integrity, (2)
   displacement of political and regime values, (3) the promotion of amoral
   administrative thought, and (4) bureaucratic dysfunction and
   ossification. Although these dimensions are neither exhaustive nor
   mutually exclusive, they are substantial and have been under appreciated
   and analyzed in public administration's academic literature. The article
   concludes with five strategies for reducing such moral hazards. Although
   I illustrate with the United States, the moral hazards considered are
   not confined to it and are a feature of administrative states generally.},

Abstract = {Sustainability governance in polycentric systems needs to ensure both
   effectiveness and procedural justice. Effectiveness and procedural
   justice are intricately linked to power dynamics in governance. To
   assess polycentric sustainability governance, understanding different
   types, sources, and effects of power is key. Here, we investigate
   network-derived bonding and bridging social capital of actors as
   specific sources of power in polycentric sustainability governance. We
   ask two questions: How does bridging and bonding social capital
   translate into power? And: How is the power associated with satisfaction
   with inclusion? We relate levels of bonding and bridging social capital
   to power and satisfaction with inclusion in governance processes for 299
   actors in 10 cases of Swiss wetlands governance. Using a Bayesian
   multi-level regression model, we find that especially bonding social
   capital is a source of power for actors. Further, network-derived power
   but also nonnetwork-derived power by design translates into satisfaction
   with inclusion. Research and practice of sustainability governance need
   to be careful to account for power in nuanced ways, acknowledging its
   sources and relation to procedural justice.},

Abstract = {This contribution analyses conflicts around genocide memory in the
   diaspora. It shows how Assyrian/Syriac initiatives to create memorials
   to the 1915 genocide has triggered reactions by Turkish diaspora groups
   and the Turkish government. The Rwandan government, in contrast, has
   mobilized its diaspora to fight denial of Rwanda's 1994 genocide, while
   other diaspora activists draw attention to-and create commemorative
   practices around-other, silenced, mass-atrocities. The text discusses
   the opportunities for victimhood recognition and memorialization offered
   in the diaspora, and how genocide memory conflicts intertwine with
   foreign policy matters and national and local politics in the country of
   settlement.},

Abstract = {Policy agendas are a well-studied institutional level phenomenon that
   capture the set of policy issues that an institution pays attention to
   over time. They are emergent in nature in that individual behaviour
   shapes institutional level outcomes when policy makers allocate
   attention to policy issues. To examine the link between individual-level
   actions and system-level outcomes we introduce the concept of the
   agenda-setting constellation, defined as a group of policy makers paying
   attention to a set of policy issues. Taking the European Central Bank as
   a case study, and using a combination of text-analysis and
   networks-analysis techniques, we demonstrate how these meso-level
   structures shape the evolving policy agenda. We then examine the roles
   of personal experience, institutional constraints, and policy context in
   driving agenda-setter constellation membership. Our results show the
   value of studying policy agendas as networked processes and the key role
   that agenda-setter constellations play in driving policy agenda
   dynamics.},

   However, like the `rally-round-the-flag' effect (Mueller, 1970), public
   support wanes over time and we decompose this decrease into two
   elements: salience and polarisation at the domestic level for national
   and European policies in both soft and hard security (aid and
   sanctions). We show that while salience can sustain public support for
   European policy innovations, polarisation about national and
   (unexpectedly) European policies accelerates its decline. We thus
   qualify the story of EU polity formation through external security
   crises.},

Abstract = {This article advances the theory of policy paradigms by investigating
   when paradigms are rigid, constraining alternative perspectives and
   policy options, and when instead they are more flexible, allowing actors
   to overcome paradigmatic restrictions and differences. Departing from
   the existing theories on policy paradigms, I conceptualize paradigm
   rigidity and flexibility as characteristics that develop endogenously
   within the policy-making process, shaped by the types of policy changes
   that are proposed and discussed and by the types of framing strategies
   policy actors employ to support their proposals. Policy paradigms can
   therefore have both rigid and flexible modes within the same policy area
   and in the same period. Conceiving paradigms in modes helps us better
   understand how policies change when there are competing paradigms and
   exogenous crises. I illustrate this empirically with an analysis of the
   debates surrounding four antitrust (competition) policy change proposals
   in the USA during the 1970s.},

Abstract = {The literature has usually regarded street-level bureaucrats (SLBs) as
   relatively privileged bureaucrats, neglecting an important sub-group of
   these civil servants: low-status SLBs. Even though they may be members
   of a team with other SLBs who have more status, they may suffer from
   intraorganizational inequality, meaning unequal access to resources and
   the requirement that they perform informal tasks associated with their
   unequal position in the organization. We examine the unique challenges
   low-status SLBs are often confronted with, and how they cope with them.
   Based on 94 interviews with community health workers in Brazil, we
   identify several types of burdens associated with their ambiguous tasks,
   as well as the strategies they use to cope with these burdens. The
   analyses suggest that the burdens and coping strategies are an important
   source of the inequality on the team. The paper discusses the importance
   of considering the diversity of roles occupied by SLBs and the
   inequalities within teams.},

Abstract = {A growing body of research suggests that an individual's willingness to
   fight and die for groups is rooted in the fusion of personal and group
   identities, especially when the group is threatened, violence is
   condoned, and the group's enemies are dehumanised or demonised. Here we
   consider whether the language used by extremists can help with early
   detection of these risk factors associated with violent extremism. We
   applied a new fusion-based linguistic violence risk assessment framework
   to a range of far-right extremist online groups from across the violence
   spectrum. We conducted an R-based NLP analysis to produce a Violence
   Risk Index, integrating statistically significant linguistic markers of
   terrorist manifestos as opposed to non-violent communiques into one
   weighted risk assessment score for each group. The language-based
   violence risk scores for the far-right extremist groups were then
   compared to those of non-extremist control groups. We complemented our
   quantitative NLP analysis with qualitative insights that contextualise
   the violence markers detected in each group. Our results show that the
   fusion markers combined with several other variables identified across
   the different online datasets are indeed indicative of the real-world
   violence level associated with the relevant groups, pointing to new ways
   of detecting and preventing violent terrorism.},

Title = {Volunteers in Public Service Production: Modeling the Contributions of
   Volunteers to Organizational Performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 20},
Abstract = {Volunteer use as an alternative service delivery arrangement entails
   public organizations directly incorporating volunteers in service
   production through a quasi-employment relationship. However, research
   evaluating the contributions of volunteer labor to organizational
   performance are relatively few. This article fills this gap by drawing
   from two theoretical insights. First, this study tests a linear model
   based on the traditional human resource management approach of
   interchangeability in which volunteers constitute a one-on-one
   substitute for paid employees. Second, this study draws insight from
   critical mass theory to explore a nonlinear model based on the
   assumption that the productivity of one volunteer may not be equal to
   that of one paid employee due to the systematic limitations of volunteer
   labor. Analyzing a five wave panel dataset of 484 local law enforcement
   agencies in the United States that utilize sworn volunteers with general
   arrest powers, the findings indicate that an increase in the number of
   sworn volunteers has a linear negative effect on clearing violent crimes
   in sheriffs offices. However, the results also indicate evidence of
   curvilinear effects on clearing violent crimes in police departments.
   This article suggests the need to account for the systematic limitations
   of volunteer labor when measuring performance and to explore multiple
   indicators. This study contributes to theory building and testing by
   enabling a two-way understanding of the relationship between volunteer
   involvement and organizational performance in the public sector.},

Title = {Identity, status and role in UK foreign policy: Brexit and beyond},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 16},
Abstract = {Brexit-the UK's withdrawal from the European Union-is at the same time
   historic, controversial and of enduring significance. That description
   applies to both the UK's domestic politics and (the focus here) its
   external relations. This article introduces the special issue `Adapting
   to Brexit: Identity, Status and Role in UK Foreign Policy'. It suggests
   that Brexit has had a dual character-being a source of both anxiety and
   opportunity for the UK-and, in consequence, can be usefully analysed
   through the concept of role adaptation. A focus on national `roles' is a
   well-established way to think about what drives foreign policy. But role
   only makes sense when linked to the parallel concepts of status and
   identity. Insofar as Brexit has challenged (or, for some, has boosted),
   the status and identity of the UK, then so role adaptation becomes
   necessary. This piece outlines all three concepts-role, identity and
   status-placing them at the service of an analysis of Brexit's effects on
   British foreign policy. That framing is then deployed in the thematic
   articles which follow.},

Abstract = {In late-July 1961, US President John F. Kennedy announced a major
   military buildup over the dispute with the Soviet Union in Berlin. But
   why? The USA was superior militarily, and many Western leaders and
   policymakers considered the Soviet threat overblown. I offer an
   explanation for the puzzle: widespread fear among Kennedy and members of
   his administration, opposition leaders, the press, the diplomatic
   community, and international allies (i.e., his ``in-group{''}) that he
   lacked resolve. Their impression of him as irresolute-formed long before
   but continued to brew after he assumed the highest political
   office-drove the emotion. They were obsessed, less with ascertaining
   Soviet intention than with bolstering Kennedy's reputation for
   resolve-as they imagined it. As they expressed and fed on each other's
   emotion, their sense of crisis intensified. Pent-up fear gave rise to a
   ``cult of toughness,{''} culminating in and eventually finding outlet
   through Kennedy's dramatic show of force.},

Abstract = {Unexplained Wealth Orders, introduced in the United Kingdom in 2017,
   were designed to tackle the problem of transnational kleptocracy.
   However, our research on real estate purchases in the UK by elites from
   post-Soviet kleptocracies demonstrates that incumbent elites are
   invulnerable to attempts to question the legality of their wealth while
   exiles from these states often lose their property. From our original
   dataset of properties, we take a single exemplary case: one of
   incumbents Dariga Nazarbayeva and Nurali Aliyev, the daughter and
   grandson of Kazakhstan's first president, Nursultan Nazarbayev who were
   subject to one of the few UWOs issued and thereby had their properties
   frozen. In a close analysis of the legal documents from this case, this
   paper analyses how the properties were purchased and how the sources of
   wealth were subsequently explained as legitimate. We elaborate an
   exemplary case of transnational kleptocracy revealing how British legal
   services actively, passively, and structurally enable specific acts of
   money laundering. We further expose how they effectively explain
   kleptocratic wealth and why they are likely to continue to do so despite
   recent changes to laws and regulations.},

Title = {Possibilities and limits of procedural and distributive justice in

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},

Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {PurposeExtensive empirical evidence suggests that procedural justice
   (PJ) and distributive justice (DJ) are key success factors for achieving
   durable peace negotiations. This paper aims to investigate how
   complexity affects these factors and the outcomes in negotiations.
   Design/methodology/approachThe qualitative study is based on an
   examination of the peace negotiations that led to the 2016 agreement
   between the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Ejercito del
   Pueblo and the Colombian Government. Based on document analysis, the
   authors examined in detail how and where in the process the principles
   of PJ and DJ were applied. The authors then examined the implementation
   progress after 2016 and placed the peace process in the overall context
   of the Colombian conflict. FindingsThe authors found that the principles
   of PJ and DJ were present in both the negotiation process and the
   agreement. The negotiations were successful and satisfactory solutions
   could be found for all issues. The complexity of the conflict is
   reflected in the limited coverage of the peace negotiations. Not all
   groups, interests and subconflicts could be included in the
   negotiations. This limits their contribution to a durable peace in
   Colombia. Conflicts that remain unresolved also have a negative effect
   on the implementation of the agreement. Practical implicationsFor
   conflict management, this implies that the negotiations should not be
   viewed as ``one-and-done{''} but rather as a progressive, ongoing
   process. The agreement is only the nucleus for achieving total peace. It
   must be actively advanced and defended. Originality/valueThis study
   offers new qualitative insights into how PJ and DJ function in
   negotiations. It also establishes a systematic connection between PJ and
   DJ and complexity, introduces the notion of coverage and, thereby, opens
   a new perspective on the management of conflict complexity.},

Title = {Escaping or Reinforcing Hierarchies? Norm Relations in Transitional
   Justice},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {The global project of transitional justice (TJ) traditionally has been
   packaged in a multi-pillar model with criminal justice, truth recovery,
   reparations, institutional reform, and memorialization, and the norms
   they enshrine, seemingly presented as interventions of equivalent status
   at the level of policy. This article aims to enhance the theorizing on
   TJ as a ``norm cluster{''} by comparatively examining the relations
   between the norms found in the cluster in transitional practices in
   Colombia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. We claim that the relations between
   the norms of TJ are hierarchically organized, with the anti-impunity
   norm being positioned as normatively superior. Through an analysis of TJ
   processes in the two countries in the past three decades, we discuss how
   such a hierarchy was established, secured, and challenged. Our findings
   show that hierarchical relations arise primarily due to legitimacy
   concerns and are manifested as changes in the internal structure of the
   anti-impunity norm whereby its prescribed behaviors or measures, i.e.,
   criminal trials, seek to fulfill a range of new values. We argue that,
   in search for ownership and legitimacy, political actors have
   overemphasized the role of criminal trials by increasing their ``social
   weight{''} and positioned them as indispensable for achieving the values
   of truth, reconciliation, and non-recurrence, disturbing the internal
   structures and co-opting the spaces of other measures in the TJ norm
   cluster. Such normative superiority of anti-impunity is significant and
   detrimental for the TJ global project. It has resulted in other TJ
   mechanisms being weakened by or dependent on judicial procedures, and it
   has enhanced competing and revisionist truth-making while promoting a
   narrow understanding of accountability. Ultimately, we establish that
   the normative superiority of criminal justice continues to challenge the
   prospects of complex and comprehensive TJ and that the place of
   anti-impunity in the norm cluster should be rethought.},

Abstract = {Under Xi Jinping, China puts regime security and a revived ideology, `Xi
   Thought', at the core of its foreign policy. This distorts how `national
   interest' is calculated and impedes China from behaving in the way
   neoclassical realism suggests a rising superpower would behave. Xi
   adheres to a China-first approach. The United States and its partners
   could respond more effectively to China's conduct in three main ways.
   Firstly, they could stop framing their competition with China as one of
   democracy versus authoritarianism, as this has limited appeal for the
   Global South. Secondly, insofar as Xi's approach is often not conducive
   to his stated goals for his `China dream', the US could allow him to
   undermine them himself. Finally, the US could adopt a foreign policy of
   putting the interests of the global community first, as it effectively
   did during the Cold War, such that America's allies would be more
   willing to support the United States over China in a crisis, and other
   countries less prone to taking sides against the US.},

Abstract = {What do people do in the face of violence, war, and tragedy? How do
   those touched by violence survive, live on, keep on going and feeling?
   What if `dance first, think later' IS the natural order? In this paper,
   I propose dancing as an everyday, embodied, and multisensorial register
   of war. Combining new trajectories in war and military studies with
   ongoing feminist scholarship on war, embodiment, and emotions and
   interdisciplinary research on dance and electronic music, this paper
   explores entanglements between sites of political violence, militarism,
   and electronic dance music and culture. Drawing upon my research in
   Northern Ireland and Bosnia and Herzegovina, I argue that attending to
   these unseen entanglements activates distinctive ways of knowing the
   politics of war: they reveal alternative narratives of armed conflict
   mediated through and in between DJ performances, dancing bodies, and
   electronic sounds. These experiences offer important insights that
   unsettle taken for granted locations and affective economies of war
   while also reproducing conflict logics and divisions. I propose dance as
   a heuristic device that can recalibrate our understanding of the
   sensuous, affective, and embodied politics of/in war, enabling us to
   explore fragile possibilities for resistance and escape from its grip.},

Abstract = {A large literature analyzes the determinants of change in international
   institutions, focusing on the role of systemic political and economic
   shocks. However, this article considers this question also in more
   business-as-usual periods, asking when institutions of global governance
   reform and which states benefit from these changes. The authors argue
   that allies of international organizations (io)s' leading stakeholders
   benefit more than nonaligned countries; however, the authors also
   document that reforms sometimes contain concessions to nonallied
   members. This article theorizes that while io officials reward major
   stakeholders' allies in normal times, they provide concessions to
   nonallies during periods of poor io performance to prevent these states
   from disengaging. Analyzing an original data set of reforms at the World
   Bank between 1944 and 2018, paired with qualitative evidence, the
   article finds significant support for its hypotheses. The findings help
   to make sense of otherwise puzzling instances of power shifts within
   ios.},

Abstract = {IntroductionElections allow citizens to participate in the political
   process and to choose those candidates they consider suitable to govern
   their nation. MethodsIn this context, this research aims to investigate
   the level of knowledge of Ecuadorians about the authorities, for which a
   survey was applied to 1,376 inhabitants from different provinces and
   ages. The survey evaluated knowledge about executive function, mayor and
   prefect, legislative office positions, assembly members and councils.
   ResultsThe information showed that people know more about the functions
   of the mayor, followed by the assemblyman, prefect and finally council,
   admitting that age is a correlated factor. It was also seen that
   Ecuadorians show they know more about the functions of the prefect than
   of the mayor, also reinforcing the premise: the older the person, the
   more knowledge he/she has about executive functions of popular
   representations. However, in legislative functions, there is more
   knowledge about the work of councils than the members, unlike what was
   evidenced before. Regarding age, a significant variation is observed,
   demonstrating that the group between 27 and 64 years is the one with
   more correct options. ConclusionsThe results reveal the urgent need of
   governments, academia and society in general to work on electoral
   processes literacy.},

Abstract = {Most nuclear dyads are characterized by some degree of nuclear and
   conventional asymmetry. This paper argues that these asymmetries create
   an environment in which deliberate nuclear first use (DNFU) can be
   rational. This possibility has been discarded in the formal literature
   on nuclear escalation because of the common reliance on the assumption
   of mutually assured destruction (MAD). This paper develops a formal
   model that traces how and under what circumstances two types of DNFU are
   rational. First, nuclear imbalances and advancements in counterforce
   technologies create a damage limitation incentive for a strong actor.
   Second, conventional asymmetry creates an incentive for the coercive use
   of nuclear weapons by the weaker player. Moreover, this paper
   illustrates that these asymmetric conditions are a relevant
   characteristic in important and very different nuclear dyads: DPRK-US,
   Pakistan-India, and Russia-US. Thus, the model demonstrates the
   potential core drivers of DNFU in today's nuclear landscape.},

Title = {The UK `othered'? External perceptions of Brexit},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 14},
Abstract = {Brexit significantly altered external perceptions of the UK. In the case
   of Brexit, perceptions developed in ways that largely escaped the UK
   government's control given the absence of a compelling diplomatic
   narrative on the part of the British government. These perceptions
   implied an `othering' of the UK in the eyes of external constituencies,
   a process reinforced by British government positions which amounted to
   an exercise in differentiation by design. This article analyses the
   significance, for the UK's future status, role and identity, of the
   views held by key Brexit stakeholders including EU Member States and the
   USA. It finds that most perceptions were formed early; that these were
   continually calibrated alongside the UK's actions on non-Brexit
   developments such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and that the wilful
   self-othering undertaken by the UK has had ramifications for the UK's
   domestic politics as well as its international relations.},

Abstract = {Scholars of responsive forms of governance tend to analyze agreements,
   arrangements, and architectures. Yet, these forms of governance also
   require actual actors to act and interact, something that has been
   scarcely empirically studied. Taking a practice-theoretical approach, I
   explore how responsive governance is accomplished in and through
   meetings. This study is based on participant observation, interviews,
   and document analysis of governance of child and family services in the
   Netherlands. It contributes to our current understanding of responsive
   forms of governance by situating its everyday practice in meetings. A
   second contribution can be found in the thorough analysis of its
   everyday practices, with actors continuously calibrating tasks,
   performance, scope, and authority. Third, this study develops an
   understanding of how practices of responsive governance relate to
   structural governance arrangements, exposing how structural contours can
   be challenged and changed, while other actions result in changes that
   remain invisible.},

Abstract = {This article looks at the equalization/normalization problem through the
   lens of campaign spending and investigates the effect of expenses for
   digital tools on the electoral result of individual candidates in an
   open list proportional representation system. A multilevel analysis of
   the campaign expenses of 1253 serious contenders in the Belgian 2019
   concurrent federal, regional, and European elections shows that the
   investment in both owned Web 1.0 media and paid Web 2.0 media does not
   have an effect on electoral performance. Investing in traditional tools,
   by contrast, does have a significant positive effect. While most
   candidates use digital tools, they invest only a small part of their
   budget in these, which may explain the absence of a digital expense
   effect. These findings put the use of digital campaigning in
   perspective, showing that the effect of paid online tools should not be
   overestimated, and that the role of traditional campaigning is still
   dominant.},

Abstract = {Do presidential climate change narratives increase related congressional
   attention in the United States? Narrative theory says since narratives
   leverage cognitive heuristics, they should focus policy-making attention
   in institutions more efficiently than non-narrative statements. This
   study identifies and tests climate change statements and narratives,
   including those focused on solutions, or ``stories of hope,{''} and
   those focused on problems and victims, ``stories of fear,{''} for
   relationships with congressional attention using time series analysis.
   Findings suggest a relationship between narrative and hearings, but not
   for non-narrative statements and hearings. Furthermore, while narratives
   are related to hearings generally, stories of fear have larger effects,
   but only in conditions of single party control of the US Presidency and
   Congress. This analysis supports theory about narratives and
   institutional influence and offers the additional concept of stories of
   fear and hope as impactful on political institutions.},

Abstract = {This article presents the ``Competitive Rent-Seeking Model{''} that
   accounts for how reform policies paved the way for sustainable economic
   growth in ``authoritarian transition economies{''} despite widespread
   corruption. Competitive rent-seeking refers to the process whereby the
   entry barrier to rent generating economic activities, once monopolized
   by a small number of vested interests, has been lowered inviting more
   potential rent-seekers into the system. This was accomplished by
   enacting decentralizing and market-friendly reform policies that in turn
   exacerbated corruption but boosted production efficiency leading to
   improved social welfare. The model is exemplified by the Chinese and
   Vietnamese experiences during the 1980s. Furthermore, this article
   demonstrates that the model is applicable to the North Korean economy
   under Kim Jong Un's economic reform policy of the ``Socialist System of
   Responsible Business Operation in Economic Management{''} initiated in
   2014.},

Abstract = {Who comprised the political bureaus of the Eastern Bloc? There exists a
   wealth of literature on the former communist party elites, studying
   their personal biographies and group dynamics. However, we still lack an
   accessible resource cataloguing these individuals and documenting their
   personal and professional histories. This research note introduces new
   individual-level data on 787 candidate and full members from the ruling
   politburos of nine communist regimes across Eastern Europe. Along with
   compiling a centralized roster establishing who made up the politburos
   and at what times, I also code a range of descriptive variables for each
   elite, opening for better study of their comparative traits within and
   across space and time. These data are an important step toward more
   accessible documentation of the histories of ruling party elites in
   communist regimes, centralizing valuable information for future scholars
   to study, reference, and utilize.},

Abstract = {As with previous crises, EU-wide risk-sharing has also been demanded
   during the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet, this crisis did not unfold in a
   political vacuum. Instead, public backing for EU-wide risk-sharing might
   have been informed by past crises experiences. Building on the idea of
   experienced reciprocal risk-sharing, we assume that the willingness to
   share risks is greater when a crisis-ridden country has also shown
   solidarity before, whereas readiness to cooperate may be mitigated by
   non-solidarity-oriented behaviour in the past. We test this assumption
   based on a survey experiment carried out in eleven EU countries in 2020.
   Our findings suggest that, when people are given information about
   whether another country has acted in solidarity in the past, this
   influences their willingness to support risk-sharing in the present.
   However, we also find evidence that respondents' preferences outside the
   experimental setting do not always match their country's recent history
   of reciprocal risk-sharing.},

Abstract = {Much research examines the state-dissident nexus by large-n studies and
   rational choice theories. This article contributes an analysis of
   dissident reasoning through a computational evaluation of ethnographic
   interviews. The analysis shows that dissident decision-making is based
   on tit-for-tat deliberations: Dissidents choose violent means primarily
   in response to violent repression, and nonviolent means in response to
   nonviolent repression. Ordinary citizens not participating in dissent
   consider positive state behavior or safety concerns instead. Consistent
   with arguments that state-dissident interactions are reciprocal, these
   findings reveal unexpected cognitive similarities between political
   dissent and cooperation, which is often associated with tit-for-tat
   deliberations. They also show the importance of state repression
   compared with other motivators of dissent, including perceived relative
   deprivation and social contagion. The findings identify heuristic
   patterns of reasoning which suggest that dissidents may be more open to
   change and, ultimately, cooperation with state authorities than what is
   argued by repressive states.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the debate about democratic discontent and
   far right party support taking into account the heterogeneity of the far
   right voter pool. Distinguishing between peripheral far right voters
   driven by discontent, and core far right voters driven by nationalism,
   we argue that citizens' evaluations of the democratic process are
   associated with their electoral behaviour; but this relationship varies
   depending on their immigration attitudes. Using data from 9 waves of the
   European Social Survey (2002-2018), we confirm that whereas among the
   general population positive evaluations of the democratic process may
   serve as a deterrent for far right party support, the same assessments
   are unlikely to deter the far right's core ideological voters. In some
   circumstances, they might have a galvanising effect, prompting a
   backlash among some core voters. Our findings add nuance to voting
   behaviour theories, and illustrate why scholars should pay more
   attention to far right intra-partisan heterogeneity.},

Title = {Debating E-voting throughout Europe: constitutional structures, parties'
   concepts and Europeans' perceptions},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Techno-optimists with a more cosmopolitan focus agree that E-voting lies
   at the heart of implementing e-government and digitalization into
   democratic structures. The example of the ``e-state{''} Estonia proves
   the relevance: E-voting has been in (legal) practice since 2005, and
   research can take much empirical evidence from this laboratory for
   digital innovation. The fact that Estonia is an exception to the rule
   within the European Union (EU) member states explains the comparative
   approach to the (possible) legal framework for eparticipation. With
   focusing on liberal democracies' constitutional predefinitions, voting
   procedures in the virtual age have not been compared yet. However, we
   have yet to learn much about the extent to which E-voting exists in
   European constitutions, even after one generation of intense debate
   about its possible implementation. Perceptions of E-voting matter
   because of the omnipresent digital transformation and discussions about
   how democracies (could) digitalize. E-voting represents a bottom-up part
   of top-down e-government and, through this, digital transformation. This
   research explores whether party policies, legal frameworks, and
   citizens' perceptions resemble E-voting on the national and European
   levels. To explore this question, several mixed-methods approaches are
   used. The question of ``legalistic opportunity structures{''} is
   approached by relying on legal frameworks of European member states,
   parties' policies derived from their manifestos, and survey data from
   three Eurobarometer waves. Using a dictionary approach, the research
   design analyses the constitutions, electoral laws and manifestos of
   parties running for the European elections, combined with a classic
   analysis of surveys. Therefore, these sources are analyzed using several
   mixed methods approaches. The results have broader implications that we
   need to study in more detail what the digital transformation and the
   constitutionalization of electronic decision-making entail to develop a
   digital democracy and link it to a public sphere throughout Europe.
   Ultimately, it is analyzed whether the EU will push its member states to
   E-voting and implement E-voting for European elections. This would
   question the normative basing of democracy and how responsivity is
   brought into place.},

Abstract = {Research has examined the impact of the ``entrepreneurial university{''}
   on regional socioeconomic development by focusing on the entrepreneurial
   intentions and performance of alumni, staff, and students. The study of
   impact, to date, has focused on direct and short-term mechanisms, such
   as alumni's entrepreneurial activities, faculty spin-outs, and active
   public engagement with policy agendas. Our point of departure is in
   conceptualizing and empirically testing a longer-term and more systemic
   mechanism. We theorize and empirically test how the entrepreneurial
   university imprints on its graduates, some of whom take on leadership
   positions in innovation policymaking years later. We test this
   relationship by employing a text-as-data approach to examine the extent
   to which innovation policy leaders speak about startup-centric
   innovation, comparing the media coverage of entrepreneurial university
   alumni relative to their peers. Our original dataset comprises the 485
   individuals who held senior innovation policy positions in East Asia's
   eleven largest economies from 1998 to 2019, detailing their educational
   background and media coverage (10,816 documents). We conceptualize the
   ``alumni policymaker{''} mechanism, which constitutes entrepreneurial
   university alumni shaping the future of national innovation policy by
   referring to startup-centric innovation three times more than their
   peers. Those who completed MBAs at entrepreneurial universities express
   an even greater preference for startup-centric innovation policy.},

   activities as proportional responses to the challenges governments face,
   historical work reveals instances of disproportionate repression. This
   literature, moreover, is inconclusive regarding the effects of communist
   and military regimes on violations of physical integrity rights. Another
   shortcoming of current work is that different types of repression are
   modeled separately. I distinguish between oppression (restrictions on
   speech), repression (the use of beatings, arrests, and trials to
   restrain the rights of assembly and association), and state terrorism
   (when governments intimidate political opponents using extrajudicial
   violence). I examine the relationships among them in a multivariate
   regression framework from 1952 to 2010. My analysis reveals that
   communist dictatorships repress the freedoms of expression, travel, and
   association, whereas military dictatorships engage in extrajudicial
   violence. My study contributes to the literature by providing an
   institutional account of why tactics of repression differ between these
   two political systems, and by considering the effects of temporal lags,
   endogeneity, and diffusion processes on state repression.},

Abstract = {How does the politicisation of trade policy affect the lobbying
   strategies chosen by interest groups? Several studies have shown that
   business associations tend to focus more on inside lobbying and citizen
   groups more on outside lobbying. We argue that politicisation makes this
   difference in lobbying strategy even more pronounced. Facing an issue
   that is contested and publicly salient, we should see business actors
   move even more toward inside lobbying and citizen groups move even more
   toward outside lobbying. We test this argument using a unique
   combination of evidence from a survey with 691 interest groups and an
   analysis of Twitter usage with respect to the Transatlantic Trade and
   Investment Partnership (TTIP) by 993 interest groups. The empirical
   evidence largely supports our argument. By making and testing this
   argument, we contribute to the literatures on the politicisation of
   trade policy and interest group strategies.},

Abstract = {Street-level bureaucrats are often grassroots officials, and they are
   regarded as passive practitioners of policy with no authority to change
   policy or innovate, while policy entrepreneurs are usually high-level
   officials. Based on observations of China's responses to two national
   crises, this study found that the times do make a hero. When acting as
   innovative frontline technocrats, major transboundary crisis
   practitioners, and management savvy operators within the top-down
   bureaucracy, street-level bureaucrats can become policy entrepreneurs.
   To innovate and drive policy change, street-level policy entrepreneurs
   will adopt innovative strategies. They will make efficient use of their
   expertise and discretion, integrate various resources, strive for
   attention from superiors, consolidate their achievements, and expand
   their influence.},

Abstract = {Former legislators who lobby exacerbate the effects of financial
   resources on the relative political influence that various organized
   interests achieve. These lobbyists receive more income and achieve
   favorable policy outcomes more often than other lobbyists. The value of
   these revolving-door lobbyists, however, is contingent on the continued
   presence of former colleagues in legislatures. Former legislators
   achieve influence because of their insider connections, and membership
   turnover among incumbents decreases the value of this asset for interest
   groups. I examine the incomes and clienteles of former legislators who
   lobbied in the American states over seven decades. Turnover is a
   consistent, negative predictor of revolver value. This effect is
   enhanced by the presence of legislative staff support. This study is the
   first to examine the value of revolving-door lobbyists in the state
   legislatures. My findings imply that reforms that induce turnover help
   to level playing fields of political advocacy among interests with
   different levels of financial resources.},

Title = {The `Long Spring' of migration management: Labour supply in the
   pandemic-induced EU border regime},

Abstract = {Pandemic-induced border lockdowns in the spring of 2020 severely
   disrupted the migrant-labour supply in Western EU economies. This
   disruption of the EU border regime took place for different, even
   opposite reasons than the so-called `crisis' of 2015, which is also
   known as the `long summer' of migration. Indeed, where the latter
   originated from migrants' massive appropriation of mobility, the
   disruption of 2020 resulted from state-imposed restrictions on mobility.
   However, by comparatively analysing two models of work organisation in
   the agro-industrial sector, characterised by a strong reliance on mobile
   labour and thus particularly affected by the border lockdowns of 2020
   (harvest of crops in Italy and meat processing in the Netherlands), I
   argue that states' response to the disruption of border regime in 2020
   relied on a pre-existing logistical approach in migration management,
   adopted in the aftermath of 2015. More specifically, during the pandemic
   the ethical minimalism intrinsic in the logistical approach allowed a
   decoupling of migrant workers' right to mobility, on one hand, and
   social and economic rights, on the other, thus resulting in increased
   discipline in the workplace, exposure to infections, exploitation, and
   dependency on the employer, to which migrant workers opposed more or
   less visible forms of resistance.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) revived the enlargement process in response to
   the Russia-Ukraine war. That reaction compares to how the EU utilized
   this process following the wars in the Balkans in the 1990s. In this
   paper, we argue that on neither occasion was the inclusion of more
   states within EU borders a preferred EU working agenda. Instead, the EU
   used enlargement as a stabilization and security-building mechanism
   without guaranteeing membership as the end state. This observation has
   implications for the future of the enlargement process. We argue that
   the outcome of the previous rounds of enlargement was reactive and
   context-driven. Absent those same contextual factors, and although the
   EU reacts to the Russia-Ukraine war in a familiar sequence of incomplete
   decision-making, the outcome of this wartime enlargement negotiation
   process points in a different direction.},

Abstract = {The war in Ukraine sends mixed signals about the capacity of the EU to
   be a relevant actor. Despite steps forward over defense, strategic
   autonomy has been seen as a `pipe dream' that has encountered a `reality
   check'. Key member states are in a similar predicament. Despite talk of
   a Zeitenwende, Germany has been dimed a `reluctant giant'. France has
   allegedly seen discourse on European sovereignty vindicated, but at the
   same time has managed to alienate a few EU countries. We interpret this
   ambivalence as an effect of the fragmentation of the liberal
   international order, accelerated by war in Ukraine, and claim that this
   process is increasing the requirements for EU actorness. We then
   identify a range of reactions to such situation. We map them and
   leverage the mapping to offer a research agenda on the politics of EU
   foreign policy.},

Abstract = {Ordoliberalism has been accused of being the ideational blueprint for
   Germany's fiscal stance during the Eurozone-crisis. While the literature
   that debates the influence of ordoliberalism on crisis politics is
   growing, there is a lack of studies tracing the ordoliberal influence
   within Germany. This study shows that ordoliberalism had very limited
   influence on the creation of German institutions and its economic
   knowledge regime. Where ordoliberalism can be found is in the
   bureaucracy. This influence will come to an end with the last
   ordoliberals retiring. The article reconstructs how the reorientation of
   German economics towards the global economics profession crowded out
   ordoliberalism. Ordoliberalism, publishing mostly in German and not
   being able to formalize its theory, could not keep up with modern German
   economics. This will also dry up the supply of ordoliberal staff for the
   bureaucracy. The article shows also that ordoliberalism lives on as part
   of the German conservative political tradition.},

Journal = {CRITICAL MILITARY STUDIES},

Volume = {9},

Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Operators of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within the military have
   increasingly been recognized as potential sufferers of immense stress
   and trauma as a result of the conditions they are exposed to. In cases
   of such trauma, the provision for and access to sufficient mental health
   care is vital to minimize risks of developing conditions such as
   Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), moral injury or high emotional
   distress. Through integrating psychological studies and data with
   critical feminist security studies, this article attempts to establish
   the validity of drone operators as victims of trauma within the broader
   context of drone warfare. The aim of this article is to not only
   highlight this trauma suffered by drone operators, but to also openly
   address the ongoing stigma and factors that prevent them from seeking
   adequate mental health care. Drone operators exposed to trauma are
   further stigmatized and emasculated by their peers, resulting in a
   decrease in uptake of available mental health support. Through adopting
   a gendered approach, the article explores how this stigma invalidates
   much of the experiences and trauma suffered by drone operators, but
   furthermore is structured by ideas of masculinity and emasculation.
   Recognizing this stigma and emasculation is not only important for
   understanding military order and the masculinized dynamics of state
   violence, but vital for addressing the wider issues of trauma in drone
   warfare.},

Abstract = {Nations mired in prolonged conflict develop and disseminate societal
   beliefs to address society's needs. These beliefs are also used to
   garner support in the international arena. Two key beliefs commonly
   voiced to the international community by leaders of rival parties
   concern the threats posed to their nation and their nation's aspiration
   for peace. Not accounting for power differences, so common in
   international conflicts, current literature asserts that both parties in
   conflict express these beliefs. However, we suggest that the extent
   these beliefs are voiced depends on the nations' relative power. Namely,
   we hypothesize that because of inferior capabilities, low-power nations
   are likely to mention the threats posed to their security and their
   eagerness for peace more frequently than high-power nations. To test our
   hypothesis, we analyzed the entire corpus of speeches made by Israeli
   and Palestinian representatives speaking at the United Nations General
   Debate between 1998 and 2020. We found that although representatives
   from both parties spoke about the threats posed to their security and
   their eagerness for peace, both beliefs were voiced more frequently by
   speakers from the low-power party (in this case, Palestinians) than the
   high-power party (Israelis). Implications for psychological research of
   nations in conflict are discussed.},

Abstract = {Lowering the voting age from 18 to 16 years has recently been a hot
   topic of the political debate in many democratic countries. This study
   investigated whether the voting quality of 16-17-year-olds is inferior
   to that of the voting population. Shortly before the 2021 German federal
   election, two samples, representative for age and gender, indicated
   personal preferences about various political issues and weighted them
   according to importance, allowing for the calculation of individual
   expected values for political parties. Participants then indicated their
   voting choice. These choices were normatively correct when individuals
   voted for the party that best reflected their preferences, that is, the
   one maximizing the expected value. Results show that the voting
   decisions of 16-17-year-olds were as good as those by eligible voters.
   The study indicates that the exclusion of 16-17-year-old Germans in
   democratic elections cannot be justified by their lack of
   decision-making ability.},

Abstract = {Organizational ecology has attracted growing interest in global
   governance research in recent years. As a structural theory, however,
   organizational ecology has overlooked how organizations may shape the
   organizational environment by their own choices. Bridging the insights
   of organizational ecology and the study of nongovernmental organizations
   (NGOs), I argue that the organizational choice of specialism (as opposed
   to generalism) increases the power of NGOs to influence an environmental
   condition-issue salience-by targeting a small but engaged segment of the
   public. Focusing on wildlife conservation governance, I collected new
   comprehensive data on NGOs and issue characteristics (2008-2015). My
   empirical analysis shows that specialist NGO density is strongly
   associated with issue salience. I further examined causal processes in
   the case of pangolin conservation advocacy, in which specialist NGOs
   first raised issue salience and generalist NGOs followed. The findings
   suggest a division of labor among NGOs and challenge a conventional view
   that the power of NGOs is concentrated in a small number of prominent
   organizations.},

Abstract = {Does exposure to terrorism affect attitudes toward immigration policy?
   If so, is it the sense of threat that impacts these attitudes? Previous
   studies could not find conclusive evidence of increasing hostility
   toward out-groups as a direct consequence of terrorist events, as they
   struggle to separate attitudinal migration policy preferences and
   reactions to terrorism. Drawing on intergroup threat theory, we
   conducted two original public opinion polls (N = 954) in Israel, using a
   unique model that refined both the measure of the intensity of exposure
   to terrorism-more intensive (Study 1) and less intensive (Study 2)-and
   differences in the measure of different levels of geographic proximity
   to the attacks (high/low). Results indicate that in times of intense
   terror attacks, high levels of exposure to such attacks affect people's
   conflict-related threat perceptions, which drive their support for
   exclusionary migration policies. These findings improve our
   understanding of the spillover effects of terrorism on public opinion
   about migrants who are not involved in the conflict that prompts the
   terror attacks.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the power struggles of executives and legislators in a
   kingship budget setting, the study sheds light on the role of informal
   power in budget decisions and what makes one of the key actors more
   powerful than the other in the budgeting process. The study employs a
   qualitative case study collecting data through face-to-face interviews,
   observations, and documentary analysis. The paper advances the research
   stream of budget politics in public administration literature,
   highlighting the intense exercise of informal power to drive budget
   decisions. The paper provides evidence that informal power has heavily
   influenced the interactions between executives and legislators by the
   King and his fictive kin, exercised by formal and informal mechanisms
   (e.g., half-room meetings). Utilizing Weber's traditionalism, we
   demonstrate that the role of informal power over formal power is
   especially critical in a context where democratic institutions have no
   solid foundation.},

Volume = {67},

Abstract = {The imposition of sanctions by the UN Security Council (UNSC) is
   notoriously selective. Many crises have qualified for UNSC sanctions by
   endangering peace and security, yet the UN has imposed sanctions in only
   a few. Selectivity in UNSC sanctions is conventionally explained by
   conflict intensity or the interests of the Council's permanent members.
   Complementing these accounts, we document a third explanation:
   pre-existing sanctions by regional organizations. We argue that the UNSC
   has incentives to sanction countries which are already under sanctions
   by regional organizations because regional sanctions embody neighborhood
   consensus on the legitimacy of these sanctions and reassure the Council
   about implementation. Statistical analyses of original data, text
   analyses, a case study, and interviews strongly support our argument:
   regional sanctions increase the likelihood of UNSC sanctions adoption,
   particularly when these are enacted by regional organizations composed
   of neighboring states. This study advances research on sanctions,
   conflict resolution, and regime complexity.},

Abstract = {Researchers are increasingly recognizing that social movements are
   crucial for realizing deliberative democratic values. However, this
   raises two important questions: (1) what actions should count as
   deliberation and (2) whether we should demand more from activists than
   merely provoking or encouraging deliberation in a society. Building on
   current research on activists' actual engagement with deliberation, we
   argue that the standard of taking a ``deliberative stance{''} (being
   respectful, sincere, and public-minded) is a good starting point for
   addressing both questions. By taking a deliberative stance, movements
   benefit from deliberation themselves and contribute to deliberative
   systems. However, we should also acknowledge that forms of deliberation
   change, and discovering new forms is a crucial part of what movements do
   for democracy. We propose to adopt a principle we call ``reflective
   inclusion,{''} which allows us to engage abductively with new actions
   that might expand and deepen our understanding of what deliberation may
   look like.},

Abstract = {The emergence and growth of incel subculture online has triggered a
   considerable body of research to date, most of which analyzing its
   worldview or mapping its position and connections within the broader
   manosphere. While this research has considerably enhanced our
   understanding of the incel phenomenon, it tends to offer a somewhat
   static, one-dimensional portrayal of what is-like all online subcultures
   and communities-a highly dynamic and multi-layered environment.
   Consequently, we lack sufficiently nuanced answers to what is arguably a
   critical question for law enforcement and academics alike: is this a
   violent extremist ideology? Using a uniquely extensive corpus covering a
   range of online spaces constitutive of the incelosphere spanning several
   years, we analyze the evolution of incel language across both time and
   platforms. Specifically, we test whether this language has grown more
   extreme over time as online spaces shutdown and others emerged. Our
   findings demonstrate that, while levels of violent extremist language do
   vary across the incelosphere, they have steadily increased in the main
   online spaces over the past 6 years. Further, we demonstrate that, while
   activity on these online spaces is responsive to offline events, the
   impact of these on violent extremist ideation is not uniform.},

Abstract = {Why do people in authoritarian countries think more positively of their
   governments than people in democratic countries? Existing research
   suggests three explanations: (1) people in authoritarian countries lie;
   (2) people in authoritarian countries are indoctrinated; and (3)
   authoritarian governments have better performance than their democratic
   counterparts. In this study, I explore a fourth explanation - people in
   authoritarian countries apply lower standards. To test it, I apply the
   anchoring vignettes method developed by Gary King and others to original
   data from China, Vietnam, Russia, Mexico, and the United States, and
   from the cities of Beijing and Taipei. Adding a case study of Taiwan's
   economic trajectory as a robustness check, I conclude that people in
   authoritarian countries tend to use lower standards when reporting
   political trust and government responsiveness, but the lower standards
   are likely to be caused by fast economic growth rather than
   authoritarianism.},

Abstract = {This longitudinal study examines the role that students' political
   reputation in class plays in their future political activities offline
   together with other people. When aged 16, students were asked to
   nominate the classmates they considered politically knowledgeable and
   verbal in class, that is, as having a political reputation. This measure
   of political reputation was used to predict the participants' political
   activities offline four years later at age 20 and their attempts to take
   a stand in public in the national election the same year. The study
   controlled for individual differences in political interest,
   self-perceived political impact in class, the students' political
   activities at age 16, and also gender and immigrant status. About 300
   Swedish students were followed up four years later. Political reputation
   in class positively predicted future political activities offline,
   membership of political organizations, and attempts to take a stand in
   public for a party in the forthcoming national election. At the same
   time, the role played by political reputation depended upon students'
   other characteristics, especially their levels of anger and popularity,
   as observed by classmates. Evidently, the group dynamics in class that
   give some students a political reputation have long-term consequences
   for their future political activities.},

Abstract = {Based on a discussion of main channels through which fiscal stability
   can contribute to financial stability, the current legal governance
   framework of the euro area and the experience gained in its application
   are assessed with the aim to offer an answer to the question alluded to

   current EMU legal framework on economic policy coordination, provides a
   meaningful contribution to financial stability. Moreover, the potential
   of this framework to accommodate future measures to enhance fiscal
   stability is briefly assessed.},

Abstract = {This chapter aims to explore the ethical tensions between the objections
   raised against the use of lethal autonomous weapons generally and the
   potential of lethal autonomous weapons to mitigate some of the key
   challenges of urban warfare. Our argument originates from the premise
   that the ethics of war is an ongoing negotiation between recognizing the
   necessity of war and minimising the destructiveness of war. If this is
   true then we argue that the ethics of using lethal autonomous weapons in
   urban warfare cannot be appropriately weighed without the ability to
   have a reasonable sense of what operational impact they are likely to
   have. To generate an understanding of this operational impact, the UNSW
   Canberra Future Operations Research Group conducted an experiment using
   a wargame-based methodology. We present the potential merit of wargaming
   as a tool for applied ethics research and go on to describe the project
   and outline its findings. We contend that these findings represent a
   significant contribution to this debate.},

Title = {FOREIGN AID AND POLITICAL SUPPORT How Politicians' Aid Oversight
   Capacity and Voter Information Condition Credit-Giving},
Journal = {WORLD POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {75},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-42},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Prominent scholarship on foreign aid argues that aid can interfere with
   citizens' ability to hold politicians accountable. One particular
   concern is that politicians receive unde-served credit for aid projects
   due to misattribution by voters with low information. But in some cases,
   politicians exert effort to ensure the success of projects and thus may
   deserve any credit they receive from voters. The authors show that the
   credit politicians receive depends both on voter information and on the
   capacity of politicians' offices to provide oversight. Drawing on
   original surveys of politicians and nongovernmental organizations (Ncos)
   in Uganda, the authors describe circumstances in which politicians
   support the realization and administration of aid projects. The authors
   then use an experiment to show that information about foreign financing
   and Nco implementation of these projects reduces support for incumbent
   politicians only when their offices have low aid oversight capacity. The
   authors also provide evidence from other African countries that shows
   that credit-giving for aid depends on both information and state
   capacity. Their results suggest that voters think realistically about
   what politicians might have contributed to aid proj-ects and update
   their assessments accordingly.},

   Russia, and Escalation},
Journal = {INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {81},
Number = {4},
Pages = {500-522},
Abstract = {Concurrent with increasing Russian revanchism and aggression from 2014,
   the US approach to military presence on NATO's Eastern flank has
   evolved. Overall, the development could be perceived as change in
   rationale from reassurance of allies to deterrence of Russia by
   punishment and, in recent years, deterrence by denial. This has resulted
   in altered structures for presence, resulting in changes of dispositions
   on the ground that has contributed to increasing the credibility of
   NATO's deterrence doctrine. The rhetorical offensiveness of U.S.
   strategic communication has also become more powerful and exercise
   activity scaled up. This indicates a change in US perception of
   escalating activity. There is persistent bipartisan agreement on the
   continuation of US deep-engagement in Europe, with similar perceptions
   in the US military-leadership. This underpins the theory of an
   ``institutionalized practice{''} of military presence and Great Power
   Persistence. The enhanced credibility of US-NATO deterrence on the
   Eastern flank lowers the likelihood of fait accompli-scenarios. This has
   security implications for countries located elsewhere that Russia may
   wish to challenge, both conventionally and through Hybrid means.},

Abstract = {Against the backdrop of the ``normative power Europe{''} (Manners, 2002)
   thesis, this paper investigates the rule of law crisis in Poland and its
   implications on private companies' performance and investment decisions.
   The rule of law plays a crucial role in companies' investment activity,
   while at the same time is also a central category in the EU's legal and
   political edifice. These two problems are rarely analysed together as
   inter-linked realities, which, in fact, they are. The central question
   of this paper is how the rule of law's deterioration in Poland
   influences the private investment level in the country's economy and
   what it might mean for the further political integration of the EU.
   Among the theories applied were those linked to the institutional
   approach, i.e., new institutional economics, while among the methods
   themselves, it was qualitative methods which were used over quantitative
   methods. It is argued that the political and legal crisis, which has
   placed Poland in an adversarial position towards the EU, may result in a
   long-term deterioration of the investment climate in Poland. It may also
   induce political instability and legal disintegration in the EU.},

Title = {Analysis of the Systems for Representation of Minorities in Public
   Administration: The Case of the Republic of North Macedonia},
Journal = {JOURNAL ON ETHNOPOLITICS AND MINORITY ISSUES IN EUROPE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {94-125},
Abstract = {The paper analyses the implementation of the principle of equitable
   representation in North Macedonia. It examines existing consociational
   theory and the elements of consociationalism. It attempts to answer the
   question whether the theory supports the adequate representation of
   minorities in respect of the promotion and protection of their rights.
   The focus of the paper is on the instrument called ``Balancer
   calculator{''} (\& bcy;\& acy;\& lcy;\& acy;\& ncy;\& scy;\& iecy;\&
   rcy; \& kcy;\& acy;\& lcy;\& kcy;\& ucy;\& lcy;\& acy;\& tcy;\& ocy;\&
   rcy;)-an instrument used to set employment thresholds in the public
   administration in North Macedonia. This instrument strives towards the
   principles of equitable representation, set within the Constitution and
   the Ohrid Framework Agreement, additionally regulated by the relevant
   law and bylaws. In practice, this instrument is used to balance
   representation of the ethnic communities in public administration and to
   improve their position in general. The paper gives a critical approach
   to the implementation process since the tool is not adequately set or
   implemented. These come from its abuse as a purely calculative
   instrument, putting the numbers of the represented groups in first
   place, apart from the need of merit-based requirements; its inability to
   address the needs of smaller ethnic communities; and its ambiguity and
   irrelevance coming from the non-existent legal clarification of the
   communities' identity markers. The paper does not offer options, but it
   opens discussion upon these questions whose answers may help towards the
   creation and establishment of more relevant policies for representation
   of minorities within public sector.},

Title = {Analysing the contextual factors that promote and constrain policy
   learning in local government},
Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},

Abstract = {Policy learning is an important part of the policy process that
   crosscuts multiple frameworks. However, policy learning is difficult to
   model and predict, and even less is known about the extent to which
   community characteristics affect policy learning. This article examines
   the contextual factors that promote and constrain policy learning in
   local government by identifying factors that promote learning. The
   central theory is that community characteristics, experience with a
   policy problem, and the type of subnational government will be important
   factors. We examine this in the context of primary data collected after
   Hurricane Harvey from open-ended interviews with 22 local government
   officials across Southeast Texas. Using a mixed methodology, we leverage
   the results of content analysis and Poisson regression. We find that
   cities with higher median incomes and larger populations are more likely
   to experience policy learning. Experience is not an important predictor
   of policy learning, suggesting possible maturation effects in the
   learning process. Given the long-term challenges posed by natural
   hazards and disasters, this puts smaller and less affluent communities
   at higher risk. If equitable risk and recovery is the goal of disaster
   policy, efforts must be made to either increase capacity or provide more
   resources to local governments with less capacity.},

Title = {Bureaucracy and Cyber Coercion},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {States are increasingly incorporating militarized cyber technologies, or
   cyber weapons, into their defense arsenals, but there is vigorous debate
   about their coercive utility. Existing scholarship often adjudicates the
   debate by parsing technical differences between cyber and conventional
   weapons. This technical approach overlooks a critical consideration:
   bureaucrats who inform state assessments may hold unique perspectives on
   coercion due to their organizational affiliation. We make an empirical
   intervention by fielding a survey experiment on bureaucrats inside US
   Cyber Command, offering a rare glimpse into elite perceptions. We find
   little evidence that technical differences between weapons yield
   systematically different assessments. Bureaucrats perceive that
   conventional and cyber weapons have statistically indistinguishable
   coercive utility and battlefield effects. Replicating the study on a
   public sample, we find that bureaucrats are more optimistic about
   coercion across all domains and their optimism stems from organizational
   culture, rather than parochial interests or technical expertise. The
   findings show how who is responsible for assessing a technology's
   coercive value can shape estimates even more than which technology is
   being assessed. Unique perspectives clustered within influential
   bureaucracies may shape state assessments and policies in ways that
   diverge from the expectations of analyses that emphasize technical
   characteristics of military capabilities.
   Los Estados estan incorporando, cada vez en mayor medida, tecnologias
   ciberneticas militarizadas, o armas ciberneticas, en sus arsenales de
   defensa. Sin embargo, existe un fuerte debate sobre su utilidad
   coercitiva. Los estudios existentes a menudo resuelven este debate
   analizando las diferencias tecnicas entre las armas ciberneticas y las
   convencionales. Este enfoque tecnico pasa por alto una consideracion
   critica: los funcionarios que realizan estas evaluaciones estatales
   pueden tener perspectivas unicas en materia de coercion debido a su
   afiliacion organizacional. Hacemos una intervencion empirica, a traves
   un experimento de encuesta a funcionarios del Comando Cibernetico de EE.
   UU., la cual nos ofrece una rara vision de las percepciones de la elite.
   Encontramos pocas pruebas de que las diferencias tecnicas entre las
   armas den lugar a evaluaciones sistematicamente diferentes. Los
   funcionarios perciben que las armas convencionales y las armas
   ciberneticas tienen una utilidad coercitiva estadisticamente
   indistinguible y que sus efectos sobre el campo de batalla tambien son
   estadisticamente indistinguibles. Cuando replicamos este estudio en una
   muestra publica, encontramos que los funcionarios son mas optimistas
   sobre la coercion en todos los dominios y que su optimismo proviene de
   la cultura organizacional, en lugar de provenir de los intereses
   regionales o de los conocimientos tecnicos. Las conclusiones demuestran
   como los responsables de evaluar el valor coercitivo de una tecnologia
   son quienes pueden dar forma a las estimaciones, incluso mas que la
   propia tecnologia que se esta evaluando. Las perspectivas unicas,
   agrupadas dentro de burocracias influyentes, pueden dar forma a las
   evaluaciones y a las politicas estatales de maneras que divergen de las
   expectativas de los analisis que enfatizan las caracteristicas tecnicas
   de las capacidades militares.
   Les etats integrent de plus en plus de cybertechnologies militarisees,
   ou cyberarmes, dans leur arsenal de defense, mais les debats font rage
   quant a leur utilite en matiere de coercition. Les travaux de recherche
   existants statuent souvent sur le debat en analysant les differences
   techniques entre les cyberarmes et les armes conventionnelles. Cette
   approche technique omet une consideration essentielle : les bureaucrates
   qui renseignent les evaluations etatiques peuvent detenir un point de
   vue unique sur la coercition a cause de leur affiliation
   organisationnelle. Nous intervenons empiriquement en repondant a une
   experience de sondage sur les bureaucrates dans le US Cyber Command, qui
   propose un rare apercu des perceptions des elites. Nous ne trouvons que
   peu d'elements indiquant une relation systematique entre armes
   differentes et evaluations differentes. D'apres les bureaucrates,
   l'utilite coercitive et les effets sur le champ de bataille des armes
   conventionnelles et cyberarmes ne se distinguent pas sur le plan
   statistique. En repliquant l'etude sur un echantillon public, nous
   observons que les bureaucrates se montrent plus optimistes par rapport a
   la coercition dans tous les domaines, et que leur optimisme puise son
   origine dans la culture organisationnelle, plutot que dans une
   etroitesse d'interets ou une expertise technique. Selon les conclusions,
   la personne responsable de l'evaluation de la valeur coercitive d'une
   technologie faconne encore plus les estimations que la technologie
   evaluee. Des points de vue uniques rassembles au sein de bureaucraties
   influentes pourraient avoir une incidence sur les evaluations et
   politiques d'un etat qui les detourne des attentes des analyses mettant
   l'accent sur les caracteristiques techniques des capacites militaires.},

Abstract = {This study conducts a randomized survey experiment to examine the impact
   of budgeting professionalism, environmental shocks, and fiscal
   transparency on citizen blame attributions during government fiscal
   crises. Theoretically, we distinguish between two logics of
   responsibility attribution: causal responsibility stresses the causal
   link between an actor's actions and specific phenomena; functional
   responsibility underlines an actor's legal, moral, or social obligations
   in relation to such phenomena. Our experiment focuses on empirically
   testing causal responsibility. Moreover, fiscal transparency may shape
   citizens' perceptions regarding government fiscal performance and
   subsequently influence blame attributions. The experimental results show
   that citizens attribute less blame to government leaders when
   professional experts play a more important role in the budgeting
   process, when localities experience severe environmental shocks, or when
   governments exhibit greater fiscal transparency. These findings support
   inferences based on the logic of causal responsibility and establish a
   clear relationship between fiscal transparency and citizen perceptions
   of government performance.},

Title = {Socializing Warlord Democrats: Analyzing Violent Discursive Practices in
   Post-Civil War Politics},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {Across the world, so-called warlord democrats (WDs) - former military or
   political leaders of armed groups who subsequently enter formal
   electoral politics - strongly influence the dynamics and trajectory of
   post-civil war politics. However, scholarship on war-to-peace
   transitions and post-conflict politics have often failed to pay
   attention to the agency of these important actors. This article
   rectifies this oversight, and thereby adds to the overarching scholarly
   debate on what enhances or hampers democratic processes after violent
   conflict. It makes two main contributions. First, by putting an explicit
   focus on the individual level of analysis and on the agency of WDs, the
   article opens up an avenue of research that previously has been
   black-boxed. Second, it demonstrates that the assumptions of
   socialization theory are particular suitable for enhancing our
   understanding of variations in the agency of WDs and their impact on
   post-conflict electoral politics. A novel analytical framework that
   refines the concept guides the empirical examination of the
   socialization processes of two WDs over time: Julius Maada Bio, the
   ex-junta leader who became President of Sierra Leone and Prince Johnson,
   the ex-warlord in Liberia who became Senator and presidential candidate.
   The findings suggest that the socialization theory holds promise as a
   new perspective on the study of WDs, but the theory may also need
   additional conceptual development and adjustment when applied outside
   its traditional empirical context and at the individual levels of
   analysis. Specifically, we find that the democratic socialization of our
   selected WDs display the characteristics of hybrid socialization, where
   conflicting normative frameworks result in lopsided socialization
   processes. But more research is needed on how to empirically distinguish
   between cost-benefit calculations and a logic of appropriateness, the
   long-term implications of hybrid socialization, and how to theoretically
   reconcile individual level socialization processes with that of states
   or groups.
   En todo el mundo, los llamados senores de la guerra democratas (WD, por
   sus siglas en ingles), exlideres militares o politicos de grupos armados
   que posteriormente dan el salto a la politica electoral formal,
   influyen, en gran medida, en la dinamica y la trayectoria de la politica
   posterior a la guerra civil. Sin embargo, los estudios en materia de
   transiciones entre la guerra y la paz y de la politica posterior a los
   conflictos raramente han prestado atencion a la agencia de estos
   importantes agentes. Este articulo pretende rectificar este descuido y,
   por lo tanto, se suma al debate academico general sobre lo que mejora u
   obstaculiza los procesos democraticos despues de un conflicto violento.
   El articulo realiza dos contribuciones principales. En primer lugar, al
   poner un enfoque explicito en el nivel individual de analisis y en la
   agencia de los WD, el articulo abre una via de investigacion que
   anteriormente habia sido descuidada. En segundo lugar, el articulo
   demuestra que los supuestos de la teoria de la socializacion son
   particularmente adecuados para poder mejorar nuestra comprension de las
   variaciones en la agencia de los WD y su impacto en la politica
   electoral posterior al conflicto. Usamos un marco analitico novedoso,
   que mejora este concepto, con el fin de conducir el analisis empirico de
   los procesos de socializacion de dos WD a lo largo del tiempo: Julius
   Maada Bio, el exlider de la junta que se convirtio en presidente de
   Sierra Leona, y Prince Johnson, el exsenor de la guerra de Liberia que
   se convirtio en senador y candidato presidencial. Las conclusiones
   sugieren que la teoria de la socializacion es prometedora como una nueva
   perspectiva en el estudio de los WD, pero tambien que la teoria puede
   necesitar un desarrollo conceptual adicional y un ajuste cuando esta se
   aplica, o bien fuera de su contexto empirico tradicional, o bien en los
   niveles individuales de analisis. En concreto, concluimos que la
   socializacion democratica de nuestros WD seleccionados muestra las
   caracteristicas de la socializacion hibrida, donde los marcos normativos
   conflictivos dan lugar a procesos de socializacion desequilibrados. Sin
   embargo, se necesita mas investigacion sobre como se puede distinguir
   empiricamente entre los calculos de coste-beneficio y una logica de
   adecuacion, sobre las implicaciones a largo plazo de la socializacion
   hibrida y sobre como se pueden reconciliar teoricamente los procesos de
   socializacion a nivel individual con los de Estados o grupos.
   De par le monde, desdits democrates seigneurs de guerre (warlord
   democrats, WD)-d'anciens dirigeants militaires ou politiques de groupes
   armes qui ont ensuite pris part a des politiques electorales
   officielles-influencent fortement les dynamiques et la trajectoire des
   politiques post-guerre civile. Cependant, les recherches menees sur les
   transitions de la guerre a la paix et sur les politiques post-conflit
   n'ont souvent pas prete attention a l'agentivite de ces acteurs
   importants. Cet article remedie a cette omission et contribue ainsi au
   debat intellectuel global sur ce qui ameliore ou freine les processus
   democratiques suite a un conflit violent. Il apporte en effet deux
   contributions majeures. D'une part, en mettant explicitement l'accent
   sur le niveau individuel d'analyse et sur l'agentivite des WD, cet
   article ouvre une piste de recherche qui avait precedemment fait l'objet
   d'une << mise en boite noire >>. Et d'autre part, cet article demontre
   que les hypotheses de la theorie de la socialisation sont
   particulierement adaptees pour ameliorer notre comprehension des
   variations de l'agentivite des WD et de leur impact sur les politiques
   electorales post-conflit. Un cadre analytique novateur affinant le
   concept de socialisation des WD guide notre examen empirique des
   processus de socialisation de deux WD au fil du temps : Julius Maada
   Bio, l'ancien dirigeant de junte devenu President de la Sierra Leone, et
   Prince Johnson, l'ancien seigneur de guerre liberien devenu Senateur et
   candidat a la presidentielle. Nos conclusions suggerent que la theorie
   de la socialisation est prometteuse en tant que nouveau point de vue
   pour l'etude des WD, mais qu'il est egalement possible que cette theorie
   necessite des developpements et ajustements conceptuels supplementaires
   pour les cas ou elle est appliquee en dehors de son contexte empirique
   traditionnel et aux niveaux individuels d'analyse. Plus precisement,
   nous constatons que la socialisation democratique des WD que nous avons
   choisis presente les caracteristiques d'une socialisation hybride, dans
   laquelle des cadres normatifs contradictoires entrainent des processus
   de socialisation asymetrique. Toutefois, des recherches supplementaires
   sont necessaires sur la maniere d'etablir une distinction empirique
   entre calculs cout-benefice et logique de convenance, sur les
   implications a long terme de la socialisation hybride et sur la facon de
   concilier theoriquement les processus de socialisation au niveau
   individuel et les processus de socialisation des etats ou des groupes.},

   `ideational change' occurred about the financial assistance regime in
   the EU. Such an ideational change consists in two concomitant phases - a
   first phase of `ideational collapse' of the existing governance mode
   (i.e. intergovernmental coordination as per the ESM) and a subsequent
   phase of `ideational consolidation' around a new governance mechanism
   (i.e. limited supranational delegation as exemplified by the RRF). Based
   on the specific case study of the RRF, the paper discusses implications
   for how institutional change in the EU may take place following an
   exogenous shock and the relative explanatory power of ideas in
   determining the final form of institutional change.},

Title = {Identities in flux? National and other changing identities during the
   COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {Social identities, such as identification with the nation, are regarded
   as core variables in explanations of political attitudes and behaviors.
   In these accounts, increases in the importance of an identity such as
   ``Englishness{''} are often seen to be accompanied by decreases in the
   importance of other, more inclusive, identities such as ``British{''} or
   ``European.{''} At the same time, increases in exclusive national
   identities like ``Englishness{''} present challenges to democratic
   states because they are associated with preferences such as support for
   Brexit and intolerance of outgroups. Yet we know comparatively little
   about the relative importance to individuals of different social
   identities, the extent of changes in the strength of those social
   identities with contextual shifts, the interrelationships between
   different social identities, and the influences on different social
   identities. In this paper, we address each of these questions using a
   five-wave online panel study administered over two years of the COVID-19
   pandemic in England from 2020 to 2022, in which we asked about the
   importance of eight identities-Europeanness, Britishness, Englishness,
   the local area, gender, age, race/ethnicity, and social class. We show
   that national identity is consistently less important to individuals
   than the social identities of gender and age, though more important than
   race/ethnicity and social class. We also show that there were general
   increases in identification with almost all these groups during COVID.
   We consider why and discuss the implications for our understanding of
   increases in the strength of national identity as a challenge to
   democratic states.},

   aim of impeding refugee influx. However, scholars have expressed doubts
   regarding the effectiveness of these fortifications, suggesting that
   walls merely redirect migrants to alternative routes, discourage return
   migration, or alter migrants' cost-benefit calculations. Despite these
   concerns, there has been a lack of rigorous testing to support or refute
   these claims beyond case-specific evidence. This article addresses this
   research gap by thoroughly examining the arguments surrounding the
   impact of border fencing on refugee flows. We conduct a systematic,
   cross-national test of these arguments with a two-way fixed-effects
   estimator, an equivalence test, and a recently developed matching
   estimator designed for use on time-series cross-sectional data. Our
   results strongly support those who are skeptical of the impact of walls.
   We consistently demonstrate either that border fencing has not had any
   causal impact on refugee flows between 1970 and 2017 or that the
   statistical state-of-the-art is incapable of discerning that true
   effect. In either scenario, the evidence suggests that border fences
   fail to deliver the anticipated outcomes. These findings hold
   significant implications as violence-driven refugee flows persist,
   underscoring that while walls may serve as politically attractive tools
   for populist leaders, their actual deterrent effects are highly
   questionable at best.},

Abstract = {Indigenous civil society organisations (CSOs) are receiving a larger
   proportion of international aid than ever before. The international
   community supplies them with financial support owing to the belief that
   they can effectively mediate between disputant communities. The impact
   of this situation attracts scholarly debate. Whereas scholars
   traditionally assert that recipients transform into service-delivery
   organisations tied to the interests of their donors, some allege that
   CSOs retain the agency to negotiate how funds are spent in accordance
   with their own priorities. By focusing on Cypriot peacebuilding CSOs, I
   add further nuance to this debate. I argue that international aid
   enables CSOs to carry out peacebuilding initiatives according to their
   underlying agenda, owing to several contextual factors, providing they
   adhere to donors' expectations and restrictions. International aid
   cannot therefore be reduced to having a solely positive or negative
   impact - a more complex picture emerges, to some degree suiting both
   donors and CSOs.},

Abstract = {Why are politicians selective in granting investment incentives to
   foreign direct investment (FDI) projects? One understudied reason is
   that politicians want to minimize backlash from voters. In this article,
   I present the first study to systematically analyze voter preferences
   toward investment incentives. I theorize that voters should be more
   likely to support investment incentives for FDI projects that they
   perceive as ``high quality{''}that is, projects that voters perceive to
   be highly effective in improving the living standards of their
   communities. As a result, I expect that politicians who support
   low-quality FDI projects with incentives will lose voter support. A
   factorial survey experiment in the United States provides evidence in
   favor of this argument. Voters reward politicians only if they provide
   investment incentives to high-quality projects. An additional conjoint
   survey experiment highlights the importance of project characteristics
   that indicate high quality in increasing the approval of investment
   incentives. To demonstrate the external validity of these experimental
   results, I present descriptive evidence that illustrates the
   consistencies between the determinants of investment incentives for FDI
   projects and voter preferences.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this research is to examine the relationship
   between employer and employees in a public power sector undertaking
   through the validation of CODE (compensation, organizational justice,
   dispute resolution and employee empowerment) and PLE (workforce
   productivity, employee loyalty and employee engagement)
   model.Design/methodology/approachA hypothesized research model was
   developed and validated by using structural equation modeling (AMOS 20).
   In total, 303 responses were accumulated by administering a structured
   questionnaire among the employees of a state-owned power
   sector.FindingsThe results revealed that a harmonious climate of
   employee relations is prevailing in the public power utility.
   Additionally, the findings suggest that the CODE and PLE model of
   employee relations are found to be positive and significant by
   investigating the impact of compensation, organizational justice,
   dispute resolution and employee empowerment as the predictors; and
   workforce productivity, employee loyalty and employee engagement as the
   critical outcomes of employee relations.Practical implicationsThe study
   recommends some plausible insights for practitioners, decision-makers
   and policy formulators to develop strategies and policies for nurturing
   congenial employee relations and also to cultivate a facilitative work
   environment for generating contented and competent
   manpower.Originality/valueValidation of CODE and PLE model of employee
   relations in the new perspective of power sector undertaking is an
   epoch-making and novel contribution that offers significant empirical
   evidence to the extant literature. Moreover, the exploration of
   employer-employee relations in this context is a unique and innovative
   effort toward existing research.},

Abstract = {Preventing and countering violent extremism programmes (P/CVE)
   programmes in western and postcolonial countries present several
   differences as well as similarities. The differences are a consequence
   of specific coordinates of time and space in which security programmes
   are situated. This article builds on a growing scholarship focusing on
   the dimension of time, highlighting how the investigation of global and
   local historical trajectories brings to light postcolonial processes of
   security policymaking and their role in shaping local security measures.
   Through interviews carried out in Tunisia with local and international
   NGOs working on P/CVE, this research examines the agency of
   international and local actors, and their role in implementing or
   challenging global and local security narratives. The objective of this
   research is to show the connection between global and local security
   narratives and practices, and the role of colonial historical
   trajectories in the evolution of security.},

Abstract = {We explore what factors explain the legislative party discipline in a
   new democracy. We choose a Lithuanian case that offers a large pool of
   roll call votes. We find support for the explanations calibrated for
   specifics of new democracy. First, overall legislative party discipline
   tends to increase after the period of decreased electoral volatility.
   Second, hyper-accountability of voters creates incentives for
   legislators to defect more often in the last year of parliamentary term.
   Lastly, our research suggests that office incentives and phases of
   law-making could be as important explanations of legislative party
   discipline in new democracies, as in the old.},

Abstract = {This Testify article proposes archive as land as an anticolonial
   methodology for archival and historical research in the field of
   international relations (IR) and beyond. The article does so by
   reflecting upon a conversation about the Richard Kekuni Blaisdell
   Hawaiian National Archive (HNA) with two of the organizers-Dr. Lynette
   Hi'ilani Cruz and Emilia Kandagawa. Aunty Lynette is a Kanaka Maoli
   (Native Hawaiian) and Emilia identifies as a Hawaiian national. Their
   insights into the purpose, building-process, and function of the HNA are
   deeply rooted in Hawaiian indigenous resistance and movements against
   U.S. occupation, colonialism, militarism, and other structures of
   violence and injustice. Analyzing the conversation alongside a rich body
   of literature on indigenous methodology, this article argues that
   archival research is land-specific and political and that engaging
   ethically with the archives-including indigenous-led community archives
   like the HNA, colonial archives, state archives and more-requires
   working on relationships that are grounded in the particular location
   and land-relations of the archive and its sociohistorical and material
   contexts. Archive as land is a methodology to facilitate this kind of
   archival work and to assist critical, anticolonial, and decolonial
   struggles.},

Abstract = {A formal model reveals how the information environment affects
   international races to implement a powerful, dangerous new military
   technology, which may cause a ``disaster{''} affecting all states.
   States implementing the technology face a tradeoff between the safety of
   the technology and performance in the race. States face unknown,
   private, and public information about capabilities. More decisive races,
   in which small performance leads produce larger probabilities of
   victory, are usually more dangerous. In addition, revealing information
   about rivals' capabilities has two opposing effects on risk: states
   discover either that they are far apart in capability and compete less
   or that they are close in capability and drastically reduce safety to
   win. Therefore, the public information scenario is less risky than the
   private information scenario except under high decisiveness. Finally,
   regardless of information, the larger the eventual loser's impact on
   safety relative to the eventual winner's, the more dangerous is the
   race.},

Abstract = {The United Kingdom presents itself as a leader in counterterrorism (CT),
   countering violent extremism (CVE) and preventing violent extremism
   (PVE). The Action Counters Terrorism Campaign is a public-facing
   campaign of the U.K. government aimed at raising the public's awareness
   of how it can support its CT/CVE/PVE efforts. A narrative analysis of
   the campaign's YouTube channel (2017-2020) reveals a clear dominant
   narrative that ``ordinary people{''} can assist in CT/CVE/PVE by being
   alert and following basic rules (such as Run, Hide, Tell). However, a
   gendered narrative analysis reveals far more surprising results: The
   terrorist threat is understood as exclusively male and only men are
   viewed as at risk of radicalization. Women are predominantly portrayed
   in relation to men in their lives. Through their love and care, women
   can support efforts to save men by noticing when ``something is
   wrong.{''} This article reveals how the gendered constructions of the
   British awareness campaign are so engrained in a powerful metanarrative
   of gender and political violence that they ignore even widespread public
   security debates, such as those surrounding British girls and women
   joining ISIS. It concludes that a narrative analysis must include a
   gendered analysis to understand the political and security implications
   of CT/CVE/PVE narratives.},

Abstract = {Digital transformations are impacting inter-state currency politics in
   strategically important ways. This article contributes to growing
   debates over the nature of US-China competition as the Chinese RMB
   rapidly digitizes in ways said to challenge the hegemony of a slower
   digitizing greenback. We categorize existing views of currency
   competition in the digital age into two categories: `conventional
   transformation' and `transformative continuity'. Both these presently
   dominant perspectives, we argue, are overly techno-deterministic and
   stand in contrast to a third perspective we propose called
   `probabilistic flux'. Emphasizing the unanticipated and error-prone
   nature of technological change through Social Construction of Technology
   theory and informed by the IPE of monetary relations, we provide a more
   nuanced assessment of digital RMB's challenges to dollar dominance
   stressing the functions, benefits and powers of international currency
   hegemony. Our conclusions are three-fold. First, wider digital currency
   alternatives to both the dollar and RMB have enriched the international
   currency functions of the former over the latter. Second, this broader
   array of digital currency alternatives combines with Chinese RMB
   digitization to gradually erode the functional base and benefits of
   dollar dominance position, as well as diminish the US's international
   monetary power in both Asia and beyond. Third, what we see as largely
   friendly digital currency competition focused on domestic imperatives
   currently remains unpredictable. These findings pose present
   possibilities for greater international cooperation but equally for less
   friendly competition and flux particularly as US dollar digitization
   also unfolds in ways that are difficult to anticipate.},

Abstract = {International organisations (IOs) have never been more authoritative and
   potentially agential while simultaneously faced more intense threats to
   their continued existence. Amid these dialectic conditions, this article
   identifies a novel type of behaviour: IO Survival Politics. IO Survival
   Politics occurs when senior institutional actors perceive the
   organisation to face an existential threat and, in response, employ
   extraordinary strategies to ensure the organisation's continued
   existence. Survival Politics thus differs both in degree and kind from
   the ways in which secretariats exercise influence during conditions of
   normal policymaking. Two case studies illustrate the concept: (1) the
   European Commission's response to Brexit and (2) NATO's response to
   President Trump's withdrawal threats. Drawing on 87 interviews with
   senior officials, the article shows that IO Survival Politics occurs
   across a range of diverse IOs in face of diverse threats and can be a
   crucial factor in determining the fate of IOs in crisis. By
   conceptualising IO Survival Politics, the article intends to open new
   avenues for research and advance scholarly understanding of IOs and the
   crisis of multilateralism.},

Abstract = {Commendable efforts to include Ukrainian researchers in academic debates
   on the Russian invasion of Ukraine nevertheless reflect knowledge
   hierarchies that characterise contemporary academia, which is compounded
   by the difficulties that scholars face when they study violence in their
   own communities. On a practical level, Ukrainian researchers were busy
   performing the physical work of surviving or, if based abroad, the
   emotional work of worrying about the safety of friends and family. Many
   volunteered their time and resources for Ukrainian causes. The pastoral
   care and public engagement elements of their job expanded. Some
   Ukrainian scholars also engaged in tone (self)policing in order to
   prevent their arguments from alienating key audiences or being dismissed
   as too partisan or naive. The peculiarities of Ukrainian contemporary
   history and politics - (for instance, its self-perceived belonging to
   `the West' and the fact that `Western' countries have contributed the
   most to Ukraine's self-defence) at times resulted in a lack of common
   vocabulary with postcolonial and critical scholarship. This article
   calls for deeper understanding and closer engagement between academics
   and activists working in and on the `Global East' and the `Global
   South', as well as for more self-aware and caring ways of researching
   war.},

Abstract = {The research article (Expression of Dissidence) analyses Polish
   underground publishing during the late Cold War using the NOW-a
   publishing house as an example. The innovation of my approach lies in an
   attempt to bring closer Western and Eastern studies on various aspects
   of resistance. The subject of Polish resistance has already been studied
   but not with reference to the concept of everyday resistance. The
   protest sites are examined more closely with the question of how urban
   and rural geography can play a role in bringing a movement together.
   More broadly, what my contribution offers is to revive Charles Tilly's
   concepts to study Polish resistance and to see historical developments
   from a social movement perspective.},

Abstract = {Political orientation profoundly influences individual and social
   decisions. Yet adequate and culturally adaptable tools to quantify it
   are missing. In personality research, it is common to use questionnaires
   to capture the multifaceted nature of a construct. Thus, surprisingly,
   most studies assess political orientation using single-item scales that
   fail to account for cultural contexts beyond two-party systems. Using a
   bottom-up approach in which the core content of political orientation
   was defined by a German sample (N = 117), the current preregistered
   study developed a contemporary German questionnaire of political
   orientation (CGPOQ). The CGPOQ consists of 20 items that together form
   three main factors: ``Tradition and National Security,{''} Gender and
   Sexuality,{''} and ``Global Thinking.{''} The factor structure that was
   determined by exploratory factor analysis (N = 1,089) was validated by
   confirmatory factor analysis in an independent sample (N = 303). Good
   fit was demonstrated by comparing the CGPOQ with several convergent
   (self-identification, older conservatism questionnaire, voting
   intention, social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism)
   and divergent (religiosity, empathy) measures. The results indicate that
   the CGPOQ is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring political
   orientation in a German population. Furthermore, it challenges the
   assumption that political orientation relies on the same two dimensions
   across cultures.},

Abstract = {Platform cooperatives that are owned and governed by gig workers
   themselves have been proposed as a silver bullet to improve these
   workers' influence on organizational decision-making. However, they
   remain relatively rare compared with dominant investor-owned platforms.
   Traditionally, worker cooperatives strive for alternative organizing
   based on the ideal of workplace democracy but are often faced with
   unequal participation by members in decision-making processes. To test
   for participation inequalities, this study used survey data (n = 418)
   from a network of four platform worker cooperatives in Italy. The
   results show that members with lower affective commitment towards their
   cooperative and less social capital among other members are less likely
   to participate, but that there is no effect of cooperative size and
   human capital.},

Abstract = {This article assesses India's policy style, with respect to climate
   change particularly the launch of the National Action Plan on Climate
   Change (NAPCC). The NAPCC was India's first significant climate policy
   document that demonstrates a paradigm shift from the ``structural
   conflict{''} policy paradigm towards ``embedded liberalism{''}. Policy
   ideas favouring ``embedded liberalism{''} emerged from the Indian state
   were significant for the formulation of the NAPCC. The NAPCC was
   formulated due to a proactive and partially consensual policy style. The
   policymaking processes of ``learning \& puzzling{''} regarding a
   domestic climate policy involved relevant state and non-state actors and
   the policy idea was ``powered{''} by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).
   This article explores interactions between state and non-state actors to
   find that the Indian government, in the context of the global
   aspirations of an emerging power faciliated and led the formulation of
   the NAPCC under an embedded liberal climate policy paradigm.},

Abstract = {Given the undisputable reality of climate change, this article explores
   Sudan's power generation and its approach to the current climate crisis,
   focusing on the perspective of a just energy transition. It highlights
   how the power sector's plans remain centralised, favouring urban
   consumerism, cost-driven energy sources, and inadequate social and
   environmental evaluations with limited community involvement.
   Furthermore, the absence of timely adaptation measures has left off-grid
   populations and those displaced by hydroelectric dams disproportionately
   vulnerable to worsening climate conditions, loss of traditional
   livelihoods, and conflicts over dwindling natural resources. This
   exacerbates instability and regional development disparities. The
   article advocates for a just energy transition in Sudan that not only
   reduces CO2 emissions but also minimises adverse impacts on local
   ecosystems and livelihoods. It suggests a blend of distributed and
   utility-scale renewable energy sources alongside existing hydro-thermal
   capacity. It also calls for prioritising power supply to off-grid
   communities through socially driven financing mechanisms, countering the
   neoliberal push for privatisation and full-cost recovery.
   A la lumiere de la realite incontestable du changement climatique, cet
   article explore la production d'electricite au Soudan et son lien avec
   la crise climatique actuelle, en se concentrant sur la perspective d'une
   transition energetique juste. Il souligne que les plans du secteur de
   l'electricite restent centralises, favorisant le consumerisme urbain,
   les sources d'energie couteuses et des evaluations sociales et
   environnementales insuffisantes, le tout avec une implication citoyenne
   limitee. En outre, l'absence de mesures d'adaptation opportunes a rendu
   les populations non connectees au reseau et celles deplacees par les
   barrages hydroelectriques disproportionnellement vulnerables a
   l'aggravation des conditions climatiques, a la perte de leurs moyens de
   subsistance traditionnels et aux conflits lies a l'epuisement des
   ressources naturelles. Cette situation exacerbe ainsi l'instabilite et
   les disparites regionales en matiere de developpement. L'article plaide
   en faveur d'une transition energetique juste au Soudan, qui permette non
   seulement de reduire les emissions de CO2, mais aussi de minimiser les
   effets nefastes sur les ecosystemes locaux et les moyens de subsistance.
   Il propose un melange de sources d'energie renouvelables distribuees a
   grande echelle, ainsi que des capacites hydrothermales existantes. En
   outre, il appelle a donner la priorite a l'approvisionnement en
   electricite des communautes non connectees au reseau par le biais de
   mecanismes de financement sur criteres sociaux, en s'opposant a la
   poussee neoliberale favorisant la privatisation et le recouvrement
   integral des couts.
   A luz da realidade indiscutivel das alteracoes climaticas, este artigo
   explora a geracao de energia do Sudao e a sua ligacao a atual crise
   climatica, focando-se na perspetiva de uma transicao energetica justa.
   Sublinha a forma como os planos do setor energetico permanecem
   centralizados, favorecendo o consumismo urbano, as fontes de energia
   orientadas para os custos e avaliacoes sociais e ambientais
   insuficientes com um envolvimento limitado da comunidade. Alem do mais,
   a ausencia de medidas de adaptacao atempadas deixou populacoes fora da
   rede e comunidades deslocadas por barragens hidricas
   desproporcionalmente vulneraveis ao agravamento das condicoes
   climaticas, assim como a perda de meios de subsistencia tradicionais e a
   conflitos em torno da diminuicao dos recursos naturais. Isto, por sua
   vez, agrava a instabilidade e as disparidades de desenvolvimento
   regional. O artigo defende uma transicao energetica justa no Sudao que
   nao so reduza as emissoes de CO2, mas tambem minimize os impactos
   adversos nos ecossistemas e meios de subsistencia locais. Sugere uma
   combinacao de fontes de energia renovaveis distribuidas e a escala dos
   servicos publicos juntamente com a capacidade hidrotermica existente.
   Alem disso, apela a priorizacao do fornecimento de energia as
   comunidades fora da rede atraves de mecanismos de financiamento de cariz
   social, contrariando o impulso neoliberal para a privatizacao e a
   recuperacao a custos totais.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Civil conflicts typically end with negotiated settlements, but many
   settlements fail, often during the implementation stage when average
   citizens have increasing influence. Citizens sometimes evaluate peace
   agreements by voting on referendums or the negotiating leaders, and,
   almost always, they decide whether to cooperate. Yet, despite their
   role, we do not know much about how citizens form attitudes toward peace
   agreements. In this article, we assess how citizens form attitudes
   toward settlements, specifically the policy provisions that emerge from
   them, which are central in shaping the post-conflict context. These are
   complex policy changes, involving deeply factionalized actors, and the
   citizens evaluating them are often focused on rebuilding their lives. We
   therefore theorize that citizens use stark cues from political elites
   with whom they have affinity to form their attitudes. We test our theory
   using survey experiments in Colombia. We find that citizens rely on
   political elites' cues to decide their stance on the settlement's
   provisions. These cues appear to supply easily-accessible information
   that respondents use over other information. In contrast to work
   positing that peace agreements are exceptional and weary citizens are
   stabilizing forces, our results suggest that even these decisions are
   politics as usual, where divisions among political elites drive the
   outcome.},

Abstract = {City governments are at the forefront of public problem-solving. As they
   deliver services to residents and work to tackle complex social
   challenges, they often coordinate and communicate with each other.
   Against the backdrop of globalisation and urbanisation, which have been
   documented and analysed widely, the phenomenon of inter-city
   collaboration (ICC) has remained understudied. In this article, we
   examine existing and emergent patterns of how and why cities
   collaborate. We conducted a desk review of ICCs in 64 US cities. We
   interviewed city leaders in US and international cities (N = 13) and
   leaders of ICCs (N = 20). We also surveyed leaders from 47 US cities.
   Through our analysis, we put forth an analytical framework of ICCs,
   describing the forms they take and the value they deliver. We identify
   various forms of value ICCs produce for cities and examine under what
   conditions they are likely to be effective. While not all collaborations
   are successful, ICCs have the potential to generate substantial benefits
   through mutual learning, economies of scale and the power of collective
   action. Intentional design and management of ICCs can make them
   effective platforms of `horizontal governance' and solving collective
   action problems.},

Title = {Leading sectors and polarity change in the context of US-China
   competition: a process-based analysis of the origins of polarity shift},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 13},
Abstract = {The rise of China has reignited scholarly interest in power transition
   and systemic polarity. Applying the leading-sector approach as a
   theoretical background, this paper seeks to understand the extent with
   which leading-sector dominance can explain polarity change through the
   study of the post-World War II shift from multipolarity to bipolarity
   and the post-Cold War transition from bipolarity to unipolarity.
   Moreover, this paper also analyzes how leading sectors are shaping
   US-China competition and the relative military balance between both
   countries. We find that leading sectors tend to be important factors for
   polarity shift, but their degree of causal primacy depends on the
   contextual process under which they operate. Moreover, we also find that
   the current system remains unipolar due to US military superiority over
   China in command of the commons-related capabilities.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to report the development of the multiparty
   collaborative leadership scale (MCLS) that assesses four dimensions of
   collaborative leadership that have been defined in the literature
   regarding the functions of collaborative leadership in intra- and
   interorganizational settings.Design/methodology/approachThe authors have
   tested the validity and reliability of the MCLS in a sample of 110
   managers and professionals who participated in five multiparty
   collaboration workshops, each lasting for two days. The authors used
   multilevel analyses to test the construct, discriminant and predictive
   validity of the MCLS.FindingsThe results generally supported the
   reliability and validity of the MCLS. The scale has good internal
   consistency and in terms of validation, the authors show that MCLS
   negatively predicts the conflictuality and positively predicts the
   collaborativeness of the leading party as well as trust in the
   multiparty system and its entitativity.Research
   limitations/implicationsThe MCLS can be used to extend literature on
   collaborative leadership and generate insights on the antecedents and
   consequences of effective collaborative leadership in multiparty
   systems.Social implicationsMultiparty systems are set to deal with
   important societal challenges and mediators involved in multiparty
   issues are asked to settle important international disputes and
   conflicts. Understanding collaborative leadership in such systems and
   its role in establishing effective multiparty collaboration is key. The
   MCLS can be used as a research instrument and as a development tool
   toward realizing much-needed collaboration.Originality/valueThe authors
   present a first attempt to develop a short scale to assess collaborative
   leadership in complex systems in which participating stakeholders lack
   position power.},

Abstract = {This article elaborates an account of political theology that is both
   historical and critical in orientation. Whereas the historical dimension
   excavates theological antecedents that inform the vocabulary of
   international relations, the critical dimension illuminates incoherence
   in accepted ways of thinking and speaking about the subject. The article
   develops these distinct, though complementary, modes of argument to
   illustrate what political theology contributes to the study of
   international relations. Part one situates the historical mode within
   the broader discourse of political theology, followed in part two by a
   consideration of the marginal place of political theology in
   international relations scholarship. Part three re-reads the
   exception-extraordinary action that contravenes established legal or
   moral order-to illustrate what is at stake when analogies between divine
   and human deviate from the theological original. This, in turn, unlocks
   in part four a critical project that subverts the ubiquitous contrast
   between irrational (religious) belief and rational (secular) unbelief
   and the privilege it asserts. Political theology conceived along these
   lines breaks free of the parochialism of the present by denaturalizing a
   matrix of international relations knowledge that is anything but
   natural.
   Este articulo desarrolla un relato de la teologia politica que tiene una
   orientacion tanto historica como critica. Por un lado, la dimension
   historica investiga los antecedentes teologicos que forman parte del
   vocabulario de las relaciones internacionales, mientras, por otro lado,
   la dimension critica arroja luz sobre las incoherencias con relacion a
   las formas aceptadas de pensar y de hablar sobre este tema. El articulo
   desarrolla estos modos distintos, aunque complementarios, de
   argumentacion con el fin de ilustrar la medida en la que la teologia
   politica contribuye al estudio de las relaciones internacionales. La
   primera parte situa el modo historico dentro del discurso, mas generico,
   de la teologia politica. A continuacion, la segunda parte considera el
   lugar marginal que ha ocupado la teologia politica dentro del
   conocimiento academico en el marco de las relaciones internacionales. La
   tercera parte reinterpreta la excepcion (accion extraordinaria que
   contraviene el orden legal o moral establecido) con el fin de ilustrar
   lo que esta en juego cuando las analogias entre lo divino y lo humano se
   desvian del original teologico. Esto, a su vez, propicia que en la
   cuarta parte podamos desarrollar un proyecto critico que subvierte el
   contraste ubicuo entre la creencia irracional (religiosa) y la
   incredulidad racional (secular), asi como el privilegio que afirma. La
   teologia politica concebida de esta forma rompe con el parroquialismo
   del presente mediante la desnaturalizacion de una matriz de conocimiento
   de las relaciones internacionales, que es cualquier cosa menos natural.
   Cet article approfondit un recit de theologie politique a l'orientation
   a la fois historique et critique. Bien que la dimension historique fasse
   apparaitre des antecedents theologiques qui renseignent le vocabulaire
   des relations internationales, la dimension critique met en lumiere une
   certaine incoherence quant aux facons de penser et de parler du sujet.
   L'article developpe ces modes de raisonnement distincts, mais
   complementaires, pour illustrer la contribution de la theologie
   politique a l'etude des relations internationales. La premiere partie
   resitue le mode historique au sein du discours de la theologie politique
   au sens large, quand la deuxieme partie s'interesse a la place marginale
   de la theologie politique au sein de la recherche en relations
   internationales. La troisieme partie propose une relecture de
   l'exception-une mesure extraordinaire qui va a l'encontre de l'ordre
   juridique ou moral etabli-pour illustrer les enjeux de la deviation des
   analogies divin/humain de l'original theologique. Cette partie ouvre
   ensuite la porte a une quatrieme contenant un projet critique qui
   subvertit le contraste omnipresent entre la croyance irrationnelle
   (religieuse) et la non-croyance rationnelle (seculaire) et le privilege
   qu'il affirme. Apprehendee en ces termes, la theologie politique se
   libere de l'esprit de clocher actuel en denaturalisant une matrice de
   connaissances en relations internationales qui est tout sauf naturelle.},

Title = {Diplomatic Gender Patterns and Symbolic Status Signaling: Introducing
   the GenDip Dataset on Gender and Diplomatic Representation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {This research note introduces a new dyadic dataset on gender and
   diplomatic representation and shows its potential to address questions
   about international status, gender patterns in international politics,
   and more. The GenDip dataset includes the names and gender
   classification of all bilateral ambassadors heading embassies 1968-2019
   (74,549), structured as dyad/decade for 1968-1998 and dyad/lustrum for
   1998-2019. Cross-fertilizing the quantitative study of status with
   qualitative studies on women's symbolic meaning for the status of
   states, we illustrate the utility of this data by showing that the
   gender of ambassadors is implicated in status hierarchies among states.
   For instance, states with a reputation as strongly patriarchal are more
   likely than others to post their female ambassadors to states with an
   international gender equality profile, for status and to signal policy
   alignment. We also show that shares of female ambassadors vary
   considerably among sending states, in unexpected ways, identifying the
   need for more research explaining why. This dataset enables new, crucial
   questions to be asked of international relations, mapping gender changes
   in diplomacy over time and place and explaining their causes and
   effects.
   Esta nota de investigacion presenta un nuevo conjunto de datos diadicos
   en materia de genero y representacion diplomatica y muestra su potencial
   de cara a abordar cuestiones relativas tanto al estatus internacional,
   como a los patrones de genero dentro la politica internacional y a otras
   cuestiones. El conjunto de datos GenDip incluye los nombres, con su
   correspondiente clasificacion en materia de genero, de todos los
   embajadores bilaterales que encabezaron embajadas entre 1968 y 2019
   (74.549), estructurados de la siguiente forma: diada/decada para los
   datos de entre 1968 y 1998 y diada/lustro para los datos de entre 1998 y
   2019. Ilustramos la utilidad de estos datos mostrando que el genero de
   los embajadores tiene implicaciones para las jerarquias de estatus entre
   los Estados, a traves del cruce de datos entre el estudio cuantitativo
   del estatus y los estudios cualitativos sobre el significado simbolico
   de las mujeres para el estatus de los Estados. Por ejemplo, aquellos
   Estados que tienen una reputacion de ser fuertemente patriarcales son
   mas propensos que otros a enviar a sus embajadoras a los Estados que
   cuentan con un perfil internacional de igualdad de genero, por motivos
   de estatus y con el fin de simbolizar la alineacion entre las politicas.
   Tambien demostramos que las proporciones de embajadoras varian
   considerablemente entre los Estados de origen, en maneras inesperadas,
   lo cual nos permite identificar la necesidad de realizar una mayor
   investigacion que pueda explicar por que ocurre esto. Este conjunto de
   datos nos permite hacer nuevas preguntas cruciales en materia de
   relaciones internacionales, asi como mapear los cambios de genero en la
   diplomacia a lo largo del tiempo y el espacio y explicar sus causas y
   efectos.
   Cette note de recherche presente un nouvel ensemble de donnees dyadique
   sur le genre et la representation diplomatique, et montre son potentiel
   lorsqu'il s'agit de repondre entre autres aux questions relatives au
   statut et aux schemas genres en politique internationale. L'ensemble de
   donnees GenDip comprend les noms et la classification de genre de tous
   les ambassadeurs bilateraux a la tete d'ambassades entre 1968 et 2019
   (74 549), en les structurant par dyade/decennie entre 1968 et 1998 et
   par dyade/lustre de 1998 a 2019. En fertilisant mutuellement l'etude
   quantitative du statut et les etudes qualitatives sur la signification
   symbolique des femmes pour le statut des etats, nous illustrons
   l'utilite de ces donnees en montrant que le genre des ambassadeurs est
   implique dans les hierarchies de statut des etats. Par exemple, les
   etats reputes fortement patriarcaux auront plus de chances que les
   autres de poster les ambassadrices dans les etats au profil
   international d'egalite des sexes, tant pour le statut que pour indiquer
   un alignement politique. Nous montrons aussi que la part d'ambassadrices
   differe beaucoup et de facons inattendues chez les pays emetteurs, et
   identifions donc la necessite de mener de nouveaux travaux de recherche
   pour en expliquer les raisons. Cet ensemble de donnees permet de poser
   de nouvelles questions essentielles aux relations internationales, en
   representant les evolutions relatives au genre en diplomatie au fil du
   temps et en fonction du lieu et en en expliquant les causes et effets.},

Abstract = {It is not easy to be optimistic about international security at the
   present time, but 9th Review Conference of the Biological Weapons
   Convention in December 2022 agreed a renewed effort to strengthen the
   Convention after decades of stagnation. In March 2023 an agreement was
   also reached on an agenda and timetable for this effort over the next 2
   years. Scientists have a long history of providing valuable input to
   such meetings, in this paper, we discuss how such input might best be
   provided with complicated challenges now facing the BWC and concluded
   that there is much that could be done, but greater coordination amongst
   scientists is needed.},

Title = {Grassroots involvement on Global South policy narratives and
   deliberative action on climate change loss and damage},
Journal = {PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY-AN ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {156-168},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {PurposeThis paper investigates how power and narratives among actors
   relate to the process of agenda-setting and deliberation in the context
   of climate change loss and damage. The focus is to understand how
   grassroots voices manifest their concerns on intensifying economic and
   non-economic impacts of climate change loss and damage which affect
   them.Design/methodology/approachThis paper is based on the case of the
   Southeast Asia climate change loss and damage workshop in Bohol,
   Philippines in August 2022. It utilizes lesson drawing as a critical
   approach by thematic analysis in making sense of the data gathered from
   the perspectives of participant observers and facilitators.FindingsThere
   are different levels of power and dominant narratives actors in a
   deliberative process propel in taking a stance over a particular issue
   towards agenda-setting and policy framing. The power and narratives help
   actors to maintain and emphasize their position, exercise authority, and
   to some point, suppress weak voices. Narratives associated with
   emotions, sentiments, ideologies, and value systems of the grassroots,
   community leaders, and climate justice movements tend to be devalued by
   those in a high level of power and
   authority.Originality/valueTechno-authoritarian domination explicitly
   hampers a genuine grassroots involvement in the policy process,
   especially towards agenda-setting of immediate concerns about climate
   change loss and damage which affect the public. Critiquing actors' power
   and narratives are productive in identifying and propagating the type of
   deliberative spaces that speak truth to power.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a technological upheaval with
   the potential to change human society. Because of its transformative
   potential, AI is increasingly becoming subject to regulatory initiatives
   at the global level. Yet, so far, scholarship in political science and
   international relations has focused more on AI applications than on the
   emerging architecture of global AI regulation. The purpose of this
   article is to outline an agenda for research into the global governance
   of AI. The article distinguishes between two broad perspectives: an
   empirical approach, aimed at mapping and explaining global AI
   governance; and a normative approach, aimed at developing and applying
   standards for appropriate global AI governance. The two approaches offer
   questions, concepts, and theories that are helpful in gaining an
   understanding of the emerging global governance of AI. Conversely,
   exploring AI as a regulatory issue offers a critical opportunity to
   refine existing general approaches to the study of global governance.},

Abstract = {Recent studies show that, when salience is high, `heterogeneous lobbying
   coalitions' uniting business and civil society groups are more
   successful in achieving their lobbying objectives than homogeneous
   coalitions. It is therefore surprising that a coalition of tech firms
   and civil society activists failed to prevent the adoption of the EU's
   contested 2019 Copyright Directive, which constitutes a significant
   shift in the Union's approach to online content regulation. This article
   argues that proponents of the policy change successfully undermined the
   lobbying coalition by invoking notions of `digital sovereignty' and by
   delegitimizing activists as Silicon Valley's `useful idiots'. Combining
   process-tracing of the lobbying processes and content analysis of
   European Parliament debates, the article shows how legislators employed
   delegitimation and sovereignty claims to justify their
   non-responsiveness to public protests. The article contributes to the
   interest group literature and debates on `digital sovereignty' by
   demonstrating its strategic use in the policy-making process.},

Title = {Conflicted Identities: Negotiating Belonging among Young People from the
   Lebanese Diasporas in Montreal},
Journal = {ETHNOPOLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {435-452},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {To elucidate the reproduction of antagonist relationships between
   diasporic populations, conflict transportation theories tend to focus on
   societal and transnational contexts. This approach often neglects the
   complexity of people's lived experiences and risks essentializing
   diasporic identities. Based on ethnographic fieldwork among young people
   of the Lebanese diasporas in Montreal, this contribution reconsiders the

   nature of existence. It argues that everyday encounters and life
   trajectories play a critical role in how the diasporic youth relate to
   identity categories, inspiring them to continuously renegotiate and

Abstract = {This article brings feminist critiques of capitalism into conversation
   with race-conscious International Political Economy to highlight the
   place of social reproduction in the colonial global economy. It does so
   by taking a provincial perspective, using Royal Leamington Spa as a case
   study to reveal how the provision of care for the elderly and the ill
   sustained colonial elites across the life course, while religious and
   educational practices helped transmit cultural values across generations
   and reproduce imperialism as an institutionalised social order. Whereas
   the finance houses of London, the factories of Manchester, and the ports
   of Liverpool and Bristol constitute nodal points for imperial circuits
   of capital, the spa town condenses the everyday practices through which
   bourgeois metropolitan empire was lived and made liveable. These
   findings point to a functional differentiation of economic space within
   the metropole and offer a critical reinterpretation of Middle England as
   a Whitened site of middle-class respectability.},

Abstract = {As the harms of hate speech, mis/disinformation and incitement to
   violence on social media have become increasingly apparent, calls for
   regulation have accelerated. Most of these debates have centred around
   the needs and concerns of large markets such as the EU and the United
   States, or the aggressive approach countries such as Russia and China
   adopt to regulate online content. Our focus in this article is with the
   rest, the smaller markets at the periphery of the advertising industry,
   and the deep inequalities that current approaches to content moderation
   perpetuate. We outline the depth of the unequal practice of moderation,
   particularly across Africa, and explore the underlying political and
   economic factors driving this gap. While recognizing content moderation
   has many limitations, we conclude by underlining potential approaches to
   increase oversight in content moderation.},

Abstract = {The inhabitants of the Palestinian city of Nablus in the West Bank,
   which has been under Israeli military rule since 1967, practice
   bottom-up civility to shape public life in spite of political rights
   being denied to them. As most institutional forms of `civil society' are
   deeply distrusted, everyday civility among Palestinians dynamically
   reacts to occurrences of political violence. Based on ethnographic
   fieldwork in Nablus in 2013 and 2014, this article argues that bottom-up
   civility constitutes a medium for addressing ethical and political
   questions about how to live together in dignity in the midst of a
   repressive and opaque political landscape. As such, civility can be
   understood as form of collective ethical self-care. People laterally
   discipline one another to embody dignity and piety in their face-to-face
   interactions and to express respect for victims by hiding signs of
   consumption and market transacions. In an enclosed community facing
   repression, ethical claims about dignity and civility in public
   interactions are a form of political agency that calls for decentering
   common understandings of civil society.},

Abstract = {The 2019 General Election brought about a significant change in the
   parliamentary balance of power. There has already been much attention
   devoted to how parties and their leaders campaigned in the run up to the
   polling day. Using original leaflet data from the OpenElections project,
   this study extends the focus to individual candidates by exploring the
   nature of local campaign communications. We find that candidates make
   little effort to promote their personal traits, with personalisation of
   leaflets remaining largely limited to offering visual cues in the shape
   of candidate photos. We also find that while negative campaign messages
   are common, they tend to relate to an opposing party more generally.
   Similarly, we find that highlighting the tactical situation in the
   constituency remains a rare practice. Our findings suggest that there is
   still considerable room for candidates to tailor their campaign
   materials to their personal attributes and the local electoral context.},

Abstract = {With planet-wide environmental unravelling ideas of multispecies and
   planetary justice are gaining multidisciplinary attention. They frame a
   set of ethical, moral and political obligations to life-on-Earth. While
   it is clear it is humans who bear the duties and obligations of justice,
   who or what is the subject of justice-beyond-human varies widely: Some
   limit the subject to sentient animals, others include all living things.
   We argue for a more expansive subject that includes both living and
   non-living matter. We claim that privileging living/life is an
   anthropocentric categorisation embedded in the foundational
   epistemologies and ontologies driving environmental damages, resource
   conflicts and mass extinction. An exclusion of matter from concerns of
   justice ignores multiple fundamental more-than-human relationships in
   humans' every-day material lives. We argue that the subject of planetary
   justice must be expansive - addressing sentient or not, living or not,
   animal, vegetable, mineral, and elemental - to be inclusive, applied,
   plural, and sustainable.},

Abstract = {The Chinese central government has greatly supported two strategic
   high-tech industries: 5G and supercomputing. However, when both
   encountered similar U.S. sanctions, the 5G industry failed to make
   crucial upstream components while the supercomputing industry could.
   This article argues that the central government-level industrial
   policies contributed to these divergent outcomes. Using natural language
   processing and qualitative content analysis of meticulously collected
   official documents and secondary sources, key policy differences were
   identified. Before the U.S. sanctions in May 2019, China's 5G industrial
   policies were significantly unbalanced, with inadequate attention given
   to research and development of vital upstream components, contributing
   to a lack of upstream investment. Although recent attempts to rebalance
   5G industrial development since 2021, the policy focus remains largely
   on the mid and downstream segments. In contrast, before the U.S.
   sanctions in 2015, the supercomputing industrial policies emphasised the
   development of the entire industrial chain, including crucial upstream
   components, resulting in China's possession of entirely homegrown
   supercomputers. Leveraging a tri-level analysis framework rooted in
   political economics, this study also offers possible explanations for
   the policy divergence and discusses implications. It contributes to the
   existing literature and ongoing debate on China and industrial policy
   amidst great power high-tech competition.},

Journal = {SOUTH EUROPEAN SOCIETY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This paper examines regional legislative initiatives in Spain, a
   mechanism of shared-rule regulated in article 87.2 of the Spanish
   Constitution. Through description and analysis of an original dataset
   covering all legislative terms from 1978 to 2021, it is shown how this
   specific mechanism has not accomplished its shared-rule objective.
   Moreover, the article identifies patterns that determine the strategic
   use, intensity and failure or success of the legislative initiatives. We
   find diverging trends across regions exemplified by Catalonia, the most
   active territory but with a very low approval rate. Overall, the
   analysis underlines how the state-wide scope initiatives seem to have a
   strategic rather than a legislative purpose while, on the other hand,
   regional scope initiatives are explained by minor self-rule objectives.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the pre-existing state of knowledge,
   attitudes and sentiments that pupils have and display in relation to
   terrorism and violent extremism. Based on our experiences with our
   historical-pedagogical TerInfo project, we propose a new approach for
   dealing with these topics in the classroom: the adoption of an
   historicizing approach in teaching about terrorism in class. This
   approach relies on the creation of a historical framework that serves as
   a tool to both deal with emotions of shock and panic, and to help
   teachers and pupils find an objectified ground to discuss terrorism on a
   knowledge-informed base.},

Title = {Personal Networks and Grassroots Election Participation in China:
   Findings from the Chinese General Social Survey},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Grassroots elections of rural village heads and urban community
   directors are an important public arena for social-political
   participation of Chinese citizens. Analyzing the Chinese General Social
   Survey (CGSS2017) data through the models of GSEM (general equation
   structure modeling) and fulfilling the robustness check via IV
   (instrumental variable) method (including IV-Probit and 2SLS-IV models),
   this article examines the direct and indirect effects of personal
   networks on voting participation after 2012 under the leadership of Xi.
   We find that people with greater amounts of network resources and higher
   frequencies of social eating with network members have a higher
   likelihood to participate in elections. As to mediating effects, the two
   measures of personal networks pave the way for people to participate in
   formal networks of associational engagement, which in turn increase
   their participation in elections; however, people with higher values in
   the two personal network measures tend to have lower levels of
   institutional trust, which in turn hinders voting participation. In
   comparison, the positive effects are more powerful than the negative
   ones, so on the whole, personal networks are acting as an important
   conducive force for grassroots election participation.},

Abstract = {This article explores the growing trend of ``white jihad{''} by
   examining how white supremacists have incorporated jihadi language,
   motifs, and tactics into their ecosystem. Using observation and content
   analysis of various primary sources associated with the neo-Nazi
   movement, we highlight the core issues and themes around which the two
   movements have coalesced; identify key facilitating actors who have
   advanced the convergence of elements of the far right and the jihadist
   movements; and identify operational threats that emanate from this
   cross-ideological encounter.},

Abstract = {Career narratives among the Danish power elite often include the
   facilitating presence of an elite superior. We explore the role patrons
   play in the mobility narratives of the Danish power elite. Drawing from
   a highly select group identified in the core of elite networks, we
   interviewed 37 individuals selected for maximal variation in career
   paths, networks and positions within the power elite. We referenced the
   concept of patrimonialism to understand the relations between patrons
   and proteges in building an elite career and develop a typology
   identifying three kinds of patrimonial relations described by elites,
   intra-organizational relations to mentors and patriarchs and
   inter-organizational relations to sponsors. We then empirically explore
   the three types of patrimonial relations. Finally, we argue that each of
   these patrimonial relations reinforce elite cohesion, even in the
   supposedly critical case of good governance in Denmark. Hence,
   patrimonial relations present a crucial perspective for understanding
   contemporary power structures.},

Title = {Critical Latin American Feminisms: Community-Based, Experience-Based,

Abstract = {Objective/Context: In the following pages, I describe three political
   feminist projects from Latin America, which we can characterize as
   critical, given that these projects endorse positions historically
   attributed to the political left. Methodology: Since I am addressing
   specific feminist experiences that are not eminently theoretical, I use
   the few theorizations produced by the movements mentioned above and
   interviews and descriptions of the activism of these feminist political
   projects. I apply aspects of a cultural studies perspective with a
   non-hegemonic methodology, deploying the creativity that characterizes
   the article's subjects, and some elements of Participatory Action
   Research (PAR) methodology. Conclusions: I show that all three of these
   political proposals-although there are differences among them-have
   common ground and points of convergence that are important for thinking
   differently about critical Latin American feminisms. Specifically, I
   demonstrate that some of them share three characteristics: first, they
   are not born out of or made in academia; second, they are/live in the
   community; and third, they seek to unravel gender. Originality: This
   article presents an overview of these feminisms that have been of
   interest to feminists while providing academic readers with insight into
   social movements and their language. It could serve as a tool to discuss
   the relevance of these feminisms and expand the ongoing discussion in
   Latin America.},

Abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that one-party regimes are intrinsically
   hostile to civil society because organized citizens can threaten the
   regime's political dominance. Contrary to this view, the authors argue
   that genuinely voluntary civil society organizations may be tolerated,
   or even actively promoted, by governments in a one-party system when
   those organizations can help to efficiently resolve intrasocietal
   distributional conflicts arising from economic modernization. Using
   China's homeowner associations (HOAs) as a case, the article
   demonstrates that local authorities are more likely to promulgate
   policies that encourage the development of self-organized HOAs when
   citizens frequently call upon the authorities to intervene and
   adjudicate their disputes with property development and management
   companies. An instrumental variables estimation suggests that the
   relationship is likely to be causal, and additional analyses on
   mechanisms reveal that citizens' complaints are most effective in
   eliciting pro-HOA policies when they are targeted at business rather
   than government actors. These findings highlight an important function
   of civil society organizations in street-level governance and offer a
   nuanced interpretation of how pluralistic elements may emerge in
   nonliberal systems.},

Abstract = {This article takes stock of the literature that is advancing knowledge
   about how to classify, organize and think about existential risks and
   globally catastrophic risks altogether. It then points out policy
   implications from this literature and applies those implications to a
   short case study on the National Risk Register, a comprehensive risk
   policy in the United Kingdom. In doing so, it names three broad systems
   that have emerged in the literature, which are those that organize risks
   by (1) consequences of risks, (2) sources or causes of risks and (3)
   risk processes and interactions with human systems. Organizing risks by
   consequences aids in risk prioritization, while classifying risks by
   source or cause aids in risk prevention and mitigation. Analysing risk
   processes and interactions with human systems opens the policy frame to
   broader policies of risk response and resilience.},

Abstract = {Building on, and going beyond, the state-of-the-art literature, this
   article aims to advance the analysis and conceptualization of the
   financialization of households. It argues that there is a need to better
   conceptualize the household and that the relations between households
   and other actors in financialized capitalism require further
   elaboration. Its contribution rests on providing a high-level review of
   literature and on proposing a relational and activity-orientated
   approach to the household as a micro-level social institution performing
   its activities through a web of relationships. Furthermore, it builds on
   the concept of `financial chains' to draw attention to power relations
   and transfers of value between households and other economic actors. In
   doing so, the article also highlights the uneven ways through which
   households are inserted into such `financial chains' and explores
   social, spatial and temporal dimensions of household financialization.
   Finally, it suggests avenues for further research.},

Title = {Human Rights beyond the Liberal Script: A Morphological Approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {While recent scholarship has turned to the increasing fragmentation of
   global human rights discourses, the often competing ideological projects
   in which different understandings of human rights are embedded have
   received comparatively scant attention. Instead, human rights are
   treated as isolated norms. Although treated as isolated, human rights
   norms are frequently simultaneously understood against the implicit
   backdrop of liberal assumptions about political order and human agency,
   thereby obscuring alternative human rights conceptions. This research
   note seeks to move our understanding of human rights beyond the liberal
   script. Drawing on advances in the fields of intellectual history and
   political theory, it develops a morphological approach that treats norms
   not only as individual standards of appropriate behavior but as complex
   units of meanings. These meanings only emerge in larger ideational
   formations in which varying notions of human rights are temporarily
   fixed through their positioning toward other concepts. This
   morphological understanding of human rights as part of larger conceptual
   arrangements allows for their analysis beyond the liberal script as the
   research note shows by way of two illustrative case studies, which focus
   on human rights beyond liberal notions of democracy and the rule of law
   as well as beyond the human as ontologically singular.},

Abstract = {Increasing research on the humanitarian sector examines how its
   organizational cultures affect both aid outcomes and humanitarian
   workers' private lives. The \#MeToo movement and several public scandals
   have brought to light patterns of sexual violence in crisis zones
   perpetrated by humanitarian aid workers; surveys suggest rates of sexual
   assault within the humanitarian community comparable to, if not higher
   than, those on US college campuses. How do the conditions that produce
   sexual violence persist in a sector governed by strong, mission-centric
   principles, professional codes of conduct, and oversight?This article
   uses participant observation in Iraq and Uganda, in-depth interviews,
   and textural analysis to examine the social origins of sexual violence
   in humanitarian communities. It builds on studies of aid organizations
   to argue that the humanitarian sector operates similarly to a ``total
   institution{''} (Goffman 1961). Then, it draws upon recent work on
   sexual violence to demonstrate how within-sector social ecologies and
   informal socialization practices create the conditions of possibility
   for sexual violence. It identifies two key factors that constitute the
   emergency aid world-sexual scripts and projects, and sector-specific
   sexual geographies-and argues that they produce conditions that
   facilitate sexual violence while labeling them ``just how things are
   done.{''}},

Abstract = {In the post-Cold War era, United Nations (UN) peacekeeping has been an
   effective civil conflict mitigation tool. On the path to peacekeeping,
   the UN Security Council often signals its growing likelihood to deploy
   an operation by passing resolutions addressing the conflict. How do
   these signals affect violence levels in a pre-operation environment? We
   posit that conflict actors have incentives to improve their relative
   positions through violence as the UN signals its likelihood to
   intervene. Using a new dataset that links UNSC resolutions to active
   civil wars from 1989 to 2014, we find that resolution passage is
   significantly related to an increase in combatant use of anti-civilian
   violence. Additionally, as the signal strengthens with the passage of a
   greater number of resolutions, violence increases. Thus, although
   deployed peacekeeping operations may effectively protect non-combatants,
   the process leading to deployment can produce a dangerous environment
   for civilians.},

Abstract = {When are international organizations (IOs) responsive to the policy
   problems that motivated their establishment? While it is a conventional
   assumption that IOs exist to address transnational challenges, the
   question of whether and when IO policy-making is responsive to shifts in
   underlying problems has not been systematically explored. This study
   investigates the responsiveness of IOs from a large-n, comparative
   approach. Theoretically, we develop three alternative models of IO
   responsiveness, emphasizing severeness, dependence, and power
   differentials. Empirically, we focus on the domain of security,
   examining the responsiveness of eight multi-issue IOs to armed conflict
   between 1980 and 2015, using a novel and expansive dataset on IO policy
   decisions. Our findings suggest, first, that IOs are responsive to
   security problems and, second, that responsiveness is not primarily
   driven by dependence or power differentials but by problem severity. An
   in-depth study of the responsiveness of the UN Security Council using
   more granular data confirms these findings. As the first comparative
   study of whether and when IO policy adapts to problem severity, the
   article has implications for debates about IO responsiveness,
   performance, and legitimacy.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how green purchasing in local governments varies
   as a function of the organization's internal commitment, operationalized
   by the stage of institutionalization of green public procurement (GPP),
   and external pressures from various stakeholder groups. GPP, a
   value-based innovation justified on the grounds of intergenerational
   equity, is an important tool governments can use to mitigate the adverse
   effects of climate change. Survey data from 210 U.S. local governments
   reveal that while both external and internal factors are strong
   predictors of buying green, internal commitment matters relatively more.
   We also find that earlier stages of GPP institutionalization are more
   conducive to external influence, albeit the effect differs among
   stakeholders. Local governments tend to be more likely to buy green when
   nudged by nonprofits and interest groups, and less so when offered
   financial incentives by the federal government.},

Abstract = {How are attitudes formed in the 21st Century, and who sets the agenda
   for initial COVID-19 coverage in the United States? We explore these
   questions using a random sample of 6 million tweets from a population of
   224 million tweets collected between January 2020 and June 2020. In
   conjunction with a content analysis of legacy media such as newspapers,
   we examine the second-level agendamelding process during the onset of
   the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The findings demonstrate
   that in the early weeks of the pandemic, public opinion on Twitter about
   the virus was distinctly different than the coverage of the issue in the
   traditional media. The attributes used to describe it on social media
   demonstrate users relying on their past experiences and personal beliefs
   to talk about the virus. In the 1st week of February, public opinion,
   traditional media, and social media converged, but traditional media
   soon becomes the main agenda setter of COVID-19 for 13 weeks. However,
   for the final 5 weeks of our sample, traditional media are taken over by
   social media. The findings also show that, except for a few weeks at the
   onset of the outbreak, Twitter users relied on their personal
   experiences far less than what statistical models predicted and allowed.
   Instead, traditional media and social media to shape their opinion of
   the issue.},

Abstract = {Having inherited an Israel-Palestinian peace process in poor shape in
   January 2001, George W. Bush did little to advance it during his first
   term. His approach was motivated by political and diplomatic expediency,
   rather than deep-seated convictions or principles. 9/11 did not have a
   decisive impact on US policy. During his second term, however, the
   president authorised a new formal negotiating process. Although this has
   received little scholarly attention hitherto, it remains the last
   serious American effort to broker Israeli-Palestinian peace. Barack
   Obama made no attempt to continue from where Bush left off in early
   2009. Furthermore, Obama's preferred approach backfired, to the extent
   that serious US engagement in Israeli-Palestinian dialogue was
   effectively over before the end of his first term. This facilitated the
   approach subsequently pursued by President Donald Trump, who downgraded
   and side-lined the Israel-Palestinian dispute in favour of other
   regional priorities in the Middle East.},

Abstract = {An accord to increase global pandemic preparedness is currently
   negotiated at the World Health Organisation (WHO). One aspect is
   conspicuously missing from the draft version: data governance. As the
   COVID-19 pandemic has shown, the availability of good quality data, and
   prudent ways of using this data while preventing other forms of data use
   that is harmful to people and communities, is literally a matter of life
   and death. It is of utmost importance for the pandemic accord to include
   a data governance strategy. We argue that data solidarity provides a
   suitable foundation for such a data governance strategy in the context
   of pandemics. It includes instruments to facilitate data use in cases
   where data use is likely to create benefits for many people without
   entailing high risks for individuals or communities. Data solidarity
   also calls to refrain from data use in cases where it would pose
   unacceptable risks. Finally, data solidarity helps to mitigate harm
   where it occurs. In sum, data solidarity helps to enhance the benefits
   from digital practices in health crises without playing out collective
   interests against the rights and needs of individuals.},

Abstract = {PurposeBased on the service eco-systems perspective, this paper
   evaluates the strategies and actions adopted by the Government of
   Pakistan to handle the COVID-19 crisis with the involvement of multiple
   actors including public, private, third-sector organizations and civil
   society.Design/methodology/approachThe paper is based on an in-depth
   analysis of secondary sources including research articles, policy
   documents, policy briefs, governmental reports, third party
   evaluations/reports and media publications.FindingsA multi-stakeholder
   approach was evident during the pandemic with an effort to better manage
   the crisis which has exerted immense social, cultural, economic and
   political impacts on the lives of the citizens. Collaborative efforts
   among stakeholders (government, private and third sector) were
   witnessed, resulting in a coherent response. The successful management
   of COVID-19 in Pakistan is attributed to multiple factors including the
   formation of a specialized public organization which effectively and
   proactively took data-driven informed decisions and aggregated the
   efforts of the federal and provincial governments for a timely
   response.Originality/valueThis paper gives insights for policymakers to
   create a sustainable post-pandemic socio-economic environment by
   building resilient structures across the government while promoting
   cooperation and collaboration. It suggests strategies for policymakers
   responsible for providing sustainable societal solutions to combat the
   social, economic and administrative challenges under the pandemic. As
   Pakistan has managed and contained the pandemic in a relatively
   efficient way, it is hoped that this paper can provide a learning
   experience for other countries with similar national contexts.},

Abstract = {Over the past 20 years, a number of political theorists have been
   focusing on the just political treatment of linguistic diversity in
   liberal democratic societies. This body of work, known as the
   `linguistic justice' literature, has mainly examined two specific
   categories of linguistic groups: autochthonous linguistic minorities and
   immigrants. However, it has entirely neglected non-resident citizens,
   that is, citizens of a country who reside in a different one, and their
   distinctive language interests and rights. In this article, we address
   this gap by developing a theory of linguistic justice for non-resident
   citizens, using diaspora institutions as a case study. More
   specifically, we draw on the linguistic justice literature to outline
   two categories of non-resident citizens' language interests and rights,
   that is, those related to opportunity access and to democracy. We
   finally suggest ways in which language-related diaspora institutions
   could be reformed in order to better fulfil non-resident citizens'
   language interests and rights.},

Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 16},
Abstract = {One of the classic questions in political psychology has been whether
   feelings of self-worth are relevant for politics. In this review, we
   summarize seven decades of research attempting to address this question,
   focusing on three sets of political outcomes: (1) political ideology,
   (2) political interest and engagement, and (3) intergroup relations. We
   rely on the distinction between self-esteem (feelings of adequacy and
   satisfaction with oneself) and narcissism (feelings of entitled
   self-importance and superiority over others). We argue that this
   distinction allows us to integrate the literature and explain the mixed
   effects observed in past research on self-evaluation and politics. Our
   review points to a key role of narcissistic status pursuit and
   psychological defensiveness in predicting potentially problematic
   political attitudes and behaviors. We discuss practical implications
   these associations might have for democratic functioning and for
   understanding political leaders. We conclude by identifying outstanding
   questions and promising new research directions.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the impact of population aging on the composition
   of taxes in an overlapping generations model. Taxes are levied on both
   income and expenditure, with the median voter being pivotal in the
   political-economy theoretical framework in question. As in Razin, Sadka,
   and Swagel (2002. ``The Aging Population and the Size of the Welfare
   State.{''} Journal of Political Economy 110 (4): 900-918.
   doi:10.1086/340780), an increased fraction of retirees in the population
   leads to lower income taxes. Conversely, the results for expenditure
   taxes are ambiguous. The main proposition is that the composition of
   taxes-defined as the extent to which taxes are levied on income relative
   to expenditure-falls unambiguously with the share of retirees increasing
   as the tax burden is rebalanced toward the retired population.},

Abstract = {Throughout British membership of the European Union (EU), agricultural
   policy was largely determined by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
   This was viewed by the UK as a dysfunctional policy and while periodic
   reforms meant that the EU moved slowly in the direction advocated by the
   UK, many of the main policy elements remained in place. The devolved
   administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have always
   enjoyed a measure of policy freedom in agriculture and have diverged
   from England in some areas. This article explores the extent of
   de-Europeanisation in the agricultural sectors in the UK and the
   patterns of divergence between them, focusing primarily on the
   development of policies for agricultural support that will replace those
   in place under the CAP. Overall, there has been substantial divergence
   in policy, but also areas of continuity, which means that processes of
   de-Europeanisation in the UK agricultural sectors has been uneven.},

Abstract = {As Sino-American competition and Russo-American tensions continue to
   rise, many believe that China and Russia have established an
   increasingly well-coordinated division of labour to undermine the United
   States. Yet, this discussion has long neglected the analysis of
   Sino-Russian relations in the Middle East despite the importance of that
   region. Hence, this article investigates how Russian actions there are
   perceived in China through the analysis of the debate among Chinese
   foreign policy experts. Russia is seen as an opportunistic actor whose
   behaviour is only partially consistent with Chinese interests. However,
   problems related to China's own Middle East policy and the pressure
   caused by the rivalry with the United States in Asia greatly limit
   China's capability to adopt a more assertive approach. These findings
   prompt important considerations about the dynamics of the triangular
   Sino-Russian-American relations. They also help us to understand Chinese
   foreign policy and the evolution of world politics better.},

Abstract = {National power has been an important discriminative signal for the
   evolution of great power competition and international patterns in
   recent years, not only in terms of the relative resource scale of the
   state but also in terms of the efficiency of resource use. Based on the
   two levels of national resources and conversion mechanisms, this article
   uses the entropy method to establish national power comprehensive
   assessment index systems covering 144 countries and 38 indicators from
   1990-2020. At the same time, based on power transition theory (PTT),
   this article uses quadratic assignment procedures to verify the
   relevance and interpretation of international bilateral relations in the
   national power gap. The conclusion is that technology and economic
   elements are especially important for national power, and the conversion
   mechanism is icing on the cake rather than a decisive factor. The
   competition among great powers is transformed into nontraditional
   competition rather than an arms race; the international pattern has
   gradually developed from one superpower to a multipolar trend, and the
   global economic and geopolitical center has transitioned to Asia. The
   rise of China and the recession in the U.S. are factual; as the gap
   between the two countries' power narrows, their international relations
   become increasingly tense, confirming power transition theory.},

Abstract = {This article investigates how political machineries and direct delivery
   of developmental goods and services to crucial constituencies were being
   linked and used in two locales in the Philippines: Third Congressional
   District of Pangasinan and the City of Naga. In the context of the
   ``developmental machinery,{''} differences in the two areas' respective
   contexts create distinct yet similar machinery and outcomes in terms of
   both political and socioeconomic development. Utilizing archival
   research and comparative analysis, this article aims to compare the two
   experiences in running political machines that are based more on direct
   people's participation and direct delivery of goods and services.
   Preliminary evidence shows that the two are most likely unique political
   structures that were similarly founded on the principles of broad public
   participation and credible service delivery. More research is needed to
   flesh out the comparison, as well as the ``mode l{''} of developmental
   machinery.},

Abstract = {This article explores the impact of judicial interpretation on legal

   semi-structured interviews with judges, lawyers, and activists shows
   that judges created opportunities for mobilization for social rights by
   changing understand-ings about and uses of pre-existing institutional
   arrangements, through the contingent exercise of judicial agency. While
   Colombian judges pointed to interconnectedness of rights, South African
   judges focused on human dignity. These choices spurred the massive, yet
   unforeseen, expansion of the tutela procedure in Colombia and
   precipitated policy-oriented judicial decision-making and ``meaningful
   engagement{''} in South African constitu-tional rights litigation.},

Journal = {MORAL PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {397-418},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {According to the beneficiary-pays principle, the involuntary
   beneficiaries of injustice ought to disgorge their unjustly obtained
   benefits in order to compensate the victims of injustice. The paper
   explores the effectiveness of the above principle in establishing a
   robust and unique normative connection between the rectificatory duties
   of the beneficiaries and the rectificatory rights of the victims of
   injustice. I discuss three accounts of the beneficiary-pays principle
   according to which the rectificatory duty of the beneficiaries towards
   the victims is grounded in (a) their duty to oppose injustice and
   mitigate its effects, (b) their duty to give up benefits that are
   causally linked to an act of wrongdoing, or (c) their duty to not
   sustain wrongful harm against the victims. By criticizing these
   accounts, I intend to highlight the complexities of articulating a
   distinct rectificatory duty that applies uniquely to the beneficiaries
   of injustice qua beneficiaries. I conclude that, while it may seem
   complicated to defend the beneficiary-pays principle as an independent
   moral principle, it is more plausible to think of it as being derivative
   of more general principles such as the principle of fair play.},

Abstract = {This article explores how predatory economic processes play out in South
   Sudan, particularly in fuelling conflict and competition. It posits that
   issues of personal wealth and communal patronage are just as essential
   to understanding the conflict as politics, ideology and personal
   animosities. The article highlights the structural incentives for
   coercive economics and the commodification of labour. Exploring two case
   studies, it analyses how contests over the vital oil and cattle
   industries create insecurity in South Sudan, outlining the actors,
   methods and incentives involved in this economic violence. It concludes
   with opportunities for further research.},

Abstract = {This article explores the scope conditions of the effect of individual
   political orientation on environmental beliefs, focusing on personal
   economic circumstances. Distinguishing between willingness and
   opportunity factors, it is argued that the positive effect of left-wing
   ideology on public support for environmental protection is more strongly
   pronounced when individuals' personal economic circumstances are better
   as potentially more costly regulations can be paid for. We test the
   theory using three different data sets from three different contexts:
   the German Longitudinal Election Study, the Cooperative Election Study
   (US), and Eurobarometer data. The analyses provide strong and robust
   evidence in line with our expectations. This research adds to our
   understanding of the role of political ideology as well as economic
   conditions in environmental public-opinion formation, and we shed light
   on the interactive influence of self-interest and political
   predisposition.},

Abstract = {In dyadic ultimatum bargaining proposers, who are privately informed
   about the pie size, can exploit their ``moral wiggle room{''} by
   engaging in unfairness which is unobservable by responders. Our setup
   instead assumes better informed responders and, as a consequence, limits
   ultimatum power and questions conflict resolution via acceptance of
   ultimatum proposals. In addition to testing the game theoretic solution,
   based on common opportunism, we assess whether two different market
   framings boost benchmark behavior. Our results confirm nearly universal
   responder opportunism. Although the benchmark proposer demand is modal,
   proposer choices display substantial variation, even in later rounds and
   even in the range in which lower demands would let both parties expect
   to earn more. Nevertheless, such inefficiently large demands become less
   frequent across rounds. Our results also show that market framing is
   insignificant and more so in later rounds.},

Title = {Small states shelter diplomacy: Balancing costs of entrapment and

Journal = {COOPERATION AND CONFLICT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {58},
Number = {4},
Pages = {441-459},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Shelter theory has emerged as a promising but unrealized alternative to
   existing theories of bandwagon and hiding in the literature. It
   describes how small states can utilize the structural power of great
   powers to achieve political aims through the formation of asymmetric
   alliances. At present it is not clear exactly what shelter diplomacy
   aims to achieve, what type of costs it protects small states against and
   to what degree asymmetric shelters are useful when the preferences
   between the small state and the shelter partner widen. The article
   addresses these gaps. It develops a realist inspired model of shelter
   diplomacy that specifies when, how and with what effects small states
   can utilize the structural powers of great powers. It demonstrates how
   shelter diplomacy can help small states balance the costs of abandonment
   and entrapment in the alliance dilemma through construction of both
   asymmetric and symmetric shelters. The main contributions are to bring
   shelter diplomacy into the International Relations mainstream literature
   and develop a new theoretical middle position between the more
   well-described bandwagon and hiding strategies. The model is applied to
   a Danish case that demonstrates how small states have utilized and
   adopted dynamic shelter strategies in the European integration process.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the development of Sino-European relations following
   Russia's attack on Ukraine. I argue that the behaviour of European and
   Chinese leaders is driven by the availability and attractiveness of
   outside options. While both sides want to reduce their dependence on the
   other, neither actor seeks a radical decoupling. Measures to diversify
   supply chains, the negotiation of new trade agreements around the world,
   and the `technology war' have made Beijing's outside options less
   favourable. Europeans are emboldened to articulate their interests more
   forcefully, particularly in the areas of human rights, scrutiny of
   foreign funding, and economic coercion. China, in turn, provides
   diplomatic cover for Russia but resists undermining Western sanctions.},

Abstract = {When countries emerge from a civil war, accountability and compensation
   for harms done are crucial for peacebuilding. However, post-civil war
   governments face uncertain political contexts, delegation problems,
   difficulties building trust among former combatants, deficits of central
   administrative capacity, and incentives to reward supporters. Given
   these challenges, they are unlikely to be able to fairly distribute
   financial compensation. In Nepal, the awarding of internationally funded
   compensation for conflict-related losses provides a very tangible test
   regarding whether factional opportunism or broader public interest
   considerations guide post-conflict allocations. We hypothesize that
   without effective institutions, compensation will be skewed in favour of
   those in power and not proportional to harms suffered. Using
   individual-level data, we analyse who benefited from the post-conflict
   settlement, showing those killed by Maoist perpetrators, those
   sympathetic to the state and members of the state armed forces were more
   likely to be compensated, a biased, hence unfavourable, outcome for
   peacebuilding.},

Abstract = {While national policy styles have (re)gained academic attention in
   recent comparative public policy work, the concept still needs a widely
   accepted operationalization that can allow the collection and analysis
   of data across contexts while steering away from construct validity
   threats. We build on Tosun and Howlett's (2022) work and employ a
   mixed-methods approach, which relies on exploratory factor analysis and
   hierarchical cluster analysis. We put forth an operationalization, using
   Bertelsmann's Sustainable Governance Indicators (SGI) as proxies, that
   achieves conceptual clarity and distinctiveness, informational
   robustness, and statistical power. Ultimately, we construct two
   composite indicators-mode of problem-solving and inclusiveness-calculate
   them in 41 countries and present policy style classifications based on
   their combinations. We report the distribution of countries across four
   policy styles (administrative, managerial, accommodative, adversarial)
   and conclude with an analysis of the clusters, assessments of
   robustness, and comparison with other national policy style
   classification schemes.},

Journal = {STUDIES IN CONFLICT \& TERRORISM},

Abstract = {Since the early 1970s, the United Kingdom (U.K.) has experienced
   political violence undertaken by militant animal rights actors. This
   violence has included the use of car bombs and incendiary devices, which
   are more akin to the tactics of a terrorist campaign. Similar acts in
   the United States have been described as ``eco-terrorism{''} yet this
   label has not gained traction in the U.K. This article is concerned with
   the labeling of militant animal rights actions in the U.K. and explores
   the labels that have been applied by the print media, notably The
   Guardian to the actions of those animal rights actors who have utilized
   or espoused illegal and violent tactics in the pursuit of their cause.
   Moreover, the article takes a more in-depth look at the labeling of the
   group Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) in its campaign against
   Huntingdon Life Sciences and its business partners. How actions are
   labeled can have repercussions in shaping the public debate and policy
   implications.},

Abstract = {Debates and controversies surrounding the conceptualisation and conduct
   of US foreign policy during the George W. Bush presidency (2001-2009)
   are hardy perennials in scholarly discourse. This short introduction to
   the collection of articles that follows identifies and briefly discusses
   key underlying and connecting themes: the Bush administration's approach
   and attitude to multilateralism, the hegemonic unipolarity impulse
   underpinning its policy approaches, and a consistent interest in great
   power politics and relations. Appreciating the significance of these can
   help us to better understand and explain the main drivers behind Bush
   foreign policies as well as in evaluating the ways and extent to which
   the latter have continued to influence and inform policy approaches
   pursued by Bush's three successors to date.},

Title = {Racial Discrimination in International Visa Policies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Does racial discrimination persist in global mobility rights? While many
   states explicitly discriminated based on race far into the twentieth
   century, contemporary migration policymaking is now putatively
   objective. The rise of white supremacist violence against all varieties
   of migrants, politician statements, and public support for restrictive
   policies calls this supposed color blindness into question. However,
   existing work is not discerning because most policies appear objective.
   In this article, I use new data on bilateral visa waiver policies from
   1973 to 2013 to show that racial difference predicts whether a country
   receives a visa waiver, even after accounting for its economic,
   political, and security context. This conditional racial discrimination
   has worsened since 9/11. In so doing, I provide evidence of systematic
   racial discrimination in international visa policymaking. The results
   have important implications for the study of racial inequality in the
   international system.},

Abstract = {Research in differentiated policy implementation in the European Union
   is in vogue because of its strengths for deploying public policies and
   assessing policy outcomes. This article sets out a path dependency
   argument about the dynamics of differentiated customs policy
   implementation in the EU. We analyse two highly representative cases of
   customs fraud to develop a quantitative and qualitative approach to the
   impact of customisation on customs control performance: the first,
   linked to an exercise of unfair competition; the second, a case of
   customs common standards `misinterpretation' related to path dependency.
   We conclude that differentiated policy implementation has proved
   inefficient for ensuring an equivalent level playing field of customs
   controls in the EU, resulting in three substantial negative outcomes:
   economic and budgetary; problem-solving capacity; and output legitimacy.
   Differentiated policy implementation can lead to a competitive
   disadvantage, especially when dealing with policies that do not permit
   any graduation in their fulfilment.},

   Theoretical and Methodological Contributions to Evaluate Participatory
   Public Policies in Latin America},

Abstract = {Citizen participation is a central component among the most innovative
   ways of managing the public sector. As such, it contributes to the
   practices of associationor articulation between the actors and the
   State, enhancing skills, capacities, and social ties, democratizing
   public management and collaborating in the possibility of moving towards
   policy co-production schemes. During the exceptional period of the last
   few years, changes in the development of participatory policies in Latin
   America have been observed, but also setbacks. The objective of this
   paper is to present an instrument to evaluate the impact of citizen
   involvement in policy processes, considering the situation of recent
   years and its repercussions on the participatory management. To this
   end, a matrix scheme is used that covers the multiple dimensions of
   participation in each of the stages of public policy. Contextual
   elements are also incorporated to adapt the tool to the particularities
   of each territory. This scheme is based on the results of previous
   research, an exhaustive bibliographic survey and the comparative
   analysis of case studies in the region -where subnational and local
   governments from Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Chile, Brazil and Argentina
   are incorporated- in order to have devices to monitor the effects of the
   innovations produced in the public sector and their impact on the modes
   of linkage, articulation and coordination between the State and society.},

Abstract = {Existing literature has long debated on religious beliefs and democracy.
   However, the implications of religious institutions, which shall
   internally interpret faith and socialize followers and externally decide
   its political positions with authorities, have yet to be comprehensively
   explored. By adopting an inter-religious comparison in Hong Kong, this
   article argues that religious institutions decided to take different
   positions in response to democratization: Eastern religious
   organizations, including Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism, act as
   ``state defenders{''} to legitimate government decisions at critical
   political moments. However, Christian organizations, including
   Catholicism and Protestantism, act as ``state critics{''} to promote
   political justice. The Anglican Church is located at ``in-between
   status{''} with pro-regime leaders but with pro-democracy followers.
   Consequently, Eastern religious institutions maintain close relations
   with the authorities, Christian leaders face criticisms from pro-regime
   associations, and intra-religious tensions within the Anglican Church
   are intensified. Theoretically, this article moves beyond that, from a
   ``belief-based{''} perspective on how faith facilitates/ hinders
   democratization to an ``organization-based{''} perspective on how
   religious institutions choose their political positions in a
   sub-national hybrid regime. Empirically, this study examines how
   historical development in the pre-handover era contributed to different
   religion-state interactions in the post-handover period.},

Title = {Europeanization of Corruption Prevention Policies in Spain},
Journal = {REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA},
Year = {2023},
Number = {85},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Discussions on how to prevent corruption are now at the heart of the
   most influential international organizations and research centers. The
   best ideas in this field are spreading rapidly through all
   organizations. This fact has combined with the European response to the
   economic crisis triggered by COVID-19 to generate a new process of
   change in Spanish anti-corruption policies. The European Union has
   created the Next Generation Funds (NGEU) to help the member states
   hardest hit by the pandemic-related crisis not only to recover from it,
   but also to put in place the necessary reforms to strengthen their
   resilience to face similar crises in the future. Given that the
   management of these funds, according to European regulations, is
   strongly conditioned not only to ensure their effective and efficient
   use, but also to avoid any risk of corruption, fraud and conflict of
   interest, all organizations (public and private) that will have any
   responsibility in the use of this money are obliged to develop solid
   control schemes that minimize such risks. This fact represents a unique
   opportunity for the Europeanization and improvement of Spanish
   anti-corruption policies. This work analyzes, comparatively with
   previous anti-corruption reforms, the model of change that this reform
   represents. It also describes the general lines of hard and soft
   regulation approved on this matter in Spain, as well as the
   implementation that the ministries most affected by the management of

   the COVID-19 pandemic. Thanks to exceptional support from governments
   and central banks, the world economy returned rapidly to growth
   following the dramatic global lockdowns of spring 2020. However, the
   huge fiscal and monetary interventions involved raise significant
   challenges for future growth and financial stability, especially given
   the sharp rise in inflation from mid-2021. These challenges make
   implementing the ambitious Common Agenda of the United Nations
   difficult, especially as the war in Ukraine has greatly weakened

Abstract = {The past is integral to Labour Party politics, serving as a constant
   reference point in articulating a politics for the present and in
   responding to defeats. In Wales, however, 100 years of electoral
   dominance means that Welsh Labour has not had to respond to defeat in
   the same way. This article therefore analyses how Welsh Labour utilises
   the past when constructing its brand, articulating its ideology and
   challenging opponents. To do this, it analyses Welsh Labour politicians'
   references to Aneurin Bevan, a significant figure in Labour history. The
   analysis argues that while Welsh Labour's engagement with the past has
   helped it to maintain electoral dominance, the references do not engage
   critically with the party's traditions, risk ideological inertia and
   signal potential dangers for the dominant party in a one-party dominant
   system.},

Abstract = {Scholars often assume that courts in authoritarian regimes cannot
   credibly protect foreign investors' interests because these institutions
   lack judicial independence. In this article, we construct a novel data
   set on multinational corporations' litigation activities in Chinese
   courts from 2002 to 2017. This supports the first systematic case-level
   analysis of foreign firms' lawsuit outcomes in an authoritarian
   judiciary. We find that foreign companies frequently engage in
   litigation in authoritarian courts. Moreover, we theoretically and
   empirically distinguish between two types of government-business ties in
   terms of their effectiveness in incentivizing the host state to protect
   foreign investors' interests. We argue that ad hoc, personal political
   connections deliver only trivial lawsuit success for multinational
   enterprises, while formal corporate partnerships with regime insiders
   can lead the state to structurally internalize foreign investors'
   interests. In particular, we demonstrate that joint venture partnerships
   with state-owned enterprises help foreign firms obtain more substantial
   monetary compensation than other types of multinational enterprises. By
   contrast, the personal political connections of foreign firms' board
   members do not foster meaningful judicial favoritism. These findings are
   robust to tests of alternative implications, matching procedures, and
   subsample robustness checks. This article advances our understanding of
   multinational corporations' political risk in host countries,
   government-business relations, and authoritarian judicial institutions.},

Abstract = {An overview of environmental policy in Brazil since President Jair
   Bolsonaro took office in January 2019 suggests that the rise to power of
   a new political elite has led to a radical change in Brazil's trajectory
   of climate change initiatives and environmental protection. The new
   elite is associated with the disruption of two factors historically
   relevant for the design of environmental policy: the participation of
   civil society in the governance of public policy and multilateralism in
   matters of environment policy. Uma analise das politicas ambientais
   brasileiras desde a tomada de posse de Jair Bolsonaro da presidencia da
   Republica em Janeiro 2019 constata que o aparecimento de uma nova elite
   politica acarretou em uma alteracao radical na trajetoria do Brasil com
   respeito as suas iniciativas sobre a mudanca climatica e a preservacao
   ambiental. Houve uma perturbacao de dois fatores por causa desta elite
   politica que eram historicamente importantes pela elaboracao de
   politicas ambientais: a participacao de organizacoes de sociedade civil
   na governanca de politicas publicas e o multilateralismo.},

Abstract = {Why do some states project military force to seek control of resources,
   while others do not? Conventional wisdom asserts that resource-scarce
   states should have the strongest interest in securing control over
   resources. Counter-intuitively, I argue that, under existing conditions,
   the opposite is true. It is not resource-scarce states that will be more
   interested in militarily seeking additional resources, but rather states
   that are resource-abundant and dependent on income from extracting those
   resources. I test this proposition by leveraging a natural experiment
   that analyzes how states reacted to an exogenous shock that exposed
   resources in the Arctic in 2007. I employ original data that measures
   the change in states' Arctic military presence before and after the
   shock. I find that dependence, not scarcity, explains how states
   responded to the shock. The findings enhance our understanding of the
   causes of resource competition and the geopolitical implications of
   climate change.},

Abstract = {International institutions play a key role in sanctions success.
   However, little is known about when senders mobilize institutional
   sanctions and how they induce international institutions to support
   their sanctioning efforts. Senders may need institutional support when
   they expect third-party states to engage in sanctions-busting. I suggest
   that senders anticipate sanctions-busting when they face third-party
   rivals which also have an alliance tie with targets. The presence of
   such potential sanctions busters may lead senders to seek institutional
   support. Also, senders should possess substantial material power to
   induce member states of international institutions to approve the
   sanctioning efforts. I assess the theoretical claim of this research by
   analyzing 1,038 sanctions episodes over the period 1951-2005. The
   findings support my argument that senders pursue institutional support
   when they face potential sanctions busters, and the success of their
   efforts partly depend on their material power.},

Title = {THE EXPLOITATION OF NIGERIA'S CHIBOK GIRLS AND THE CREATION OF A SOCIAL

Abstract = {Scholarship on the \#BringBackOurGirls (\#BBOG) movement mainly focuses
   on its success in generating global attention to the 2014 kidnapping of
   Nigeria's Chibok girls. This paper focuses on an unintended consequence
   of the movement-the establishment of a social problem industry around
   the Chibok girls and their community. The paper draws on a dataset with
   over 160 interviewees and focus group discussion (FGD) participants,
   including 42 \#BBOG activists. The findings demonstrate the interplay of
   contextually situated actors with particular values and interests
   engaged in claims-making regarding the Chibok girls. The \#BBOG turned
   the Chibok kidnapping into a social problem in a sociological sense. In
   the process, the BBOG engaged in an ideational battlefield with three
   other entities. The paper contributes to the sociology of social
   problems by articulating weaknesses in social problem theory. This helps
   to suggest how to make social problems theory more applicable to
   developing world contexts. The paper's approach avoids the unilinearism
   and determinism of existing theory. It argues that not all social
   problems are resolved in ways that are favourable to those affected. The
   exploitation of the Chibok girls and their community provides an example
   of the persistence of social problems: social problems are useful in
   appropriate hands.},

Abstract = {The World Bank, under the stewardship of the United States, stands out
   as the global leader among international development organizations. Does
   China's establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)
   undermine this status? Examining this question, we focus on the
   borrowing practices of a special set of countries: the founding members
   of the AIIB. These founders openly defied the public preference of the
   United States, arguably to create a potential rival to the World Bank.
   Using a new causal inference method, Pang, Liu, and Xu's Dynamic
   Multilevel Latent Factor Model-as well as several well-known estimation
   models as robustness checks-we document at least a temporary decrease in
   the number of World Bank infrastructure projects that the developing
   AIIB founders have entered into. This study presents the first
   systematic evidence that China's AIIB could unsettle the political
   influence the United States has enjoyed over developing countries
   through its leadership of the World Bank. An important set of countries
   may be parting ways with the World Bank and looking to a Chinese
   institution for leadership in the world of development.},

Title = {Gender Gap in Parental Leave Intentions: Evidence from 37 Countries},

Abstract = {Despite global commitments and efforts, a gender-based division of paid
   and unpaid work persists. To identify how psychological factors,
   national policies, and the broader sociocultural context contribute to
   this inequality, we assessed parental-leave intentions in young adults
   (18-30years old) planning to have children (N = 13,942; 8,880 identified
   as women; 5,062 identified as men) across 37 countries that varied in
   parental-leave policies and societal gender equality. In all countries,
   women intended to take longer leave than men. National parental-leave
   policies and women's political representation partially explained
   cross-national variations in the gender gap. Gender gaps in leave
   intentions were paradoxically larger in countries with more
   gender-egalitarian parental-leave policies (i.e., longer leave available
   to both fathers and mothers). Interestingly, this cross-national
   variation in the gender gap was driven by cross-national variations in
   women's (rather than men's) leave intentions. Financially generous leave
   and gender-egalitarian policies (linked to men's higher uptake in prior
   research) were not associated with leave intentions in men. Rather,
   men's leave intentions were related to their individual gender
   attitudes. Leave intentions were inversely related to career ambitions.
   The potential for existing policies to foster gender equality in paid
   and unpaid work is discussed.},

Abstract = {Situated within the public will and political will framework, this paper
   explores frames to address the social issue of gender pay inequity.
   Specifically, the authors examine whether demographic characteristics
   affect perceived acceptability of different frames describing gender pay
   inequity and perceptions of this social issue. First, the authors
   identified 26 terms used to discuss gender pay inequity; this list was
   narrowed to 12, representing four categories. Next, the authors
   solicited sentiment reactions to those frames and perceptions of gender
   pay inequity. Taken together, the results indicated that although
   respondents had consistently positive reactions to the frames fair pay,
   equal pay, and pay fairness, perceptions varied across demographic
   groups. The biggest effects were consistently for political
   party-related variables. One frame, strategic compensation practices,
   emerged as a value-neutral frame that could potentially be used to
   reframe the issue and re-engage business and political stakeholders who
   do not perceive gender pay inequity as problematic.},

Abstract = {Why is there intra-rebel group variation in the amount of civilian
   victimization perpetrated during civil war? I focus on the connection
   between intra-rebel group distribution of foreign fighters and civilian
   victimization. I argue that cells within a rebel group that include more
   foreign fighters are going to be more likely to commit violence on

Abstract = {This article seeks to analyze how norms and procedures created in
   International Organizations spread to member states. More specifically,
   the analysis focuses on how changes in the training architecture for UN
   peace operations, driven by the Brahimi report, caused institutional and
   procedural changes on the administrative, political and military spheres
   in Brazil. Combining official documents and analytical literature,
   through process tracing, we find that the main causal mechanism observed
   was emulation, given Brazil's desire to adapt to use the capacity
   building as a tool for international action.},

Abstract = {Year 2022 brought increasing uncertainty and new challenges around the
   world, including in the European Union (EU), mainly related to the
   Russian aggression against Ukraine and its direct and indirect effects
   for all EU Member States. Europe finds itself in a difficult situation
   which provokes reflection on the current shape of the EU's security
   policy and the need to rethink and structure its stipulations. Faced
   with Russian aggression against Ukraine, the EU has implemented a number
   of new foreign policy initiatives and measures to support both the
   economy of Ukraine and of its member states. This article explores the
   issue of EU and Ukrainian economic security in the context of the
   financial and economic intervention measures taken by the Union to
   maintain sustainable development in the region. The EU support is
   helping Ukraine to survive, while on the other hand the EU has certain
   demands regarding Ukrainian reforms and certain aspects of its policies.
   These sensitive issues regarding the inadequacy of the EU's role in
   relation to recent challenges are topical in the debate in Ukraine.},

Abstract = {The state of prisons in India is poor, especially in relation to
   overcrowding, healthcare and sanitation. The issue of medical facilities
   and adequate treatment was brought to light by the Covid-19 pandemic,
   where overcrowding led to a failure of compliance with the prescribed
   social distancing norms. This paper deals with the state of prisons in
   India, highlighting the impact of the pandemic and examining associated
   changes in incarceration rates. It analyses relevant Supreme Court
   orders and the effects of alternative house arrest and other state
   measures. In conclusion, the paper discusses the measures recommended by
   the United Nations to alleviate the impact of the virus on prisons.},

Title = {Analysing the stability of advocacy coalitions and policy frames in
   Ghana?s oil and gas governance},
Journal = {POLICY AND POLITICS},

Abstract = {Political associations and public discourse on policy issues are
   essential components of any democratic system. Yet, their
   characteristics, particularly those concerning change or stability over
   time, remain largely understudied, especially outside western
   jurisdictions. By applying the advocacy coalition framework (ACF) to the
   context of Ghana's oil and gas governance, this article seeks to reduce
   these limitations by analysing coalition stability at the micro-and
   meso-levels as well as examining the stability of policy frames as
   expressions of policy beliefs. Applying analysis of variance and network
   analysis, these objectives are pursued using news media data collected
   between 2007 and 2019. The results show coalition stability at the
   meso-level but instability at the micro-level. In addition, some policy
   frames appear more stable while others seem less stable. This article
   contributes to existing knowledge by proposing two levels of coalition
   stability analysis, augmenting the number of ACF applications beyond
   western jurisdictions, facilitating comparative analysis, and producing
   more generalisable knowledge.},

Title = {?I Need Husband-Distancing?: Experience of Marital Conflict during the
   COVID-19 Emergency in South Korea},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to understand the phenomenon of marital
   conflict during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emergency in South
   Korea by adapting the vulnerability-stress-adaptation model (VSA; Karney
   and Bradbury 1995). The public emergency of COVID-19 and social
   distancing policies caused emotional distress, so-cial isolation, lack
   of support, and economic crisis in families, increasing the risk of
   marital conflict. Eleven wo-men who reported experiencing severe marital
   conflict during the COVID-19 pandemic were interviewed by tele-phone.
   The interview data were analyzed through directed content analysis. The
   women experienced 1) malad-aptation to sudden life changes, 2) family
   role confusion, 3) economic crisis, and 4) invasion of personal space.
   These adverse experiences, along with the influence of their spouses'
   personality traits, led to reduced physical and psychological
   interaction between the partners and severance of their relationship.
   Attention must be paid to the mental health and well-being of families
   to prevent their dissolution. There is an urgent need for
   com-munity-based psychological intervention and support for families who
   are house-bound for long periods. Addi-tionally, government policies are
   necessary to lighten or share the childcare burden on families during
   the crisis, so women are not compelled to take career breaks.},

   crisis. The case of Guatemala's regional integration policy},

Abstract = {The article analyzes the influence of internal factors in the Central
   American integration crisis, based on Guatemalan politics and from a
   liberal intergovernmental approach. The results confirm the relationship
   between national preferences, some alignment with the preferences of
   partner states, and the results and effects of the process. For
   Guatemala, integration is an ideational commitment conditioned by the
   absence of negative externalities for the interests of governments and
   other key actors. National preferences limited the scope and determined
   the institutional design. The identity commitment and the creation of
   regional institutions seem to be insufficient for integration.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze how there are spatiotemporal factors
   that can disable/enable local agency capacities in peacebuilding
   processes. Those local agency capacities depend on the context, which
   are shaped both by time and space. The traditional conception of time
   and space allows only a narrow understanding that reduces the
   possibilities of agency, and to rethink and broaden the concept of time
   and space I rely on History of the Present Time and Critical Geography.
   This paper illustrates the theoretical debate through the women's agency
   capacities in the Mozambican peace process. This example demonstrates
   the complexities and multifaceted disabling/enabling capacity of
   spatiotemporal factors for the exercise of agency and provide some
   guidelines to identify them.},

Abstract = {Ukraine is currently facing an armed onslaught, the likes of which no
   European country has struggled with since the Second World War, and it
   will probably take years to repair the country physically and the
   population mentally. However, to ensure that the future recovery process
   does not begin with a return to the past, a thorough analysis of the
   state of affairs before the intensification of the Russian onslaught in
   2022, which began in 2014, is needed. The primary purpose of writing the
   article is to show, with real examples, the ineffectiveness of the
   pre-war state-forming function in Ukraine. This analysis indicates why
   most of the reforms were nullified and which steps must be taken to
   avoid these problems for the country's correct economic, cultural, and
   political evolution. Using the Cobb-Douglas function, the relationship
   between intra-system factors of state formation and the standard of
   living of the country's population is also established. It is proposed
   to shape the national concept of the modernisation of the public
   administration system and its new paradigm and to develop its
   state-forming model, which will be adequate with regard to Ukrainian
   realities (including the state post-war) and global trends. Thus, the
   relevance of the research topic stems from the need to provide practical
   recommendations for the future, post-war modernisation of the
   state-forming system in the context of the socio-political and economic
   development of the country, as well as civil society.},

Abstract = {Individuals often come across political conspiracy theories in various
   daily encounters. Researchers have mainly investigated predictors of
   conspiracy beliefs; meanwhile, the psychological and behavioral
   consequences of conspiracy exposure remain less known. In four
   experimental studies (total valid N = 1,091) with U.S. and Chinese
   participants, we examined whether conspiracy exposure promotes
   aggressive behavior and tested several potential mechanisms underlying
   the effect. We also tested whether reinforcing the importance of
   following rules weakens conspiracy exposure's effect on aggression. Our
   results revealed that conspiracy exposure increases aggression through a
   greater tendency to break rules (Experiments 1-3). We also ruled out two
   alternative mechanisms because neither sense of control (Experiment 2)
   nor negative mood (Experiment 3) accounted for conspiracy exposure's
   effect on aggression, and rule-breaking tendencies still significantly
   mediated the effect after we controlled for these factors. Finally,
   increasing the perceived importance of rules weakened conspiracy
   exposure's effect on aggression (Experiment 4). Taken together, this
   research carries significant implications for how exposure to political
   conspiracy theories influences people's aggression. Our findings also
   lend themselves practically to the development of strategies for
   reducing the negative impacts of political conspiracy theories.},

Abstract = {The New Development Bank (NDB) launched its first project in Africa on
   April 13, 2016, and on August 17, 2017, the Bank opened its Africa
   Regional Centre (ARC) in Johannesburg, South Africa. This article
   assesses the NDB's presence in Africa. It addresses the following
   questions: what role is the NDB playing in Africa? What is the ARC and
   why was its created? How well have the NDB and the ARC been performing?
   Have they delivered on their intended purpose? If the NDB or the ARC
   have not performed as well as hoped, or expected, what has stood in
   their way? We assess the NDB and the ARC within the context of the
   general experience of some of the projects that the NDB has been
   financing in Africa and determine whether there are lessons that can
   help the NDB as it expands further into the continent. The main policy
   recommendation is that the ARC be strengthened in ways that enhance the
   NDB's transparency and make it a truly new type of multilateral
   development bank.},

Abstract = {Right-wing terrorist (RWT) incidents targeting Muslims have become more
   frequent and news reporting about these incidents can trigger a variety
   of cognitions and behaviors in audiences. While some studies report more
   tolerance and openness in response to RWT, hate crimes against
   minorities can increase in their aftermath. To date, we know little
   about the associations between following news reporting about RWT and
   attitudes toward Muslims as one of the main target groups of modern RWT.
   Using a young, quota-based German sample (aged 16-25, N = 865), we build
   on Terror Management and Social Identity Theory to shed light on the
   relationships between attention to RWT in the media, threat attributed
   to RWT, and negative attitudes toward Muslims. Additionally, a measure
   of subtle support for far-right extremist stances (SSE) was included,
   accounting for moderation effects. Results suggested that attention to
   RWT was positively related to perceived threat. This association was
   weaker in individuals with higher levels of SSE. Attributing more threat
   was associated with less negative attitudes toward Muslims, independent
   of SSE. Media attention only had a (positive) association with negative
   attitudes in individuals with moderate to high levels of SSE.
   Implications and limitations are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this article, we suggest rethinking the conflict resolution agenda
   among seemingly latent intractable communal conflicts by moving toward a
   constructive transformation of these conflicts. We connect Coser's
   theorization on social conflict and Lederach's conflict transformational
   ideas to, first, offer an alternative way of reconceptualizing conflict
   in ways that focus on harnessing the inherent potentialities of
   conflicts while changing the negative relational patterns among
   disputants; second, we propose emancipation from the local turn in
   peacebuilding to a local-local turn that will create a sense of local
   ownership, legitimize the process and increase the likelihood of
   acceptable and durable outcomes. To substantialize our argument, we
   present phenomenologically generated evidence from the Nkonya-Alavanyo
   conflict, which persists for over a century despite several attempts at
   its resolution. The conflict revolves around two truths derived from two
   maps and two tales and is overshadowed by mutual accusations and
   historically conditioned distrust of mediators.},

   shows that the type of online campaigns of parties depends, to a large
   extent, on the way parties use their resources, as well as their target
   audience. The basis for this conclusion is a qualitative analysis of
   media reports from the campaigns of the three elections. This finding
   suggests the need for a closer investigation on the interplay between
   party organization, use of online tools, and campaign appeals.},

Journal = {COMMUNIST AND POST-COMMUNIST STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {56},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Approaches explaining the dynamics of informal youth participation
   during crisis typically examine youngsters' political activity in light
   of the general understanding of political participation. In this
   article, I argue that such an approach falls short of understanding the
   motivations behind youth engagement during a crisis. Therefore, this
   qualitative study aims to investigate the motivations that triggered
   youth engagement in COVID-19-related protests and how they developed in
   response to government actions. It does so through 20 semi-structured
   interviews conducted across Bosnia and Herzegovina in the first six
   months of 2021 with 20 youth who had either no previous political
   participation experience or only voting engagement. The primary focus is
   on examining the motivations for two informal political
   activities-expression of opinion and protest. The findings reveal that
   the action reaction patterns were not independent occurrences but
   evolved through three different stages each of which depended on
   distinctive motivations.},

Abstract = {Blockchain is gaining popularity as a potential solution for the
   decentralized management of public information. A number of interesting
   solutions have been proposed by independent developers around the world
   to promote blockchain as a promising platform to potentially accelerate
   democratic processes and achieve certain public values in reforming
   digital governance. This could be reflected in facilitating direct
   citizen participation in digital politics, promoting greater civic
   cooperation and engagement in political discussions, boosting the role
   of civic commentary and even collaborative decision-making in
   e-government. In this regard, the article critically elaborates on the
   potential of this technology to promote political dimensions of public
   sector reforms in a post-positivist manner, resorting to the analysis of
   concrete e-participation cases in a number of public areas where the
   potential has already been realized and the opinions of professional
   software developers who are currently engaged in building various
   blockchain-driven data management solutions in the e-government area.
   This paper identifies, debates, and draws on what benefits and risks
   public policy can yield from the implementation of blockchain
   governance.},

Abstract = {Governance and policy authors are concerned with the effectiveness of
   crisis management. In this study, the effectiveness of 27 Chinese
   provinces in addressing COVID-19 is examined using the QCA approach. The
   contribution identifies four pathways for explaining effective crisis
   management and two for explaining ineffective crisis management. Strong
   analytical capacity is a relatively critical condition for achieving
   effective crisis management. This study contributes to the existing
   governance and policy literature through uncovering the mechanisms
   underlying effective crisis management.},

Title = {Conflicts and defensive communication: investigating the mature,
   neurotic and immature defences of service professionals},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to examine task and relationship conflict and
   their linkage with defensive communication strategies, i.e. mature,
   neurotic and immature defensive communication. Furthermore, Study 1 also
   investigated the mediating impact of relationship conflict and the
   moderating impact of a manager's active-empathic listening in dealing
   with task conflicts and the defensive communication of the employees.
   Study 2 intended to assess the causal direction of task conflicts and
   defensive communication strategies.Design/methodology/approachThis
   research integrates the Job Demands-Resources framework, Conservation of
   Resources theory and Conflict Expression framework. Data from 124
   professionals in India's tertiary industry was gathered using a
   longitudinal approach. Study 1 analyses the dynamics between conflicts
   and defensive communication while considering managers' active-empathic
   listening as a potential mitigating factor. Study 2 was conducted after
   a 10-month interim to delve into the intricate causal connections
   between defensive communication strategies and task conflicts. For
   analysing the data, SPSS was used for conducting confirmatory factor
   analysis. Furthermore, to analyse the conceptual framework and the
   hypothesised relationships in this study, partial least squares (PLS)
   modelling was performed using Smart-PLS 4.0.FindingsTask conflicts have
   a significant negative association with mature and neurotic defensive
   communication, whereas they have a strong positive relationship with
   immature defensive communication. Relationship conflict significantly
   mediates the association between task conflict and immature defensive
   communication. The moderating role of the manager's active-empathic
   listening was not supported. In addition, the relationship between
   immature defensive communication and task conflict is significantly
   positive, outlining their bidirectional association. In contrast, the
   association between mature defensive communication is significantly
   negative. This highlights the potential of immature defensive
   communication to create escalatory conflict spirals and of mature
   defensive communication to de-escalate them.Research
   limitations/implicationsDefensive communication strategies, commonly
   explored in the psychological realm, particularly within family and
   romantic relationship contexts, have received limited attention in
   organisational behaviour. This longitudinal study offers a unique
   perspective on the evolution of defensive communication and its impact
   on task conflict over time, enhancing the understanding of how
   individuals adapt their communication strategies as conflicts persist or
   dissipate. The investigation also advances the understanding of conflict
   spirals, illustrating the potential of mature defensive communication to
   de-escalate conflicts while revealing a bidirectional connection between
   immature defensive communication and task conflicts.Practical
   implicationsLeaders need to prioritise addressing task conflicts,
   particularly those that might spiral into relationship conflicts. This
   would present managers with the ability to make task conflicts more
   functional in nature, which could help to enhance both team and
   organisational achievements. The bidirectional relationship between task
   conflict and immature defensive communication points towards the
   exigency for managerial and organisational initiatives to prevent the
   development of conflict spirals at the workplace.
   Originality/valueThis study offers crucial interdisciplinary
   perspectives into the body of literature with the longitudinal
   investigation of the connections between managers' active-empathetic
   listening, task conflict, relationship conflict and the various
   defensive communication strategies. With the help of insights from this
   study, managers and leaders will be empowered to take the necessary
   actions to reduce employee defensive behaviours and foster a supportive
   culture for evoking positive and desirable performance.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the questions of whether, to what extent, and how
   China contests the norms and practices for public debt management in
   developing countries as currently preferred by the Group of Seven (G7)
   and G7-led multilateral institutions. More specifically, it considers
   three norms: debt sustainability, debt transparency and conditional debt
   relief. To that end, I elaborate a norm contestation typology and apply
   it to analyse how China discursively contests these norms. Equally, I
   contrast China's rhetoric with its actual behaviours. Two findings
   emerge from the analysis. First, there are notable efforts by China to
   contest the three norms, with Chinese officials emphasising a
   qualitatively distinct understanding of debt sustainability and debt
   transparency and the appropriateness of non-conditionality and equality
   in the provision of debt relief. Second, there is an apparent
   disjunction between China's words and actions, with its actual lending
   and debt relief practices (becoming) more aligned with what is currently
   preferred or advocated by the established actors.},

Abstract = {While previous studies underscore the importance of climate-sensitive
   approaches to peacebuilding, the relationship between ecosystem services
   and peace and security, especially at the local level, has been
   insufficiently studied. We argue that ecosystem services are often
   neglected by national-level actors and insufficiently integrated into
   peacebuilding interventions and project design. In fact, policy
   discourse at highly aggregate levels of analysis silences local,
   community understandings of ecosystem services and its potential for
   contributing to sustainable peace. For example, despite investment in
   community development in Afghanistan via the Citizens' Charter
   Afghanistan Project, there is scant reference to `ecosystem services' on
   which Afghans are so reliant, much less any policy planning informed by
   it and directed at addressing climate and environmental risks. Drawing
   on evidence from Kabul and Herat provinces in Afghanistan, we illuminate
   the intersections among insecurity, environmental sustainability and
   ecosystem services. Specifically, we examine water-related services in
   Chest-e Sharif district in Herat province and demonstrate how the lack
   of water availability and (mis)management of water infrastructure
   contribute to local communities' sense of precarity and government
   neglect. The findings inform our policy recommendations which are
   intended to address these gaps.},

Abstract = {The article analyses the renewed importance of bilateralism for the UK's
   engagement with individual EU member states in relation to security and
   defence policy. By systematically scrutinising the bilateral agreements
   with 18 EU countries concluded between the EU membership referendum in
   2016 and the end of Boris Johnson's premiership in 2022, we argue that
   the United Kingdom currently finds itself in the process of
   transitioning from one policy regime (multilateralism) to another
   (bilateralism); we try to make sense of this strategy by looking at it
   through the lens of four key aspects stemming from regime theory, namely
   (1) triggering factors; (2) institutional design and adaptation; (3)
   path dependency; and (4) regime sustainability. The analysis shows how
   the sustainability of a purely bilateral regime, with its high degree of
   customisation and intrinsic reliance on specific reciprocity, is
   precarious, albeit while leaving open the possibility to incorporate a
   future multilateral component.},

Abstract = {Collective productive projects are an effective strategy to bring
   reconciliation and development to the most remote parts of the national
   territory. Incipient rural development was recognised in the peace
   agreement, signed between the Colombian government and the Armed Forces
   of Colombia People's Army (FARC-EP), as one of the causes of the armed
   conflict. However, social margins and precarious conditions are not
   exclusive to the countryside; exclusion also occurs in urban centres.
   Using ethnographic methods, we visited three areas of reincorporation to
   identify the socio-economic practices of collective productive projects.
   The findings suggest that the social solidarity economy is a promising
   alternative led by FARC-EP ex-combatants and host communities to resist
   socio-economic exclusion.},

Abstract = {This article, grounded in virtual ethnographic observations during the
   first sixteen months of Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine,
   examines the role of personal stories, testimonies, and other
   communicative acts of Ukrainian social media users in the digital realm,
   their place in the process of knowledge production, and the value and
   authority they hold in the context of participatory warfare. Drawing on
   the notions of `affective publics' {[}Papacharissi in Inf Commun Soc
   19(3):307-324, 2016] and `media practices' {[}Mattoni and Trere in
   Commun Theory 24(3):252-271, 2014], I reflect on how such affective
   media practices are strategically enacted, articulated, and circulated
   by Ukrainians in the networked spaces of war and how they interact with
   high-level state war narratives and traditional expert commentary that
   tend to dominate wartime knowledge production. I argue that
   personalized, reflexive, embodied, socially situated knowledge, and
   lived experiences of war shared on social media can act as forms of
   resistance, while also redefining the meaning of expertise in wartime
   and centring citizen voices in the hybrid media sphere.},

Abstract = {This article examines the paradigm shifts in the European Union's (EU's)
   climate policy from 2009 to 2022 looking closer at the main policy
   instrument of EU's climate policy, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU
   ETS). The paradigm shifts of the EU ETS are linked to the climate policy
   paradigms prometheanism/growth unlimited (PGU), ecological modernization
   (EM), and sufficiency. The question of how ideas have shaped EU climate
   policy and the EU ETS in the past decade is answered, with the
   establishment of the EM paradigm and moving toward the sufficiency
   paradigm. There is a need for more research looking closer at how this
   paradigm shift impacts legislation for climate policy going forward.},

Abstract = {This occasional-series paper offers an economic perspective on the study
   of terrorism and counterterrorism. At the outset, the paper identifies
   how the economic perspective enriches terrorism analysis by stressing
   rational choice of myriad agents (e.g., the terrorist groups, their
   supporters, and targeted governments) subject to constraints.
   Game-theoretic strategic rational choice allows allied and adversarial
   agents to incorporate the responses of others into their interdependent
   choices. Economists' theoretical paradigms are judged by their success
   in predicting agents' behavior and informing effective policies. Since
   9/11, many political scientists, operation researchers, sociologists,
   and others applied economic methods to their study of terrorism. To
   illustrate selected applications of the economic approach, the paper
   considers findings from economic studies on bargaining and making
   concessions during hostage incidents, judging the effectiveness of
   counterterrorism strategies, identifying the economic consequences of
   terrorism, and finding adequate identification strategies in empirical
   studies. Future directions and some shortcomings of the economic
   approach complete the study.},

Abstract = {This special issue explores the role of grassroots activism and social
   movements in creating counter-spaces of democratic learning and
   resistance to authoritarianism in Southeast Europe in the 2020s. It
   investigates the role of social movements and new political actors on
   the Left in containing democratic decline as well as their attempts to
   strengthen democracy from below. The contributions to this special issue
   demonstrate how social movements, which emerged across Southeast Europe
   in the last decade, can be conceived as spaces of innovation resistance,
   and also act as important bulwarks against democratic backsliding.
   Furthermore, the articles delve into the factors that foster the
   engagement of social movement actors in electoral politics, exploring
   the trajectories that political parties take when they enter into the
   electoral arena.},

Title = {Autonomous projects in the face of the global fishing market: women fish
   processors in Senegal in a context of climate emergency},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyse the difficult relationship between the
   needs of the Senegalese state to obtain economic compensation for the
   over-exploitation of natural resources, the right to food sovereignty of
   the local population, and the survival of the environment. It focuses on
   the fisheries agreements signed by Senegal with the European Union (EU)
   and how these have an impact on the conditions of people who make a
   living from the sector, analysing the situation and the self-organising
   of women involved in fish processing, an activity that sustains their
   autonomy and their ongoing reproduction as a collective. Declared goals
   of sustainable fishing in the latest protocol implementing the
   EU-Senegal Fisheries Agreement (2019-2024) are at odds with the actual
   over-exploitation of the marine environment. The commitment expressed in
   Article 2 of the agreement to `promote sustainable fishing and protect
   marine biodiversity' contrasts with the lived experiences of women fish
   processors, expressed in denunciations of campaigns such as Greenpeace
   Afrique's AnaSamaJen (where is my fish?). Based on the assumption that
   overfishing is a form of extractivism that undermines food sovereignty
   and the sustainability of local societies, this article first analyses
   the agreements signed between Senegal and the EU, including their clear
   anthropocentric ontology (Escobar 2017) and discusses how the state
   takes up the financial, environmental and food challenges posed by
   climate change. The second part, based on fieldwork and interviews with
   women fish processors and other actors in the sector, shows how these
   international agreements affect their economic and social conditions as
   well as their resistance, where social struggles and environmental
   thinking are linked.
   Cet article vise a analyser la relation difficile entre le besoin de
   l'etat senegalais d'obtenir une compensation economique pour la
   surexploitation des ressources naturelles, le droit a la souverainete
   alimentaire de la population locale et la survie de l'environnement.
   L'auteur s'interesse aux accords de peche signes par le Senegal avec
   l'Union europeenne (UE) et a leur impact sur les personnes qui vivent de
   ce secteur, en analysant leur situation et la mobilisation des femmes
   impliquees dans la transformation du poisson, une activite qui assure
   leur autonomie et leur reproduction continue en tant que collectif. Les
   objectifs declares de << peche durable >> dans le dernier protocole de
   mise en oe uvre de l'accord de peche UE-Senegal (2019-2024) sont en
   contradiction avec la surexploitation reelle de l'environnement marin.
   L'engagement exprime dans l'article 2 de l'accord, tendant a <<
   promouvoir la peche durable et de proteger la biodiversite marine >>,
   contraste avec les experiences vecues par les femmes transformatrices de
   poisson, exprimees dans des campagnes telles que AnaSamaJen (ou est mon
   poisson ?) de Greenpeace Afrique. Partant de l'hypothese que la surpeche
   est une forme d'extractivisme qui mine la souverainete alimentaire et la
   durabilite des societes locales, cet article analyse d'abord les accords
   signes entre le Senegal et l'UE, y compris son ontologie clairement
   anthropocentrique (Escobar 2017), et discute de la maniere dont l'etat
   prend en charge les defis financiers, environnementaux et alimentaires
   poses par le changement climatique. La deuxieme partie de l'article,
   basee sur un travail de terrain et des entretiens avec des femmes
   transformatrices de poisson et d'autres acteurs du secteur, montre
   comment ces accords internationaux affectent leurs conditions
   economiques et sociales ainsi que leur resistance, ou les luttes
   sociales et la reflexion environnementale sont liees.
   Este artigo tem como objetivo analisar a dificil relacao entre a
   necessidade do Estado senegales de obter compensacao economica pela
   sobreexploracao dos recursos naturais, o direito a soberania alimentar
   da populacao local e a sobrevivencia do ambiente. O autor centra-se nos
   acordos de pesca assinados pelo Senegal com a Uniao Europeia (UE) e o
   impacto dos mesmos nas pessoas que vivem do sector, analisando a sua
   situacao e a organizacao das mulheres envolvidas no processamento do
   pescado, uma actividade que sustenta sua autonomia e sua reproducao
   continua como um coletivo. Os objetivos declarados de << pesca
   sustentavel >> no ultimo protocolo de aplicacao do acordo de pescas
   entre a UE e o Senegal (2019-2024) estao em contradicao com a atual
   sobreexploracao do ambiente marinho. O compromisso expresso no artigo
   2.degrees do acordo de << promover a pesca sustentavel e proteger a
   biodiversidade marinha >> contrasta com as experiencias vividas por
   mulheres transformadoras de peixe, expressas em campanhas como a
   AnaSamaJen ({''}onde esta o meu peixe?{''}) da Greenpeace Afrique. Com
   base no pressuposto de que a sobrepesca e uma forma de extrativismo que
   mina a soberania alimentar e a sustentabilidade das sociedades locais,
   este artigo analisa primeiro os acordos assinados entre o Senegal e a
   UE, incluindo a sua clara ontologia antropocentrica (Escobar 2017), e
   uma discussao sobre como o Estado enfrenta os desafios financeiros,
   ambientais e alimentares colocados pelas alteracoes climaticas. A
   segunda parte, assente em trabalho de campo e entrevistas com mulheres
   transformadoras de pescado e outros actores do sector, mostra como estes
   acordos internacionais afectam as suas condicoes economicas e sociais,
   bem como a sua resistencia, onde as lutas sociais e o pensamento
   ambiental estao ligados.},

Abstract = {The Berggruen Governance Index (BGI) is a new and innovative entry into
   the crowded domain of quantitative governance research. In its effort to
   contribute to the field, the BGI builds off of and acts in dialogue with
   several other governance indicator projects from across the globe. As
   part of a collaborative outlook, the BGI convened the first of three
   symposia at the UCLA Luskin School in October 2022, titled `Advancing
   Governance Indicator Systems: The 2022 Conference'. The event invited
   representatives from other indicator projects to share their thoughts on
   the BGI, present their own projects and discuss avenues for further
   research and development of `planetary' indicators. This article
   discusses the highlights and key contributions from the conference.},

Abstract = {Vaccine distribution in the Global South has created opportunities for
   vaccine-developing countries to improve their international reputations.
   Leveraging a panel survey conducted in early 2021, this article
   evaluates whether vaccine diplomacy affects trust in foreign governments
   in six Latin American countries. Among vaccinated respondents, trust in
   the government of the country that they believed developed their vaccine
   increased relative to trust in the governments of other foreign powers.
   Furthermore, providing information about the aggregate distribution of
   vaccines within a respondent's country increased vaccine-eligible
   respondents' trust in the governments of countries from which more
   vaccines were delivered. In each case, greater trust principally
   reflects updated perceptions of a common good motivation. The article's
   empirical findings suggest that vaccine distribution-especially by
   China, but for other vaccine-developing countries as well-can cultivate
   favorable international public opinion. These favorable opinions may in
   turn facilitate great powers' economic, political, or military foreign
   policy goals.},

Abstract = {Numerous segments of society have been affected by the global Covid-19
   pandemic. It has heralded a new era oriented toward the digitization of
   Pakistan after the shutdown of public sector institutions and
   disruptions in governance implementations. The objective of this study
   is to investigate how governments' innovation initiatives enhance
   government response to cope with Covid-19 with the primitive mechanism
   of citizens' adoption intention behavior during the pandemic. Employing
   a structural equation model in SmartPLS, data samples collected from 663
   followers of social media accounts of government information department
   through a selfadministered survey questionnaire were examined. The
   findings indicated a direct and indirect relationship between
   governments' innovation initiatives and responsive e-governance,
   intending to adopt e-services acting as a mediator. Similarly, the
   quality of government information was found to influence citizens'
   willingness to adopt e-services by interacting with innovation
   initiatives. Institutions and policymakers can benefit from the study's
   strategic and practical recommendations.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this work was to analyze the importance of implementing
   software solutions in public enterprises whose founders are local
   self-government units in the Republic of Serbia. The author's focus was
   on identifying problems in the real functioning of public companies, as
   well as establishing comparative links between self introduced software
   and software purchased from third parties. The study was based on the
   analysis of the software implementation process. The usefulness of the
   study was reflected in the study of the evaluation of the top management
   of the mentioned public companies, on the one hand, and on the other
   hand, the possibility of comparing the results of the evaluation with
   the results of the management of local self-government units was left.
   The urgency of the research study is based on the existence of major
   global changes in the IT sector. Our contribution is pointing to the
   fact that the total income of a public company can be predicted based on
   the evaluated and analyzed factors of influence on the introduction of

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the international
   dimensions of populism, by now a major political phenomenon around the
   world. This interest, however, has been confined largely to the state
   level, especially the influence of populism on foreign policy. In this
   Forum, we argue that it is important for analysis to move beyond the
   state level and view populism as a concept and phenomenon of
   international relations (IR) rather than simply a factor of foreign
   policy. The Forum discusses implications of the rise of populism for IR
   theory, the role of international systemic change in the emergence of
   populism in national arenas, and the ways that regime type, state
   structure and institutions, ideational content, and the political
   strategies of populists condition the impact of populism on world
   politics. In this way, the Forum identifies specific directions for the
   study of populism in IR that scholars can follow in the future.},

Abstract = {The term `resilience' is widely used in current analysis of world
   politics to refer to a situation where institutions surprisingly sustain
   themselves against otherwise dire prospects. Yet, discussions of
   institutional resilience tend to underappreciate its dynamic character.
   This article proposes a reconceptualization of institutional resilience
   that centers the productive power of crisis. It argues that
   institutional resilience is best understood as an interpretative process
   rooted in a co-constitutive dynamic of crisis and adaptation. Resilience
   is made possible through the (re)production of a crisis narrative in
   context. We illustrate this argument with two case studies looking into
   how this dynamic unfolds in the context of political regimes (Cameroon)
   and international organizations (ASEAN). Doing so, we make the case for
   the development of a broader research agenda that can contribute to a
   better understanding of how institutions that are portrayed as frail and
   unstable not only survive but transform over time.},

Abstract = {Development finance needs to be better aligned with climate change
   objectives, and many experts see net zero portfolio targets as a
   powerful way to achieve this. This paper explores the operational
   implications of net zero portfolio targets for development finance
   institutions (DFIs). We set out an agenda to move development finance
   towards net zero goals in a way that acknowledges development concerns.
   These include (1) setting context-specific emissions pathways with
   granular bottom-up data and emphasising climate-development win-wins;
   (2) dealing with inertia and lumpiness in the portfolio through `when'
   flexibility (multiyear carbon budgets) and `where' flexibility (sharing
   of carbon space); (3) encouraging transition projects through
   future-emissions accounting and transition credits; (4) managing
   climate-development and other trade-offs with an internal carbon price
   and ESG standards; and (5) accounting for emissions after project-end
   with monitoring and legal provisions.},

Abstract = {Despite the increasing globalization of housing markets, little is known
   about its political implications. This study investigates whether rising
   Chinese investments in US homes influenced local voting in recent US
   presidential elections. Building on pocketbook/sociotropic voting and
   nativism theories, I develop hypotheses on the electoral consequences of
   foreign real estate investment through greater home demand and equity,
   improved local economies, and changing neighborhoods. Using
   difference-in-differences designs that combine a unique shock to Chinese
   capital outflows in 2013 with county-level measures of local
   attractiveness to Chinese investments, I find that greater exposure
   reduced Democratic vote shares in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential
   elections. Furthermore, an initially larger white population
   strengthened this effect, while a larger college-educated population
   weakened it. In contrast, local equity gains, housing competition, or
   economic strength did not systematically influence the effect. Together,
   the results appear more consistent with the pro-conservative effects of
   nativism.},

   Evidence from galamsey in the ashanti and Savannah regions},

Abstract = {The recent Chinese involvement in small-scale gold mining in Ghana has
   received wide publicity and scholarly attention. While the literature
   has focused on environmental sustainability, political accountability,
   and institutional reforms, it is yet to examine local adoption of
   Chinese technology and its impact on Ghana's rural economy. We argue
   that it is in the interstices between the formal economy and
   entrepreneurship within the informal economy that opportunities for
   Chinese interventions emerge. Using evidence from Manso Akropong in the
   Ashanti region and Bole in the Savannah region, this article shows that,
   while Chinese technology's impact is transformative, the outcomes are
   divergent in different regions. In Manso Akropong, the intensification
   of mining backed by Ghanaian-Chinese collaborations has led to the
   environmental destruction, creating competition between gold mining and
   cocoa farming that had underpinned Ghana's rural prosperity. In Bole,
   where less aggressive Chinese technology such as Changfa and rubber mats
   are incorporated without direct Chinese participation, a more
   sustainable pattern of growth has emerged. This comparative study
   suggests that besides the large-scale projects and state-led training
   programmes, grassroots actors like informal artisanal miners are at the
   forefront of technology transfer in the China-Africa encounter.},

Abstract = {Much contemporary economic policy analysis deploys demographic
   projections. To explore their macroeconomic significance, this article
   draws on documentary evidence from two case studies: (1) the World
   Bank's Human Capital Index and (2) European Union models of population
   ageing within debt sustainability analysis. Combining constructivist and
   Foucauldian insights, we develop a threefold argument about the
   constitutive effects of quantified demographic futures on macroeconomic
   policy analysis. First, the World Bank's and the European Union's
   respective demographic futures mobilise urgency for contingent policy
   choices with reference to expected future `gaps'. Second, they build
   credibility for contested bodies of expertise on the basis of long-term
   population forecasts. Third, they delineate agency such that the effects
   of structural inter-dependencies between economies are rendered as
   national-level policy risks. These findings demonstrate how quantified
   demographic futures circumscribe national policy space, mediate the
   politics of macroeconomic ideas and contribute to the depoliticisation
   of economic policymaking.},

Title = {Who's to blame for failed integration of immigrants? Blame attributions
   as an affectively polarizing force in lay discussions of immigration in
   Finland},
Journal = {POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY},

Abstract = {Increasing expression of antagonism toward immigrants has turned
   immigration into one of the most polarizing issues in many countries,
   among them Finland, dividing people into those who favor and those who
   oppose immigration. But while affective polarization of the kind
   exemplified by widespread responses to immigration has recently received
   increasing attention from political psychologists, little attention has
   been paid to how affective polarization develops through the mutual
   reinforcement of opposing discourses. The application of critical
   discursive psychology to interviews with lay Finns reveals this mutual
   reinforcement in progress. In our interviews, Finns across the political
   spectrum construct five subject positions by attributing blame for
   immigration-related challenges. Both sides blame some ``other{''} for
   the challenges while exempting themselves from blame. Our study makes
   three contributions to political psychology: exploring how blame
   attribution helps to generate affective polarization, illustrating the
   ability of (critical) discursive psychology to illuminate processes of
   affective polarization in individuals, and bringing the concept of
   affective polarization drawn from survey research into dialogue with the
   concept of subject positions constructed by blame attribution drawn from
   discursive studies of populism.},

Abstract = {Parallelization theory complements earlier concepts in cultural and
   political history by focusing on the coexistence of seemingly
   contradictory patterns in various localities, such as
   segregation/integration of migrants in Europe and the USA,
   polarization/hybridization in Korea and Ukraine, and secularization/the
   resurgence of religions in countries like Malaysia and Sweden. The
   current article examines the parallel presence of Ukrainian
   nationalism/Westernization and Russification/Russophobia before and in
   the aftermath of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The argument is
   bolstered by both Russian, Ukrainian, and Western media sources, showing
   how and why these seemingly conflicting tendencies coexist.},

Abstract = {This article examines the inquiry reports from the commissions charged
   with investigating government crisis management of the COVID-19 pandemic
   in Norway and Sweden. Such postcrises commissions have been a common
   feature in many countries as they seek to systematize their experiences
   and learn from the crisis. In this article, we used various dimensions
   of governance capacity and governance legitimacy as assessment criteria.
   It reveals that the commissions' assessment criteria were not very
   specific in their reports, but a reanalysis of their findings shows that
   governance capacity and governance legitimacy dimensions are useful to
   assess the reports themselves. The two reports reveal a lack of
   preparedness in both countries, but they differ in their conclusions
   about governance regulation and output legitimacy.},

Abstract = {The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban)-Housing for All mission (PMAY-U),
   a flagship mission of the Government of India, aims to address the need
   for affordable housing in urban areas through five different schemes.
   One of these schemes is a housing subsidy scheme, the Credit Linked
   Subsidy Scheme (CLSS), which has significantly contributed to the
   success of PMAY-U. However, the design of the CLSS scheme favors
   households considered creditworthy, with stable and secure income
   streams. This article examines the gap between the policy design and
   practice of the CLSS scheme to explore how biases get embedded into the
   policy, resulting in the exclusion of economically vulnerable
   households. Schneider and Ingram's Social Construction of Target
   Population (SCTP) framework is used to identify the target groups
   involved in the CLSS policy chain. These target groups and policymakers
   were interviewed to understand their interpretations of the concept of
   affordable housing. Using a relational lens, these interpretations are
   compared to know how the meanings of affordable housing get represented
   within CLSS policy documents. The analysis presents two key insights.
   First, the power and interests of the target groups predict their
   representation in policy design and policymaking. Second, privatized
   implementation design of the subsidy scheme embeds negative selectivism
   creating exclusionary tendencies in the CLSS design. Lastly, given the
   shrinking of the welfare state across the globe, this study raises the
   critical question of ``who benefits and who loses?{''} while challenging
   the normative aspects of the policy goal of affordable housing.},

Abstract = {Does increasing Internet access and use challenge authoritarian
   elections? I argue that Internet access provides both opposition
   supporters and government authorities with new means to shape electoral
   conduct. Opposition supporters can use the Internet to report on
   electoral malpractice and mobilize for support. At the same time
   government authorities can use the Internet to monitor antiregime
   sentiment prior to the elections and disrupt Internet access to
   selectively repress regime opponents during the elections. Studying
   Uganda's 2016 presidential elections, evidence from election monitoring
   and survey data suggests that electoral violence is significantly higher
   in opposition strongholds with greater Internet access prior to the
   Internet disruption and is targeted specifically at voters. Insights
   from qualitative interviews with politicians, journalists and activists
   underline that the disruption of Internet access indeed hindered
   opposition supporters to effectively challenge electoral malpractice.
   Overall, the results stress the important role that Internet access can
   play for opposition actors in authoritarian elections. At the same time,
   they highlight their susceptibility to manipulation by government
   authorities.},

Abstract = {The European Union's Recovery and Resilience Facility is an
   unprecedented investment opportunity for economic modernisation.
   However, while the supranational European Commission assumes
   considerable influence over the design of national Recovery and
   Resilience Plans (RRPs), there is substantial diversity among RRPs. This
   paper analyses the interaction between national governments and the
   Commission in the coordinative RRP design process. We argue that
   national policy preferences, rooted in the partisan profiles of
   governing coalitions, ultimately explain variation in RRP content. We
   analyse the policymaking process in three semi-peripheral economies in
   Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) - Estonia, Romania, and Slovakia. CEE
   countries are especially suitable because as expected rule-takers, they
   function as least likely cases for the relevance of government agency,
   i.e., national partisanship. Through elite interviews, we trace various
   elements of each RRP to specific positions of governing coalitions and,
   with national variation, the Commission's ability to impose its own
   policy preferences.},

Abstract = {After the Cold War, a new generation of security studies emerged that
   moved debates beyond traditional, narrow, state-centric definitions of
   security toward considering other aspects like economic, political,
   social, and environmental contexts. This article evaluates one such
   contemporary important security concern-the threat of the Islamic State
   (IS), mainly against Iran, in the framework of the Copenhagen School
   security approach. The analysis concludes that IS threatens Iran's
   security by increasing the possibility of Kurdish sectarianism, widening
   the Shi'ite-Sunni gap, creating economic threats, decreasing Iran's
   influence in Syria, and challenging its power in the region. Analyzing
   Iran's stance against IS and the ensuing security debate is important to
   predict the future of the Middle East.},
