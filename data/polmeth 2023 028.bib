Abstract = {Policy boundaries and issue interdependence are not a given. The stakes
   they imply-who governs, how, and where a policy domain is-become
   institutionalized over time, often first by the Global North. We know
   little about how these stakes are presented and institutionalized within
   and across organizations. We tackle this lacuna by asking how, and to
   what effect, an emerging policy domain is situated in a densely
   institutionalized environment. We argue that new policy domains such as
   cyberspace or artificial intelligence prompt resourceful governments to
   forum-shop policy frames by clustering promising issues in new and
   existing organizations in pursuit of coalition-building. Initially,
   resonance is more likely to be established in organizations with
   like-minded countries, leading to partially differentiated
   non-hierarchical regime complexes. In the long-term, competing
   adjustment pressures, particularly felt in the Global South, help
   trigger a regime-shift to an orchestrating general-purpose organization.
   Key actors must reconfigure their frames thereby reducing
   differentiation. In today's geopolitical world, this hardens
   intra-organizational political differences. We examine three
   propositions in the case of cyberspace and show how the proliferation of
   competing frames across organizations led to shifting the policy debate
   to the UN, where only piecemeal policy adjustments are possible. Our
   analysis is based on primary sources and immersion strategies.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, a growing body of scholarship has shed light on the
   persistent inequalities in political representation, revealing that
   citizens are far from equal in their access to, and experience of,
   representation. While ample research has focused on the issue of
   underrepresentation, scarce attention has been given to the implications
   of descriptive and substantive under-representation on the perception of
   being substantively represented, as reflected in citizens' satisfaction
   with implemented policies. This study aims to make a significant
   contribution to the existing literature by investigating the substantive
   representation of descriptively under-represented citizens in the
   context of Belgium. Specifically, this research examines the intricate
   dynamics of substantive (under-)representation with political
   institutions (government, parliament and political parties) and
   citizens' perceptions of being represented in terms of satisfaction with
   government policies. The findings reveal intriguing variations in
   different measures of substantive representation, highlighting the need
   for critical review and further investigation in future studies.},

Abstract = {Antisemitism was on the rise after 9/11, yet, until 2015, there was weak
   policy to address it at the national and EU levels. The following
   examines why and how antisemitism policy emerged on the EU agenda
   culminating in the creation of the 2021 comprehensive strategy to combat
   antisemitism. Utilizing punctuated equilibrium theory, crisification
   literature and literature on Commission entrepreneurship, the article
   explores why, although other violent attacks had occurred against Jews,
   it would take the double attacks in 2015 to bring attention to
   antisemitism within the Commission. Leadership at the EU level, NGOs
   working with EU institutions, a working definition of antisemitism,
   along with pre-existent EU legal bases in antidiscrimination law, would
   help promote antisemitism policy to the EU level. The EU's adoption of
   antisemitism policy demonstrates both Commission agenda setting and
   prioritizing antisemitism due to its threat to EU fundamental ideals,
   thus promoting a `European polity' based on values.},

Abstract = {This article considers how the European People's Party (EPP) responded
   to democratic backsliding in Serbia that unfolded under under the
   leadership of its affiliate, the Serbian Progressive Party. Drawing on a
   qualitative analysis of the European Parliament resolutions and the
   responses of EPP legislators, the article demonstrates that the EPP has
   systematically ignored increasingly non-democratic practices in Serbia.
   Seeking a wider pan-European sway, the EPP strove to protect its Serbian
   member driven by strategic concerns and the logic of partisan
   allegiance. While there was a high level of intra-party cohesion, a few
   EPP members consistently dissented and did not toe the party line. Their
   positions were fundamentally informed by contrasting normative
   commitments to liberal democratic principles and ideological proximity
   to the Serbian Progressive Party.},

Abstract = {Visual politics is a fast-growing field and much of it is focused on
   images that inspire criticism. This tendency results in a lack of
   attention to oppressive visual practices. A political visual literacy
   approaches all visual practices as being layered with different ``visual
   truths{''} that were developed in response to political commitments over
   time. These ``visual truths{''} inflected visual practices in ways that
   may outlive the political settings in which they were first articulated.
   Most important of these is the desire to capture human difference that
   framed the development of visual technologies and is still embedded in a
   range of visual practices. The methodology I develop here links a
   conjunctural analysis of visual tools and practices and the visual
   truths implicated in them with their operationalisation by actors as
   cultural tools through the framework of mediated action. I develop this
   approach by interrogating two layered and harmful visual practices: the
   White-centrism of visual technologies and the racialised origins of
   transphobic visualities in automatic gender recognition technology.},

Abstract = {We review the history, magnitude, and scope of voter suppression in the
   United States., showing that, when it is attempted, it targets the
   voting rights of a disfavored group. We argue that this is an important
   weakness of American democracy and that current efforts at voter
   suppression focus on states with major demographic shifts that are seen
   by some to be threatening. We then discuss the consequences of recent
   decisions by the Supreme Court to weaken key elements of the Voting
   Rights Act, arguing that a weakened Voting Rights Act has led to a
   resurgence of voter suppression in some states and that those same
   states often see a rise in countermobilization efforts aimed at
   encouraging targeted communities to register and vote. An undeniable
   impact of current attempts at voter suppression, we argue, is that it
   signals to certain communities that their participation in elections is
   not wanted.},

Abstract = {Research on labour and development has demonstrated the significance,
   both analytically and politically, of labour for understanding the
   political economy of development. Analyses of labour regimes highlight
   the central role of reorganised workplaces and changing labour processes
   in value chains across the global economy. Research in global labour
   studies illustrates the ways in which concepts and theorisations of
   labour struggles emanating from the Global North struggle to capture the
   dynamics of labour conflict in the Global South and their wider impacts.
   This article argues that the revival of autonomist `class composition'
   approaches can advance a labour perspective on development by shedding
   light on the importance of labour's defeats when mapping the contours of
   the political economy of development. This approach reveals how what
   E.P. Thompson called the `dead ends' of labour history are essential to
   understanding the grounds upon which state and capital reorganise to
   contain workers' demands and struggles, thereby setting new conditions
   for these struggles to re-emerge. Drawing on insights from the early
   work of Antonio Negri, the article will examine how processes of
   working-class composition and decomposition occurred within the
   trajectory of importsubstitution industrialisation in Chile and
   Argentina, establishing new labour regimes in its early crises. The
   article demonstrates this through original archival research using
   industry journals and publications from the textile industry in Chile
   and metalworking industry in Argentina.},

Abstract = {There is a growing recognition that international organizations (IOs)
   formulate and adopt policy in a wide range of areas. IOs have emerged as
   key venues for states seeking joint solutions to contemporary challenges
   such as climate change or COVID-19, and to establish frameworks to
   bolster trade, development, security, and more. In this capacity, IOs
   produce both extraordinary and routine policy output with a multitude of
   purposes, ranging from policies of historic significance like admitting
   new members to the more mundane tasks of administering IO staff. This
   article introduces the Intergovernmental Policy Output Dataset (IPOD),
   which covers close to 37,000 individual policy acts of 13 multi-issue
   IOs in the 1980-2015 period. The dataset fills a gap in the growing body
   of literature on the comparative study of IOs, providing researchers
   with a fine-grained perspective on the structure of IO policy output and
   data for comparisons across time, policy areas, and organizations. This
   article describes the construction and coverage of the dataset and
   identifies key temporal and cross-sectional patterns revealed by the
   data. In a concise illustration of the dataset's utility, we apply
   models of punctuated equilibria in a comparative study of the
   relationship between institutional features and broad policy agenda
   dynamics. Overall, the Intergovernmental Policy Output Dataset offers a
   unique resource for researchers to analyze IO policy output in a
   granular manner and to explore questions of responsiveness, performance,
   and legitimacy of IOs.},

   Crimes},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},

Abstract = {The peace agreement signed by the Colombian government and the FARC has
   an innovative sanctioning regime which, based on a restorative approach,
   offers non-custodial sanctions as a less punitive form of punishment for
   international crimes. However, given their leniency, these `special
   sanctions' have caused controversy. Based on qualitative interviews,
   this study explores the perceptions of different stakeholders concerning
   various issues related to the special sanctions' nature, goals,
   processes, (envisioned) outcomes and challenges. Our findings reveal
   that most participants perceive these sanctions as a tool that can
   modestly help repair the damage done, reintegrate (certain) offenders
   into society, and promote coexistence. Only a limited number of
   respondents saw these sanctions as punishment. For several participants,
   the special sanctions may be an alternative accountability measure to
   prison. However, this seems to depend on meeting certain preconditions,
   victims' participation, the type of crime and the offender's rank and
   affiliation.},

Abstract = {This article reflects on the meaning of China's Central Bank Digital
   Currency (CDBC) with respect to money and power relations to argue that
   it will not represent a rupture with the dollar centric international
   monetary and financial system (IMFS). It combines three theoretical
   approaches - on the nature of money, on currency internationalisation
   and on currency hierarchy - to build an analytical framework that adds
   to the literature that strives to understand the dynamics between money
   and state power. This framework stresses the fundamental place of
   currency dominance and of an underlying currency hierarchy that explains
   the broader configuration and evolution of the IMFS. While there is an
   enormous asymmetry between the economic weight of China and the
   international use of its currency (physical or digital), it does not
   necessarily follow that this tension will be resolved by assembling a
   fairer distribution of the economic and political advantages that come
   along with issuing a currency that is used by the rest of the world (the
   so-called `exorbitant privilege').},

Abstract = {In Norway and elsewhere, care provision for frail elderly populations
   faces pressure from austerity measures and neoliberal governance. Public
   long-term care services are continually reconfigured through new policy
   measures (for example, `ageing in place') and emphasis on `principles
   for prior itisation'. This study utilises ethnographic approaches to
   provide new insights into the prevailing contestation and devaluation of
   care work. Care work is predominantly carried out by women; thus,
   ongoing, fundamental reforms to the welfare system simultaneously
   represent a gendered battle. We identify tensions around how `needs' for
   care are interpreted and argue that the female workforce is coerced to
   accept rationalities that undermine their professional and ethical
   understandings of `proper care work', which, in turn, questions the
   perception of the `women-friendly' Norwegian welfare state.},

Title = {Inclusion or co-optation? Navigating recruitment as a gender diversity
   candidate in finance},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {In the decade-plus following the financial crisis of 2008, diversity and
   inclusion initiatives - especially those targeting gender - have
   proliferated in global financial centres. Feminist political economists
   critique the ways that struggles for gender and racial equality can
   become co-opted via inclusion endeavours, and how they may primarily
   serve to legitimate existing institutional practices. At the same time,
   diversity and inclusion initiatives open up counterspace for emerging
   professionals to draw from experiences of marginalisation, formulate
   critiques, and push back against processes that generate inequalities.
   In this study, I draw from field-based and interview research on gender
   diversity programmes in finance to analyse how dynamics of co-optation
   and critique play out as recent initiates into the industry navigate
   diversity offerings. I refer to De Jong and Kimm's (2017) research
   agenda on co-optation as conceptual reference, demonstrating how
   mechanisms, effects, and actor's perceptions of co-optation play out
   together in this particular institutional matrix. The fault lines that
   emerge around institutional practices of diversity indicate where a
   hegemonic incorporation that would serve the financial establishment is
   incomplete and contestations over the inclusivity of professions,
   markets and financialised societies remain.},

Abstract = {To examine how private regulatory governance reproduces a market logic
   that always already circumscribes possibilities for radical change, we
   tarry with Michel Foucault's notion of governmentality and his writings
   on power. We focus on two major initiatives created to regulate gold
   supply chains, subjecting their publicly released documents to a
   discourse analysis. This reveals subtle but tangible examples of how
   these initiatives discursively shape business preferences and
   possibilities for engaging with a social change agenda. Through a focus
   on how power circulating through these initiatives works to shape the
   identities and interests of business actors themselves, we contribute a
   new perspective to the literature on business, power, and private
   regulatory governance, one that highlights the ways through which these
   discourses both expand and limit business actors' engagement in setting
   social agendas and the mixed and sometimes seemingly contradictory
   implications for the public interest.},

Title = {Under the influence: The celebrity factor in policy capture},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {158-176},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Celebrity is a form of policy influence that can occur under distinctive
   circumstances. This paper draws on the regulatory/policy capture
   literature to develop a model of celebrity capture that explains how
   interest groups can affect policy in the absence of economic clout or
   constituency mobilization. We posit that the likelihood of celebrity
   capture increases when several factors align: (1) a context open to
   change; (2) reduced oversight in decisionmaking processes; (3)
   organizations that have credibility and a halo effect due to their
   celebrity status; and (4) an uncoordinated sector with weak intermediary
   organizations. The analysis applies process tracing to account for the
   success of one celebrity-founded and celebrity-led organization, WE
   Charity, in shaping the design and being awarded sole-source
   implementation of the CAD \$543 million Canada Student Service Grant
   (CSSG) program during COVID-19. The CSSG, which proposed to pay up to
   100,000 students to ``volunteer{''} in nonprofits over the course of a
   summer, quickly failed and became a public ethical scandal.},

Abstract = {The Child Tax Credit (CTC) has become an increasingly important element
   of the U.S. safety net. We discuss the structure of the CTC and its
   effects on childhood poverty and other indicators of well-being during
   its three distinct phases: prior to the 2021 American Rescue Plan (ARP)
   expansion, during the expansion, and after the expansion's expiration.
   We also examine recent efforts to establish state-level CTCs. We show
   that, in 2020, roughly one in three children were ineligible for the
   full CTC because it is tied to family earnings. The temporary expansion
   under the ARP extended full CTC eligibility to nearly all of these
   children, thus moving more than three million children out of poverty in
   the expansion months. State-level analyses show how states could
   establish CTCs that reduce child poverty rates by half, either as a
   complement to an expanded federal CTC or in the absence of a continued
   federal expansion.},

Abstract = {Although markets are becoming increasingly transnationalized, the social
   question appears to remain firmly national. The aim of this article is
   to discuss under what circumstances, if at all, the social question
   ought to have a transnational dimension and what form it should take. As
   such, the article seeks to build a normative framework that abandons the
   conventional taxonomies of moral duties and instead links the concept of
   responsibility to governance, which takes place in the space of the
   polis through a reliance on questions of group agency. To this end, the
   article will draw on different aspects of responsibility. Having
   established a link between the social question and the concept of
   responsibility based on outcome and remedial responsibility, it will
   draw on collective and shared responsibility to consider what, if any,
   transnational dimension the social question should have.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the recent use of European Union (EU) terminology
   of digital sovereignty and strategic autonomy, aiming to identify
   tensions between policy considerations of fundamental rights, free
   market principles and geopolitical concerns. These tensions are rooted
   in the disparity between the EU's considerable economic and regulatory
   power in digital matters and its limited mandate and capabilities in
   foreign policy. The article also explores the translation of the notions
   of digital sovereignty and strategic autonomy into EU policy. It
   identifies three important trends in the geopoliticisation of the EU
   agenda on digital technologies: (1) the instrumental use of `classic'
   internal market policies to exert geopolitical influence; (2) the
   imposition of foreign policy imperatives on national markets; and (3)
   new `hybrid' digital policies that combine internal market concerns,
   fundamental rights and geopolitical concerns. Ultimately, digital
   sovereignty has inherent tensions with the EU's normative power in
   digital issues and may also result in a strategic cacophony.},

Abstract = {The article provides an innovative, comprehensive quantitative analysis
   of legal integration and differentiation in the European Union (EU) from
   1958 to 2020. Building on a streamlined analytical framework and new or
   revised datasets on EU primary, EU secondary and EU-related
   international law, it challenges or qualifies several aspects of the
   received wisdom on European integration. Specifically, it delivers the
   first-ever quantitative estimate of integration in terms of integration
   opportunities, shows that differentiation is deployed in a reluctant and
   eclectic manner and offers clear measurements for the prevalence of
   various modes of temporal, spatial and policy differentiation. These
   methodological and empirical findings confirm the fruitfulness of the
   quantitative approach to the study of European integration and point to
   promising avenues for future research on international integration and
   comparative regionalism.},

Abstract = {Using a data set of 1.1 million speeches drawn from UK House of Commons
   debates during 1997-2017 and a combination of automated and manual
   content analysis, this study addresses three interrelated questions.
   First, to what extent are minoritised women constitutively represented
   in parliamentary debates? Second, which MPs do so? Third, how do MPs'
   race and gender affect how they represent minoritised women? I find that
   minoritised women are mentioned exceptionally rarely in parliamentary
   debates. Furthermore, descriptive representatives are not only
   substantially more likely to mention minoritised women than other MPs,
   but they also improve the quality of representation by doing so in
   relation to a wider range of issues. Yet, paradoxically, white men's
   descriptive over-representation means that they account for the vast
   majority of mentions of minoritised women. More broadly, I foreground
   the distinction between constitutive and substantive representation,
   highlighting the importance of distinguishing between speaking about and
   on behalf of.},

Abstract = {Under which conditions do social movements receive extensive attention
   from the mainstream news media? We develop an institutional mediation
   model that argues that combinations of the news-heightening
   characteristics of movements, including their disruptive capacities,
   organizational resources, and political orientation, and political
   contexts, including partisan regimes and benefiting from national
   policies, bring extensive attention to movements. It also holds that
   investigations will draw extensive media attention to movements, and
   those that have achieved prominence in the news will remain prominent
   under specific conditions. We appraise these combinational arguments by
   examining 29 social movements across 100 years in four national
   newspapers using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). Researchers
   typically use QCA to study the consequences of movements when they
   hypothesize outcomes to result from multiple combinations of conditions.
   This raises our second main question: How should scholars best address
   combinational hypotheses using QCA? Here we employ Venn diagrams to
   identify and illustrate key analytical issues and anomalies, including
   constrained diversity in observational data, empirical instances when
   combinations of conditions do not produce the expected outcome, and
   instances when unexpected combinations of conditions produce a
   consistent result. We also demonstrate the value of broad comparisons
   across movements and over time in these analyses.},

Abstract = {In times of political crisis, populism uses visual artifacts to give
   concreteness to central entities such as power and the people. The
   campaign poster, which favors visibility, simplicity and accessibility
   to the message, fits particularly with the populist goals of embodying
   the people and bridging the political representational gap. How does
   political representation transfer to/become visual representation? Which
   visual, symbolic, psycho-affective processes are mobilized? To answer
   these questions, this study intends to explore the concept of
   representation as well as the iconography of the National Front/Rally
   throughout its campaign posters from 1972 to 2019.},

Pages = {29-38},
Abstract = {Any threat to use nuclear weapons inherently carries the possibility of
   escalation to a level such that both parties in a conflict, and likely
   many others, would be destroyed. Yet nuclear weapons are also seen as
   necessary for securing the very things that would be destroyed if the
   weapons were ever used. The fix for this nuclear dilemma relies on the
   strategy of deterrence. Deterrence provides a rationale for why nuclear
   weapons are necessary, even though they may seem dangerous. But the
   practice of deterrence involves less intentionality and agency than is
   usually assumed. The success of deterrence relies partially on luck as
   well as unrealistic assumptions about human behavior. Rather than a
   strategic necessity, deterrence may be an institutionalized behavior,
   accepted because it has always been practiced rather than because it
   makes sense. Assessing the ethics of deterrence and nuclear weapons
   requires engaging with these issues.},

Abstract = {The institutional design of voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) has
   been recognized as an important determinant of compliance with VSS
   rules, which partly explains heterogeneity in VSS sustainability
   impacts. However, the current understanding of how VSS institutional
   design generates compliance is scattered and lacks systematic
   operationalization. This paper brings together different strands of
   literature and identifies three main mechanisms through which VSS
   institutional design can generate compliance: enforcement, market
   incentives, and capacity-building. We propose an integrated analytic
   framework that operationalizes these mechanisms into specific,
   identifiable design attributes. We apply it in an empirical analysis of
   13 agrifood and forestry VSS to assess the extent to which these
   mechanisms are used in VSS institutional design. While enforcement
   appears necessary for VSS to operate, we find heterogeneity in how these
   mechanisms are used and combine, which is partly explained by contextual
   factors. This provides avenues for analyzing their respective
   effectiveness in generating compliance.},

Abstract = {Existing research has demonstrated that government policies often
   prioritise growth over climate during economic downturns. Yet government
   stimulus spending during economic downturns also offers an opportunity
   for decarbonisation through long-term investments in infrastructure,
   transportation electrification, building efficiency, and clean energy
   technologies able to reduce emissions and sustainably shift the economy
   away from fossil fuels. We study the size and distribution of green
   stimulus spending in response to two recent economic downturns - the
   2008 financial crisis and the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. Focusing on Canada
   and the US - two major economies with strong incumbent fossil fuel
   interests - we explore the determinants of green stimulus spending.
   Counter to conventional wisdom, our findings provide little evidence to
   support the notion that institutional permeability to industry lobbying
   influenced the share of green stimulus spending. Instead, drawing on a
   novel dataset on green recovery spending and lobbying, we show that the
   strength of liberal parties in the legislatures shapes the distribution
   of stimulus funds. Our analysis suggests that liberal parties committed
   to decarbonisation can leverage economic crises to align economic and
   climate policy making, even in the face of strong lobbying efforts by
   the fossil fuel sector.},

Title = {Africa's roads to digital development: paving the way for Chinese
   structural power in the ICT sector?},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, China emerged as Africa's main partner in
   digital development. Sino-African cooperation in the Information and
   Communications Technology (ICT) sector meets African demand for advanced
   technologies and know-how while helping China to position itself in the
   global ICT sector. Albeit crucial for Africa's digital development in
   the short term, this paper argues that the breadth of Sino-African
   cooperation carries important long-term consequences that could afford
   China latent control over Africa's digital development. Drawing on Susan
   Strange's pillars of structural power, this paper considers how the
   rollout of fiber-optic network cables underpins Chinese control over
   production, how the construction of data centers might impinge on
   security, and how research partnerships enhance norms and standards in
   future innovation-the knowledge pillar. The paper argues that the
   enabling force of Sino-African cooperation in these three realms is
   Chinese finance. To test this claim, I conduct a Qualitative Comparative
   Analysis (QCA) of 42 states in Sub-Saharan Africa, showing that Chinese
   aid and, to a lesser extent, Chinese loans are the main drivers of
   Sino-African ties in the ICT sector. The paper concludes that Chinese
   financial support not only promotes Africa's digital development but
   also paves the way to Chinese structural power in the ICT sector.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the role played by the main European
   cooperation mechanism on asylum, the Common European Asylum System, in
   the making of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex rights in the
   European Union. Based on a one-year qualitative inquiry in Brussels and
   online, it shows that European Union asylum policies were a key arena
   for the consolidation, invention and renegotiation of European Union
   lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex rights, especially concerning
   trans recognition. This pioneering role, far from being fortuitous, was
   part of the conscious strategy of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and
   intersex movement to use asylum as a `side door' to the creation of a de
   facto recognition of `gender identity' as a protected characteristic.
   Characterising this phenomenon as a `politics of interstices' and
   analysing the importance of ignorance (and not just knowledge) as a tool
   for policy change, this article makes the case for an analysis of
   policymaking that acknowledges the importance of non-equality-specific
   arenas in the making of equality norms.},

Abstract = {The current political and regulatory discourse frequently references the
   term ``trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI).{''} In Europe, the
   attempts to ensure trustworthy AI started already with the High-Level
   Expert Group Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and have now merged
   into the regulatory discourse on the EU AI Act. Around the globe,
   policymakers are actively pursuing initiatives-as the US Executive Order
   on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI, or the Bletchley Declaration on AI
   showcase-based on the premise that the right regulatory strategy can
   shape trust in AI. To analyze the validity of this premise, we propose
   to consider the broader literature on trust in automation. On this
   basis, we constructed a framework to analyze 16 factors that impact
   trust in AI and automation more broadly. We analyze the interplay
   between these factors and disentangle them to determine the impact
   regulation can have on each. The article thus provides policymakers and
   legal scholars with a foundation to gauge different regulatory
   strategies, notably by differentiating between those strategies where
   regulation is more likely to also influence trust on AI (e.g.,
   regulating the types of tasks that AI may fulfill) and those where its
   influence on trust is more limited (e.g., measures that increase
   awareness of complacency and automation biases). Our analysis
   underscores the critical role of nuanced regulation in shaping the
   human-automation relationship and offers a targeted approach to
   policymakers to debate how to streamline regulatory efforts for future
   AI governance.},

Abstract = {Public sector unions are increasingly becoming the hegemonic
   contemporary labor actor in terms of membership and militancy in both
   advanced and emerging economies. However, political economy lacks a
   unified theoretical approach to study mobilization by state unions. The
   analysis of public sector union politics has been largely separated by
   regional (United States vs. Europe vs. Global South) and disciplinary
   (American politics vs. comparative politics/political sociology)
   divides. We contend that though both public and private workers belong
   to the subaltern classes, public sector union politics and mobilization
   have different foundations than in the private sector. Unlike private
   unions, state labor mobilization is essentially driven by what we call
   the ``reverse economic cycle{''} (militancy increases in bad-rather than
   good-economic times), by the legal enforcement of bargaining rights
   (which in contrast to the private sector substantially varies across and
   within democracies), and by the likelihood of a political exchange
   between labor and the government. Argentine teachers between 2006 and
   2019 provide an ideal laboratory to test this argument through a
   multilevel (i.e., national and subnational), mixed-methods strategy,
   which includes comparative and statistical assessments.},

Title = {Between a republican and a Bengalee state: Confronting
   exclusionary constitutionalism in Bangladesh},
Journal = {GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {562-589},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The constitutional design of Bangladesh is characterized by an
   ambivalent choice: it aspires to establish a republican yet a Bengalee
   state by putting itself in the conflicting terrain within the
   demos-ethnos binary. This article aims to examine the implication of
   this problematic choice along all three axes of the constitution's
   elemental parts: its identity, rights and structure. While the identity
   element of the Bangladesh Constitution embodies the ethno-nationalist
   vision of the Bengalee state that transforms demos into ethnos, its
   rights and structural aspects reflect its republican promise to
   transform ethnos into demos. Contemporary scholarship seeks to confront
   the exclusionary dimension of the ethno-nationalistic choice in
   Bangladesh but ends up accepting ethnos as a politically superior value.
   Such an approach brings us to the politics of difference and, with that,
   undermines the integrationist potential of the republican constitution.
   In response, this article defends the republican promise of the
   Bangladesh Constitution while arguing that what we need in Bangladesh is
   the `de-ethnicization' of the republic, one that can be achieved by
   transforming ethnos into demos and not the other way around.},

Abstract = {The planned economy was a defining element of the Bolshevik
   dictatorship. In contrast to scholars who have located its intellectual
   roots in the classic texts of nineteenth-century Marxism, this essay
   situates the origins of economic planning in World War I. The text
   analyses the link between war and planning in Russian and German
   thought. In doing so, we argue that the Bolsheviks' positive assessment
   of the techniques of wartime mobilisation, influenced by the work of
   German economist Rudolf Hilferding, was foundational to their vision of
   organising the economy through the state.},

Abstract = {How was the European Union's privacy regime built? Drawing on regime
   theory and carrying out qualitative document analysis, we present the
   evolution of the privacy regime across the three decades from the 1995
   European Data Protection Directive to the 2016 General Data Protection
   Regulation, the 2022 Data Governance Act and finally the 2022 Digital
   Markets package. Our analysis focuses on the European Commission and
   suggests that the privacy regime emerged out of the seemingly
   conflicting interplay between the (digital) single market whose power
   draws on the network effects of expanding data resources and concerns
   for personal privacy that seek limiting data gathering itself. Contrary
   to expectations, potential tensions between competition law and consumer
   protection have not hindered or decelerated the formation of the
   regulatory regime. In fact, these tensions have proven to be
   surprisingly productive.},

Abstract = {In the mid-1950s, Atoms for Peace provided a crucial boost for the study
   of nuclear physics in Hungary, a country that fell under Communist rule
   and Soviet domination after World War II. Several small, insulated
   centers of nuclear research already existed, but after President Dwight
   Eisenhower's speech to the United Nations General Assembly on 3 December
   1953, calling for the development of Atoms for Peace programs, Hungary's
   efforts began to grow quickly. In the glow of the moment, with
   significant support from the government and the ruling Communist party,
   Hungarian physicists established new research centers, bought and
   constructed instruments, published specialized books and journals, held
   conferences, and organized university courses and programs to train
   experts both at home and in the USSR. These activities constituted a
   new, vibrant nuclear culture encompassing diverse areas of life
   (agriculture, medicine, and some parts of industry) and eventually some
   cooperative links with Western and Soviet-bloc scientific communities.},

Abstract = {This article explores how Muslim women's activism unfolds in the context
   of anti-Muslim racism and Islamism in contemporary Germany. In
   particular, it identifies both gendered forms of anti-Muslim racism and
   Islamism encountered by Muslim women's organizations and ways they
   respond to it. Drawing on theories of intersectionality and boundary
   making, this study identifies the most common strategies used to
   confront anti-Muslim racism and Islamism and their implications for
   intersectional boundary making. For this purpose, six expert interviews
   with representatives of major Muslim women's organizations were
   conducted and supplemented by data from internet research and
   participatory observation. Based on a Grounded Theory-inspired approach,
   the findings show that the responses of Muslim women's organizations to
   anti-Muslim racism and Islamism reconfigure group boundaries. They
   create more inclusive spaces in which boundary formations by religion,
   race, and ethnicity and gender are transcended.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) post-COVID-19 investment and reform programme,
   the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), has been hailed as novel and
   ambitious, both as a fiscal instrument and as a lever for accelerating
   progress towards EU climate commitments. Yet, its design also exhibits
   strong path dependency, drawing on existing processes and commitments.
   Adapting theories of institutional change and models of hard/soft
   governance, we argue that the RRF is an example of significant yet
   gradual change - of evolution rather than revolution - taking place via
   layering and conversion of existing frameworks, and alteration of their
   logics of action. We show how the RRF repurposes the European Semester
   and track continuity and change in climate policy, a key priority area.
   Our findings suggest that the literature on institutional change should
   give greater consideration to the interplay between layering and
   conversion as a mechanism of gradual yet transformative evolution.},

Title = {Secular-Religious Dynamics and their Effect on Humanitarian Norms
   Compliance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We propose a more nuanced examination of the powerful forces that play a
   role in shaping the view shared by many international humanitarians that
   religions have a predominantly negative influence. First, we examine the
   role of secularist underpinnings of humanitarian discourse in shaping
   secular-religious dynamics in the humanitarian sphere, and the
   intersection of this with other forces of power. We argue that analyses
   of secular-religious dynamics are essential to understanding the roles
   of and attitudes towards faith actors in humanitarian norms compliance
   as well as the actions and reactions of faith and humanitarian actors.
   Theoretically, we ground the article in an analysis of secular
   perspectives towards impartiality and neutrality, the observation of
   which is meant to secure humanitarian space. Interrogating secular
   perspectives on humanitarian action helps demonstrate how impartiality
   and neutrality can be used as reasons to avoid engagement with faith
   actors. A secular approach to humanitarian action tolerates religion
   with boundary-creation around what is permitted from faith actors,
   applying a reductive `good'/'bad' binary. We then examine the
   experiences of local faith actors (LFAs) in South Sudan in interaction
   with international humanitarians with respect to humanitarian
   principles. These examples demonstrate how LFAs comply with humanitarian
   principles and view this as part and parcel of their commitment to the
   values of their faith tradition. They also show how LFAs create space
   for humanitarian norms compliance of other actors through their
   peacebuilding work and have been relied upon to access parts of the
   country that are inaccessible to international humanitarians due to
   safety concerns.},

Title = {Bivalent Hegemony: How Hindu Nationalists Appeal to Caste-Oppressed
   People in Communist-Ruled Kerala},

Abstract = {A recent trend has confounded observers of India's political system.
   Dalits-a population that has historically been deprived of vital
   resources and socially ostracized by upper-caste Hindus-have
   increasingly given their vote to the Hindu nationalist movement led by
   the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). Why have some members of India's most
   marginalized caste come to support a party that has preserved caste
   hierarchies and catered to the socially dominant sections of society?
   This article explores this question through the case of Kerala, where
   Dalit support for the BJP is additionally perplexing given the state's
   history of left-led governments that have implemented far-reaching
   redistributive reforms that greatly benefited Dalits. Nevertheless, in
   recent years the Hindu nationalists have made significant inroads among
   Kerala's Dalit population. Drawing on two hundred interviews and eight
   months of ethnography, this article identifies two major factors driving
   Dalits' defection to the BJP. The first is linked to the communist
   parties' (CPs') agricultural land redistribution program which, despite
   being the most ambitious of its kind in modern India, excluded the
   majority of Dalits and reinscribed caste hierarchies. The second factor
   is the cultural discrimination Dalits face while working in the CPs,
   including being grossly underrepresented in the party leadership. The
   BJP exploits these grievances by providing representation to Dalit
   cadres who are embedded in strategic majority-Dalit neighborhoods. These
   cadres win popular support through welfare brokering and also by
   constructing a new narrative that portrays the CPs as casteist and the
   BJP as a more socially just alternative for Kerala's Dalits. This
   article makes sense of these findings by drawing on Nancy Fraser's
   concept of bivalent oppression to advance a novel Gramscian theory of
   ``bivalent hegemony.{''}},

Abstract = {War metaphors permeate the world we live in. From wildlife documentaries
   (natural war) to the curbing of academic freedom (war on woke), it seems
   that anything can be described in an essential likeness to warfare.
   Drawing on Lacanian psychoanalysis, this paper investigates the ubiquity
   of war metaphors in critiques of violence within Critical Security
   Studies and International Political Sociology. The analysis focuses on
   three concepts recently advanced as alternatives to the shortcomings of
   securitization theory and its reliance on a mythological idea of liberal
   peace: fighting, martial politics, and struggles. The paper investigates
   how each of these concepts is built in relation to war metaphors and
   explains this as revealing of an underlying symptom, a form of
   ontological militarism, which these alternatives to securitization
   cannot properly work through. It advances the concept of ontological
   militarism as the attribution of heuristic privilege to war turning it
   into the cypher of all social relations by investment in an assumed
   indistinction between war/peace and war/struggle. The paper invites
   critiques of liberal civility in International Relations (IR) to take
   seriously the point whereby the resort to war metaphors becomes the
   symptom of an inability to escape the symbolic horizons of a violent
   militaristic order.},

   contender state-society complex's concept. The imprints of China's
   contender state are identifiable in its peculiar mode of mediation of
   transnational capital both in terms of the state ownership-leadership of
   BRI projects' and of their effective and potential outcomes. While BRI
   fixes over-accumulated capital through valorisation in external
   geographies, it is modulated to respond to a set of multi-scalar
   political and economic imperatives. Studied activities in the Middle
   East contribute to China's energy security in terms of direct access to
   oil, trade routes, and oil invoicing practices. Transports and logistics
   investments strategically integrate the mainland's underdeveloped
   regions as central nodes in the BRI's transnational capital flows to
   dynamise their economies and ensure political stability. Beijing seems
   to be conducting a territorially embedded strategy to restructure the
   international monetary system through new oil-related financial and
   monetary arrangements with Middle East producers. Geopolitically, BRI
   reduces dependence on US-dominated global connectivity networks, thus
   increasing Beijing political autonomy.},

Abstract = {New Zealand's involvement in the Five Eyes is under-reported in academic
   and general literature. New Zealand's participation was initially due to
   its integration within World War II western alliance intelligence
   systems, which evolved further after the war ended. Once in, New
   Zealand's role became something of a self-fulfilling prophecy, but
   genuine nonetheless. Changes in communications technology, access to US
   technical capability, and geopolitical changes in the Pacific have all
   led to a viable New Zealand role in Five Eyes, as both contributor and
   beneficiary. But to retain this, New Zealand must increase its foreign
   intelligence capability in the future.},

Abstract = {This article explores the emergent intersectional framework and forms of
   activism among feminist/queer university students against government
   policies that attack participatory democracy, citizenship rights, and
   spaces of freedom and solidarity in Turkey. An increasing number of
   student activists find it difficult to engage and mobilize around
   single-issue politics; instead, they tend to define social justice in
   its most comprehensive terms, build associations across diverse forms of
   disempowerment and struggle, and identify themselves with multi-issue
   politics and intersectional activism. Their youth, political, and
   feminist/queer subjectivity enables our 41 respondents to cultivate a
   predisposition toward intersectional understandings. The conscious,
   reflexive, and staunch agency of student activists can be productively
   understood through the intersectional lens of their collective refusal
   and struggles against the governmentality of the nation-state. Our
   findings show that the intersectional framework is employed by the
   respondents in two ways: (1) to internalize intersectional tenets and
   engage in intersectional activism, and (2) to dissociate themselves from
   the mainstreamed and professionalized aspects of that activism. This
   article unravels the variety and complexity around the concept, sheds
   light on the challenges that face feminist/queer student activists in
   contemporary Turkey, and considers how they respond by engaging
   intersectionality in multiple ways.},

Abstract = {News outlets are increasingly nationalizing their presentation of news
   stories, framing and presenting local news in a broad national context.
   We investigate how supply-side and curation-side factors of the news
   cycle contribute to the nationalization of news coverage. Through the
   computational analysis of 1.05 million Google news results on four days
   in July-August 2020, that corresponded to 1,581 news stories published
   on the George Floyd protests in Portland, Oregon, and Kenosha,
   Wisconsin, we examine the relationship between the nationalization of
   news coverage, stories' search rank in Google News, and the geographic
   distance between the news event and the stories' reading audience.
   Further, we explore the role of Google News in curating locally focused
   news. Our findings help to map the media ecosystem in a digital age,
   highlighting the influence of algorithmic power in politics and showing
   that excessive circulation of national news may have a profound negative
   impact on news diversity and social justice.},

Abstract = {Sexual violence in the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo
   is predominantly understood and represented as a ``native{''} phenomenon
   - a direct consequence of the economic civil war - unrelated to colonial
   violence. This article offers a historicized perspective on Congo's
   enduring conflict in which sexual violence continues to ruin lives. I
   argue that sexual violence does not follow but structures colonialism as
   part of a continuum of violence. Drawing on extensive archival research,
   I analyze patterns of everyday gender-based violence in the Congo Free
   State (1885-1908) and identify the fusion of terror and pleasure as key
   aspects of a capitalist and patriarchal gender order. Staging an
   encounter between historical and contemporary dynamics of sexual
   violence in Congo, this article addresses and reconceptualizes
   contemporary sexual violence in relation to past colonial violence.},

Abstract = {With increasingly frequent emergencies related to pandemics, climate
   change, or any other as yet unforeseen disaster, it is imperative to
   develop our understanding of how opportunistic legislation and policy
   grabs may appear even in democracies. Circumventing a lengthy process of
   public debate and government regulation, declaration of emergency may be
   conducive to such opportunism. Underlying mechanisms may involve
   national interest groups, whereby early in the pandemic a group quickly
   develops a messaging strategy focused on broad public health concerns.
   This strategy is then implemented by state affiliates lobbying local
   officials and mobilizing their supporters to push executive branch
   officials to effectuate restrictions. We examine state-level abortion
   restrictions during the outbreak of COVID-19. Our Qualitative
   Comparative Analyses indicate that at least in the political context of
   reproductive rights and under the emergency of COVID-19, it was level of
   emergency, levels of religiosity in the state and Republican dominance
   in government that strongly predicted the likelihood of opportunistic
   legislation.},

Abstract = {Research on dynamics within the European Parliament frequently draws on
   group-based explanations - such as parties and national affiliations -
   for the behaviour of its members. Hence, there is a growing interest in
   the question of how policy issues trigger the salience of group
   memberships and whether partisan or national group memberships - and
   which of them - rank higher when voting on issues. This article provides
   answers to these questions by presenting empirical evidence on the group
   memberships that are decisive for the voting behaviour of Members of the
   Parliament (MEPs). In theoretical terms, it introduces the
   social-psychological perspective on social identities to European Union
   (EU) parliamentary research. Methodologically, the article relies on a
   qualitative comparative analysis of voting results in three resolutions
   of the 9th EU legislative term. The findings emphasize a hierarchy of
   salient social identities and reveal that some national and some
   partisan identities are stronger than others in the European Parliament.},

Title = {``Citizenship Cheaters{''} before the Law: Reading Fraud-Based
   Denaturalization in Norway through Lenses of Exceptionalism},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 4},
Abstract = {For decades, fraud-based denaturalization was hardly used in Norway. In
   the 2015-2016 ``refugee crisis,{''} however, the right-wing government
   decided to reinforce efforts to expose ``citizenship cheaters.{''} This
   article asks how this decision emerged, what arguments the government
   articulated to legitimize this decision, and how parliament responded. I
   examine the Norwegian case by reworking Schmitt and Agamben's
   perspectives on exceptionalism. The executive desire to reduce
   naturalized citizens to ``bare life{''} illustrates Agamben's logic of
   exception: their potential exclusion is inscribed in law. Yet, the
   analysis shows that exceptionalism does not necessarily lead to ``bare
   lives{''}: denaturalization was mediated through legal, administrative,
   and democratic procedures. The opposition submitted proposals to tame
   the executive's denaturalization powers. In responding to criticism, the
   government relied on three different arguments to legitimize the
   decision: (1) moralizing and (2) criminalizing fraud, while
   simultaneously (3) de-politicizing the decision through hyper-legalism.
   Such reasoning does not suggest the collapse of law and politics, as
   Agamben envisions, but rather that states formulate exclusionary
   politics based on formalistic interpretations of law. The article
   concludes by problematizing Agamben's claim that we are all equally
   disposed to sovereign violence. I urge to take seriously social
   categories of difference in developing a political sociology of
   exceptionalism.},

Title = {The State of Languages in South Africa},
Booktitle = {LANGUAGE, SOCIETY AND THE STATE IN A CHANGING WORLD},
Year = {2023},
Pages = {169-185},
Abstract = {The issue of languages has been highly emotive and controversial,
   extremely contentious, and deeply political in South Africa. This has
   been the case since the early colonial years, and particularly since the
   turn of the nineteenth century. In South Africa, language became
   enmeshed with hegemony and power on the one hand and powerlessness on
   the other; the politics of inclusion and exclusion; racism, culture, and
   ethnicity; colonialism and postcolonialism; and access and denial to
   employment and sociospatial opportunities. Conflict over the use of
   language also provided the spark that precipitated the Soweto 1976
   uprising and ushered in the push that led to the collapse of the
   apartheid state and the transition in April 1994 to a democratic,
   nonracial state. This chapter addresses the politics and conflicts over
   language in South Africa, and the duplicity of the state in
   precipitating and then attempting to defuse social discord over the use
   of languages. The chapter examines the marginalization and
   regionalization of the indigenous languages in South Africa, the
   ascendency of English and Afrikaans as hegemonic languages, the social
   contradictions over the use of languages, and the postapartheid state's
   resolve to ameliorate tensions and injustice over language in its
   adoption of 11 official languages. Legislation and official policies
   aside, historic and ingrained social tendencies and practices that
   incorporate racial, cultural, and ethnic inequities wax slowly, often
   necessitating judicial intervention to resolve disputes over languages.
   In the multiplicity of the issues related to language, the historical
   specificity of the South African case is both illuminating and
   instructive.},

Title = {Changing Attitudes of Beijingness to Westernized Place Names in Beijing:
   From the Semi-Colonial Period to Postmodern Twenty-First Century},

Abstract = {One of the goals of China's place name governance, which started in
   2015, is to remove westernized place names. This study investigates what
   westernized place names are not suitable for a city in China. It uses
   Beijing as an example to analyze the westernized place names of Beijing
   in three periods against the prevailing social background. The first
   period is from the end of the Qing Dynasty to the early years of the
   Republic of China. The second period is from 1949 to 1980 which started
   with the foundation of People's Republic of China to the early years of
   China beginning to open up. The third period is from 1980 to 2019. In
   addressing this topic both the government and the mass media have asked
   major questions for study by toponymic scholars. Two major conclusions
   are provided. First, Beijingness knew the symbolic meaning of place
   names in the first period and actively used place naming and renaming to
   reflect the prevailing ideological viewpoint of society. In the last
   period real estate developers started to commercialize the cultural
   capital of westernized place names. Second, after three periods of
   examining westernized place names, the attitudes of Beijingness toward
   westernized place names reflect balances between the old and new, the
   local and global, and a positioning and spiritual function. This
   discussion advances thinking about the administrative management of the
   westernized place names in Beijing and even in China, that is,
   acknowledging that the laws and regulations on place names need to be
   coordinated with existing laws and regulations, including those
   addressing property rights.},

Abstract = {Using recently declassified documents, this article examines the wartime
   work of Canada's Special Intelligence Section under diplomat Herbert
   Norman. This was the first experiment with all-source strategic
   intelligence analysis in Canada. The SIS scrutinized intercepted
   Japanese and French communications, and prepared regular intelligence
   reports on enemies' conduct of the war. Its analysis sometimes veered
   into prescriptions of Allied policy and grand strategy for the benefit
   of readers like Prime Minister Mackenzie King. During the Second World
   War, Canada's SIS demonstrated that intelligence personnel with deep
   expertise could produce insightful analyses of key global developments
   for strategists and decision-makers.},

Abstract = {The Next Generation EU (NGEU) package transformed European economic
   governance. This article examines the implications of this change in
   terms of EU polity formation and in terms of social policy content. It
   asks whether the temporary availability of large funds increases the
   leverage of the Commission in the European Semester and how this
   innovation affects sensitive policies. In the tradition of Stein Rokkan,
   the article advances a conception of the EU as a compound polity that
   needs to reconcile dispersed authority with second-order loyalty. We
   then contrast our theoretical expectations with traditional reform
   surveillance and experimentalist governance theories. The drafting of
   Recovery and Resilience Plans for Italy and Spain provides the empirical
   basis for assessing these expectations. The analysis shows a dual
   effect: adding fiscal capacity to the European Semester enhances the
   Commission's hierarchical power whilst the need to ensure member states'
   loyalty leaves room for national executives to insist on their
   priorities.},

Abstract = {When the Child Tax Credit (CTC) was created in 1997, its financial
   benefits were unavailable to families that did not earn enough to owe
   federal income tax. It has since evolved into a measure that provides
   partial benefits to millions of children in low-income working families
   but still leaves out children in families with extremely low or no
   earnings. In 2021, the credit was enlarged for one year, with full
   benefits provided to the poorest children. Ten states have also recently
   instituted state CTCs that provide full benefits to the poorest
   children. This history of CTC expansion contrasts with the erosion of
   cash assistance ``spending programs{''}-including Temporary Assistance
   for Needy Families (TANF), unemployment insurance, and state general
   assistance-while being consistent with a larger pattern of tax-credit
   expansions. Both the CTC and Earned Income Tax Credit have repeatedly
   been expanded, and various other new benefits have been created as tax
   credits.},

Abstract = {This article examines children's political agency in the context of the
   Junior Eurovision Song Contest. The Eurovision Song Contest is widely
   recognized as a political arena-a space for nation branding and soft
   diplomacy, narratives of European musical and democratic harmony, and
   protests over global political events. But despite filling similar roles
   to their adult counterparts, the young performers' age and the
   organizers' emphasis on ensuring the event is safe and fun mean these
   dynamics are frequently downplayed or overlooked at Junior Eurovision,
   with significant consequences for how we understand children's political
   and politicized roles in international cultural spaces. I work with
   Lauren Berlant's concepts of genre and the juxtapolitical to argue that
   recognition of children's political-as opposed to artistic-agency by
   adults is tempered by both the format of Eurovision as entertainment and
   by broader conceptions apparent in international discourses of children
   as apolitical innocents. I suggest that while each of these genres can
   work separately to quiet the political dimensions of events, issues, and
   identities, it is Junior Eurovision's double-edged status as a
   spectacular musical event and one starring and aimed at children that
   keeps the young performers from being recognized as having political
   identities and agency twice over.},

Abstract = {Global health emergencies present opportunities for countries to enhance
   their soft power by demonstrating generosity and technological
   capabilities. Although China's initial association with the COVID-19
   pandemic outbreak had a detrimental impact on its international
   reputation, the country endeavored to rebuild it by visibly distributing
   vaccines and medical supplies. By countering U.S. vaccine nationalism,
   China positioned itself as an alternative provider of public goods in
   the Global South. The COVID-19 crisis provides a unique opportunity to
   examine how aid translates into reputation, particularly when donors are
   facing reputational damage. This article assesses the impact of
   alternative goods provision on China's reputation using original
   individual-level panel data collected from six Latin American countries
   between 2020 and 2021, employing a difference-in-differences research
   design. By positing the existence of absolute and relative reputational
   effects, we observe that Chinese vaccines improve public opinion of
   China and elevate its reputation in comparison to the United States.
   These findings are substantiated through a survey experiment, which
   demonstrates that when individuals receive information about China's
   provision of medical supplies, it enhances China's reputation relative
   to the United States.},

Abstract = {The national quality framework (NQF) has been implemented to improve the
   safety and quality of alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment and provide
   a nationally consistent approach to treatment quality in Australia. At
   the same time, concerns have been raised that, in the absence of
   appropriate regulatory structures to support the NQF, the quality and
   safety of AOD treatment services cannot be guaranteed in Australia. An
   effective enforcement strategy is critical to the ability of the NQF to
   provide a nationally consistent approach to the delivery of AOD
   treatment in Australia. The monitoring and enforcement strategy proposed
   by the NQF encompasses two different mechanisms. For specialist AOD
   treatment providers in receipt of government funding, monitoring and
   enforcement of the NQF will occur via contractual arrangements. For
   providers not in receipt of government funding, monitoring and
   enforcement will be managed by regulatory mechanisms as decided by each
   jurisdiction. This proposed enforcement strategy raises the question of
   whether contractual arrangements are the most effective mechanism for
   monitoring and enforcing the NQF in publicly funded specialist AOD
   treatment providers. This paper considers whether a licensing regime may
   address the shortcomings that arise from the proposed strategy. It
   argues that the pluralistic approach to the monitoring and enforcement
   of the NQF will result in substantive differences in how the NQF is
   enforced both within individual jurisdictions and on a broader national
   level. A licensing regime, therefore, would be a more appropriate
   monitoring and enforcement strategy.},

Abstract = {The external incentives model (EIM) proved highly compelling in
   explaining Europeanization and rule adoption in countries from Central,
   Eastern and Southeast Europe. Building on the EIM, the present article
   seeks to contribute along three key objectives. First, it proposes to
   re-evaluate the EIM for the Eastern European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)
   region: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Second, the
   paper introduces a conceptual distinction between domestic
   transformation costs and regulatory costs. Third, it integrates and
   evaluates the EIM in a broader framework, incorporating domestic and
   alternative international conditions. The paper combines theory-guided
   case comparisons and panel data analysis, based on a dataset with
   evidence collected from the Eastern ENP countries. The study
   corroborates the EIM and finds that higher domestic transformation costs
   lead to lower levels of democratic development and a positive
   cost-benefit balance of transformation, on the other hand, tends to
   encourage democratic consolidation in the Eastern ENP region.},

Title = {The Politics of the European Minimum Wage: Overcoming Ideological,

Volume = {62},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Until recently, the idea of a European minimum wage (EMW) policy had
   never taken concrete shape, due to the heterogeneity of national
   wage-setting and collective bargaining institutions, uncertain EU
   competence on the matter, and widespread scepticism amongst political
   actors. In 2022, however, the EU adopted a directive on adequate minimum
   wages. How did this make it to the EU agenda, despite the many
   political, territorial and institutional tensions? What coalitions
   supported and opposed it? Based on a reconstruction of the policy
   process substantiated by an analysis of news media data and 14
   interviews, this article investigates the multi-level politics of the
   EMW. It shows that, despite enduring `euro-social scepticism' in
   northern Europe, the emergence of pro-minimum wage coalitions in key
   member states and the increase of party-competition dynamics at the EU
   level were crucial in overcoming the lines of conflict that had long
   hindered EU initiatives on minimum wage co-ordination.},

Abstract = {As in other countries, regulated savings in France are intricately woven
   into dense regulatory frameworks driven by explicit governmental
   objectives. The anticipated marketization of the French economy should
   have eradicated them; however, a substantial portion of regulated
   savings has managed to evade this process. Is this phenomenon
   attributable to the tenacious grip of the French state-led tradition?
   Not entirely, as another subset of these savings has indeed undergone
   marketization. The landscape of French regulated savings is notably
   distinguished by a growing dichotomy: on one side, non-marketized
   products offered by banks, and on the other, increasingly marketized
   products provided by insurers. Drawing upon process tracing, we contend
   that these ostensibly conflicting developments emanate from the distinct
   and precise institutional dependencies between state and private actors
   in which these products are enmeshed. The prevailing status quo within
   the banking sector is owed to banks' engagement in a mutually
   advantageous, long-term exchange of favors with state actors. Faced with
   the trade-off between offering less lucrative products and risking the
   endangerment of this relationship, banks have opted for the former. In
   contrast, an assertive strategy has gained traction in the insurance
   industry. Yet, strategies for the marketization of regulated savings
   aligned with state priorities have been implemented, even when insurers
   expressed opposition.},

Abstract = {Many public health initiatives encouraging positive health behaviours
   require patient cooperation in the face of perceived costs and health
   risks. Ongoing public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and
   the organ shortage, underscore the necessity of incorporating an
   understanding of human cooperation and the motivators for cooperation
   into social and public health policy. We explore the costs, benefits and
   motivators regarding cooperation in the cases of vaccination and organ
   donation. We likewise explore policy incentives that have successfully
   encouraged cooperation with these positive health behaviours. We find
   that appeals to morality, reciprocity and reputation are important
   behavioural predictors of cooperation. However, we find that cooperation
   is a fragile state, vulnerable to the individual's perceptions of the
   risks, as well as external social, cultural and political forces, such
   as social media-disseminated misinformation, which can sway attitudes to
   health behaviours, including cooperation. Drawing from the literature,
   we conclude by calling for a nuanced understanding of cooperation in a
   number of policy recommendations. Notably, we underscore: the volatile
   emotional levers affecting cooperation; the risks of overusing
   restrictive mandates; the consideration of short-and long-term
   consequences of social policies; and the need for locally and culturally
   tailored, as well as nationally relevant, policies.},

Title = {Shaping planetary health inequities: the political economy of the
   Australian growth model},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {273-287},

Abstract = {Planetary health equity - the equitable enjoyment of good health and
   wellbeing in a sustainable ecosystem - is under threat from
   anthropogenic climate change and economic and social inequities. Driving
   these major challenges is the global consumptogenic system that
   encourages excessive production and consumption goods and services that
   are harming human and planetary health. Growth models lie at the core of
   the consumptogenic system. This paper examines the sources of economic
   growth in Australia, the coalitions that sustain this approach
   politically, and the implications of these dynamics for planetary health
   equity. Australia's consumption-led growth model is underpinned by a
   combination of rising house prices and a permissive credit regime. This
   growth model is supported by a dominant growth coalition of producer
   interests, elements of organised labour, and property owners. The growth
   coalition has been able to successfully generate growth model policy
   convergence between the mainstream political parties. In turn this
   growth model, and associated growth coalition, has undermined the
   pursuit of planetary health equity in Australia by incentivising and
   driving excessive consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and economic
   inequality.},

Abstract = {The ``revolving door{''} between those at the top of public and private
   organizations has given rise to questions about the ``pull{''} and
   ``push{''} factors influencing public servants' switching into lucrative
   posts with companies they previously regulated. In this study, we
   investigate the departmental attributes associated with the movement of
   senior British civil servants into potentially controversial corporate
   jobs. To do so, we develop a configurational analysis of revolving door
   activity in UK government departments for 2015-2018 using panel-based
   fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). We identify a series
   of alternative departmental conditions' based pathways for taking up, or
   not taking up, a role in the private sector. In particular, more
   prestigious departments with high levels of pay and low levels of
   agencification are associated with revolving door activity, while
   departments with low levels of pay, high levels of agencification, and
   low levels of capital procurement tend to be associated with an absence
   of such activity.},

Abstract = {Various measures of mobility restrictions were introduced since the
   outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This collective discussion examines
   them in relation to six different carceral techniques that govern
   movement: citizenship, nativism, colonialism, infrastructure, gender,
   and borders. We investigate how these spatializing techniques of
   carcerality have been modified and strengthened in the pandemic and
   their implications for how we conceptualize migration. Our conversation
   revolves around the relationality between movement and confinement to
   argue that they are not in opposition but work in tandem: Their meanings
   become interchangeable, and their relationship is reconfigured. In this
   collective discussion, we are interested in how to analyze
   movement/migration in ways that do not define the pandemic through
   temporal boundaries to mark its beginning and ending.},

   democracy, particularly the fundamental democratic norm of ``loser's
   consent.{''} We argue that recent political developments-close
   elections, ideological polarization, participatory party nominations,
   and changes in campaign finance and media-have worked to undermine the
   parties' commitment to loser's consent. We use recent survey data to
   show that party activists no longer demonstrate greater commitment than
   do ordinary citizens to democratic norms-especially to loser's consent.
   We also examine how parties and voters responded to the post-2020 crisis
   of democratic legitimacy, finding that both parties prioritized their
   political interests over democratic health. However, a small number of
   voters did deviate from normal partisanship and helped to shore up
   American democracy in the 2022 elections.},

Abstract = {This article explores how North Korean leaders tried to maneuver between
   Iran and Iraq to gain greater leverage in the Cold War. Both of these
   Middle Eastern countries seemed potentially attractive partners for
   Pyongyang, but they were often on hostile terms with each other. The
   article considers how the Iraq-Iran rivalry and domestic changes in Iraq
   and Iran affected North Korean policy. Even when Pyongyang's cooperation
   with one or the other of the two states reached a high level, the North
   Koreans also reached out to the other country, regardless of the
   position of either state and of external actors such as the Soviet Union
   and China. The North Koreans generally avoided taking a public stand on
   the Iraq-Iran dispute, but on occasion they became more deeply involved.
   Mainly, the North Korean government sought to maximize the number of its
   partners, rather than to make a stable commitment to just one state. In
   turn, both Iraq and Iran eventually came to perceive North Korea as a
   state that was mostly out to benefit itself rather than helping either
   of them.},

Abstract = {In this article, I revisit my 2007 piece on The Construction of EU
   Normative Power (NP) and the Middle East `conflict' and bring in
   Manners' Arrival of NP in Planetary Politics' (NPA) frame to shed light
   on how the EU's southern neighbourhood and its social and political
   fragility becomes amplified by the `force multiplier' of climate
   mitigation. For example, in 2018, Gaza sewage led to the closure of
   Israeli beaches and the shutdown of the desalination plant in Ashkelon,
   which supplies Israel with 15\% of its drinking water. This is but one
   example of how Israel and Palestine are not only inter-dependent but,
   perhaps more importantly, co-dependent. This article therefore draws
   attention to the urgent need of thinking on the co-constitution of all
   life on earth, particularly in a climate-conflict scenario such as that
   of Israel and Palestine. Water scarcity, rising temperatures and
   electricity interruptions contribute to the region's instability. If
   policy-makers from the region and beyond are to co-ordinate policy
   interventions around water and food insecurity for instance, they cannot
   ignore intractable conflicts such as the Israeli-Palestinian issue and
   their ensuing implications for planetary politics. Such enduring
   `conflicts' represent a microcosmic image of the planet as a whole.
   Along with the other contributions in this symposium, this piece invokes
   planetary politics as the space where we need - out of necessity - to
   think differently: Otherwise, others will be writing the script for us.},

Abstract = {In the face of a rapid decline of rule of law standards in a number of
   EU Member States, this article examines whether the Helsinki process of
   the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which
   was instrumental in strengthening the political commitments to human
   rights and their defenders during the Cold War and thereafter, can still
   deliver for defenders in the EU today. It discusses issues related to
   the concern of the OSCE's fading relevance in its human dimension and
   the role EU Member States (EUMS) play in its decline. In reviewing the
   EU's diplomatic practice within the OSCE, this article suggests that in
   its quest for unity, the EU has grown into a cartel of silence,
   effectively weakening the OSCE's foundational logic of peer review as it
   is unwilling to deal with problems in a forum that was created for this
   very purpose. The article then recommends a number of ways in which
   OSCE's institutions and political bodies could develop their working
   methods to take advantage of particularly EU civil society expertise
   while also being open to their calls for OSCE action.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND GENDER},

Volume = {XX},
Number = {XX},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {ISIS is well known for its brutal mistreatment of those deemed `enemies'
   and `infidels'. In the Kurdistan region of Iraq, having been abducted by
   ISIS in 2014, many Yazidi women were subjected to different types of
   violence: sexual, physical and mental. This study investigates how
   silence was employed by these women as a security strategy to survive
   their brutal mistreatment under ISIS. The use of silence as a security
   strategy challenges the assumption that silence is a sign of
   disempowerment. Drawing on feminist security studies, this study
   proposes an alternative analysis of security, agency and gendered
   violence; it demonstrates the need to recognise the complex strategies
   these Yazidi women developed to resist ISIS rule. It suggests that this
   approach may be used to critique established narratives about women in
   the Global South and reveal the under-reported security strategies women
   employ in conflict settings.},

Abstract = {EU decentralised agencies dispose of a wide network of external
   relations giving third countries various degrees of access to their
   management boards, secondary bodies and/or operational cooperation.
   These venues constitute hitherto under-explored opportunities for third
   country influence on EU laws and policies. Based on an original dataset,
   this article maps the widening scope and depth of third country de jure
   access to 26 EU agencies over time and provides first explanations for
   the variation across agencies and countries. We find that agency
   autonomy and international mandate as well as third country democracy,
   regulatory capacity, and wealth are positively correlated with access.

Abstract = {This article explores `late justice' in the context of settler
   democracies with a history of racism, using Norway as a case study. It
   examines the background for the Norwegian Truth and Reconciliation
   Commission (TRC), established by the Norwegian Parliament in 2018 to
   investigate the consequences of historical and ongoing assimilation of
   the indigenous Sami people and two national minorities. I argue that
   although the Norwegian TRC was established in direct response to an
   initiative from the Sami Parliament, its successful creation was a
   result of political negotiations involving a series of actors, including
   Sami activists, mainstream politicians and various interest
   organizations. The protagonists pushing for a truth commission were in
   turn encouraged and inspired by a global focus on transitional justice,
   truth commissions and indigenous rights. Based on a desk study,
   interviews and media reports, and applying a theoretical framework
   emphasizing agency and norm diffusion, I argue that while the Norwegian
   TRC has explicitly used truth commissions elsewhere in the world -
   particularly the Canadian TRC - as models, it is quite unique in terms
   of mandate and design.},

Abstract = {Feminist approaches to international security have revealed persistent
   gendered stereotypes in the construction of women in contexts of
   political violence and terrorism, including the Global War on Terror.
   Acknowledging the parallelism with the United States-led enterprise in
   its endeavor to ``save{''} a female population and re-posing one of the
   most significant questions in gender-informed security studies, this
   article asks ``Where are the women in China's `People's War on Terror'
   (PWoT)?{''} It takes the idea of agency as pivotal in answering this
   question and investigates how the Chinese state has (im)mobilized,
   through concealment or deployment, the idea of and potential for agency
   when positioning Uyghur and other Turkic Muslim women in Xinjiang as
   specific subjects in the context of the PWoT. The article reveals the
   establishment of a gendered hierarchy of power in the Chinese
   counterterrorism playbook, one that fixes ``Xinjiang women{''} as
   securitized and passive victims in need of rescuing by a state that
   continues to suppress their agency, despite official claims to the
   contrary.},

Abstract = {Why do some trade negotiations conclude with preferential trade
   agreements, while others drag on indefinitely? Departing from prior
   focuses on established cooperation, this study emphasizes the trade
   negotiation process and accounts for the unconcluded talks. I argue that
   domestic uncertainties induced by political systems and elections will
   influence negotiation lengths and outcomes. On the one hand, political
   systems' cohesion and efficiency in decision-making may affect the
   progress of trade negotiations. On the other hand, the unpredictability
   of electoral outcomes and calendars may prolong trade negotiations. To
   have a complete picture of trade negotiations, I collected an original
   Trade Bargaining Dataset, which contains information on both concluded
   and unconcluded talks. To test the hypotheses, I use a sample of 157
   negotiations from 1980 to 2016, in which at least one negotiating
   country is from the Indo-Pacific region. The results from the Cox
   proportional hazard models show that parliamentary systems make
   negotiations smoother than presidential systems. Additionally,
   negotiating governments are not likely to sign agreements in election
   years, particularly in the elections of parliamentary and democratic
   countries. This study contributes to the trade cooperation literature by
   highlighting the variations in negotiation outcomes and offering a novel
   approach to investigating the negotiation process.},

Abstract = {Debates have surged in the European Union (EU) on how EU competition
   policy can best support the European Green Deal. In the theoretical and
   practical aspects, non-economic factors in competition law analysis are
   problematic due to the difficulty in measuring the concrete benefits of
   trade-offs. The National Competition Authorities (NCAs) rather than the
   European Commission (EC) are leading the `sustainability in competition
   law' debates, which is the focus of this article. Therefore, this study
   reviews the current status quo of all NCAs' positions concerning
   sustainability-related matters by classifying them into four typologies
   in terms of their willingness to incorporate sustainability in their
   assessments. It further identifies four emerging NCAs models, which seem
   to divert from the EC's view. This can be problematic in ensuring the
   uniform application of competition law.},

Abstract = {What is the place of the market in society? Polanyi's answer derives
   from institutional separation and the self-regulating mechanism of
   supply and demand. In this article, I offer an alternative approach.
   Following Aristotle, I suggest that commodity fiction follows from the
   fictitious nature of valuation in the market economy. I then combine
   this broader definition of commodity fiction with Aristotle's ideas on
   means and ends of human action, which leads to a framework relating the
   uniform standard of value in the market economy to commodity fiction and
   market imperialism. This framework, like Polanyi, underlines the
   market's subordination of society, but it explains such domination with
   how the market subverts political deliberation on the allocation of time
   and resources to distinct objectives in society. The result is a
   theoretical framework that goes beyond the embeddedness-disembeddedness
   dichotomy and that emphasizes how the place of the market in society is
   inextricably a political phenomenon.},

Journal = {ETHICS \& INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},

Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {309-320},
Abstract = {Regulating war has long been a concern of the international community.
   From the Hague Conventions to the Geneva Conventions and the multiple
   treaties and related institutions that have emerged in the twentieth and
   twenty-first centuries, efforts to mitigate the horrors of war have
   focused on regulating weapons, defining combatants, and ensuring access
   to the battlefield for humanitarians. But regulation and legal codes
   alone cannot be the end point of an engaged ethical response to new
   weapons developments. This short essay reviews some of the existing
   ethical works on lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS), highlighting
   how rule- and consequence-based accounts fail to provide adequate
   guidance for how to deal with them. I propose a virtue-based account,
   which I link up with an Aristotelian framework, for how the
   international community might better address these weapons systems.},

Abstract = {This article's main aim is to evaluate the position of BRICS `as a
   group' towards the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) norm by locating it
   in the framework of the English School's pluralist versus solidarist
   debate. It traces the pluralist and solidarist elements in BRICS
   discourses and decisions towards R2P by scrutinising the content of the
   ten BRICS summit declarations between 2011 and 2020 and the voting of
   BRICS members on UN Security Council resolutions regarding seven cases
   involving atrocity Libya) discussed at the UN Security Council. The
   article argues that although there is an obvious quantitative increase
   in BRICS common pluralist agenda, they do not demonstrate group
   solidarity in practice and have not yet socialised to act as a group on
   the R2P as a key norm of global governance. Therefore, their position as
   a group towards R2P could best be framed as `Charter solidarism' in
   principle per se, not in practice.},

Abstract = {Following the 2008 financial crisis, policymakers in advanced economies
   employed unconventional economic interventions that were meant to be
   short-term but continued for more than a decade and were followed by
   unconventional interventions in non-financial markets. What causal
   mechanisms connect short-term unconventional interventions with
   long-term policy change? By developing a constructivist-evolutionary
   framework, we suggest that employing unconventional policy ideas for the
   sake of securing the pre-crisis growth regime, in a volatile economic
   environment, has repeatedly failed policymakers' expectations. The gap
   between expectations and outcomes expanded the policy space for
   unconventional policy ideas, and activated an evolutionary process,
   through which expanding `temporary' interventions have been adopted in
   additional areas, became hard to reverse and modified macroeconomic
   priorities. A comparative process-tracing analysis of two case studies -
   the UK and Israel - demonstrates how short-term employment of innovative
   policy ideas and long-term change in economic policy are tightly
   connected via causal ideational evolutionary mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Most European states have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of
   Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), but implementation varies at national
   and local levels with municipalities often playing a key role.
   Decentralization policies have often led to municipalities providing
   social support as well, but little attention has been paid to the
   accessibility of municipal support for persons with disabilities in the
   light of the CRPD. Therefore, this article presents the Dutch 2015
   Social Support Act (SSA) as a case study. The SSA introduces the right
   to an assessment. This legal evaluation moment has far-reaching
   consequences for persons with disabilities as it serves as the gateway
   for access to reasonable accommodations under the CRPD. Dutch municipal
   councils implement their assessment systems in different ways, but
   social district teams are usually set up to execute the assessment under
   the mandate of the municipality. It is often the case that social
   workers fulfil both counselling and gatekeeping roles, despite the fact
   that they are not necessarily trained to combine these dual
   responsibilities. This article identifies impeding factors that
   influence the gaining of access to municipal social support at the level
   of the social system, the involved organizations and the individual
   professionals. It takes a legal-anthropological approach based on
   in-depth multidisciplinary interviews with experts in the field of
   disability rights advocacy, social policy and human rights, or with
   experiential expertise. The results indicate a lack of alignment between
   the SSA and the CRPD. The discussion gives recommendations for a broader
   implementation of the CRPD.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the scholarship on queer migration by
   exploring the translation of knowledge as a concept and process whereby
   social, cultural and epistemic histories and structures are negotiated.
   Drawing on my own experiences of engaging in ethnographic fieldwork and
   qualitative interviews with queer asylum seekers in Denmark, I reflect
   on ways of translating knowledge by focusing on the epistemological,
   methodological and affective dimensions of research relations. By
   reflecting on my own position as an epistemological translator, I follow
   the ways in which affective intimacies emerge in embodied encounters and
   how these intimacies are constrained and made possible by institutional
   norms, bodies and spaces. My central argument, drawing on
   autoethnography, affect theories and decolonial perspectives, suggests
   epistemic translation as a method of navigating affective intimacies and
   encounters in research relations. This approach may support a critical
   reflection of differing positionalities and moments of untranslatability
   within knowledge production.},

Abstract = {Bringing home federal spending projects to the district is a common
   reelection strategy for members of the U.S. Congress, and congresswomen
   tend to outperform congressmen in securing district spending. However,
   for legislators to turn distributive benefits into higher approval and
   electoral rewards, constituents must recognize that public spending has
   taken place in their community and attribute credit to the correct
   public official. I theorize that congresswomen face a gender bias when
   claiming credit for federal projects, and I test this theory through an
   online survey experiment. Contrary to expectations, I find no evidence
   that legislator gender influences the public's reaction to congressional
   credit claims, indicating that congresswomen can effectively use
   distributive politics to counter gendered vulnerability in the U.S.
   Congress. This research advances the literature on gender and politics
   by investigating whether a gender bias in credit claiming prevents
   congresswomen from turning their representational efforts into electoral
   capital.},

Abstract = {The self-identification of Sweden and Canada as exceptionally caring and
   ethical states committed to the goal of global gender justice has been
   reinforced through their adoption of feminist foreign policies (FFPs).
   However, despite the enthusiasm surrounding the potential of feminism as
   an ethical approach to foreign policy making, critics have drawn
   attention to the many failings of FFPs that hamper their ability to
   bring about transformative change. This article posits that the
   shortcomings of Swedish and Canadian FFPs are rooted in an
   unacknowledged legacy of colonial power relations. It is from within
   this history of violence that Swedish and Canadian practices of feminism
   both ``at home{''} and ``abroad{''} can be seen as a re-articulation of
   colonialism. Through two illustrative narrative readings of
   reconciliation efforts, the article examines state provisions of
   hierarchically imposed, paternalistic expressions of care that silence
   Indigenous ``articulations of self-care.{''} As such, it addresses a
   significant gap in the literature on FFPs by highlighting the risk of
   self-proclaimed ``caring{''} feminist states reproducing colonial power
   relations within and beyond borders.},

Abstract = {Climate emergency is one of the facets shaping the current stage of
   ecological imbalance and requires action to be taken. The trend to
   address conflicts involving climate change by legal means is clearly on
   the rise, and the article argues that this calls for an evolving
   constitutional dialogue on human rights. The article examines the
   phenomenon, particularly in Latin American countries, explaining how
   past development of constitutions in the region, for all its precarious
   effectiveness, has already served to consolidate a path demanding
   judicial review in matters affecting human rights of constitutional
   stature. It argues that this path is being pursued by the ongoing
   climate litigation in Latin America. Based on case discussions, the
   article demonstrates how compliance with the Paris Agreement has been
   assimilated as a commitment to constitutional protection of human rights
   in the region, and how this process must deepen, taking into account
   regional vulnerabilities and future developments, in order to strengthen
   the fundamental human right not only to mitigation, but also to
   adaptation and equitable transitions.},

Abstract = {Studies of domestic political actors' influence on the design of
   preferential trade agreements (PTAs) have focused on veto players as
   obstacles to policy change, assuming their roles as access points or
   channels for economic interests. Access point and veto player theories
   predict that multiple access points lead to a protectionist bias and
   that numerous veto players have a constraining influence over PTAs. This
   study argues that after the veto player and access point theories are
   combined, the effect of variation in the number of veto players and
   access points on the institutional features of PTAs depends on the types
   of exporters (endowment-based or intra-industry exporters) with whom
   said political actors interact. Quantitative tests show that as the
   value of intra-industry exports rises, veto players and access points
   have a less constraining effect on the scope and autonomy of PTAs. This
   study employed a novel dataset to approximate the values of
   intra-industry and endowment-based exports of 256 Standard International
   Trade Classification (SITC) products manufactured by 500 trading
   partners. The findings highlight the importance of considering the
   broader influence of political actors and economic interests on PTA
   design.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the consequences of postcommunist economic reform
   for narratives about capitalism, using the example of World Bank
   discourse. It shows how the World Bank's capitalism narrative has
   changed to reflect post-Soviet reform complications and the growing
   Sino-(post-)Soviet contrast. While the capitalism narrative struggles to
   show that there is one (global) capitalism or market economy model,
   reform anomalies and the Sino-(post-)Soviet contrast turn the model into
   a complex political-economic hybrid. Simultaneously, the interplay
   between the capitalism narrative and reform anomalies highlights the
   World Bank's relevance for neoliberal ideational production.},

Abstract = {Improving the psychological well-being of parents who received the 2021
   expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) was not an explicit focus of that
   benefit program, but psychological effects may have been felt, given the
   positive income shocks generated by the credit. This article reviews
   academic research that is available on the CTC's effect on parents'
   psychological well-being. Some studies have found that the CTC led to
   reductions in reported levels of clinical depression and anxiety among
   parents and in their subclinical depressive and anxiety symptoms. Other
   studies that have used similar methods find no effects on those
   outcomes. Importantly, the evidence does not point to the CTC worsening
   psychological well-being. Overall, evidence on this topic is thin and
   mixed, even when comparable studies on the impact of income support are
   also included in the review. We argue that building a more conclusive
   evidence base would require tighter alignment of policy objectives to
   measurement approaches.},

Abstract = {Research on enforcing compliance with the European Union's (EU's) rule
   of law value has focused on the roles of the European Commission, the
   European Parliament and the Court of Justice of the EU. However, the
   Council of the EU has attracted less attention. Existing scholarship has
   convincingly established that the rotating Presidency can crucially
   influence the functioning of the Council, and, accordingly, this paper
   examines the discretionary impact the Presidencies have towards Art.7
   procedures. Drawing on official documents and statements, this paper
   compares how the various Presidencies from 2018 to 2022 have used their
   privileged position on the Council's agenda to decide whether to move
   forward with hearings. In doing so, they selected appropriate
   agenda-shaping strategies, shaped the Commission's perceived
   opportunities to exercise its agenda prerogatives, avoided compromises
   on the trios' agendas and, sometimes, benefited from not dealing with
   Art.7 to pursue other agenda priorities. The Presidency's wide room for
   manoeuvre hinders the Council's activity in scrutinising backsliding
   governments.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to elaborate a proposal for a rural proofing
   method for Castilla y Leon. To this end, the methodology used was to
   analyse the main international experiences and the European Union's
   position. Based on the success stories in different countries and the
   economic and demographic characteristics of Castilla y Le \& oacute;n,
   it can be concluded that the implementation of a system that assesses
   regulations and public policies from a rural lens before their effective
   application can be very useful in Castilla y Leon.},

Abstract = {Intersectionality has become a widely used theoretical lens through
   which scholars examine women's political and economic participation.
   Intersectional frameworks analyze the ways in which formal state
   structures produce gender inequalities. It is precisely this conceptual
   and empirical strength that make a theory originally rooted in the
   experiences of Black women in the United States, applicable to other
   groups of women in a range of national contexts. Extensive debates
   surround the generalizability of intersectional theory. Using my work on
   gender inequality as a predictor of state fragility in the African
   region, this piece addresses these questions both conceptually and
   methodologically. My larger project is a cross-national study; however,
   I will use original country case study datasets from women's local civil
   society organizations in Nigeria and Ghana to illustrate the
   relationships between institutionalized inequalities and the
   mobilization efforts of different groups of women. First, I begin by
   defining intersectionality. Next, I combine African feminists and
   African Muslim feminists' theoretical contributions which extend and
   expand intersectionality. This piece contributes to conversations about
   the ways in which intersectionality can be applied to other groups of
   Black women outside of the United States. Third, I demonstrate how
   intersectionality is used to capture the range of priorities and
   strategies activists used to define and promote gender equality within
   formal state structures.},

Abstract = {Border corruption can help facilitate the smuggling of people and
   irregular migration, but it receives limited attention in academic
   research. In this article, I explore how smugglers use corruption and
   bribery to circumvent border restrictions. I focus on the role of
   bribery in the survival economy of border communities, including
   migrants, smugglers, and border authorities, and on its role in
   facilitating cross-border movement. This study draws on extensive
   ethnographic research conducted on land routes between West Asia and
   Europe, interviewing smugglers specifically on the Syrian-Turkish border
   and the Evros border between Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria. My findings
   indicate that on both borders, smugglers and border guards accommodate
   each other's interests in creative collaborative processes. As such,
   corruption and bribery are not merely illegal practices but rather
   strategic adaptations in response to harsher border enforcement
   policies, stemming from specific needs of local border realities.},

Abstract = {We analyze how the criminalization of migration has taken hold in the
   borderlands of Ecuador and Colombia from 2000 to 2022, despite the
   existence of progressive legal frameworks in those two countries that
   have historically allowed for relatively open borders and recognition of
   migrants' rights. We use a historical and ethnographic approach to
   explore how criminalizing mechanisms have been implemented, showing that
   the criminalization of migration happened episodically. The
   criminalization of migration has been justified under the legal regime
   of migrant-smuggling statutes, and mechanisms of criminalization have
   been activated only at specific junctures to halt the growth of
   irregularized migrations from the Global South to the U.S. We go on to
   argue that border crossings por trocha, as unlawful river and land
   pathways are locally known, have served as a strategy for resistance to
   criminalization and have enhanced the expansion and refinement of
   illegal border economies and local livelihoods.},

Abstract = {The division of the world into `developing' and `developed' countries
   has grown increasingly problematic in the past decades. Nonetheless, it
   remains embedded in legal documents, foreign policy discourse, and
   colloquial use. This paper explores this complexity by unpacking the
   different ways in which the `developing' label is used in the
   international system. It argues that understanding the complexity around
   its use requires a rigorous analysis of the label's diverse meanings and
   consequences. This is done by introducing a taxonomy that intersects two
   elements: (1) the source of the classification (External or Internal)
   and (2) the kind of hierarchy implied in the classification (Narrow or
   Broad). This two-by-two matrix generates four approaches in which the
   `developing' vs `developed' dichotomy is used: Technocratic, Elective,
   Northern Gaze, and Southern Solidarity. Each approach is explored
   empirically, illustrated by cases connected to international
   organizations and multilateral treaties. In doing so, the paper teases
   out the underlying reasons why the use of the dichotomy is so
   challenging, based on what kinds of contestation it generates, and which
   actors are pushing for demise or longevity (and where).},

Abstract = {The assimilationist approach has been used controversially by lesbian,
   gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) activists to engage the
   state for legal reform in Europe and the United States (US). Drawing
   insight from the concept of situated knowledges, this article explores
   the historical and political particularities that enabled lala (queer
   women) activists to adopt a politics of assimilation in the Chinese
   anti-domestic violence movement. It unravels the specific features of
   their assimilation to effect policy change and their entanglements with
   feminists. Through participant observation and in-depth interviews, the
   article first delineates the contours of lala activists' struggle and
   traces their strategic choice of assimilation in the Chinese context
   from the 1990s to the 2000s. Second, the article elaborates on two
   aspects of lala activists' assimilation: establishing an ambiguous
   position toward institutions and orienting activism toward indirect
   legal provisions. Third, the article illuminates how lala activists
   created new gender dynamics through this politics and developed their
   own strand of lesbian-feminist cooperation characterized by restricted
   visibility in the mainstream women's movement and an open coalition with
   different feminists. I also discuss the limitations of lala activists'
   politics and conclude by summarizing how lala activism can enrich global
   dialogues on the controversial assimilationist approach and the
   diversity of lesbian-feminist relationships.},

Abstract = {Creating intergovernmental environmental clubs is a prominent policy
   proposal for addressing global environmental problems. According to
   their proponents, environmental clubs provide an incentive to join them
   and accept their environmental obligations by generating exclusive
   ``club goods{''} for their members. Yet, the existing literature
   considers environmental clubs as a theoretical idea that still has to be
   put into practice. This article asks whether, in fact, the numerous
   international environmental agreements (IEAs) containing trade-related
   provisions provide club goods to their parties. It does so by
   investigating the effects of these provisions on trade flows among
   parties compared to flows with non-parties. We introduce an original
   dataset on 48 types of trade provisions in 2,097 IEAs that we make
   available with the publication of this article. Based on this new data
   and a panel of worldwide bilateral trade flows, we find evidence that
   existing IEAs and their trade-liberalizing content are associated with
   increased trade among their parties relative to trade with non-parties.
   We conclude from this finding that systems of IEAs provide club goods to
   their parties. Uncovering the existence of environmental clubs has
   significant methodological and policy implications. It is an important
   first step for future research on the actual effectiveness of clubs in
   attracting participation and raising environmental standards.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) faces a pressing challenge with democratic
   backsliding potentially resulting in an authoritarian member state. EU
   institutions have sought to safeguard member state democracy. Most
   normative studies submit that the EU can legitimately intervene based on
   either current treaties or the theory of militant democracy, but they
   leave unanswered the fundamental question of the EU's normative
   political authority. I argue that shared popular sovereignty, which
   entails Europe's peoples directly authorizing the EU, is the most
   appropriate principle to theorize the EU's political authority for the
   foreseeable future. This principle results in a duty for the EU to
   protect its democratic peoples from backsliding governments and an
   account of who can legitimately decide on whether backsliding is taking
   place. A comprehensive normative assessment follows on the democratic
   legitimacy of various democracy protection measures. My argument
   bolsters the normative case for EU democracy protection.},

Abstract = {The Israeli military's occupation of Palestinian territory relies
   heavily on its ability to shape the visual environment and set the terms
   of how Palestinians may see and be seen. However, the relationship
   between violent occupation and violent visualities has yet to be fully
   theorized. This article gathers several conceptual strands-biopolitics,
   visual biopolitics, and necropolitics-to theorize what I term ``visual
   necropolitics.{''} Visual necropolitics is proffered as an analytical
   tool that furthers our understanding of the violent visual regulations
   that enable and sustain the conditions for the illegal occupation of
   Palestinian lands and the subjugation of the Palestinian people. To
   illustrate this, three distinct but related forms of visual violence
   will be analyzed: the deliberate infliction of ocular trauma through
   targeting of the eyes, the strategy of maiming in order to prevent
   telegenic death, and the imposition of visual regulations to govern the
   death of captured bodies. This theorization allows us to move beyond
   considering the politics of sight, vision, and representation only as an
   artifact of the colonial power relations that govern life and death in
   Palestine, towards understanding how visual violence is a constitutive
   dimension of occupation. Not only does colonial occupation use visual
   violence, but it cannot be sustained without it.},

Abstract = {Criticizing the insurance theory, this article asserts that to measure
   post-constitutional political uncertainty, one should consider not only
   the power distribution among the `political' actors but the power
   distribution among all actors involved in the constitution-making
   process, including the public and civil society. Comparing the
   constitution-making processes of the constitutions of Egypt (2012) and
   Tunisia (2014), this study presents the duration of the
   constitution-making process as an alternative measure of power
   distribution among all actors. The theoretical framework asserts that
   the long constitution-making process increases the possibility of
   deliberation at the public level. That will help to develop trust among
   polarized political actors and improve political actors' perception of
   the public as a credible control and constraint mechanism. This will
   ensure that the incoming government will respect the newly established
   institutions and lead to the establishment of an independent and
   powerful judiciary. In the second part of the article, to test this
   argument, I use a large dataset that covers information on the content
   and design processes of 140 countries' most recent constitutions adopted
   between 1945 and 2018. The empirical results indicate that as the
   duration of the constitution-making increases, the number of
   constitutional guarantees for judicial independence also increases.},

Abstract = {This article examines the development of the doctrine of the `permanent
   constituent power' in Mexico. This doctrine reflects a long tradition in
   constitutional theory according to which the exercise of constituent
   power is a one-time event: once a constitution is adopted, there will be
   no legal mechanism in place for the exercise of the people's original
   constitution-making authority. This view is nonetheless in tension with
   a notion that has also been historically embraced by liberal
   constitutionalism: that the people has an inalienable right to alter the
   form of government. The constitutional provisions that reflect that
   idea, we will see, can have important implications in terms of the
   nature and scope of the amending authority and, at the same time, point
   toward alternative mechanisms for the exercise of constituent authority.
   By closely examining the operation of those kinds of provisions in the
   Mexican constitution, we seek to illustrate a tension central to the
   liberal constitutional tradition and to suggest a way out of it. In so
   doing, we aim to draw some lessons from the Mexican case that can
   contribute to current discussions about constituent power and
   fundamental constitutional change in liberal constitutional orders.},

Abstract = {China's path is conceived as a transition from an economically
   underdeveloped and semi colonised country of the Global South into a
   modern socialist country in a multipolar world where successive steps
   (modes of regulation) were shaped by China's external environment
   (uneven and combined development) and a succession of contradictions and
   crises encountered along the way. Three phases are examined: a turbulent
   phase of socialist construction in a context of capital shortage and US
   embargoes; a phase of reform and opening up in an era of neoliberal
   globalisation, whose early roots lay in the early 1970s' rapprochement
   with the US; and a New Era dating from 2017. In each phase, crises and
   contradictions saw waves of reform, involving successive joint
   transformations of economic structures and institutions, while each
   phase was anticipated in the years that preceded it, so opening up
   started in the early 1970s with the rapprochement with the US, and
   aspects of the New Era concern with innovation, green development,
   common prosperity and an equitable global order started to emerge
   earlier.},

Abstract = {Do women's motives for joining a political party depend on the
   implementation of a gender quota for party offices and electoral lists?
   Based on multiple waves of the German Party Membership Studies, we
   address this issue using survey data for about 5,000 female party
   members. We find that women's probability of joining a party because of
   their political ambition, i.e. attaining a public or party office,
   slightly improves with the quota size. But more importantly, there is a
   robust, statistically significant interaction between the quota targets
   and the percentage of female party members. Women are most likely to
   report instrumental reasons for joining when there is a large gender gap
   for the party members and a quota requiring a high percentage of female
   office holders. These results strongly imply that women, at least
   roughly, calculate the intensity of the intra-party competition for
   political offices when deciding to join a party.},

Abstract = {In recent years, local media in the U.S. have faced increasing economic
   precarity, and many newspapers have been purchased by hedge funds and
   private equity firms. How do investment owners shape the newspapers they
   acquire? We document the shift in ownership and its impact on the number
   and type of journalists that local newsrooms employ. Using over 13,000
   digitized media directory pages, we measure the newsrooms of 211 major
   newspapers from 2005 to 2022. We estimate that the acquisition of a
   newspaper by an investment owner reduced the paper's newsroom by nine
   reporters and editors compared to newspapers that remained under other
   ownership, a cut equivalent to 14 percent of the average newspaper's
   staff. These cuts were concentrated among positions focused on general
   assignment and political reporting. Our findings indicate the rise of
   investment owners has accelerated the decline of local newspapers.},

Abstract = {Central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a digital form of fiat currency.
   CBDC has the potential to be a game challenger in the international
   financial system, bringing increased complexities arising from
   technology and regulatory considerations, as well as generating greater
   currency competition. As more states begin exploring CBDC, the
   interactions between actors may lead to the emergence of a new CBDC
   network. What shape would the emerging CBDC network take? What would its
   network effects be? What would be the impact of the CBDC network on the
   international financial system, or the global financial network? This
   article explores these questions by examining the emerging CBDC network
   and its regulatory implications. It argues that the CBDC network would
   likely be both decentralized and uncoordinated, making it unlikely to
   lead to convergence in CBDC regulation. The CBDC network would probably
   bring policy diffusion effects, with states behaving instrumentally,
   while shaking up the power balance between different actors, generating
   both cooperation and conflict. The CBDC network also has the potential
   to push international financial system toward becoming more
   decentralized.},

Abstract = {Since 2012, an ongoing housing boom has turned Bishkek into an El Dorado
   of so-called `elite housing' or elitki. Against this background, this
   article seeks to explore elite housing not only as the manifestation of
   `newbuild gentrification' in the rapidly changing urban landscape of
   Bishkek but also as a phantasmagorical object of desire and fear that
   haunts the collective imaginaries of its residents. The article seeks to
   reveal the paradoxical nature of elite housing being simultaneously the
   carrier of collective fantasies and a material remainder of their
   ultimate impossibility.},

Title = {Private Insurance, Public Welfare, and Financial Markets: Alpine and

Journal = {POLITICS \& SOCIETY},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {Contemporary capitalist societies use different institutions to manage
   economic risks. While different public welfare state and financial
   institutions (banks, capital markets) have been studied across
   coordinated and liberal market economies, the different worlds of
   private insurance institutions have been understudied. Building on new
   insurance data sets (1880-2017), we find that countries with a Maritime
   (USA, GBR, CAN) in contrast to the more backward Alpine (AUT, DEU, CHE)
   insurance tradition developed bigger life and nonlife insurance earlier,
   with less state-associated and reinsurance enterprises, but riskier
   investments steered toward financial markets. We argue that the larger
   and more ``Maritime{''} the insurance sector, the more it made welfare
   states liberal and securities markets large. Insurance is thus a hidden
   factor for countries' varieties of capitalism and worlds of welfare. The
   recent convergence on the Maritime model, however, implies that the
   riskier and risk-individualizing type of private insurance has added to
   privatization and securitization trends everywhere.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the political origins of diverse peripheral growth
   models in Europe, focusing on debt-based consumption-led growth model in
   Southern Europe and FDI-based export-led growth model in Central and
   Eastern Europe. Contrary to existing approaches that attribute this
   East-South divergence to their geographic position and systemic features
   of European monetary integration, the paper argues that these growth
   models stem from different national and EU-level policy responses to the
   challenge of core-periphery market integration. While the Southern
   states sought to protect domestic firms, allowing for, or even directly
   contributing to deindustrialisation in the face of competition with the
   European core economies, Central and East European states aimed to
   preserve their industrial legacy even at the expense of FDI-dependency.
   These policy responses were, in turn, shaped by distinct patterns of
   interaction and accommodation between segments of state elites and
   domestic economic groups, as well as by dramatically different EU
   strategies of governing integration. In contrast with society-centred
   perspectives on the politics of growth models, the paper highlights the
   autonomous role of the state as a key actor balancing between the
   demands and accommodation of domestic economic groups, and the
   constraints and opportunities created by regional institutions governing
   market integration.},

Abstract = {The Nixon administration's attempt to promote a military coup in Chile
   after the election of a far-left president in September 1970 is a
   well-documented example of U.S. officials' willingness do whatever was
   needed to curtail Soviet influence in the Third World. Drawing on
   declassified White House documents and records of the U.S. Central
   Intelligence Agency, this article examines the parallel but largely
   unknown story of U.S. dealings with right-wing extremists in one of the
   founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Italy, at
   around that same time. In December 1970, far-right activists in Italy
   staged an abortive coup that was intended to prevent further gains by
   Italy's leftist parties. The article draws on new and widely forgotten
   sources to examine the background and involvement of two private U.S.
   operatives for the Republican Party who were closely aligned with senior
   coup plotters in Italy. Their involvement with Italian neo-fascists

Abstract = {The survival and resurgence of Indigenous legal orders and
   constitutional traditions in Canada, as elsewhere, disrupt the normative
   hegemony of the liberal state and articulate a constitutionalism that
   accounts for a plurality of laws. How can state and non-state legal
   orders interact across vastly different normative worlds? How can their
   interaction address the colonial power imbalance and what role should
   recognition play in this relationship? This article draws on the work of
   Ralf Michaels on relational legal pluralism and Aaron Mills on
   Anishinaabe constitutionalism to explore how a legally plural society
   must embrace Michaels' challenge of constitutive external recognition:
   the idea that legal orders mutually constitute each other through
   recognition without interfering with each other's factual status as law.
   External recognition is consistent with strong legal pluralism and is
   distinct from recognition within the multicultural liberal state, a form
   of weak legal pluralism and continued colonialism. Mills' discussion of
   treaty, rather than contract, as a foundation for shared political
   community assists in imagining a constitutionalism with/in Canada in
   which distinct legal orders can mutually constitute each other without
   domination. Linkage norms may help to establish reciprocal relations
   among state law and Indigenous legal orders, and the enactment of such
   `tertiary rules of recognition' from within Indigenous legal orders may
   itself shift the balance of power.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the relation between climate change and the
   globalization of food systems. Although the corporate food regime made
   possible by the logistics revolution has been deemed highly intensive in
   its use of fossil fuels, the political economy of its energy foundations
   is yet to be deciphered. Based on EDGAR-FOOD, a global database that
   measures carbon emissions in the food system, we built a sample of nine
   South American economies to assess the extent to which capital mobility
   triggers emissions across different sectors. Findings from our study
   reveal that although food distribution was the most dynamic sector
   during the period in assessment, land-based emissions remained
   overwhelmingly larger in absolute terms. This, the paper concludes,
   highlights the definitive role that landed property - and the structural
   heterogeneity of agrarian capitalism more broadly - performs in the
   politics of carbon emissions. Accordingly, our findings lay bare a
   hidden abode of heterogeneous relations of production - chief of which
   are unpaid work, petty commodity production, and rent - that lies at the
   basis of a polarizing, hierarchically-structured international division
   of labor.},

Abstract = {In recent years, IPE research has increasingly tried to better
   understand the nature and implications of China's rise in a changing
   global landscape. However, in IPE teaching, China is often treated as an
   afterthought to a familiar transatlantic story. IPE students thereby are
   not adequately prepared to explain important developments in the
   21st-century global economy, their underlying causes, mechanisms and
   particularities. This article provides a roadmap for rethinking the IPE
   curriculum. In an initial step, we suggest incorporating more
   comparative political economy into the teaching of IPE theories to
   create an analytical sensitivity for understanding (Chinese)
   state-market relationships that significantly diverge from
   Western-centric narratives. In a second step, these conceptual
   frameworks should be taken into account when teaching core IPE issue
   areas such as finance, development, production and trade, in which we
   argue China must be treated as an integral part rather than an outlier
   of IPE teaching. Such a revised curriculum, we argue, equips students
   with the conceptual tools and empirical knowledge for understanding
   diverging domestic institutional configurations of different economies,
   and thereby enables students to analyze, compare and critically evaluate
   fundamental assumptions and arguments about how the global economy
   functions in the context of a rising China.},

Abstract = {Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, citizens' compliance with government
   preventive measures was one of the top policy priorities for governments
   worldwide. This study engages with socio-legal and psychological
   theories on compliance and proposes an analytical framework to explore
   the role of different psychological factors on individual-level
   compliance during global health crises. Using the results of three
   national surveys, we argue that various negative emotional states,
   perceptions of the ongoing crisis, and of the institutional settings are
   major factors influencing individual compliance across countries. Most
   importantly, while increased panic, anxiety, and sadness lead to higher
   compliance, rising anger, loneliness, and impatience decrease compliance
   levels. Notably, perceptions of the COVID-19 crisis-especially health
   concerns and a worsening financial situation-tend to elicit anger among
   citizens across countries, thereby further hampering their obedience
   with pandemic regulations. Furthermore, perceptions of public
   institutions also influence individual compliance. Overall, in order to
   ensure compliance, we suggest that policymakers and those implementing
   government measures take individual psychological factors into account
   both within and beyond the public crisis context.},

Abstract = {This article explores the nexus between ecoterritorial conflict
   resolution and transformative transitional justice, against the
   background of (neo)extractivism and the Peruvian case of half a century
   of oil violence. Our argument is twofold. On the one hand, we argue that
   transitional justice can act as a conceptual and analytical lens to
   better understand and further (claims for) change while also countering
   the invisibilization of ecoterritorial struggles of Indigenous and local
   communities who resist the framing of their lives and ecosystems as
   sacrificable or disposable. On the other hand, we argue that reading
   ecoterritorial struggles through the lens of transitional justice also
   has implications for the paradigm itself. The article is rooted in the
   first author's longstanding work with Indigenous communities in the
   Peruvian Amazon who engage with transitional justice discourses and
   practices as part of their struggle against oil violence.},

Abstract = {The popular uprising (Aragalaya) combined a protest movement with a
   movement towards commons or a solidarity economy. The popular uprising
   from March to August 2022 was a reaction to the authoritarian
   heteropatriarchal Rajapaksa regime, which drained public revenues
   instigating an economic crisis. The Aragalaya was based on non-violence,
   independence from political parties, participatory democracy, collective
   leadership, politico- aesthetic strategies (art activism) and collective
   learning. While there were multiple contradictions, along with state
   repression, the Aragalaya expressed new forms of solidarity,
   strengthening struggles for democracy and citizenship.},

Abstract = {Schools have traditionally taken a ``just-the-facts-ma'am{''} approach
   to civic education, focusing on governmental structures and political
   systems. We argue that preparing young people to engage with democracy
   requires far more than rote memorization of facts and figures. Schools
   should be laboratories of democracy, where young people's civic
   intentions are converted into civic behaviors. We argue that to realize
   that transformation, educators must impart real-world knowledge,
   practical skills, and nurturing abilities that are not captured by
   standardized tests of academic achievement: namely, the interpersonal
   and intrapersonal abilities conducive to civic mindedness. We discuss
   what these oft-labeled ``noncognitive{''} skills are and how they are
   measured, review the evidence that shows how they foster democratic
   participation, articulate a vision for how civics can help develop
   students' noncognitive skills, and lay out a research agenda for
   scholars seeking to teach young people the skills requisite to actively
   participate in democracy.},

Abstract = {Social movement scholars use protest events as a way to quantify social
   movements and have most often used large, national newspapers to
   identify those events. This has introduced known and unknown biases into
   our measurement of social movements. We know that national newspapers
   tend to cover larger and more contentious events and organizations.
   Protest events are furthermore a small part of what social movements
   actually do. Without other readily available options to quantify social
   movements, however, big-N studies have continued to focus on protest
   events via a few large newspapers. With advances in digitized data and
   computational methods, we now no longer have to rely on large newspapers
   or focus only on protests to quantify important aspects of social
   movements. In this paper, we use the environmental movement as a case
   study, analyzing data from a wide range of local, regional, and national
   newspapers in the United States to quantify multiple facets of social
   movements. We argue that the incorporation of more data and new methods
   to quantify information in text has the potential to transform the way
   we both conceive of and measure social movements in three ways: (1) the
   type of focal social movement organization included, (2) the type of
   tactics and issues covered, and (3) the ability to go beyond protest
   events as the primary unit of analysis. In addition to demonstrating
   ways that the focus on counting protest events has introduced specific
   biases in the type of tactics, issues, and organizations covered in
   social movement research, we argue that computational methods can help
   us extract and count meaningful aspects of social movements well beyond
   event counts. In short, the infusion of new data and methods into social
   movements, peace, and conflict studies could lead us to a substantial
   shift in the way we quantify social movements, from protest events to
   everything that occurs outside of them.},

Abstract = {Scott Sagan asked me to revisit Nuclear Ethics, a book I published in
   1986, in light of current developments in world affairs. In doing so, I
   found that much had changed but the basic usability paradox of nuclear
   deterrence remains the same. As do the ethical dilemmas. To deter, there
   must be some prospect of use, but easy usability could produce highly
   immoral consequences. Some risk is unavoidable and the moral task is how
   best to lower it. Nuclear weapons pose moral problems but nuclear use is
   the greater evil. Abolition may be a worthy long-term goal, but it is
   unlikely in the short-term relations among the nine states now
   possessing nuclear weapons. Drawing on just war theory, I examine the
   three dimensions of intentions, means, and consequences to outline a
   ten-point agenda for just deterrence that seeks to lower risks of
   nuclear war. The world has changed since the book was published but the
   basic moral dilemmas remain the same.},

Abstract = {What are the reasons that lead Max Weber to be a convinced promoter of
   publicity in the practices of internal politics and, by contrast,
   advocate secret procedures in international affairs? The analysis aims
   at clarifying the different arguments utilised by Weber for justifying
   his apparently contrasting points of view and explains the reasonable
   motivations that are adduced to legitimate both issues. Since admitting
   confidential practices does not mean the acceptance of arbitrariness and
   bare demonstrations of power, it also highlights how Weber accompanies
   his considerations on the opportunity of the use of confidentiality with
   the determination of corresponding criteria that have to regulate and
   circumscribe its use. The present analysis is completed with a
   comparison with the positions formulated respectively by Immanuel Kant
   and J \& uuml;rgen Habermas, who both plead for a public course of
   politics to be also applied in international affairs and, as a
   consequence, explicitly reject confidentiality as alegitimate form of
   dealing with political issues. Finally, it faces the question whether
   and in which form Weber's standpoint contrasts with their positions and
   what are the reasons motivating his different assessments.},

Title = {What is Parliamentarism to Populists? The Populist Redefinition of the
   Concept of Parliamentarism in Parliamentary Debates in Post-Milošević
   Serbia},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the semantic aspect of the effect of populism in
   power on parliamentarism. The research focuses on the case of Serbia
   between 2001 and 2022, which corresponds to the post-Milo \& scaron;evi
   \& cacute; era of contemporary Serbian politicalhistory and includes a
   decade before and after the populist Serbian Progressive Party (SNS)
   took power in 2012. Drawing on the traditions of conceptual history and
   rhetorical politicalanalysis, this paper reconstructs the debate over
   the concept of parliamentarism in Serbian parliamentary debates during
   the period under observation in order to analyze how populist agents'
   interpretation and use of the concept of parliamentarism related to and
   affected established conceptual conventions. The paper argues that the
   excessive centralization of power in the hands of the populist
   executive, which marked the first decade of SNS rule, was accompanied by
   SNS deputies' attempt to redefine the concept of parliamentarism through
   the rhetorical reconstruction of its internal morphology. This attempt
   was manifested in SNS deputies' contestation of the established
   conventions of articulating the concept of parliamentarism with the
   concepts of parliamentary sovereignty, which implied the superiority of
   parliament in the institutional system of the polity, and ministerial
   responsibility, understood as the effective scrutiny of the executive by
   the institution of parliament as a whole.},

Abstract = {Intelligence scholars routinely portray intelligence oversight as a
   means of restraining intelligence activities, particularly covert
   operations. The consensus overlooks situations where oversight can
   instead channel popular passions. This paper documents how Reagan era
   activists recruited legislators to the Afghan resistance cause. Their
   legislative-civic alliance demanded the CIA launch more aggressive
   operations in Afghanistan, sidelining established oversight committees.
   The resulting covert action campaign risked Soviet escalation,
   eliminated plausible deniability, and gave advanced U.S. technology to
   potential terrorists. This episode highlights how well-organized
   lobbyists may affect the intelligence agenda and challenges assumptions
   that wider engagement in oversight will always restrain intelligence
   agencies' overreach.},

Abstract = {How analytic uncertainty is presented can affect critical policymaker
   decisions. Analysts are told to offer separate: (1) assessments of the
   likelihood an analytic statement is true and (2) confidence statements
   that express how strongly analysts believe their assessments. The
   distinction between likelihood and confidence sounds clear but is not.
   The IC defines confidence poorly. Most intelligence products fail to
   distinguish likelihood from confidence and use the terms interchangeably
   to mean probability. The IC should abandon its confusing shorthand
   confidence descriptions. Instead, analysts should provide explanations
   of the nature and strength of evidence, and the reasoning behind
   analytic judgments.},

Abstract = {Feminists have utilized manifestos and utopias in order to make
   important, often revolutionary, contributions to international law.
   However, these engagements have not been reflected in the substance of
   international law. The sources of international law - specifically
   customary international law - rely on a narrow understanding of
   historical knowledge. This article centres the 1924 manifesto and the
   `New International Order' created by the Women's International League
   for Peace and Freedom, as tools to assess the exclusion of the
   under-utilized history of feminist peace work from the sources of
   international law. This allows for a reflection on customary
   international law's weaknesses and reaffirms the importance of feminist
   approaches to international law.},

Abstract = {Regulators who aim to reduce administrative burdens often promote
   trust-based policy instruments, such as legal affidavits or honesty
   pledges, as substitutes to traditional bureaucratic procedures. However,
   little is known on how the general public view such instruments, and
   whether people would actually comply with them, and under what
   circumstances. Using a series of experimental vignettes, we examine
   public preferences toward these instruments under different conditions
   and contexts. We find that overall, people exhibit an aversion to using
   affidavits, even when they are inexpensive and can save a considerable
   amount of time compared to the traditional bureaucratic procedure. In
   contrast, honesty pledges are largely preferred over both the standard
   procedure and signing an affidavit. We discuss factors influencing the
   public choice of trust-based instruments and offer recommendations to
   help policymakers promote public compliance using behaviorally informed
   policy instruments.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that rising household indebtedness is associated with
   the decline of organised labour. Over the last decades, the financial
   system is increasingly financing working-class households, and recent
   research shows that indebted employees become more risk-averse at the
   workplace on the fear of losing their job and defaulting. Thus, since
   union formation or participation is commonly punished with redundancy,
   rising household indebtedness is likely to be associated with the
   aggregate reduction in unionisation. This study examines this argument
   for a high-, a mid-, and low-unionisation economy over the period
   1965-2018: Sweden, Japan, and South Korea, respectively. Regression
   analysis provides robust support in favour of this argument. The results
   also suggest that financial regulation and social norms about personal
   insolvency matter for the size of the effects of household debt on
   unionisation.},

   argues that through the structures of the United Nations, the
   Responsibility to Protect framework, the African Union and the African
   Union Constitutive Act, legal instruments can and should be implemented
   to stop the atrocities occurring. It provides examples from recent
   history that serve as a reference for deploying a peacekeeping

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {160-181},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {In many jurisdictions, procedural rules and arrangements that govern
   litigation are not necessarily well-suited to the protection of
   collective interests, such as the environment. This idea has been
   flagged for a while by scholars and practitioners from different
   jurisdictions and was part of the reason for promoting specific
   regulations on access to justice in environmental matters. The
   protection of the climate adds a new layer of complexity, as it is
   increasingly clear that, even in jurisdictions where a strong rule of
   law is presumed to exist, barriers to access to justice remain. We
   depart from the idea of a mismatch between procedural rules and climate
   protection through courts to explore the interface between two
   convergent phenomena in the Latin American region: the Escazu
   Agreement's implementation and climate litigation. Based on data
   gathered through interviews with 11 legal practitioners involved in
   climate cases in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Mexico,
   this article identifies procedural barriers that plaintiffs face in the
   courtroom and discusses if and how the implementation of the Escazu
   Agreement could overcome them for the improvement of access to justice
   in climate matters in the region. In doing that, it highlights relevant
   experiences in Latin America that could be of interest to those seeking
   to overcome procedural hurdles in other regions.},

Abstract = {The current research on Engels' and Marx's early economic studies often
   neglects the language and geographical differences between Engels and
   Marx which directly lead to the disparity between them in political
   economy. This study, based on MEGA(2), finds that before the
   collaboration with Marx, Engels, with his proficiency in English,
   studied plenty of first-hand English literature on political economy
   while having in-person experience and doing field investigation in
   Britain which most German intellectuals of the same period such as Marx
   lacked. With access to the newly published English literature, Engels
   transformed his literature advantage into a theoretical edge and
   formulated his original ideas. Yet Marx in German states and Austrian
   Empire mainly studied French translations of limited English literature
   on political economy, although presenting critical insights. Engels'
   advantage is that he proposed many ideas that would become the basis of
   Marxian political economy, some of which had not yet been explored by
   Marx but were later affirmed by Marx.},

Title = {Digital-Nondigital Assemblages: Data, Paper Trails, and Migrants'
   Scattered Subjectivities at the Border},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {This paper argues that the border regime works through entanglements of
   digital and nondigital data and of ``low-tech{''} and ``high-tech{''}
   technologies. It suggests that a critical analysis of the assemblages
   between digital and nondigital requires exploring their effects of
   subjectivation on those who are labeled as ``migrants.{''} The paper
   starts with a critique of the presentism and techno-hype that pervade
   research on borders and technology, and points to the importance of
   analyzing historical continuities and ruptures in the technologization
   of the border regime. It then explores the assemblages of high-tech and
   low-tech technologies used for controlling mobility and investigates the
   imbrication of digital and nondigital records that migrants need to deal
   with and show not only at the border but throughout their journeys and,
   eventually, to obtain refugee status. The third section discusses
   migrants' tactical uses of digital and nondigital records, their
   attempts to erase or reconstruct traces of their passages, and states'
   oscillation between politics of identification and nonidentification.
   Finally, the fourth section questions the image of the ``data double{''}
   and contends that, rather than a discrete digital subject, migrants'
   digital traces generate scattered digital subjectivities that migrants
   themselves cannot fully access.
   Cet article affirme que le fonctionnement d'un regime frontalier
   entremele des donnees numeriques et non numeriques et des technologies
   \& DLANGBRAC; low-tech \& drangbrac; et \& DLANGBRAC; high-tech \&
   drangbrac;. Il suggere qu'une analyse critique des assemblages de
   numerique et non numerique necessite d'explorer leurs effets de
   subjectivation sur ceux que l'on qualifie de \& DLANGBRAC; migrants \&
   drangbrac;. L'article commence par une critique du presentisme et de la
   hype technologique, omnipresents dans la recherche sur les frontieres et
   la technologie, en soulignant l'importance de retracer la genealogie de
   la technologisation du regime frontalier. Ensuite, il s'interesse aux
   assemblages de technologies high-tech et low-tech employes pour
   controler la mobilite, mais aussi l'imbrication des dossiers numeriques
   et non numeriques que les migrants doivent gerer et montrer a la
   frontiere, puis tout au long de leur periple avant de finalement obtenir
   le statut de refugie. Une troisieme partie examine les tactiques
   d'utilisation des dossiers numeriques et non numeriques des migrants,
   leurs tentatives d'effacement des traces de leur passage et
   l'oscillation de l'etat entre une politique d'identification et de
   non-identification. Enfin, l'article s'interroge sur l'image du \&
   DLANGBRAC; probleme des donnees \& drangbrac; et affirme qu'au lieu d'un
   sujet numerique discret, les traces numeriques des migrants generent des
   subjectivites numeriques eparpillees auxquelles les migrants eux-memes
   ne peuvent pas pleinement acceder.
   Este articulo argumenta que el regimen fronterizo funciona a traves de
   redes de datos tanto digitales como no digitales y de tecnologias de \&
   DLANGBRAC;baja \& drangbrac; y de \& DLANGBRAC;alta tecnologia \&
   drangbrac;. El articulo sugiere que un analisis critico de los conjuntos
   situados entre lo digital y lo no digital requiere explorar sus efectos
   en materia de subjetivacion sobre aquellas personas que son etiquetadas
   como \& DLANGBRAC;migrantes \& drangbrac;. El articulo comienza con una
   critica del presentismo y la tecno-exageracion que impregnan la
   investigacion en materia de fronteras y tecnologia y senala la
   importancia de efectuar una investigacion genealogica de la
   tecnologizacion del regimen fronterizo. A continuacion, el articulo
   explora los conjuntos tecnologicos de alta y baja tecnologia que se
   utilizan para controlar la movilidad e investiga la imbricacion de los
   registros digitales y no digitales que deben afrontar los migrantes, asi
   como de los registros que deben mostrar, no solo en la frontera sino
   tambien a lo largo de su viaje y al final de su viaje para obtener el
   estatus de refugiado. La tercera seccion de este articulo debate el uso
   tactico que llevan a cabo los migrantes con relacion a los registros
   digitales y no digitales, asi como sus intentos por borrar rastros de
   sus recorridos y la oscilacion del Estado entre la politica de
   identificacion y la politica de no identificacion. Por ultimo, la cuarta
   seccion cuestiona la imagen del \& DLANGBRAC;duplicado de datos \&
   drangbrac; y sostiene que las huellas digitales de los migrantes generan
   subjetividades digitales dispersas, en lugar de generar un sujeto
   digital discreto, a las que los propios migrantes no pueden acceder
   plenamente.},

Abstract = {Research highlights a growing divergence among U.S. states in their
   costs of voting, the partisan balance of their legislative districts,
   and the responsiveness of state policy to public opinion. Less is known,
   however, about a new and acute threat to democracy at the state level:
   policies that increase the states' vulnerability to election subversion.
   In this article, we investigate recent trends in state legislation that
   transfer election administration authority from independent to partisan
   actors, making it more likely that a losing presidential candidate could
   take office over the will of the electorate. We find that Republican
   control of state legislatures and the closeness of the 2020 presidential
   election are associated with these policies. Interestingly, these
   policies are mostly uncorrelated with gerrymandering and voter
   suppression policies that were enacted in the 2010s. We conclude with a
   discussion of how a recent Electoral Count Act reform in Congress partly
   mitigates the risk of election subversion.},

Title = {Transitional Justice in Post-terror Contexts: The Norwegian 22 July
   Memorial and the Ambiguity of Litigation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 27},
Abstract = {This article explores litigation as a practice of memorialization
   through a qualitative study of the legal mobilization to halt and
   re-site the Norwegian national memorial for the 22 July 2011 terror
   attack. In arguing that adversarial legal processes initiated by
   grassroots actors can represent a form of commemorative work with an
   ambiguous societal status, the article contributes to the emergent
   literature on transitional justice practices in established democracies
   and in post-terror contexts. In the Norwegian case, the law became an
   arena for contested negotiations over the hierarchy of victims. The
   litigation process also shaped how the fallout of 22 July is understood.
   Furthermore, this mobilization engendered frictions regarding the
   potential of future 22 July commemorations to perpetuate trauma.
   Litigation may be understood as a rupture with the national narrative of
   law as an accountability tool, because of the stigma and unresolved and
   painful contestation around democratic citizenship that it produces.},

Abstract = {Because of the United States' minimal domestic engagement with human
   rights, several subnational initiatives, including the Cities for CEDAW
   campaign, have formed to infuse human rights into local policy making.
   Analyzing Miami-Dade County as one locale within the Cities for CEDAW
   network, this article asks what happens to human rights when they are
   turned into urban policies. Drawing on literature theorizing the
   complexities of urban human rights activism and using an interpretivist
   framework of analysis, the article reconstructs local context features
   and practices promoting gender equality through the countywide CEDAW
   ordinance. It develops a narrative based on expert interviews and finds
   an unusual actor constellation in which a local officeholder led the way
   rather than community activists. The practices identified work within
   institutional constraints and highlight data collection to support
   informed gender policy making. The findings lead to the conclusion that
   both activists and scholars should think beyond the dynamics of policy
   formulation and more explicitly about the complexities of
   implementation.},

Abstract = {We know that women politicians are harassed by constituents to a greater
   extent than men, but we know less about why this difference exists. This
   study tests potential drivers of hostility against women politicans
   using an original survey experiment with 7,500 respondents in the United
   States and Sweden. First, I test whether constituents hold more lenient
   attitudes toward hostility directed at women than men, which would make
   hostility in messages targeting women representatives more likely.
   Second, I test whether constituents prefer to direct their complaints to
   women, which would increase the risk of hostility by generating a higher
   number of angry contacts. Results from both countries show a preference
   for directing complaints to women representatives over men, but no
   evidence of more leniency toward hostility directed at women.},

   communities' critical information needs and how well they were being met

   political pressures brought to bear in opposition to that inquiry and
   the extent to which opposition to this kind of research undermines the
   development of prosocial local information ecologies. Finally, I discuss
   what can be done to develop research in this vein and shore up local

Abstract = {This volume of The ANNALS revisits and updates a call made by scholars
   in the early 2010s for public policy to respond to the market failure of
   local news. Organized into four parts-policy, supply, demand, and
   adaptation-this volume is committed to the proposition that people need
   information about their communities in order to navigate everyday life,
   and that those information needs are inextricably intertwined with other
   basic necessities like sustenance, transportation, housing, health, and
   safety. However, local and regional newspapers face an existential
   threat to their continued economic survival that undermines their
   ability to do even basic, routine coverage of civic institutions and
   communities. This volume demonstrates that professional journalism is
   one of many ways to support communities' information needs. We consider
   how new sources of news and information might fill contemporary
   information needs and how media policy, broadly understood, could help
   create a more equitable, tolerant, and just multiracial democracy.},

Title = {Visibility or Impact? International Efforts to Defend LGBTQI plus Rights
   in Africa},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {506-522},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Most struggles for LGBTQI+ rights play out at the national level.
   However, the question of sexual and gender minorities' rights
   periodically appears as a point of friction in international relations
   as well. This article analyses the question of international efforts to
   defend LGBTQI+ rights in countries of the Global South, with a
   particular focus on Western countries' endeavours in Africa. Combining
   policy analysis, critique and recommendations, it asks how and when
   international actors should and should not intervene. It recognizes that
   motives for intervening can be problematic and the means often
   counterproductive, especially when exhibiting neo-imperialist tendencies
   and constituting ad hoc reactions to events in the media. Countering
   essentialist arguments about `authentic' African culture and values,
   influenced by religious beliefs, is also a significant challenge. I
   argue that more fruitful efforts should instead be centred on local
   rights defenders' perspectives and supporting their priorities and
   initiatives, based on concerted, long-term, principled strategies.
   International actors, however, are reluctant to adopt such approaches
   because of a desire for short-term visible action, even if less
   effective or not effective at all. This conundrum is a fundamental
   problem in the area of foreign aid writ large, as greater impact often
   requires less visibility on the part of international actors, but donor
   countries want domestic and international recognition of their efforts.
   The article distils key lessons learnt and principles for action that
   have emerged over the past 15 to 20 years, brought together in one place
   for the first time. It aims to stimulate discussions among practitioners
   and academics. It should be of particular interest to human rights
   practitioners, especially those who are involved or contemplating
   getting involved in defending the rights of sexual and gender minorities
   internationally.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered the critical nature of social care
   for modern societies and the moral dilemmas related to the organisation
   of care, specifically in terms of frail adults. The scarcity of
   personnel in nursing homes challenged the possibility of adequate care,
   spurring debates on both the dignity of dependent people and end-of-life
   treatments. While `classical' social care policies already stimulate
   conflicts about the `right way' of caring, non-classical care policies,
   such as assisted dying, are particularly contested. We advance existing
   research by analysing public attitudes on both care policies jointly
   and, hence, integrate the literature on morality policy and social care.
   Based on multi-level analyses, combining individual-level with
   macro-level data from 34 countries, we uncover that gender and religious
   identity drive deviating attitudes in both fields, while long-term care
   expenditure mitigates scepticism among Catholics but less so among
   Muslims.},

Abstract = {The ever-expanding field of transitional justice has, to date, largely
   overlooked the issue of disability, even though there is growing
   research on disability and armed conflict. Relatedly, little attention
   has been given to the accessibility of transitional justice processes.
   This Policy and Practice Note, the idea for which developed from the
   author's own personal experiences and reflections as a transitional
   justice scholar with a physical disability, points to unexplored
   synergies between the human rights and social models of disability
   (reflected within the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
   Disabilities), on one hand, and transitional justice, on the other. It
   also highlights and discusses three important dimensions of
   accessibility-processual, contextual and methodological-that could be
   usefully explored within transitional justice scholarship and practice
   to give the issue of disability the recognition and prominence that it
   deserves.},

Abstract = {The concept of `women's interests' has received a large amount of
   scholarly attention. In particular, the problematic assumption
   underpinning this concept - that women share interests - has been an
   object of much consideration. Yet, while scholarship on the substantive
   representation of women has today moved free of this assumption, three
   other assumptions have not been scrutinised to the same degree. These
   are: (1) that political interests are attached to social groups; (2)
   that women and men have different interests; and (3) that there are only
   two genders. This article argues that these three assumptions are
   problematic for feminist scholarship on substantive representation,
   which warrants replacing the attached `women's interests' with an
   alternative interest: the unattached `gender equality interests'. In
   addition, the article sets forth three distinct ways for future studies
   to operationalise the substantive representation of gender equality.},

Abstract = {Having roots in women's struggles in different world regions, the
   International Women's Strike (IWS) has, since 2017, generated a global
   wave of feminist mobilization against attacks on gender equality and
   sexual rights, neoliberalism's multiple crises, and authoritarian,
   fundamentalist, and neo-nationalist politics. This article discusses the
   IWS from the perspective of transnational solidarities, with a focus on
   its manifestation in Turkey. First, differentiating between
   supra-political and left-leaning currents in transnational feminist
   politics, I outline the guiding principles of the IWS campaign as an
   acknowledgment of the systemic dynamics of gender oppression, a broad
   definition of women's labor, and an intersectional understanding of
   solidarity. Second, drawing on field-based and digital ethnography,
   participatory action research, and interviews with activists from the
   coalition Women Are Strong Together, I discuss how the IWS principles
   overlapped with political dynamics and conflicts of interest between
   different women's groups, hindering the possibility of a women's strike
   in Turkey. The article demonstrates the tensions and transformations
   occurring at the intersection of the supra- and sub-national levels in
   feminist politics and contributes to the understanding of how different
   currents in transnational feminism dovetail with different imaginations
   and practices of solidarity.},

Abstract = {This article examines reactions to government officials' disclosures
   about buying secondhand clothing to manage the financial obligations
   associated with ``looking the part{''} when holding office. I refer to
   these disclosures as ``thrifting narratives.{''} This study adopts a
   novel approach to analyzing the political relevance of elected
   officials' physical appearance by asking: to what extent does public
   officials sharing thrifting narratives make them appear more relatable
   and help forge political commonality with the public? To answer this
   question, I analyze Twitter responses to a thrifting narrative shared by
   newly elected Representative Cori Bush in November 2020. Results of the
   analysis reveal that Twitter users most frequently responded to the
   socioeconomic dimensions of Bush's thrifting narrative and, in this
   context, perceived her as an authentic leader. These findings contribute
   to existing literature by showcasing how wardrobe choices can operate as
   social class markers and be used to foster rapport with ordinary
   citizens.},

Abstract = {The Rajapaksa regime over the 2005-2022 period promoted a
   nationalpopular project based on a militarised Sinhala-Buddhist
   nationalism promoting a market-driven rentier economy. It illustrated a
   form of patrimonial capitalism undermining public accountability and the
   efficacy of the state bureaucracy. This popular-national project was
   dependent on strengthening ties with China while distancing relations
   with India and the Global North (USA and the EU). The ways in which the
   external relations were coordinated reinforced discrimination against
   Tamil and Muslim communities, while disregarding their demands for
   justice and reparations. The increasing integration of the economy with
   financial markets, driven by the Central Bank, amplified the
   commercialisation of the state, restraining public revenues and state
   oversight. Meanwhile, the militarisation of the state involved the
   commercialisation of the military, opaque military budgets and violent
   repression of protests. The Rajapaksa regime, which enabled a
   minorityprivileged (leisure) class to culturally flourish in regulated
   safe spaces, also instigated multiple protests from below demanding
   democracy as well as justice.},

Abstract = {This article employs the framework of agentic misrecognition to explore
   the institutional dynamics and distinct forms of agency operative in the
   global monetary system. The analysis is framed by the concept of
   ``political recognition,{''} exploring the relationship between the
   dominant actor and subordinate actors, and showing the complex ways by
   which misrecognition is performed through, as well as shaped by, the
   sociopolitical logics of the monetary system. It shows how with the
   employment of formalist methodologies, the dominant actor protects its
   status by misrecognizing and resisting pleas for greater concern and
   more coordination, seeing subordinates not as creative agents but as
   challenges to its dominance. The analysis also explores how and why
   subordinate members come to support the misrecognition scheme even
   though it perpetuates instability and systemic inequalities. Similar to
   most studies on recognition theory, this article pays close attention to
   the plight of the misrecognized, but the analysis is also concerned with
   understanding the underlying cause of the misrecognition scheme and how
   the dominant actor as misrecognizer contributes to dysfunctions in the
   monetary system. In demonstrating the underlying features of the
   misrecognition scheme, this critique challenges established theories and
   methodologies in the monetary sphere.},

Abstract = {To cope with the socio-economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic,
   the EU has adopted a new approach by launching an instrument aimed at
   promoting cross-national solidarity, called Next Generation EU. This
   could trigger major changes in terms of EU power and authority, calling
   into question the polity's legitimacy, and the kind of solidarity to be
   embodied in the European system. As part of the scholarly debate on
   transnational solidarity, the article focuses on the politicisation of
   the Covid-19 crisis within the European Parliament, with a focus on
   opposition parties. By applying discourse analysis, the article explains
   how the crisis has acted as a catalyst for framing opposition parties'
   stances about the relationship between legitimacy and solidarity in the
   EU polity. Furthermore, the article examines how opposition parties have
   assessed their competing views on the role of the EU's political system
   and on future developments in the integration process.},

Abstract = {Sustainability risks in aquaculture are increasingly addressed through
   forms of assurance that rely on the use of digital technologies. By
   bringing in new actors and informational processes, these forms of
   digital sustainability assurance challenge existing notions of how
   global value chains are governed. Based on in-depth interviews with
   experts, we find that the growing use of digital technologies to mediate
   assurance is shaped by the digital codification of informational
   processes designed to support sustainability, which in turn increases
   the complexity of sustainability claims and changes the capabilities
   needed by value chain actors to comply. Furthermore, we find that
   digital sustainability assurance represents a new form of value chain
   coordination by a new set of extra-transactional ``digital lead
   actors.{''} As these lead actors become more prominent, their control
   over digital data flows constitutes a new form of value chain governance
   with the potential to have greater impact on steering toward
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {What are the biggest challenges and opportunities when an organization
   is trying to understand the human rights impact it has achieved?
   Building on more than 12 years combined years of practical evaluation
   and impact assessment experience across various organizations in the
   human rights field, the authors reflect on the key lessons learnt while
   trying to balance organizational needs of reporting, planning, and
   accountability with the substantive need of understanding how to break
   down human rights progress and how it happens. Reflections will be
   articulated in four key challenges, each with practical ideas to build
   on: the data challenge-what kind of information can give us the most
   meaningful view of human rights impact; the progress challenge-how we
   might capture the incremental nature and gradual pace of human rights
   impact; the target challenge-how best to balance the need to work
   towards realistic targets with setting an ambitious agenda for change;
   and finally, the context challenge-how we might compare human rights
   impact across countries and acknowledge different operating contexts.},

Abstract = {The many contradictory interpretations of neoliberalism raise doubts
   about the value of this concept. This article discusses the literature
   on neoliberalism for identifying a ``minimum common core{''} that
   warrants preserving this concept. I argue that neoliberalism entails an
   ideology and a political practice that aim to subordinate the state and
   all social domains to the market-to its logic and to the economic powers
   within it-thereby undermining democracy. This conceptualization emerges
   as a ``common lowest denominator{''} among many otherwise incompatible
   scholarly definitions of neoliberalism, reflects central neoliberal
   ideas (despite their own inconsistencies), and illuminates crucial
   features of contemporary neoliberal society. I discuss the implications
   of this interpretation for established democracies and for those
   countries that experienced democratization processes during the
   neoliberal era, for the debates on postneoliberalism, and for the
   political identity of the Left.},

Title = {Empowering your victims: Why repressive regimes allow individual
   petitions in international organizations},

Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-123},

Abstract = {The growing literature explaining why repressive regimes ratify human
   rights treaties fails to explain why some regimes take the additional
   step to delegate authority to their people to file international legal
   complaints while others do not. I examine individual petition mechanisms
   in the United Nations which allow individuals to file complaints to an
   overseeing treaty body. I argue that repressive regimes face
   international incentives to signal their commitment to the European
   Union, a global power with a strong and continued interest in the global
   human rights regime. Repressive regimes, however, only ratify agreements
   when they perceive low domestic costs with little institutional
   constraints on the executive. In support of my theory, I find that
   repressive regimes are more likely to ratify the International Covenant
   on Civil and Political Rights' Optional Protocol allowing individual
   petitions when they are trade dependent on the EU while facing lesser
   institutional constraints, both legislative and judicial. The results
   are similar to explaining treaty ratification, but the interaction is
   substantively larger for OP ratification among repressive countries,
   highlighting the increased costs repressive leaders face to allowing
   individual petitions. Individual standing in the overseeing body of the
   ICCPR is one example of non-state actor access in international
   institutions, which is an important component of understanding
   institutional design and compliance.},

Abstract = {The mass-scale expansion of student loan schemes in Turkey over the last
   two decades has been accomplished by a governance technique which the
   article defines as authoritarian debtfarism. By restructuring the Credit
   and Dormitories Institution (KYK) as subordinated to the executive and
   insulated from democratic intervention, the authoritarian neoliberal
   state in Turkey has sought to fulfil its new economic function, i.e.
   enabling the societal reproduction of the youth by increasing their
   financial dependency on credit money. The state-led student loan
   expansion in Turkey emerged in a tuition-free higher education setting
   without a sophisticated financial infrastructure and in an economic
   environment marked with perpetual graduate unemployment as well as
   inflationary pressures on repayment amounts. Based on a detailed
   interrogation of the official documents and in-depth interviews with
   defaulters, this article argues that authoritarian debtfarism has
   imposed a rigid market discipline over the university youth by using
   non-transparency and arbitrariness as its governance mechanisms.
   Consequently, future labour of the graduates is put on hold through a
   long-term debt relation, compelling them to integrate into labour market
   precariously as a new segment of the relative surplus population.},

Abstract = {How do Black Americans practice a politics of racial group uplift while
   balancing their individual material interests? Traditionally, scholars
   have drawn on linked fate theory. However, more recent work argues that
   Black Americans remain politically unified because they feel race-based
   social pressure to conform more than a sense of linked fate. Employing a
   novel research design, I use the competitive reality television series,
   Survivor, to observe and analyze Black group-based decision-making.
   Through an inductive thematic content analysis of 13 Survivor episodes,
   I identified five themes in Black players' discussions of racialized
   social obligations when playing the game-what I call narratives of
   racial duty. Claims that emerged in this storytelling suggested that
   similar to the political world, Black Survivor contestants were keenly
   aware of the racialized social obligations for them as contestants in
   the game. For some, this reality felt like a burden. For others, it
   presented an opportunity. These reactions led some Black players to work
   together and others to construct a rationale for defecting from
   race-based alliances. I conclude by making the case that analyzing
   entertainment programs offers race and politics scholars a new site for
   identifying common scripts used to adhere to (and sidestep) racialized
   social norms.},
