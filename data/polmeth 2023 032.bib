Abstract = {We are long overdue for a conversation about ethical treatment of
   student researchers. Ethical treatment of research participants has been
   carefully defined through decades of public conversation, and ethical
   practices have been institutionalized through mechanisms like mandatory
   ethics trainings and Institutional Review Boards. Student researchers
   deserve the same level of consideration. While there are many types of
   ethical violations of student labor in research projects, there are two
   that are of particular concern to social movements researchers: use of
   volunteer labor without clear academic or professional benefits, and
   failure to ensure the safety of student researchers. The first of these
   ethical violations is especially common in social movements research
   because of the emergent nature of protests: new rounds of protests begin
   and researchers seek to rapidly collect data on a tight timeframe,
   making grant funding to pay student researchers challenging. The second
   situation emerges when faculty researchers do not consider the ways
   students' race, gender identity, or other characteristics, or the nature
   of the protests themselves might create potential risks for students. In
   this paper, I propose using the Belmont Report principles to create
   guidelines for ethical treatment of student researchers. While these
   principles were developed for the purposes of protecting research
   participants, the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and
   justice help us to clarify the risks and benefits for student
   researchers, to find ways to maximize the benefits of student research
   participation, and to understand and address the inequalities that
   plague graduate student training.},

Abstract = {Social movements are made up of organized groups and individuals working
   together to accomplish shared objectives. Under what circumstances do
   active groups build and break their coalitions? Five conditions have
   been identified in the literature as influencing coalition formation:
   common identity, resources, organizational structure, historical
   connection, and institutional setting. Whereas coalition dynamics within
   a movement wave are best understood in terms of institutional
   opportunities and threats, further research is needed to determine how
   and to what extent these contextual elements influence coalitions. This
   chapter examines how threats posed by indiscriminate and selective
   repression affect the shape and structure of interorganizational
   coalitions during the 2019 Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill
   (Anti-ELAB) protests in Hong Kong. The analysis relies on an original
   political event dataset and an organization-event network dataset. These
   datasets were produced utilizing syntactic event coding techniques based
   on Telegram posts, which Hong Kong protesters used to distribute
   information, plan future actions, and crowdsource news. Furthermore,
   Telegram provides detailed information about state activities,
   event-level coalitions, and violent groups, which is difficult to access
   from other sources. This study investigates the coalition networks
   across the movement's four stages, each of which was marked by a
   particular type and degree of repression. The findings indicate that
   indiscriminate and selective repression have varied effects on coalition
   networks. A wide coalition disintegrates as a result of indiscriminate
   repression. Selective repression, however, leads to the formation of
   coalitions around activist groups targeted by repression.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the experience of editing this special issue, I propose a
   method for developing the early stages of social policy interventions
   requiring cooperation, based on two phenomena foundational to
   approaching this challenge. I recommend that the first stage is
   methodological - the application of behavioural game theory - and that
   the second is analysis of a psychological process - the motivations of
   those involved. A potential third step is use of a toolbox of factors
   known to encourage cooperation that I discussed in my introductory
   article for the issue. Three further processes are important for social
   dilemma policy development: conditional cooperation, trust and feedback.
   I go on to discuss: the contrasting properties of selfish and altruistic
   motives for cooperating, particularly in terms of their sensitivity to
   influence; the long-term prospects for altruistically motivated
   cooperation; and ethical aspects of tackling societal dilemmas through
   bottom-up and top-down agents for change. Finally, I consider the
   current state of the relationship between behavioural science and social
   policy.},

Abstract = {Polling the public is commonly assumed to be a democratic practice-a
   scientifically based proxy for instantaneous elections to enhance the
   marketplace of ideas and inform elite political actors. This normative
   underpinning of polling is rarely scrutinized. This article interrogates
   this ``black box{''} of democracy by examining political polling in a
   recently democratized context: South Korea. Drawing on twenty-three
   in-depth elite interviews of pollsters, journalists, campaign experts,
   and academics, we find that polling is not merely a technique to measure
   the public's political views, nor is it straightforwardly a democratic
   practice. Rather, polling is an independent field with its own
   distinctive norms, hierarchy, and logic of operation. While the Korean
   polling experts we interviewed endeavor to make moral meaning out of
   their enterprise and adhere to the view that polling, properly
   conducted, is democracy-enhancing, they also reveal moments of
   questionable reliance on polling as a proxy for politics, endemic
   challenges to the quality of poll data, and the vulnerability of polling
   technology to error and manipulation. By juxtaposing normative
   assumptions alongside an empirical, everyday account of polling in
   practice, we tell a critical and cautionary tale of the technical
   apparatuses that connect representatives to their constituencies.},

Abstract = {We review the literature on the expansion of the Child Tax Credit in
   2021, as it relates to food and financial hardship among households with
   children in the U.S. Extant scholarship consistently finds that receipt
   of the expanded tax credit is associated with an increase in food
   purchases and declines in food insufficiency and food insecurity. The
   effects of the tax credit expansion also vary by the socioeconomic
   characteristics of families. There are important differences, though, in
   effect sizes across studies, indicating that data sources, timeframe of
   analysis, and the way in which food hardship is measured all matter to
   the accurate estimation of effects. The effect of the credit on
   financial hardship is less conclusive, with the literature finding
   generally insignificant effects on measures such as difficulty paying
   rent or bills.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the importance of adopting a human rights-based
   approach in addressing the lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic.
   The article highlights the case of a human rights-based hospital in
   Sweden that actively reached out to vulnerable individuals in the
   community during the pandemic, emphasizing how the human rights-based
   approach contributes to building trust and thereby realizing the right
   to life and health. Based on this example it explores the need for a
   human rights-based approach in crisis management including
   climate-induced disasters. The article emphasizes the interconnectedness
   of all human rights and the need for economic prioritizations that align
   with social justice commitments. It highlights the role of institutions,
   legal frameworks, and collaborative efforts at various levels to ensure
   the realization of human rights and the principle of `leave no one
   behind'. The article concludes by advocating for the integration of
   human rights principles into legislation, policies, and actions to build
   a fairer and more resilient society.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article offers an innovative way of understanding gender balance in
   parliaments. Motivated by research documenting how newcomers are
   disadvantaged during their first term in office, while senior members
   enjoy certain privileges, we want to find out how common women are among
   senior members of parliaments. We launch an institutional approach
   comprising three seniority measures to study gender gaps in political
   endurance to find out whether, where, and when men are more likely than
   women to be parliamentary seniors. Our analysis using data from seven
   countries in Western Europe and two countries in North America
   (1965-2020) shows very high gender gaps across the three measures. Thus,
   despite an increased level of female representation, women still
   constitute a small part of the exclusive group of senior members of
   parliament. Our findings extend the research documenting that women and
   men largely have equally long parliamentary careers, emphasizing the
   need to understand gender balance in multidimensional terms.},

Abstract = {The article views the ethno-cultural map of the Eurasian space through
   the lens of Buryatia by focusing on its transnational living Buddhist
   tradition. It discusses the evolution of this tradition and the
   underlying forces that shaped Buryat Buddhist mobility amidst political
   and socio-economic transformations and intricate power dynamics. Based
   on new evidence, the study uncovers the legacy of Buryats who advanced
   Buddhism beyond national frontiers, thereby creating a transnational
   community rooted in a shared cultural code, and reveals emerging trends
   and reconfigurations in the post-Soviet Buryat Buddhist renaissance.
   This heritage could reposition Buryatia in the transnational landscape
   and lead to a rethinking of collective identity, agency and global
   interdependence in the twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {Since 2017, Italian authorities have repressed nongovernmental sea
   rescuers operating in the Mediterranean Sea. These repressive practices
   have been enacted irrespective of the ideological orientation of the
   governments in office, but have evolved over time. The strategies
   devised by civil society organizations to resist repression have adapted
   accordingly, encompassing a range of activities such as the
   dissemination of counternarratives aimed at desecuritizing migration,
   the establishment of alliances with sympathetic state actors, the
   reflagging or replacement of the ships used for rescue operations, and
   engagement in legal mobilization. This article examines how the
   repressive practices of the Italian government and the
   counter-repression actions of civil society organizations influenced one
   another from 2017 to 2023. We show that although governmental repression
   reduced civil society's rescue operations, the organizations' ability to
   adapt and engage in counter-repression strategies has ensured the
   continuation of their lifesaving activities.},

Abstract = {Bogged down in exploitative jobs or unemployment, some migrants mitigate
   their precarious condition and forced idleness through involvement in
   petty crime, including low-level drug distribution. This article
   explores the daily lives of migrants who navigate asymmetrical
   interactions and relationships with police in ways that avoid detection
   of their illicit activities. Drawing from extensive ethnographic
   fieldwork and 18 biographical interviews with sub-Saharan male migrants
   active in low-level drug retail, I scrutinize how migrants negotiate the
   rules that are supposed to govern them. I am particularly interested in
   the ways in which migrants negotiate their legal status with the police,
   whose view of them is often heavily influenced by race. I demonstrate
   that relationships between police officers and migrants can be
   influenced by migrants' deliberate mimicry of local norms, calculated
   conformity with informal policing practices, and influence over police
   officers' moral judgment of whether they are deserving of police's
   discretionary power to look the other way.},

Abstract = {In its 20 years of operation, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) has
   been enormously successful as a private governor of corporate climate
   risk disclosure. Despite an influx of potentially competitive
   government-led disclosure initiatives and interventions, the use of
   CDP's platform has nonetheless accelerated. To explain this outcome, we
   argue that public interventions augment the value of private governance
   for firms when the costs of compliance overlap, benefits of compliance
   with private rules are undiminished, and normalization helps kickstart
   positive feedback effects. These conditions of complementarity are made
   possible by private governors leveraging authority, access, and
   adaptability as public responses materialize. We illustrate our argument
   with two cases: the Non-Financial Reporting Directive in the European
   Union and the G20's Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.
   In elaborating the conditions for complementarity beyond a functional
   division of governing labor, our study helps clarify how public and
   private governance co-evolve in a mutually reinforcing manner.},

Abstract = {Though many studies have analyzed public opinion of trade
   liberalization, they do not fully explain regional disparities in
   people's preferences with regard to trade. To explain such a geographic
   division, this paper focuses on differences in social contexts that
   exist between regions, which is composed of social networks of different
   characteristics and distinct news coverage from local media. By
   utilizing multiple recent public opinion surveys conducted in Japan, we
   confirm that individuals in rural areas are less likely to support trade
   liberalization and Japan's membership in the Trans-Pacific Partnership
   (TPP) independent of individuals' economic self-interest or skills. With
   multiple surveys and data on Japanese national and local newspapers, we
   investigate the mechanisms, showing that (a) individuals whose
   communication network includes people working for a sector vulnerable to
   trade liberalization tend to oppose free trade regardless of the
   industry they work for and that (b) newspapers circulated in rural and
   urban places tend to cover TPP differently, which also impacts people's
   attitudes toward the agreement. By analyzing the mechanisms of
   sociotropic considerations, our social context approach could eventually
   lead to further uncovering the formation of public opinion on trade.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 25},
Abstract = {Enforced disappearance is a human rights violation and crime widely used
   in repression and armed conflict contexts. The families of the forcibly
   disappeared are left in a state of ambiguous loss as they search for the
   disappeared to satisfy their right to truth and achieve healing and
   closure. However, there is limited knowledge of the obstacles that
   hinder the search in practice and of how families can best be supported
   when mobilizing in search processes. Taking a multi-disciplinary
   approach, using insights from procedural justice research and
   qualitative interviews undertaken with families and other actors
   involved in supporting search processes in Colombia and El Salvador, we
   enhance and expand the scholarship that acknowledges the importance of
   victim participation and victims as key justice stakeholders.},

Abstract = {When does European co-operation and (further) integration not happen in
   the face of a major integration crisis? When do France and Germany not
   emerge as regional stabilizers, forging and uploading bilateral
   compromises to the European level? By developing a combined theoretical
   framework based on liberal intergovernmentalism and leadership
   approaches, this article analyses the European Economic Community's
   (EEC) reaction to the 1973/1974 oil crisis. Despite some favourable
   conditions, differences in domestic energy markets and relations with
   Arab oil-producing countries complicated member state co-operation. In
   turn, divergent economic philosophies and foreign policy priorities
   prevented France and Germany from filling the European leadership
   vacuum. As a consequence, the EEC did not find a unified stance on the
   Arab oil embargo, subordinated itself to US-American dominance and
   undermined its common market via export restrictions for oil. The
   findings suggest that without minimum convergent member state
   preferences or compensating regional leadership, European integration
   and today's European Union risk stalling or even disintegrating.},

Abstract = {Scholars employ two main measures of the executive constraints embedded
   in European Union laws: one is based on the variation in the use of
   different types of restrictions, and the second is based on the
   frequency of such use. They reflect two alternative conceptualizations
   of bureaucratic control. We label them, respectively, as the ``toolbox
   perspective{''} and the ``design perspective{''}. We illustrate that the
   constraint frequency measure poses fewer validity problems in estimating
   legislators' intent to constrain implementation and tends to produce
   less severe measurement errors. We then evaluate the performance in
   estimating constraint variation of a recent computational application
   and identify potential drawbacks of automated learning from hand-coded
   provisions. We lastly introduce a skeletal framework for a
   machine-learning approach based on the syntactic structures employed by
   legislators that could improve the performance of this innovative
   technique.},

Abstract = {In this article, we reply to `Ethics and Epistemic Injustice in the
   Global South' (), a response to the original article `Covert Qualitative
   Research as a Method to Study Human Rights Under Authoritarian Regimes'
   (). Our reply is written by authors who have expertise and direct
   experience with the issues at stake (authoritarianism, Global
   North/Global South relations, covert research methods, epistemic
   injustice). We show that while there are some interesting points raised
   in the response article, in general, it does not do justice to the
   arguments presented in the original article. Instead it constructs a
   `straw man' by misrepresenting claims in the original article,
   attributing to it assumptions that were not there, and lumping together
   notions such as authoritarian zones and Global South, that were not
   equated in the original article. After providing arguments for this
   position and discussing the main topics of the critique, we present two
   new elements: first, a contribution by someone from Moroccan controlled
   Western Sahara (MCWS), who experienced covert research as a research
   participant. Second, an overview of lessons learned from this exchange.
   These include: 1) instead of authoritarian zones, `authoritarian
   situations' is a more appropriate concept; 2) projects using covert
   research should strive to include overt and participatory elements; 3) a
   response article alleging epistemic injustice should create space for
   the people concerned to speak for themselves.},

Title = {Using a Volunteer Friends Support Scheme in a Temporary Relocation
   Programme},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE},
Year = {2023},

Pages = {581-594},

Abstract = {This article describes a voluntary Friends Scheme that sits alongside a
   temporary relocation scheme for Human Rights Defenders at the University
   of York, UK. Members of the Scheme, including the scheme's
   co-ordinators, are all volunteers drawn from the local community with a
   remit to befriend the Defenders, help orient them to the city and UK
   lifestyles and offer the opportunity to experience day-to-day life
   outside of the university. With the erosion globally of the operational
   space for Human Rights Defenders' work, many are in situations of
   serious risk to their health, well-being and even life, jeopardizing
   their long-term ability to conduct their work. This has in turn
   increased their protection needs with temporary relocation providing one
   mechanism for meeting these. The Protective Fellowship Scheme for Human
   Rights Defenders at Risk (PFS) at York offers an institutionalized
   programme and the Friends Scheme arose from the identified need for
   additional informal well-being support. In describing key aspects of its
   operation, their evolution over time, and its challenges and rewards,
   the article draws on feedback from both Defenders and Friends. It is
   brought up to date, outlining the impact of Covid-19. Experience to date
   suggests the use of a Friends Scheme can be a valuable part of temporary
   relocation programmes for Defenders, staff running such schemes, the
   volunteer Friends and the local community. The use of a systemic
   approach to its organization through having clear processes, regular
   communication from and between the co-ordinators and PFS, and providing
   individual and group support appears valuable.},

Abstract = {The Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence
   against Women and Domestic Violence, known as the Istanbul Convention or
   IC, is a contested issue in Central and Eastern Europe. This article
   investigates this matter further by focusing specifically on Bulgaria
   and Poland using the most similar systems design; the former country has
   not ratified the convention, but the latter has. In this article, we
   draw on the literature on gender politics and public policy and on law
   and society studies to refine the advocacy coalition framework and
   propose a novel perspective on (non-)ratification that accentuates the
   role of anti-gender and feminist advocacy coalitions. Specifically, this
   article links the (non-)ratification of the IC to the complex modes of
   interaction between partisan, societal, and legal actors who make up
   adversarial advocacy coalitions. This article also highlights that deep
   core beliefs widen the cultural cleavage, with the traditional being
   pitted against the feminist in this case, thereby instigating ``culture
   wars{''} in both countries.},

Abstract = {This essay adds to previous research of Putinism an investigation of the
   political thought and foreign outlooks of Russia's Secretary of the
   Security Council Nikolai Patrushev and Head of the Foreign Intelligence
   Service (SVR) Sergei Naryshkin, with a focus on their statements between
   2006 to 2020. The paper outlines Patrushev's and Naryshkin's thoughts
   regarding the United States, Ukraine, and the idea of
   multipolarity/polycentrism. We then introduce Patrushev's critique of
   liberal values and color revolutions, and Naryshkin's statements on the
   memory of World War II and Western institutions. The salience of these
   altogether seven topics is interpreted with reference to three classical
   topoi in Russian political thought: the Slavophile vs. Westerners
   controversy, the single-stream theory, and the civilizational paradigm.
   Our conclusions inform the ongoing debate on whether to conceptualize
   Putinism as either an ideology or a mentality.},

Abstract = {This article examines the emergence, spread, and potential future of
   `multistakeholderism' in global governance: A global norm specifying
   that global public problems ought to be addressed by all actors who
   affect or are affected by them. While some suggest that
   multistakeholderism may dominate twenty first century global governance,
   its origins are unclear, and its spread is limited globally.
   Furthermore, the implications of the end of Liberal International Order
   and the emergence of a `post-hegemonic' world raises questions on the
   future of multistakeholderism and global norm dynamics more broadly. To
   address these concerns, this article advances a Gramscian approach to
   norm dynamics. The empirical analysis examines the origins and uneven
   spread of the multistakehodler norm, finding that its emergence and
   varying influence in global governance are intertwined with hegemonic
   power struggles across different policy fields. We contend that dominant
   actors use multistakeholderism to assimilate recalcitrant actors while
   advancing Northern state and corporate power, yet powerful Southern
   states resist the norm. In a post-hegemonic world order, the
   internalization of multistakeholderism is highly limited, and it is
   unlikely to supplant the dominant norm of interstate multilateralism.
   Ultimately, the article concludes by reflecting on the fraught fate of
   multistakeholderism and on global norms more broadly.},

Abstract = {Principal-agent theorizing is based on the idea of a linear inverse
   relationship between principal control and agency slack: the higher the
   control over the agent, the less likely is the agent to slack. In this
   paper, we challenge this assumption by explicitly taking the varying
   nature of agents into account. While control may reduce the agent's room
   for maneuver, it does not explain the extent to which different agents
   are inclined to put efforts in circumventing these obstacles. Focusing
   on international organizations (IOs), we measure member states' as
   principals' control over IO administrations as their agents as well as
   the latter's intrinsic propensity to slack across eight major IOs. The
   analysis shows that low control by the principal is not necessarily
   associated with run-away agents, whereas high control is not necessarily
   associated with servant-like agents. The assumed control-slack
   relationship can thus be distorted and determining an ideal level of
   control is not possible without considering the agent's
   entrepreneurialism.},

Abstract = {The global COVID-19 health emergency has radically changed detention
   spaces, by heightening state and provider obligations to provide humane
   conditions and protect those detained against disease and subsequent
   ill-health. Using a socio-legal lens, this policy and practice note
   focuses broadly on the balance of European immigration detention
   regulations, and the actual conditions and treatment of immigrant
   detainees, putting an emphasis on developments before and after
   COVID-19. The special protections afforded to detainees assessed as
   vulnerable is unclear in the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and
   Regular Migration. While cognisant of aspects of legal positivism by
   outlining relevant legal provisions and extant European Court of Human
   Rights (ECtHR) jurisprudence where conditions of detention have violated
   Article 3, a socio-legal argument is presented around state obligations
   to protect the health of all immigration detainees; the challenges in
   using simplistic/categorical definitions of vulnerability; and the
   imperatives to broaden considerations to include health vulnerability in
   the context of contagion and future pandemics. By analogy extant ECtHR
   jurisprudence on the rights of prisoners relating to right to health and
   disease mitigation (human immune-deficiency, tuberculosis) may offer
   additional protections. Broad consideration of environmental health
   factors in light of threats of disease in detention spaces warrant
   further consideration when establishing the threshold of the severity of
   conditions and when assessing detainee vulnerability (not limited to
   age, gender or health status). A public health rights-based argument can
   shape effective immigration detention policy reform by enhancing
   protective parameters based on broad definitions of health vulnerability
   within immigration detention spaces.},

Abstract = {This article examines the main controversies throughout the negotiation
   of a regional binding instrument to fight racism that led to the
   approval of the `Inter-American Convention against Racism, Racial
   Discrimination, and Related Forms of Intolerance' in 2013. In order to
   identify the regimes of racism denial that shaped the process, the
   article explores the major controversies in terms of language, concepts,
   and the need for a more targeted binding treaty on racism, focusing on
   the leading role of Brazil. The analysis considers the links between
   scales; from the regional debate to States' national discourse and
   practices, within the context of global efforts to advance standards to
   fight racism, particularly those established at the third World
   Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, in Durban. By
   reviewing country reports, drafts of the convention, and analysing
   interviews with some participants of the debates at the Organization of
   the American States (OAS), this study assesses how the different
   strategies deployed served to perpetuate regimes of denial of racism,
   strongly present in the official discourse and challenged in the
   building of a binding instrument to fight racism in the Americas.
   Analysis revealed the deep challenges associated with combating racism
   as a systemic form of oppression historically linked to the region's
   colonial past and legacy of the transatlantic slave trade. Finally,
   consensus was only reached by moving away from the `Durban language',
   showing how disputed concepts and remedies highlight that racism remains
   a politically sensitive issue in the region.},

Abstract = {Kyrgyzstan was one of the last post-Soviet countries to ratify the UN
   Convention on Rights of People with Disabilities (UN CRPD) in 2019. The
   disability movement played a significant role in advocating for the
   adoption and ratification of the UN CRPD. Interviews with disability
   activists and a desk review of documents trace the trajectory of the
   disability movement in Kyrgyzstan. As post-ratification events
   demonstrate, a narrow interpretation of the Convention results in the
   misrecognition of the voices of people with disabilities, who are
   prevented from meaningful engagement and participation in the
   policymaking process. The essay cautions against equating ratification
   with recognition.},

Title = {Institutional supercycles: an evolutionary macro-finance approach},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 2},
Abstract = {We build upon the Minskyan concepts of `thwarting mechanisms' and
   `supercycles' to develop a framework for analysing the dynamic
   evolutionary interactions between macrofinancial, institutional and
   political processes. Thwarting mechanisms are institutional structures
   that aim to stabilise the macrofinancial system. The effectiveness of
   these structures changes over time as a result of profit-seeking
   innovations and long-run destabilising processes. New institutional
   structures emerge in response, influenced by political and ideological
   conflicts. This generates a secular cyclical pattern in capitalism, the
   `supercycle', with a longer duration than standard business and
   financial cycles. To illustrate this, we develop a macrofinancial
   stability index which we use to identify two supercycles in the G7
   countries in the post-war period. We label these the industrial
   capitalism supercycle and the financial globalisation supercycle. For
   each, we apply a four-phase classification system, based on the
   effectiveness of institutions, customs and political structures for
   stabilising the macrofinancial system. The supercycles framework can be
   used to explain and anticipate macro financial and thus political
   developments, and moves beyond approaches in which these developments
   are treated as exogenous shocks.},

   neoliberal resilience in Denmark},
Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 31},
Abstract = {Scholars have attributed the resilience of the neoliberal policy
   paradigm to external pressure on governments by giant corporations and
   to features of the neoliberal idea itself. This article proposes a
   different explanation based on the political influence of the economic
   models that governments use for policy planning. I develop a theoretical
   perspective to capture how economic models, rather than being mere
   analytical tools, are policy tools with an overt objective function and
   a covert political function. To illustrate the value of the theory, I
   use a qualitative case-study approach to analyse how politicians in the
   aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis used economic models before and
   during the 2011-2015 Social Democratic Thorning-Schmidt government in
   Denmark. I show how the Danish Finance Ministry's model worked as a
   weapon, a game board and a shield to discredit certain policies while
   promoting other policies, and in the process contributing to neoliberal
   resilience.},

Abstract = {Focusing on 23 greening measures, this paper systematically compares the
   greening efforts of the busiest container and cargo ports in the United
   States (US) and the European Union (EU). We move beyond accounts for
   general environmental differences between the EU and the US to examine
   how specific environmental decisions are shaped by the effects of
   regulatory characteristics in each region. We identify systematic
   variation in number and type of port greening measures adopted in the
   two regions. We demonstrate that differences in the number and type of
   measures adopted reflect the level of policy making with local policy
   making playing a more important role in the US compared to the EU, thus
   proposing a pathway through which the form of regulatory approach could
   influence content and extent of regulation. The EU adopts regulation
   that is broader in scope while US ports are more likely to address
   problems affecting local populations.},

Abstract = {This chapter investigates the performative role of language in the total
   struggle to control the land of Palestine before and after the Nakba in
   1948. While the pivotal role assumed by the non-military tools was
   instrumental in the construction of hegemony over space and the
   socio-political reconstruction of geography, it was rarely highlighted
   in favor of the military conflict. As the dynamics of struggle shifted,
   the dynamics and instrumentality of language and the politics of space
   shifted as well. In order to highlight the relevance of language, the
   chapter addresses the theoretical and practical dimensions of both the
   politics of space and the spatiality of politics in the Arab Israeli
   struggle. What is new in this paper is that from inscription on currency
   to naming streets, towns, cities, and even the country as a whole,
   language not only served the political agenda of the various contenders
   but that its historical language is essential to conceptualize the
   nature and essence of the struggle, thus illuminating the failure to
   reach any compromise. Ultimately, the function of the social space is
   not independent from class contradictions.},

Abstract = {Preparing young people for citizenship requires significant change in
   our public schools, including a commitment to preparation of the
   education workforce for today's diverse learners and paying more
   attention to culture and identity in what is taught. Schools should be
   designed and organized in ways that help students understand the
   obligations that members of a society owe one another. Policy can be an
   important lever in promoting changes that foster civic reasoning and
   engagement: curriculum policies can support civic reasoning and
   discourse within and across subject areas, assessments can support civic
   reasoning through competency-based approaches, and well-designed
   graduation requirements can reinforce attention to civic learning. This
   article describes various frameworks to guide policy development, each
   with the potential to prepare young people more fully for citizenship.},

Booktitle = {LANGUAGE, SOCIETY AND THE STATE IN A CHANGING WORLD},
Year = {2023},
Pages = {273-291},
Abstract = {Magahi is a language with a glorious past, a subdued intermediate
   period, a vigorous present, and a promising future. It is the language
   of the people of Magah, formerly known as Magadha which emerged as a
   small kingdom around its capital Girivraja (now Rajgir) in central
   Bihar. Magadha gradually expanded to be one of the world's largest
   empires of the time (third to fourth century BC), extending from the Bay
   of Bengal in the east to the Hindukush Mountains and Afghanistan in the
   northwest, and the River Cavery in the south. Subsequently, Magah
   reduced to its present form between River Ganga in the North, River Sone
   in the west, the escarpment of the Chhotanagpur Plateau (of Jharkhand
   State) in the south, and the Kharagpur Hills in the east. Magahi, in its
   older form, expanded as the official language of the empire (though not
   as the spoken language) as is evident from the presence of Ashokan rock
   edicts over the territory.
   Contemporary Magahi is now confined more or less to the original Magah.
   This Magahi is believed to have evolved from Vedic Sanskrit following
   the path: Sanskrit<Prakrit<Magadhi Prakrit<Magadhi Apbhransh<Ancient
   Magahi<Modern Magahi. Siddha period (eighth to twelfth century AD), the
   period of Vajrayani Buddhist poets, is considered as the golden period
   of Magahi literature and Sarahapa as the first Magahi poet. The
   following period (twelfth to sixteenth century) is considered the Dark
   Period as no significant literary work was done during the period for
   several religious and political reasons. However, the Vedic tradition of
   oral creation and transmission of thoughts and feelings continued
   throughout the period. These are now being collected for preservation.
   The real regeneration of literary activities started with India gaining
   Independence in 1947. Organizations were formed, agitations were
   initiated, and communication activities were encouraged in the form of
   publishing books and journals, making films, and indulging with
   electronic media. The result is that Magahi is now being taught in
   schools, colleges, and universities. Magahi has been granted the status
   of second official language in Jharkhand State and the Government of
   Bihar has recommended to the Central Government for it to be included in
   the 8th Schedule of Indian Constitution.},

Abstract = {This paper draws on Critical Political Economy (CPE) to explore energy
   transitions in Mexico. It analyzes struggles over competing energy
   visions from a decolonial, spatial and post-development perspective. The
   article frames energy transformations as more than a move away from
   fossil fuels: They encompass a radical overhaul of universalized
   Eurocentric capitalist modernity that call the state's role as both
   facilitator and driver of the energy transition into question. I examine
   two low-carbon infrastructure projects in the state of Yucatan, Mexico
   to build on Bridge and Gailing's notion of new energy spaces as the
   sites, scales and spatialities through which broader questions of
   political economy and contemporary struggles are being worked out. CPE
   of the energy transition must ensure that low-carbon infrastructures are
   not deployed as new forms of extraction, but rather as the material
   basis of pluriversal transitions informed by affected communities and
   their territorial struggles. Both studies on the political economy of
   energy transitions and territorial struggles can benefit from an open
   dialogue about how socioecological transformations are imagined,
   designed and implemented.},

Abstract = {This essay explores `territories of accelerated development' (TORs) to
   reconstruct the economic policy-making, development institutions and
   macroeconomic framework of late Putinism since the 2010s. It argues that
   even with Russia's integration into the world economy and the
   developmental rhetoric of state elites, TORs and the national
   developmental regime around them reproduce the patronal management and
   recycling of rents rather than the transformative and state-permeated
   facilitation of productive investments and capitalist profits. This
   upscaling of rents has been systemic. The result-rentierism-challenges
   common understandings of rent-seeking and commodity rents as incidental
   features of Russian `state capitalism', and, instead places them at the
   centre of a non-capitalist order of its own.},

Abstract = {Theories of recognition often acknowledge that some forms of recognition
   can be ideological. Only recently have authors also begun to ask whether
   all ideological phenomena involve a more basic form of misrecognition of
   epistemic agents. I argue that an expressivist reconstruction of the
   Marxian theory of ideology can help us to understand what forms of
   misrecognition are involved in ideology. According to this
   understanding, ideological discourses reflect the rules of hierarchical
   social practices and impose limits on the capacity of subjects to
   challenge dominant conceptual distinctions. While rational epistemic
   subjects will tend to experience such limits as misrecognition, this
   does not require any negative interpersonal attitudes on the part of
   others. Therefore, at least some forms of ideology involve primarily
   structural, rather than interpersonal, misrecognition. I argue that
   ideologies that persist without involving widespread false beliefs can
   best be understood in this way and that neoliberalism is a paradigmatic
   example of such an ideology.},

Abstract = {This article investigates refugees' labour to gain inclusion within the
   `host' community, drawing on interviews with male Afghan former
   interpreters employed by Western armies. It makes an empirical
   contribution by centring them as active agents rather than as passive
   tropes in the racialised and gendered discourses of the `War on Terror'
   and Western migration policies. It offers a synthesis between concepts
   from three fields: migration as translation, migrant masculinities and
   the battleground of conditional inclusion. By focusing on migrants' self
   translations in dialogue with translations of their bodies and stories
   by host-country institutions, I trace three strategies: insertion,
   subversion and exemption. While Afghan interpreters largely fail to be
   recognised as needing protection from harm, their insertion and
   subversion of discourses of protection based on service are more
   successful. Finally, they counter their interpellation as dangerous
   bodies with a strategy of exemption that can be momentarily successful
   but remains ultimately precarious.},

Abstract = {This research examined the effects of the Russian-Ukrainian war on
   identity changes among educated Ukraine-born women who have lived their
   adult lives in Israel. The data, collected in July 2022, were determined
   to be representative of educated women aged 25-60 who emigrated from
   Ukraine during 1988-2018. Findings revealed a strengthened Ukrainian
   identity in over half of the respondents. The Ukrainian-born Israelis,
   who held a hybrid Russian-Israeli identity, strengthened their Ukrainian
   identity. However, this strengthening was not uniform. It was associated
   with (a) frequency of exposure to Ukrainian news and social media that
   support the Ukrainian government; (b) attitudes toward the
   Russian-Ukrainian war; (c) the presence of the war in daily life; and
   (d) the geo-political place of origin in Ukraine. The study underscores
   the importance of researching identity shifts in people indirectly
   affected by crises in today's information-rich age.},

Abstract = {Child poverty fell to historic lows in 2021, in large part due to the
   temporary expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC). We consider the
   possible implications of this expansion on children's short- and
   long-term development. To do so, we review the available short-run
   evidence from the 2021 expansion and the existing research evidence on
   the longer-run effects of similar income transfers in childhood on child
   health and human capital. We conclude that the CTC likely improved child
   health and well-being in the short and long run, with greater impacts
   for poor children and modest or nonexistent effects for nonpoor
   children. Moreover, the effects might be more substantial for younger
   children and for those in places with weaker safety nets.},

Abstract = {Critical political economy analyses have principally conceptualised
   platforms as unproductive economic forms (rentier capital) skimming
   value off each intermediated transaction and/or illegitimately
   extracting and capitalizing user data. This scholarship has also focused
   heavily on extractive dimensions of global North platforms' operations
   within the global South. However, a small but growing literature is
   examining the productive aspects of digital platforms, while important
   digital platforms are emerging in Southern economies. These trends draw
   attention to the prospect of platforms playing a role in leapfrog
   development. This article examines digital trucking platforms in two
   major economies of the global South: Brazil and China. We argue that
   trucking platforms are engendering dramatic transformations of these
   countries' disorganised road transport logistics systems. Platforms are
   centralising investment and co-ordinating control. Utilising
   technologies which surpass those deployed in the global North, they
   rationalise disorganised and inefficient transport systems by subjecting
   them to algorithmic rule and minimising bureaucratic inefficiencies.
   Through greater centralisation, co-ordination and rationalisation,
   trucking platforms further serve to proletarianize their owner-operator
   workforces, driving down costs and eliminating barriers to the
   geographical circulation of capital. While this offers some benefits to
   workers, it also exposes them to the vagaries of market discipline in
   new ways.},

Abstract = {Under military rule (1973-1990), Chile embarked upon several top-secret
   chemical and biological weapons (CBW) programmes. `Project ANDREA' and
   the development of sarin is the best known, although other programmes
   have also been reported. However, these programmes remain poorly
   understood - particularly in English language sources. To resolve this,
   this paper draws upon local-language reporting, Cold War histories and
   other sources to provide insight into the histories, key personalities,
   and evolution of Chile's historical CBW programmes. This paper
   contributes to wider literature on Chile's dictatorship, but also
   literature on CBW-proliferation, which remains confined to a relatively
   small set of case studies.},

Abstract = {After the split amongst Russian nationalists in 2014 over their approach
   to events in Ukraine, many of them had to leave Russia to avoid
   repression. Some travelled to Ukraine to support the Ukrainians in their
   fight against pro-Russian rebel proxies. How do these Russian
   nationalists legitimise their fight against Putin's regime and the
   Russian state? This article argues that their refusal to accept the
   legitimacy of the Russian state and their linking of Putin's
   authoritarian regime to Soviet totalitarianism allow them to legitimise
   their oppositional political activities, including their involvement in
   the conflict on the Ukrainian side up to and including the February 2022
   invasion of Ukraine by Russia.},

Title = {From `I' to `we': an exploration of how theories of cooperation might
   inform policymaking around sustainable travel behaviour},
Journal = {GLOBAL DISCOURSE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3-4, SI},
Pages = {243-264},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article considers how theories of social cooperation might be
   helpful in developing policy levers for changing travel behaviours
   towards environmentally beneficial outcomes, especially in reducing
   private car use. `Theories of cooperation' can be described as a shift
   away from a `traditional' economic focus on selfish individuals to one
   where individuals care what those around them are doing and even
   sometimes identify with, and think as, groups. We use a simplified
   `game' to show how game theory offers a very constrained backdrop to
   thinking about cooperation in a transport setting: it neglects important
   social factors, both strategic ones and the general social interactions
   and ease that may be required as a backdrop to cooperation in real life.
   We then apply this to `use cases' (lift sharing, on-site travel
   planning, safe cycle storage and peer-to-peer information sharing) that
   bridge the gap between the abstractions of theories of cooperation, on
   the one hand, and the practicalities of policymaking and lived reality,
   on the other. In doing this, we show how cooperation in travel behaviour
   can develop in two different ways: as emergent social phenomena (for
   example, the informal economy approach to car or bicycle repair) and
   purposeful policy initiatives (for example, rail-fare discounts for two
   people travelling together, such as the UK's `two together' railcard).
   Somewhat reductively, these could be described as `bottom-up' and
   `top-down' elements within behaviour-change processes. The article shows
   that: (1) cooperation exists `naturally' in the `travel-behaviour policy
   space'; (2) there is a wealth of opportunities for policy to help make
   cooperation happen more and/or work better; and (3) this includes
   opportunities to create the conditions required for cooperation to exist
   and flourish.},

Abstract = {This article asks how antitrust can foster innovation by examining the
   development of infrastructure for data processing in the cloud. We
   contrast Amazon Web Services' centralized model with Google Cloud
   Platform's more decentralized, participatory ecosystem. We argue that
   rather than trying to reduce the power imbalance between platforms and
   independent database companies, antitrust should seek to channel
   platforms from the centralized model toward the decentralized ecosystem
   by (1) making partnership more attractive than mergers and (2) enlisting
   open-source foundations to help manage interoperability in the cloud.
   This requires breaking down the silos between competition, technology,
   and industrial policy.},

Abstract = {Can focusing on gender help us to better understand the mobilization
   capacity of jihadi insurgent groups and their social roots in the Sahel?
   A growing literature has explored the factors that motivate people to
   join such groups in Africa. The Sahel provides a salient case, but the
   prevalent focus on agent-based explanations has tended to overlook the
   role of gender relations and constructions. This article explores the
   potential of practice theory to shed light on intersubjective rules,
   roles, and meanings and whether and how gender influences jihadi
   mobilization in the Sahel. The study contributes to the feminist
   security studies literature by looking at gender relations and
   investigating whether it is the reassertion (practice homology) or
   emerging misalignment (practice hysteresis) of Fulani gender practices
   that best characterizes the acceptance and/or rejection of jihadi
   governance by men and women in the Sahel. The article discusses
   empirical evidence collected during extensive fieldwork in Mali and
   Niger. We suggest that in strategically choosing to either reproduce or
   reshape traditional gender practices, jihadi insurgencies linked to
   Islamic State and al-Qaeda in the Fulani milieu of the central Sahel
   gain popular support.},

Title = {The instability of the nuclear nonproliferation regime complex},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {JUL 18},
Abstract = {This article theorizes path-dependent changes in the institutional
   architecture of the nuclear nonproliferation regime complex; it analyses
   the effects of different regime-complex structures on institutional
   contestation and policy adjustment. I first offer a general theory of
   how the preexisting institutional structures of international regime
   complexes (IRCs) facilitate and constrain subsequent institutional
   developments in ways that make IRCs prone to endogenous, path-dependent
   change. Next, I illustrate how strategies of regime shifting and rival
   regime creation in the nuclear nonproliferation complex have triggered
   path-dependent `reactive sequencing', resulting in growing institutional
   fragmentation. To illustrate endogenous dynamics of IRC evolution, I
   examine the nuclear nonproliferation complex at three `critical
   junctures': The mid-1970s, the end of the Cold War, and the early-2000s.
   During each period, exogenous proliferation shocks interacted with
   pre-existing institutional structures to produce specific patterns of
   contestation which set in motion a reactive sequence of growing
   institutional fragmentation. My argument has relevance for global
   economic governance broadly and for the growing IPE literature which
   explores reactive sequencing and institutional decay in global
   governance institutions.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the practice of Covid-related bank regulatory
   forbearance measures of eight East-Central European Union member states
   from the perspective of differentiated integration. In line with the
   integration-deepening nature of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, our
   expectation was that countries within the Banking Union (BU) would
   impose harmonized forbearance measures, while non-BU members would use
   more discretional measures. Indeed, the practice of forbearance measures
   is significantly more harmonized within the BU than outside; however,
   there were also notable differences in the practice of BU members. For
   non-BU member states, our expectation was that countries with the
   intention of favouring their domestic financial system would ease
   regulatory requirements more, while those that wanted to place the
   burden of the pandemic on foreign banks would ease these requirements
   less. However, the analysis only partially confirmed this expectation.},

Abstract = {Studies examining the gendered impacts of COVID-19 have shown that women
   have been disproportionately impacted by the socio-economic effects of
   the pandemic across multiple areas, including economic and food
   security. We sought to understand how the impacts of the pandemic on
   women's food security in the Indo-Pacific region were influenced by
   women's roles in performing the bulk of unpaid work and care involved in
   social reproduction. We interviewed 183 female farmers and vendors
   (market stallholders) in Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines.
   We found that across all three countries examined, women described an
   impact on their food security as well as their labour, processes of
   reproduction, and private household dynamics. Women's household food
   security was impacted because of decreased income, increased business
   costs, rising food costs, and additional household costs. Further, our
   findings show that because it was typically women's responsibility to
   manage household food security, women were anticipating food shortages
   and engaging in risks to mitigate against food insecurity. These
   findings demonstrate the urgent need to introduce national and
   international crisis response measures that differentiate the gendered
   social and economic impacts of crises that centers, rather than
   marginalizes, social reproduction in analyses.},

Abstract = {Is oppositional behaviour in legislatures gendered? Despite a growing
   literature on gender and legislative behaviour, there is a conspicuous
   absence of research on differences between female and male members of
   parliament (MPs) when it comes to one of the key aspects of
   parliamentary debates: the voicing of opposition. This article connects
   the literature on gender and legislative behaviour with opposition
   scholarship. We examine the role of gender for oppositional behaviour in
   four legislatures with a focus on debates concerning European Union
   affairs. Our results show that female MPs generally are equally likely
   to express opposition as their male colleagues. This result, however, is
   conditioned by government status. Whilst there is no significant
   difference between the proportion of opposition expressed by female and
   male MPs from opposition parties, we find that male MPs representing
   government parties express more than twice as much opposition as their
   female colleagues.},

Abstract = {In the fallout of the 2008 crisis, macroprudential policy has been
   installed as the policy remedy against future financial instability, a
   primary focus being developments in the real estate sector. With house
   prices consistently rising in the EU since 2014, causing alarm among
   macroprudential supervisory bodies, a core question of EU regulatory
   governance is how far macroprudential bodies have been capable of
   bringing about countercyclical actions against the build-up of such
   vulnerabilities. This paper investigates this question using a novel
   dataset of macroprudential intensity coded for the 17 EU countries that
   experienced real estate vulnerabilities post-euro crisis. Specifically,
   it asks which configuration of conditions account for the (in)capacity
   of countries to impose stringent countercyclical regulations against
   housing booms? Using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis technics
   coupled with qualitative analysis of country cases using expert
   interviews, we find that the absence of political salience of
   homeownership and the political independence of macroprudential
   authorities to be crucial conditions that jointly explain
   countercyclical macroprudential activity. These findings, which show two
   pathways to action have implications for the capacity of the EU to
   prevent future crises and future reform of the EU prudential framework.},

Abstract = {This paper is a study of 14 media houses in Malawi and it looks at
   coverage of human rights issue from various dimensions. A questionnaire
   was administered to journalists of diverse levels at these media houses
   to gather data concerning the research. The targeted media houses are
   located in the main urban centres of Malawi and include radio,
   television and newspaper publishers. The findings indicate that
   training, lack of specialised units in newsrooms, inadequate reference
   materials and reluctance by officials to give out required information
   are some of the issues that are hampering coverage of human rights
   stories in the country. The paper also looks at suggestions made by
   journalists to help improve reportage of human rights in Malawi. It then
   makes recommendations based on evidence gathered through the
   questionnaires on how the media and other concerned stakeholders can
   work together for better human rights reporting in the country.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {28},
Number = {6},
Pages = {925-941},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {This article relates to debates about dependency of countries in the
   global political economy. It conceptualises dependency by drawing on the
   concept of `mechanisms of dependency', and builds a synergy with the
   Comparative Capitalisms (CC) literature (i.e. institutional and
   third-generation perspectives). The article expands the Varieties of
   Capitalism (VoC) framework by applying the established category of
   Dependent Market Economy to Greece. Building on financialisation as a
   mechanism of dependency, the article argues this locked Greece into
   reliance on external debt, dependent position within the Eurozone, as
   well as vulnerable situation after reforms demanded by the creditors
   were implemented. However, due to internal historical-structural issues
   with its capitalist model, Greece was unable to minimise the negative
   impact of financialised dependence, and is internally weakly prepared to
   escape from its peripheral status in the future if external dependence
   will be removed. The article argues that conceptual synergy between
   dependency theory and the CC literature is desirable in order to provide
   a more holistic account of interaction between external and internal
   factors in the context of dependent capitalist varieties.},

Abstract = {This article offers a definition of media policy and, through a
   discussion of specific areas of public policy, describes the scope of
   media policy as an area of potential government intervention. I argue
   for a more expansive conceptualization of media policy than has
   typically guided the work of 21st-century media policymakers. I also
   argue that there has been a troubling tendency to apply a technology
   policy framework to contexts that would be better served by a media
   policy analytical framework. The result has been a neglect of core media
   policy principles that are focused on cultivating an informed citizenry
   and ensuring that communities' information needs are being met.},

Abstract = {This article considers the public communication challenges that health
   officials in rural America faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. I analyze
   the role that public health officials played in communicating news and
   information about the pandemic in 29 rural counties in Illinois. These
   officials were challenged by a diminished reporting capacity among local
   media outlets, and by a political radicalization of local Republicans,
   who no longer regarded local media as trusted nodes in local
   storytelling networks. I find that while public health officials can
   help fill a community's critical information needs about risk and
   emergency, the public's take-up of this information depends on
   sociocultural and political forces that shape the broader communication
   context.},

Abstract = {The right to the truth is often mentioned in conjunction with missing
   persons cases and is recognized for its propensity to function as an
   enabling right, helping victims and families to claim their rights.
   While families, survivors, communities, specialist agencies, NGOs and
   international organizations readily invoke the right to the truth, the
   terminology used in the context can be ambiguous, overlapping,
   mandate-driven or strategic. This contribution reflects on the
   applicable legal spheres, use of approaches and practices in the context
   of missing persons investigations and claims made towards the
   realization of the right to the truth. The article clarifies the legal
   landscape to underscore what is meant by the right to the truth and how
   it may function as the starting point for the realization of other
   rights in the context of missing persons. Further, it examines and
   dissects conceptualizations of missing persons and resolution efforts;
   and identifies what actions help realize the right to the truth and to
   what extent. It argues the merits of a broad definition of missing
   persons while urging those engaged in solving missing persons cases to
   be candid in respect of the truth-seeking aspect they may be able to
   advance. This is by no means a trivial inquiry, for families of the
   missing rely on the assistance of the law and relevant agencies to
   further the realization of their right to the truth.},

Abstract = {This introductory article conceptualizes the notion of third country
   influence on European Union (EU) law and policy and proposes an
   analytical framework theorizing the venues and means through which third
   countries may gain such impact, under what conditions and with which
   implications for the EU's legal and political order. The article first
   introduces the focus on outside-in influence in the context of European
   studies, generally, and EU privileged third country relations,
   specifically. Thereafter, an analytical framework is developed for
   mapping and explaining the outside-in dynamics on EU law and
   policy-making differentiating between diplomatic, governance and
   discursive venues; coercive versus technocratic and normative mechanisms
   of influence; and the legal constraints and political implications of
   these processes. Turning to the potential determinants of these
   occurrences, the article then proposes a set of hypotheses for
   conditions under which third countries can influence EU law and
   policies, before summarizing the individual contributions to this
   Special Issue.},

Abstract = {The present contribution aims to highlight the need for a revision of
   the cultural heritage protection system, into a context defined by the
   inflation of protected buildings that jeopardizes the effectiveness of
   the traditional model (excessively centralized by each regional
   administration, and which presents the City Councils as collaborating
   entities fully subject to intense external tutelage). The recognition of
   larger spaces for local autonomy in this area can provide not only a
   more effective and agile protection system, but also one that is more
   coherent and coordinated with the leading role to be played by local
   authorities in urban planning matters (particularly concerning the
   authorization and control of interventions). A close analysis of the
   evolution of the various cultural heritage acts in force (where the LPHE
   model has had a great influence) reveals a certain resistance to
   abandoning centralized protection systems. It is possible, however, to
   identify specific regional experiences in the opposite direction, as
   well as recent contributions that are determined to take a more decisive
   step in favor of a wider decentralization of competences to the local
   level.},

Abstract = {Group coordinators have a key role in shaping coherent policy agendas in
   European Parliament (EP) committees and in building consensus about the
   party line among the group's specialists. They also yield considerable
   discretion and influence legislative outcomes through their selection of
   rapporteurs. This article builds and expands on previous research to
   analyse longitudinally the determinants of group coordinator selection.
   The EP's gradual empowerment to co-legislator status has arguably
   increased the stakes of selecting competent group coordinators. Drawing
   on a unique dataset that includes all party group coordinators of the
   European People's Party in seven terms of the EP (1984-2019), the
   article shows that committee incumbency, coordinator seniority and, to a
   lesser extent, ideological proximity to the committee contingent
   influence who becomes a coordinator. The results are robust to
   replication of analyses on a sample of Socialists and Democrats Members
   of the European Parliament and to controlling for several factors
   associated with partisan and distributive theories of committee
   organisation.},

Abstract = {Women's access to political leadership positions has increased greatly
   in recent decades, which calls for research concerning the conditions of
   women's political leadership in more gender-balanced contexts. This
   article responds to this need by exploring the leadership ideals,
   evaluations, and treatment of men and women leaders in the numerically
   gender-equal Swedish parliament (the Riksdag). Drawing on interviews
   with almost all the current top political leaders in the Swedish
   parliament, along with an original survey of Swedish members of
   parliament, we reveal a mainly feminine-coded parliamentary leadership
   ideal that should be more appropriate for women leaders. Masculine
   practices remain, however, and women leaders continue to be
   disadvantaged. To explain this anomaly between ideals and practices, we
   argue that a feminist institutionalist perspective, which emphasizes how
   gender shapes a given context in multiple ways, contributes to a more
   comprehensive understanding of the conditions for women's political
   leadership than that provided by the widely employed role congruity
   theory.},

Title = {Methods Regimes in Global Governance: The Politics of Evidence-Making in
   Global Health},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {This article opens up the blackbox through which evidence is selected
   and assessed in the making of guidelines and recommendations in global
   governance, through an exploration of ``methods regimes.{''} Methods
   regimes are a special kind of sociomaterial arrangement, which govern
   the production and validation of knowledge, by establishing a clear
   hierachy between alternative forms of research designs. When such
   regimes become inscribed in processes of global governance, they shape
   and control what knowledge is deemed valid and thus relevant for policy.
   We shed light that through a mode of operation that relies on a
   discourse of procedurality, a dispersed but powerful network of
   epistemic operators, and a dense web of infrastructures, methods regimes
   constitute and police the making of ``policy-relevant knowledge{''} in
   global governance. Through an examination of the case of ``GRADE{''}
   (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation), a
   standardized system that evaluates and grades the quality of evidence in
   global health, we show that its dominance has worked to the effect of
   empowering a new cast of methodologists, seen as more objective and
   portable across domains, sidelining certain forms of evidence that do
   not conform with its own methodological criteria of scientificity, and
   ``clinicalizing{''} research in medicine and beyond.},

Abstract = {In 2016, the Sri Lanka Parliament passed the Office on Missing Persons
   Act (OMP) `to search for and trace missing persons.' At the time,
   Sinhala Buddhist nationalist leaders strongly objected to it. In this
   article, I read their resistance as resistance to a truth-seeking
   mechanism. Locating my analysis within a global paradigm of `dealing
   with the past' through truth-seeking that assumes that `truth is easier
   than justice,' I show that nationalist resistance to the OMP flies in
   the face of this assumption. In postwar Sri Lanka, truth is not just a
   second-best option to justice but an equally radical demand. However, I
   also show that those same resistors have maintained the OMP on returning
   to power for several different reasons. Finally, I explore the response
   of relatives of the disappeared to the OMP and their increasing demand
   for an international truth and justice mechanism.},

   Commission to Negotiate Peace looks at Russia, 1919},

Abstract = {The United States found itself relatively unprepared to participate in
   the World War I peace conference that convened in Paris in January 1919.
   President Woodrow Wilson began American preparations for the peace
   conference in mid-1917, when he established `The Inquiry' to provide
   background and policy papers for use at the negotiating table. Once the
   conference began, however, the American peace commissioners realized
   they required more current information to support their work. To
   supplement the information provided by the Department of State, the
   American Commission to Negotiate Peace established its own sources. In
   addition to participating in a number of inter-allied investigatory
   missions established by the conferees, the Americans sent twelve field
   missions of their own to various places in Europe and Asia Minor to
   collect information. Three of those field missions targeted Russia. The
   results of those missions were mixed. This article discusses the origins
   of the Commission's little-known field mission program and describes the
   work and activities of the three missions into Russian territory. In

Abstract = {In this article, I examine social media output from three of the largest
   arms manufacturers (by profit): Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and
   Raytheon, all based in the United States. I ask: how, if at all, are
   women represented? What do these representations do? To answer these
   questions, I examine all of the tweets sent by these manufacturers over
   a three-month period and find that the Twitter content (1) normalizes
   women within the company context, (2) presents the companies as
   empowering and inspiring, and (3) shows the companies to be places for
   individual women to succeed. Central to all of these representations is
   intersectionality, with the companies depicting women of color
   frequently, especially Black women. I argue that the social media output
   of arms manufacturers helps to ``make possible{''} the arms trade by
   presenting these companies as neoliberal, multicultural feminist beacons
   of social progress, rendering ambivalent criticisms about the suffering
   inflicted by their products.},

Abstract = {This article presents an investigation into the lives and lived
   experiences of women who joined politics through quotas. In particular,
   it explores the transformative potential of a quota policy through the
   `subject position' of women politicians in Nepal, especially those who
   had no prior background in politics before being elected to their first
   political positions. Using Bourdieu's theory of capital, I reveal how
   political quotas have strengthened women's overall capital, allowing
   them to improve their position in both their families and society.
   Quotas have created new roles for women. The power and prestige attached
   to these new roles have not only offered some immediate changes to these
   women's lives, but also led to changing perceptions of women in
   politics, shifting the discourse from a view of women's participation in
   politics as an exception to one of it as an entitlement. This article is
   based on a qualitative study carried out with women politicians in
   Nepal.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates how natural language processing (NLP) can be
   used by intelligence practitioners and scholars to analyse text. Using
   decades of unredacted East Pakistani intelligence reports declassified
   and released by the Government of Bangladesh, the article shows how
   machine learning can provide insight into intelligence documents. In
   particular, it provides a case study for how NLP can provide
   quantitative analysis that complements the work of qualitative analysis.
   Simultaneously, this article also demonstrates how NLP can provide
   historians with a quantitative methodology to better understand
   historical government records.},

Abstract = {Human Rights Education (HRE) has been recognized by scholars as crucial
   and critical for the construction of a universal culture of human
   rights. This recognition stems from the fact that HRE enables the
   building of capacity and responsiveness of professionals in terms of
   shaping their skills through the acquisition of the requisite knowledge,
   attitude, skills and practices of international human rights standards
   that relate to their work. Drawing on in-depth interviews and focus
   group discussions, this article explores police officers' knowledge and
   practice of international human rights standards that relate to policing
   from a conveniently selected 48 groups of police officers from eight
   randomly selected regions out of the 16 regions of Ghana. The findings
   revealed that, although HRE constitutes part of the Ghana Police Service
   training curriculum, a large number of the officer-participants indicate
   inadequate understanding and practice of these relevant Human Rights
   Standards. Prudent HRE-oriented policies concerning Ghana police
   training are recommended.},

   illustrates that the electoral behaviour of the Kyrgyzstani diaspora is

Abstract = {Do representatives of member states in Geneva and officials based in
   capitals agree on priorities for cooperation in the World Trade
   Organization? Exploiting an original survey of trade policy officials,
   we find that respondents representing their countries in Geneva often
   accord substantially different priorities to institutional reform and
   policy issues than officials based in capitals. We hypothesize that this
   `Geneva effect' reflects bureaucratic capacity in capitals and autonomy
   of Geneva-based officials, and that the effect should be smaller for
   officials from OECD member states, given extensive interaction outside
   the WTO to define good regulatory policies and address trade issues of
   common concern. Empirical analysis supports these hypotheses but also
   reveals differences in prioritization between Geneva and capital-based
   officials from OECD countries for specific issues. The results suggest
   that the prospects of international cooperation may be influenced not
   only by well-understood differences between states that reflect material
   interests and domestic political economy drivers, but by differences in
   relative priorities accorded to issues by officials representing states
   in international organizations and officials based in capitals.},

Abstract = {Elected women can inspire other women to emerge as candidates, but
   little research has explored how individual women respond to political
   role models. Psychology scholarship suggests two factors important to
   role model influence on career decisions (like candidate emergence).
   First, role models affect behavior when they seem attainable. Second,
   motivation is dependent upon a sense of belonging in the social context,
   which role models may bolster. Because women are underrepresented in
   politics, a role model may only contribute to political ambition when
   they project a realistic path for success and inspire a sense of
   belonging. We test how role model attainability influences women's
   political ambition through this need to belong, finding attainable role
   models (ARMs) compared to high-achieving role models (HARMs) are more
   likely to inspire women's political ambition. These effects are mediated
   by the belonging inspired by role models, which is moderated by how
   competitive the aspirants are.},

Title = {Multilateralism and the Global Co-Responsibility of Care in Times of a
   Pandemic: The Legal Duty to Cooperate},
Journal = {ETHICS \& INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {206-231},
Abstract = {This article challenges the orthodox view of international law,
   according to which states have no legal duty to cooperate. It argues for
   this legal duty in the context of COVID-19, based on the ethical
   principles of solidarity, stewardship, and subsidiarity. More
   specifically, the article argues that states have a legal duty to
   cooperate during a pandemic (as solidarity requires); and while this
   duty entails an extraterritorial responsibility to care for and assist
   other nations (as stewardship requires), the legal duty to cooperate
   still allows states to attend first to the basic needs of those under
   their own jurisdiction-namely, fellow nationals and residents (as
   subsidiarity requires). The article provides a definition and
   philosophical justifications for this legal duty that are lacking in the
   literature by examining its application to a current COVID-19
   controversy: namely, states' responsibility to assist other countries in
   greater need by, inter alia, exporting at a discount or donating scarce
   COVID-19 treatments (including vaccines). In providing a principled
   tripartite account of pandemic governance, this conceptual and normative
   article offers a new lens for debating the potential international
   treaty for pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response that has now
   been drafted and is under negotiation at the World Health Assembly, by
   responding to the recent backlash against multilateralism by
   substantiating global co-responsibilities in times of pandemics and
   beyond.},

Abstract = {This essay starts by accepting Cecile Fabre's argument in her book
   Spying through a Glass Darkly that intelligence work, including using
   incentives and pressures to encourage betrayal and treason, can be
   morally justified based on the criteria of necessity, effectiveness, and
   proportionality. However, while assessments of spying tend to be based
   on Cold War notions, I explore it here in the messier reality of
   counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and ``new wars.{''} In addition, I
   suggest a methodological expansion: adding a sociological perspective to
   the ethical discussion by exploring the wider effects on society, over
   longer periods, of the operation of informers. Based on these shifts in
   perspective and context, I identify additional social harms generated by
   espionage that should lead to a more restrictive view of ethical
   espionage than the one emerging from Fabre's work. I argue that many of
   these social harms are created by the mass recruitment of informers, in
   asymmetrical conflicts where governments have leverage over suspected
   communities, and given the (often mistaken) belief that everyone
   recruited to act as informer is an ``asset,{''} primarily providing
   advantages. I argue, therefore, that the decisive issue is one of scale:
   many of the ethical problems created by espionage in these contexts
   result from the widespread systematic recruitment of informers, while
   small-scale, targeted, ad-hoc recruitment can more easily avoid such
   problems.},

Abstract = {Satellite images can be a powerful source of data for analyses of
   conflict dynamics and social movements, but sociology has been slow to
   develop methods and metadata standards for transforming those images
   into data. We ask: How can satellite images become useful data? What are
   the key methodological and ethical considerations for incorporating
   high-resolution satellite images into conflict research? Why are
   metadata important in this work? We begin with a review of recent
   developments in satellite-based social scientific work on conflict, then
   discuss the technical and epistemological issues raised by machine
   processing of satellite information into user-ready images. We argue
   that high-resolution images can be useful analytical tools provided they
   are used with full awareness of their ethical and technical parameters.
   To support our analysis, we draw on two novel studies of satellite data
   research practices during the Syrian war. We conclude with a discussion
   of specific methodological procedures tried and tested in our ongoing
   work.},

   Lessons from Burundian Practice},
Journal = {GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT},

Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-47},

Abstract = {The state's responsibility to protect is one of the well-established
   principles of international law recalled by the Resolution A/RE S /60/1
   of 16 September 2005. Given the controversies surrounding the scope of
   the principle, this paper analyses the practice of its implementation
   with a particular focus on Burundi which withdrew from the 1998 Rome
   Statute of the International Criminal Court on 27 October 2017. The
   reflection consisted in collecting and analysing previous academic works
   and official documents inter alia national laws, international
   instruments, official statements, reports, and records of meeting on the
   responsibility to protect and related topics. The paper demonstrates
   that Burundi has made progress to build the state's resilience to
   atrocity crimes by establishing a deterrent legal framework and
   institutional mechanisms. Nonetheless, these significant efforts failed
   to achieve the expected outcomes in terms of legal effect.},

Abstract = {The priorities reflected in the overarching system that includes the
   regimes dealing with international human rights law, international
   humanitarian law, and international criminal law are currently
   undergoing a gradual but highly significant transformation. The cause is
   a growing preoccupation with `atrocity crimes' in each of the three
   fields, along with the imposition of criminal sanctions in response to
   an ever increasing range of violations, the recasting of other
   violations as crimes (ecocide), and the urge to describe a great many
   situations as involving genocide. These developments have diminished the
   attention given to non-criminal violations and to techniques other than
   prosecution, and facilitated continuing neglect of the structural
   dimensions underpinning violations. In the foreign policies of key
   western states, sanctions against individuals now attract more attention
   than other human rights responses. The risk is that these trends will
   entrench an atrocity-centred normative hierarchy, empower judges and
   criminal lawyers at the expense of social movements, shine a spotlight
   on individual rather than collective responsibility, reinforce
   problematic North-South dynamics, and distort resource allocations at
   the international level.},

Abstract = {Communication departments of international organizations (IOs) are
   important intermediaries of global governance who increasingly use
   social media to reach out to citizens directly. Social media pose new
   challenges for IO communication such as a highly competitive economy of
   attention and the fragmentation of the audiences driven by networked
   curation of content and selective exposure. In this context,
   communication departments have to make tough choices about what to
   communicate and how, aggravating inherent tensions between IO
   communication as comprehensive public information (aimed at
   institutional transparency)-and partisan political advocacy (aimed at
   normative change). If IO communication focuses on advocacy it might
   garner substantial resonance on social media. Such advocacy nevertheless
   fails to the extent that it fosters the polarized fragmentation of
   networked communication and undermines the credibility of IO
   communication as a source of trustworthy information across polarized
   ``echo chambers.{''} The paper illustrates this argument through a
   content and social network analysis of Twitter communication on the
   Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM).
   Remarkably, instead of facilitating cross-cluster communication
   ({''}building bridges{''}) Twitter handles run by the United Nations
   Department of Global Communications (UNDGC) seem to have substantially
   fostered ideological fragmentation ({''}digging the trench{''}) by their
   way of partisan retweeting, mentioning, and (hash)tagging.},

Abstract = {The protests against election fraud in Russia in winter 2011-2012 were
   the first in the post-Soviet period that were attended by a united
   opposition, and attracted hundreds of thousands of previously apolitical
   citizens. This article seeks to explain mass participation in the
   protests by focusing on uses of the history of revolution and dissent in
   Russian protest art. The article investigates whether a common
   historical consciousness, which could have made it possible to unify
   previously fragmented opposition and mobilize previously apolitical
   citizens, was manifested in protest artworks created by artists with
   differing political ideologies. The conclusion is that the official
   historical narrative promoted by the state - of a spiritual unity
   between a strong state and the people - was challenged and undermined by
   protest artists, who have characterized Russian history as a continuous
   struggle between an oppressive state and civil society. This finding
   indicates that a common historical consciousness was manifested in
   protest artworks.},

Abstract = {This article offers a new framework for understanding the beliefs behind
   science, technology and innovation (STI) policy. Building on recent
   research that has identified several distinct `policy paradigms' in STI
   policy, it explains how these paradigms may be understood as
   hierarchical belief systems, and it identifies different variants within
   each paradigm. The article then illuminates one means through which
   countries may transition from one paradigm to another in this domain,
   focusing on the international diffusion of the `innovation systems
   policy' paradigm after the 1980s. The article emphasizes how local
   ideology regarding state intervention in the economy shapes how the new
   paradigm is localized in the receiving state. To probe the plausibility
   of this theory, the article presents an in-depth case study focused on
   China's reception and localization of the innovation systems policy
   paradigm in recent decades.},

Abstract = {Causation has traditionally been an under-theorized topic. Until
   Hendrickson's work, very little effort had been devoted to creating a
   compelling theory of causation in intelligence analysis. In line with
   the recent attempts to integrate intelligence theory with philosophy,
   this article is intended to contribute to the philosophy of intelligence
   by defining a dedicated account of causation for it. The Unified Theory
   for Intelligence Analysis, as this account of causation is named, is
   intended to integrate into a single account Betts' Normal and
   Exceptional Theories as well as Hendrickson's target challenges. It is
   then proved that a pluralistic account of causation that combines both
   counterfactual and probabilistic accounts of causation is the most
   successful option. Finally, it is shown that Bayesian tools are the
   natural manifestation of this Unified Theory, and that Subjective Logic
   can help refute criticism against Bayesianism in intelligence analysis.},

Abstract = {In any racialized social system, a dominant racial ideology will emerge
   to uphold it, but it is always contested by and in dialog with others.
   This article leverages conversations around Black Lives Matter, All
   Lives Matter, and Blue Lives Matter as a site of racetalk. By moving
   beyond narrow conceptualizations and measures of racial attitudes, this
   paper pinpoints a myriad of racially based frameworks, or ways of
   talking and thinking about structural racism, white grievance,
   state-sanctioned social control, and the matter of Black lives. It
   analyzes 1,000 Americans' open-ended responses to a question around
   these contested mantras with the Fightin' Words algorithm alongside an
   inductive analysis to illuminate the use of circulating racial
   ideologies. In addition to outlining the components of four racial
   ideologies-colorblind racism, diversity ideology, white protectionism,
   and anti-racism-the article assesses how they are deployed among
   Americans to uphold or challenge the racial status quo.},

Abstract = {In many issue areas in international political economy (IPE), interstate
   cooperation is governed by a dense network of distinct but overlapping
   international institutions. Whether this environment of `regime
   complexity' strengthens or undermines cooperation is a subject of
   intense debate. Some argue that overlapping institutions enhance
   legitimacy and flexibility, while others claim that opportunistic forum
   shopping enables states to escape compliance with rigorous rules. This
   article reconciles this debate, demonstrating that regime complexity has
   contrasting effects depending on the degree of value differentiation
   among institutions. In issue areas where undifferentiated institutions
   function as substitutes, forum shopping will reduce the regime's ability
   to discipline state behavior. However, in issue areas where institutions
   are differentiated by value - i.e. the benefits they provide increase as
   rules become more rigorous - institutional overlap can increase policy
   change among states. I demonstrate these dynamics formally and provide
   empirical evidence in a comparative analysis of the regime complexes for
   election observation and forest-related carbon offsets.},

Abstract = {Why do democracies experience financial crises more often than
   non-democracies? Revisiting the 2008 Great Financial Crisis (GFC) as a
   significant and informative test case, I argue that considering the way
   domestic institutions inhere in system-level structures is important to
   explaining crisis susceptibility among democracies since the turn of the
   twenty-first century. I introduce the mechanism of co-regime financial
   connections in showing that regime type is an important systematic
   feature of global financial flows. Employing a latent space network
   regression model using IMF Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey
   (CPIS), I find that the network of cross-border portfolio asset
   investments is systematically patterned by co-democracy pairs. I then
   show that this regime-patterned interdependence affects increased
   financial crisis susceptibility among democracies. My findings build on
   literature highlighting the interdependence between domestic- and
   system-level factors and inform an empirical puzzle regarding the
   prevalence of financial crises among democracies.},

Abstract = {Today, large-scale IT systems play a central role in the management of
   European borders. These systems not only support and enable the
   management of mobility but also require expert management as complex
   data infrastructures. Drawing on fieldwork carried out at the
   headquarters of the European Union Agency for the Operational Management
   of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice
   (eu-LISA), this article engages with growing calls to explore the
   politics of data infrastructure management. Focusing on the expert
   discourses and practices of eu-LISA, I show that, in line with a logic
   of service, it seeks to establish its legitimacy and authority as the
   manager of data infrastructures by sharing its expertise with its
   stakeholders. By attending to a logic of service, I show that the
   management of data infrastructures is neither exclusively depoliticising
   nor politicising; rather, it is often simultaneously both.},

Abstract = {The Three Seas Initiative (TSI) is a forum of Baltic, Black and Adriatic
   sea countries. In 1919, pioneering British geopolitical theorist Halford
   J. Mackinder promoted a `Middle Tier' strategy, that paralleled the
   Polish interwar `Intermarium' project. Today, the United States views
   the TSI as an asset in the `New Europe', while pro-Atlanticist Central
   and Eastern European states see it as a tool to build transatlantic
   connections. This article suggests that the TSI revives Mackinder's
   `Middle Tier' strategy. Similar to how the Franco-British bonds with the
   `Middle Tier' states sought to offset Germany and Russia a century ago,
   today stronger ties between the US and the `New Europe' within the TSI
   strengthen the position of NATO vis-a-vis the EU, rebalance Western EU
   actors and counter Russian interests.},

Abstract = {Over the last decade, in the United States in particular, there has been
   an increasingly acute awareness of historic and ongoing social, racial,
   gender, and other disparities, and the frequent deployment of categories
   (for example BIPOC, LGBTQQIA2SP+, Latinx) and concepts (for example
   `cultural appropriation', `white privilege', `intersectionality') that
   centre thinking and conversations around various axes of difference. For
   some critics, the hyper-focus on questions of difference is dismissed as
   `wokeness', and its seeming ascendency across elite spaces-academic,
   cultural, and corporate-is viewed with alarm, particularly insofar as
   its advocates are seen to champion a type of illiberalism. Others have
   raised concerns that hyper-identitarianism may diminish possibilities
   for worker and class solidarity, or that it represents only an
   attenuated form of social justice. This article adds to this
   conversation by asking whether the energetic foregrounding of difference
   typical of `wokeness' does not also pose a spiritual conundrum. To
   explore this question, it outlines what is here called the `connective
   worldview', which draws from deep ecology, spiritual practices, and
   mystical insights common to many religious traditions to understand
   humans and their identities as interdependent, ephemeral and,
   ultimately, subject to transcendence. The article contrasts this with
   the `particularistic worldview', which tends to set both individual and
   group identities in sharp relief, emphasizing the need to honour and
   manage difference. It argues that an `integrated' perspective-one that
   strikes a balance between both world-views-will be key for activists
   looking to foment social change while forging a larger `we' in diverse,
   pluralistic societies.},

Abstract = {Although Western-based LGBTQIA{*} mobilizations have often been
   considered rather internally fragmented and isolated from other
   movements, recent investigations show that LGBTQIA{*} organizations have
   increasingly addressed multiple discriminations and built solidarity
   ties with communities coping with various inequality structures - such
   as race, class, and dis/abilities. This article addresses this puzzle by
   analyzing how political solidarity was framed by Spanish and Italian
   LGBTQIA{*} organizations during the 2011-2020 decade, paying particular
   attention to the nexus between diagnostic framing and solidarity
   discourses. To do so, it {[}this article] examines, I examine the
   collective action events published on Facebook by LGBTQIA{*}
   organizations based in Milan and Madrid. Results show that, while
   LGBTQIA{*} actors dealt with cross-sectional issues in both cities, they
   differently framed problems and articulated diverse solidarity
   discourses.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the intelligence domain has transformed and become more
   cyber-oriented. This has been accompanied by governance reforms of
   intelligence agencies' powers and oversight mechanisms. However,
   opinions on key points of these reforms diverge and diverging
   professional opinions may affect how reforms achieve intended goals.
   Using Q-methodology, this article identifies and analyses four distinct
   viewpoints that professionals in the Dutch intelligence community hold
   regarding intelligence powers and oversight thereof. This study was done
   in the context of recent reforms in the Netherlands and also considers
   how views on trust, privacy, and effectiveness play a role.},

Abstract = {The article aims to explain the changing dynamics of property
   restitution to historical Hungarian churches in Romania. While in the
   early 2000s most claims by these churches were approved, after 2010 most
   of their petitions were denied when the courts started questioning these
   churches' historical property rights. It is argued here that this
   jurisprudential shift can be explained by the changing political
   environment after Romania's EU accession, when the courts deferred to
   the prevailing social consensus, reflecting the unpopularity of
   restitution to minority churches amongst the Romanian public.},

Abstract = {Previous explanations regarding transnational solidarity in the European
   Union (EU) have mainly focussed on factors including left-right
   self-placement, support for European integration and European identity.
   We expand this model by considering deeper psychological determinants of
   transnational solidarity: values, operationalised as Schwartz's basic
   human values of universalism and security. We expect them to exert (1)
   direct effects on transnational solidarity - measured as support for
   pan-European social benefits - and (2) indirect effects via the three
   aforementioned factors. We test and find evidence to support our
   theoretical framework using multigroup structural equation modelling and
   data from the European Social Survey. We further show that the effect
   size of the value of universalism on preferences for an EU social
   benefit scheme in each country is positively moderated by that country's
   net contribution to the EU budget, highlighting the interaction between
   material interests and psychological value motivations.},

Abstract = {As Robert Bork once asserted, ``Antitrust policy cannot be made rational
   until we are able to give a firm answer to one question: What is the
   point of the law-what are its goals? Everything else follows from the
   answer we give.{''} The appropriate answer, however, is not, as Bork
   suggested, consumer welfare. Instead, antitrust should serve the equal
   liberties that citizens give themselves when they engage in economic
   activity. Given the complexity and interconnectivity of the economy,
   however, the deliberations in which citizens and policymakers engage
   will produce a messy cacophony. While leaving the precise content and
   scope of citizens' equal liberties open, this article provides a
   cognitive framework that should nevertheless prove useful as they make
   sense of the noise. It explains that while business can claim
   associational freedoms, those freedoms challenge the autonomy of rights
   of corporate insiders and outsiders alike and should be constrained
   accordingly. Indeed, this is how citizens have historically understood
   antitrust-and they can and should do so again.},

Abstract = {Our analysis of data from a nationally representative survey of adults
   shows that beliefs in whether the January 6th insurrection was
   justifiable and whether it required investigation through the creation
   of the U.S. House Select Committee are inexorably steeped in affective
   partisanship and racial resentment. It is easy to attribute the
   insurrection to partisan machinations, but evidence shows that racial
   resentment is the dominant explanation: this includes the fact that
   allegations of election fraud were centered on districts with large
   African American and Latino populations; that many of the
   insurrectionists were white nationalists, racists, and members of
   radical right-wing groups; and that a large proportion of the electorate
   had voted to retain a president who fueled whites' sense of
   victimization by African Americans and other minorities. We argue that
   reactions to the legitimacy of the January 6th insurrection have become
   an example of how racial resentment fuels affective partisanship.},

Abstract = {We examine the historical effects of ethnic and racial diversification
   among legislators on identity group mobilization and the hiring of
   nonwhite lobbyists. We propose that diversification among legislators
   encouraged identity groups to lobby, that these groups hired lobbyists
   who reflected their members' identities, and that all interests also
   hired lobbyists who reflected the identities of new legislative targets.
   We apply a Bayesian estimation approach to infer the identities of
   lobbyists who were active in the American states over several decades.
   We find that the election of African Americans to state legislatures
   encouraged black identity groups to lobby, that all identity groups,
   including those representing Hispanics or Latinos, generally hired
   lobbyists who reflected their members' identities, and that the election
   of Asian Americans to state legislatures encouraged interests generally
   to hire Asian-American lobbyists. Hispanic or Latino lobbyists gained
   clients in response to diversification in more Democratic legislatures.},

Abstract = {Community-based and participatory methods are often marginalized within
   institutions of power. In this article, we-a group of community
   advocates, lawyers, scholars, and researchers from across the globe
   including Thailand, India, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Italy, Iraq, Argentina, the
   UK, Puerto Rico, and the United States-have collectively gathered ways
   that community based, participatory legal empowerment research has been
   delegitimized across these contexts, and offer practical strategies to
   break out of this white supremacist colonial imagination and interrupt
   and respond to these instances of silencing and erasure. Our gatherings
   enable us to bring to life the rich particulars of each of our unique
   contexts and through this richness begin to see how larger dynamics span
   the globe. The micro illuminates the mechanics of the macro. This
   critical analysis that is possible in such a participatory space allowed
   us to identify these strategies of delegitimation that we were
   experiencing despite our very different positionalities and histories.
   These techniques of delegitimation fall into three broad themes: using
   traditional research as defence, attacking the credibility of
   communities including denying their humanity, and acts of
   self-invalidation. These techniques, whether enacted by donors,
   companies, government agencies, or academic institutions, seek to
   disempower the lived experiences of community members involved in legal
   empowerment. By cataloguing these experiences we hope to better
   understand techniques of silencing and oppression, and to trace the ways
   that systems of power reinforce their standing through these immediate
   and interpersonal responses to the voice of the collective.},

Abstract = {This article examines how the European Union (EU) reacted to the
   protests that erupted in Belarus against the re-election of Alyaksandr
   Lukashenka in 2020 and the repressive measures he took against his
   political adversaries, using the conceptual lens of resilience and
   pragmatism, two concepts endorsed in the 2016 European Union Global
   Strategy (EUGS) that seem most appropriate for our analysis. However,
   while resilience is less demanding than the promotion of democracy, it
   can face obstacles created by a political leadership hostile to external
   influences, repressive measures against opposition forces and the
   support of a powerful external actor, in this case, Russia. The EU has
   thus designed a three-level strategy targeting the current leadership,
   the leaders of the opposition and the people. This tripartite approach
   may confer various different meanings on resilience, including
   resistance. The article reflects critically on resilience in complex
   situations, highlighting its features, advantages and limitations.},

Title = {Cars, capitalism and ecological crises: understanding systemic barriers

Abstract = {In the face of climate and ecological crises, it is vital that car use
   be reduced, while simultaneously shifting towards different powertrains
   and reducing the size, weight and energy demand of vehicles. This poses
   a challenge to the global car industry, as its business model
   historically centres on selling more and larger cars. In this context,
   the purpose of this paper is to examine the social-ecological limits of
   industrial restructuring in Germany. A narrative literature review
   through the lens of Marxian political economy sheds light on intertwined
   system-immanent barriers to achieving social and ecological
   sustainability at the sectoral level. Consequently, powertrain
   electrification is structured by technological dynamism, which fuels
   appropriation in the quest for metals and rare earths, with significant
   social and ecological disadvantages. This generates an impasse for the
   industry's transition strategies. Understanding how capitalist
   tendencies generate interlaced and mutually re-enforcing barriers to
   achieving social-ecological sustainability is key to understanding why
   industrial transitions are insufficient from a social-ecological
   perspective.},

Abstract = {This lead article in a JCMS symposium marking 20 years of normative
   power provides a prospective intervention into thinking through the rest
   of the century by taking the language of Arrival, the 2016 speculative
   fiction film based on Ted Chiang's 1998 short `Story of Your Life' and
   applying it to normative power by double-decolonising the
   anthropocentrism of capitalist culture and Eurocentrism in order to
   arrive at planetary politics. The article will first reflect on the
   20-year development of the normative power approach to arrive at a
   language of comprehension. The subsequent sections will then set out a
   mode of simultaneous awareness, a medium of sharing relationships and a
   means for action in concert found in the normative power approach before
   concluding on how planetary symbiosis is the story of our lives.},

Abstract = {This study examines the articulation of anti-gender politics in the
   parliamentary debates centred on two citizens' initiatives in Finland
   and Romania. Although different in their endeavours (in Finland,
   supporting equal marriage rights; in Romania, attempting to legislate
   pre-emptively against them), these citizens' initiatives resulted in
   significant defeats for the wider anti-gender campaigns in these
   countries. Examining closely the parliamentary debates ensuing these
   proposals, we evidence how anti-gender politics developed in ways
   specific to each examined polity and served as a key vehicle for
   different manners of retrogressive mobilisation, which bypassed
   left-right ideological cleavages and party loyalty. We scrutinise
   critically the discursive scenarios that coalesce in anti-gender
   politics in the two countries, and we map out both the commonalities and
   differences between the antithetic narrative scenarios, which hinge on
   the position of the child within a heteronormative nuclear family and
   the depiction of marriage equality as a harbinger of an impending
   societal collapse.},

Abstract = {This article recalculates financial flows to and from the Tajik SSR
   during the 1970s and 1980s. Using tax and export revenue from cotton
   production largely unregistered in Soviet financial accounts, it
   provides an estimate for the annual financial outflow of revenue from
   the Tajik SSR. This is then compared to the annual `subsidy' sent to the
   republic. In practice, the article concludes that financial transfers to
   the Tajik SSR were largely equivalent to the revenue accrued from its
   cotton production, calling into question the discourse of subsidisation
   of Soviet Central Asia. In this sense, the article suggests an
   overlooked risk-sharing mechanism built into late Soviet redistributive
   financial transfers.},

Abstract = {International organizations (IOs) of the United Nations (UN) system
   publish around 750 evaluation reports per year, offering insights on
   their performance across project, program, institutional, and thematic
   activities. So far, it was not feasible to extract quantitative
   performance measures from these text-based reports. Using deep learning,
   this article presents a novel text-based performance metric: We classify
   individual sentences as containing a negative, positive, or neutral
   assessment of the evaluated IO activity and then compute the share of
   positive sentences per report. Content validation yields that the
   measure adequately reflects the underlying concept of performance;
   convergent validation finds high correlation with human-provided
   performance scores by the World Bank; and construct validation shows
   that our measure has theoretically expected results. Based on this, we
   present a novel dataset with performance measures for 1,082 evaluated
   activities implemented by nine UN system IOs and discuss avenues for
   further research.},

Abstract = {Thirty years on from the collapse of Yugoslavia, the paths of the former
   constituent republics have diverged, with Slovenia and Croatia acceding
   to the European Union and the rest remaining hopeful Europeans. This
   article analyses this discrepancy through the lens of policy learning,
   conceptualising the process of accession as one of learning on the part
   of the candidate state, and uses social network analysis to identify the
   impact of informal political networks in parliaments of Croatia and
   Serbia on their respective EU accession processes. It finds that
   informal networks in Croatia enabled accession while those in Serbia
   constrained it.},

   with low population and resources requires the establishment of a

Abstract = {Review of the book by Esther Rando Burgos, Legal Framework of
   Territorial Management. Tirant lo Blanch, 2020, 464 pp. Foreword by
   Diego J. Vera Jurado. The work analyzes in a new, rigorous and complete
   way, how to manage the planning of the territory, one of the great
   challenges of the planning of the territory in our country. And it does
   so by providing solutions and tools that, from a legal point of view,
   can be decisive in advancing this controversial issue. The author
   rigorously argues the existing non-existent legal regime and, in what
   constitutes a benchmark in this public function, configures it, even
   providing it with the legal mechanisms that can enable its
   implementation.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {This collective discussion brings together six women scholars of and
   from the post-Yugoslav space, who, using personal experiences, analyze
   the dynamics of knowledge production in international relations (IR),
   especially regarding the post-Yugoslav space. Working in Global North
   academia but with lived experiences in the region we study, our research
   is often subjected to a particular gaze, seeped in assumptions about
   ``ulterior{''} motives and expectations about writing and
   representation. Can those expected to be objects of knowledge ever
   become epistemic subjects? We argue that the rendering of the
   post-Yugoslav space as conflict-prone and as Europe's liminal
   semi-periphery in the discipline of IR cannot be decoupled from the
   rendering of the region and those seen as related to it as unable to
   produce knowledge that, in mainstream discussions, is seen as valuable
   and ``objective.{''} The post-Yugoslav region and those seen as related
   to it being simultaneously postcolonial, postsocialist, and postwar, and
   characterized by marginalization, complicity, and privilege in global
   racialized hierarchies at the same time, can make visible specific forms
   of multiple colonialities, potentially creating space for anti- and/or
   decolonial alternatives. We further make the case for embracing a
   radical reflexivity that is active, collaborative, and rooted in
   feminist epistemologies and political commitments.},

Abstract = {As the population of the European Union (EU) is ageing and its
   working-age population shrinking, concerns are rising about how the
   growing demand for long-term care (LTC) will be met. Since unpaid care,
   provided mainly by women, is increasingly scarce, some EU states are
   becoming dependent on migrant labour for the functioning of their elder
   care systems. To address the growing deficit of care in the EU, the
   European Commission put forward a European Care Strategy, for the first
   time proposing a stand-alone policy on LTC. This followed on from a
   Commission proposal for a new strategy on migration, calling for labour
   migrants to be proactively attracted to work in the EU's care sector. As
   the (lack of) availability of LTC is increasingly shaping EU policy, it
   is timely to investigate what its impact is on key policy areas, such as
   gender equality, social and migration policies.},

Abstract = {A controversial approach characterizes international law and policy on
   children affected by armed conflict: it is much more concerned with
   child soldiers' victimization than with their victims' situation. This
   approach leads to (1) the prioritization of the former over the child
   victims of their crimes before judicial and non-judicial mechanisms and
   (2) a significant disparity in how international law and policy respond
   to the victimization of war-affected children in the presence of those
   categorized as `child soldiers.' To narrow this gap, this article
   explores the potential of defining child soldiers as victims who
   victimize during trials. It does so by discussing the practice observed
   in local juvenile courts in the North and South Kivu provinces in the
   Democratic Republic of Congo.},

Abstract = {What legitimates constitutions? One standard answer is that
   constitutions are legitimate only if they represent the people they
   govern. This article identifies two different conceptions of
   representation. Representation can be grounded either in the consent or
   the will of the citizens or when the constitution reflects the `real'
   identity of the members of the nation. Alternatively, it is sometimes
   stated that the constitution is legitimate because it promotes justice
   or, more generally, is grounded in reason. While constitutions are
   typically grounded both in claims to represent the people and in claims
   concerning the justness and wisdom of the constitutional provisions, we
   establish that there are two types of constitutions: constitutions that
   are primarily representational (e.g. the US Constitution) and
   constitutions that are primarily reason-based (e.g. the German
   Constitution). We also show that this distinction has important
   ramifications for how constitutions are drafted and ratified, and how
   they operate. One central implication is that the legitimacy of
   constitutions that make weak claims to representation - for example,
   constitutions that are imposed by foreign powers - can still be defended
   on reason-based grounds.},

Abstract = {Redistricting poses a potential harm to American voters in limiting
   choice and accountability at the polls. Although voters still retain
   their right to contact their representatives, research shows that the
   confusion created when redistricting divides ZIP codes confounds the
   constituent-representative link. We build on existing research that
   shows splitting ZIP codes across multiple congressional districts leads
   to harms in representation. Specifically, we examine the role of
   splitting ZIP codes on the recognition of the racial group membership of
   one's Congressional representative, a foundational component of the
   descriptive representation of racial minority voters via
   minority-majority districts in the United States. We find that citizens
   living in split ZIP codes are significantly less likely to know the race
   of their member of Congress. This occurs even when controlling for a
   host of factors including the race and partisanship of the constituent,
   the tenure of the member, and the amount of time a constituent has lived
   in their congressional district. Our work provides further evidence of
   the democratic harms experienced by American citizens living in ZIP
   codes that are split between multiple congressional districts. This work
   also points to the representational harms produced by poor district
   design on the representation of American voters.},

Abstract = {The central objective of democratic governance of intelligence is,
   through debate and law, to establish public confidence that the agencies
   work efficiently, effectively and properly. Oversight of intelligence
   can be seen as a contest between agencies, government and overseers for
   the control of information. The four interacting dimensions of
   information control are secrecy, gathering, evaluation and persuasion.
   This article assesses the oversight performance of the Intelligence and
   Security Committee (ISC) through the prism of information control in
   investigating the allegations of UK involvement in torture since 2001.
   Operating within an overall context of executive dominance, these
   dimensions constitute a series of filters including what officers tell
   their managers, what the agencies record, what they tell ministers, what
   they tell oversight bodies and, finally, what the ISC reports to the
   public.},

Abstract = {International institutions are an essential driving force of
   contemporary policies to combat gender-based violence but remain
   toothless if political actors do not implement them in domestic
   policies. How can scholars conceptualise the transposition of
   international genderbased violence norms into domestic policies? I argue
   that discourse network analysis provides a powerful conceptual and
   methodological extension of critical frame analysis to understand how
   frames shape the meaning of gender-based violence norms in multi-level
   institutional contexts. Frames' normative and cognitive network
   structure invites combining discourse network and frame analysis
   techniques that locate frames' power in their ability to connect
   different institutional spheres temporally and spatially. I outline a
   multi-level research agenda that traces the framing processes of
   international norms and their domestic implementation through
   gender-based violence policies in the Council of Europe's Istanbul
   Convention. This agenda includes avenues to study how complex
   transnational policy frameworks like the Istanbul Convention play out in
   domestic policy implementation.},

Title = {East Asia and the politics of global finance: a developmental challenge
   to the neoliberal consensus?},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {224-252},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Recent IPE scholarship locates the key dynamics of financial
   globalization in two areas: public money flows between the US and Asia,
   or private banking flows between the US and Europe. This dichotomy
   presents the globalization of private finance as firmly anchored within
   transatlantic, neoliberal financial norms. We argue that this creates a
   blind spot regarding the growing role of East Asian finance within the
   global financial system. Combining CPE insights on institutional
   characteristics of Asian financial systems with a macro-financial
   analysis of the global financial system, this paper analyzes the global
   implications of the geographic shift towards East Asia. First, we
   demonstrate the growing importance of East Asia for global
   macro-financial flows, actors and markets that goes beyond the rise of
   China. Second, we explore how the institutional arrangements that
   underpin Asian financial systems differ significantly from transatlantic
   finance. By investigating the growing importance of global investors in
   Asian markets and Asian investors in global markets, we explore how the
   shift towards East Asia introduces a growing role of developmental
   characteristics within global finance. This calls for a reconsideration
   of conventional analyses of the global financial system which often
   assume its role as a force of neoliberal globalization.},

   Mobilization, and the Securitization of Social Relations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {This article argues that the Anthropocene produces a paradox when
   thinking about political mobilization. I show how the knowledge
   production practices that render the Anthropocene visible and
   actionable, including planetary boundaries, Earth System Science
   modeling of earth systems, and geological strata, also circulate a
   security rationality. This rationality is one that attempts to manage,
   co-opt, or productively direct processes of becoming, which limits
   possibilities for mobilization. A lens that assumes political
   mobilization is a function of increased knowledge, understanding, and
   evidence contributes to this problem. By starting instead with an
   understanding of possibilities for mobilization as emerging from social
   relations, the article highlights the way in which the security
   rationality circulated by Anthropocene knowledge production risks
   transforming those social relations into security relations. Netting the
   planet and the human together through the practices of calculation and
   representation that make the Anthropocene visible produces a
   decontextualized, disaggregated, and dispersed subject and so limits
   possibilities for collective political mobilization.},

Title = {What Parliamentary Rhetoric Tells Us About Changing Democratic Culture:
   Antisemitism in Austrian Parliamentary Debate as a Threat to Democracy},
Journal = {REDESCRIPTIONS-POLITICAL THOUGHT CONCEPTUAL HISTORY AND FEMINIST THEORY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The article aims to tease out the relationship between, on the one hand,
   changing rhetorical strategies for dealing with `postwar-tabooed'
   antisemitism in the Austrian parliament and, on the other, shifts in
   democratic culture-that is, the expression of democratic equality in the
   publicly sayable. Starting from the theoretical assumptions that
   parliament symbolises democracy tout court and that parliamentarism is a
   `rhetorical condition of democracy' (Kari Palonen), we seek to explore
   the nexus between parliamentary rhetoric and democracy in depth. We do
   so, first, by identifying the successive postwar rhetorical strategies
   for dealing with antisemitism in their (historical) political context
   and, second, by delineating how those strategies mark shifting
   boundaries of the sayable in relation to antisemitism in Austrian
   postwar parliamentary rhetoric. Third, we show how those strategies and
   shifts signify transformations of Austrian democratic culture and
   democracy and that this process has a gendered dimension.
   Methodologically, we draw on a multidisciplinary mix of qualitative
   approaches, combining discourse and rhetoric analysis, specialised
   approaches to the analysis of parliamentary debate, and Conceptual
   History.},

Abstract = {The study adopts a historical perspective, analyzing from a linguistic
   and rhetorical point of view the parliamentary speeches of three Italian
   populist politicians before April 1992, that is to say, before the fall
   of the traditional Italian parties that dominated the scene in the
   second half of the 20(th) century and the beginning of a new political
   era. The aim is to ascertain whether the formal characteristics of
   Italian populist discourse are completely dependent on the general
   political landscape and on the mass media or whether it is possible to
   identify any linguistic or rhetorical features that are inherently
   linked to Italian populism.},

Abstract = {After the demise of Communism in East-Central Europe in 1989-1990, the
   new, non-Communist governments in the region had to consolidate their
   countries' independence. The basic institutions of Soviet domination in
   East-Central Europe-the Warsaw Pact, the Council for Economic Mutual
   Assistance (CMEA), four large contingents of Soviet troops, and various
   other mechanisms of intra-bloc integration-still existed, and Soviet
   leaders hoped they could preserve most of those features in some form.
   Officials in East-Central Europe soon realized that they would have to
   take the initiative in eliminating all vestiges of Soviet hegemony in
   the region. The main impetus came from Hungary and Czechoslovakia and
   eventually Poland. Acting as a pressure group, they achieved agreement
   in the first half of 1991 on the dismantling of the alliance's military
   structures and then, by mid-1991, the dissolution of both the Warsaw
   Pact and CMEA. This article draws on recently declassified Hungarian,
   Soviet, East German, and Bulgarian archival sources to tell the
   behind-the-scenes endgame of the Warsaw Pact.},

   It examines how Whitehall responded to the negative fallout, and the

   accept responsibility for the lack of personal testimony in the work,
   and prioritised settling legal cases and the avoidance of any further
   legal action as changes to the text were made for a revised first
   edition. The article also reflects upon whether the experience had any
   impact upon subsequent intelligence-related official histories.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2, SI},

Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {During the inter-war period, there appeared numerous spy memoirs,
   offering surprising insights into the recently fought secret war. These
   had a noticeable impact on the writing of spy stories, which under the
   influence of new detail and knowledge tended to become more realistic.
   The following article examines the influence of spy memoirs on spy
   fiction in the period, revealing that both critics and the reading
   public were now forced to disentangle fact from fakery and trying to
   pinpoint where truth bled into fiction. Attention is given to the three
   `spy memoirs' of Bernard Newman, Spy (1935), Secret Servant (1935) and
   German Spy (1936). These unjustly forgotten works of fiction disguised
   as fact generated some confusion and debate at the time and served to
   draw attention to issues of authenticity when treating `writers in
   intelligence'.},

   Using interview data and publicly available documents, I analyse the
   interaction between DISS and DOPS J2 using a framework on different role
   models adapted from public administration theory. I found that although
   the formal organizational structure portrays the relationship as
   separated, the relationship is more layered and complex in practice,
   which contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexity and
   multilayered nature of defence intelligence relations, where interaction
   often goes beyond the dichotomous portrayal that is predominantly found
   in literature.},

Abstract = {The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) aims at providing
   food and (non-)material assistance to the most vulnerable European
   citizens. Linking macro and micro data on the importance of FEAD
   resources shows, however, a mixed picture of targeting the most
   deprived: although FEAD budgets accrue more to countries with greater
   social needs, when the budgets are compared with the number of severely
   deprived persons, FEAD resources were found to be more than twice as
   high in Finland than in Hungary. This suggests that FEAD does not
   differentiate sufficiently across countries to focus on the poorest
   citizens within the Union. Moreover, a micro-level analysis of how these
   budgets are spent in a number of selected countries (Belgium, Finland,
   Hungary and Spain) reveals large between- and within-country variations
   in the developed FEAD programmes, indicating substantial discretionary
   leeway for Member States and social organisations to implement FEAD.},

Title = {Women's issues, critical actors and the media: substantive
   representation of women and gendered media coverage in South Korea},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND GENDER},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The article investigates whether media coverage varies for male and
   female legislators with regards to their activities in promoting women's
   interests. To test this, 30 key women's-issuepromoting legislators in
   South Korea are selected, primarily based on their legislative
   significance within a women's-issue bill co-sponsorship network between
   2004 and 2016, and their various substantive representation efforts are
   analysed by examining 45 news outlets. Findings reveal that while
   receiving less media coverage than their male counterparts overall,
   female legislators have higher odds of receiving a more focused
   spotlight concerning women's-issue-promotion efforts. However, the
   gendered media coverage was only driven by women's issues with strong
   stereotypically feminine policy characteristics, for example, abortion,
   contraception and sexual harassment, and not by those with both feminine
   and masculine policy characteristics, such as childcare support and
   maternity leave. The article demonstrates the importance of mediabias
   conditionality and thus calls for a more nuanced approach to be taken in
   future research.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {543-561},

Abstract = {This article studies the process of constitution-making in Jammu and
   Kashmir as a hegemonic process dominated by, and an ideological
   reflection of, the dominant political party of Jammu and Kashmir, the
   National Conference led by the popular leader Sheikh Abdullah. The
   Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir emerged as an outcome of their ideas.
   Though the process itself was punctuated by the exclusionary violence
   against diverse communities present in the state at that time, very
   little attention has been paid to the idea of a constitution as an
   exclusivist text that embeds `foundational violence' within it, and that
   eliminates dissenting groups and prevents the inclusion of plural
   conceptions of politics by actualizing a monopolistic discourse in
   favour of the dominant party. This article locates the violence that
   went into constitution-making and further employs hermeneutical
   interpretation of the Constituent Assembly Debates of Jammu and Kashmir
   to locate the differing viewpoints that existed in the State Constituent
   Assembly. It also takes the surrounding political and ideological
   context into account. In doing so, it constructs an alternative and
   `unofficial' version of the constitution-making process, which helps
   challenge the dominant historical narrative that the constitution-making
   in Jammu and Kashmir was a successful experiment in Indian federal
   democracy.},

Abstract = {When will members of a diaspora lend to the government in their country
   of origin? Diasporans make important contributions to developing
   countries by sending remittances and investment home. However, little is
   known about when and why diaspora communities are willing to invest in
   the governments of their country of origin. Diasporans may invest at
   home because of their affinity with their country of origin, whether in
   the form of national pride, stake in economic development, or political
   support. This paper investigates whether these different affinity-based
   motivations explain the interest of diaspora members in purchasing home
   country government bonds. We use a survey experiment fielded to members
   of the Pakistani diaspora living in the United States to investigate
   diaspora members' willingness to invest in home government bonds. We
   randomly manipulate the framing of the bond to measure heterogeneity in
   willingness to buy the home country government bond. We find that
   national pride and a stake in economic development are the strongest
   drivers for an individual's choice to invest in a home country bond. We
   corroborate these findings with follow-up interviews that reveal the
   resonance of appeals to national identity and developmental support. The
   findings have implications for the design and marketing of diaspora
   bonds.},

Abstract = {Review of the book by Lucia Alarc \& oacute;n Sotomayor, The fundamental
   rights of legal-private persons against the Administration,
   Thomson-Aranzadi, 2023, 200 pp., foreword by Jos \& eacute; Maria Ba \&
   ntilde;o Le \& oacute;n. This work analyzes whether legal persons of a
   private nature can be holders, and to what extent, of the fundamental
   rights enshrined in the EC against Public Administrations. To do this,
   it studies the jurisprudence that our TC has developed and, from there,
   determines the consequences of that attribution. There are two of the
   most original and risky contributions. On the one hand, the requirement
   to distinguish between the different types of legal entities leads the
   author to deny the ownership of fundamental rights to open corporations,
   especially listed companies, which are dehumanized entities. The other
   great contribution is the study and conclusion that the triple aspect of
   the objective conception of fundamental rights, as objective values,
   duties of protection and institutional guarantees, has a clear
   propensity to expand them as objective norms in favor of legal-private
   persons.},

Abstract = {European Union law gives special treatment to services provided to
   persons. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has had the
   opportunity to address the core aspects of this treatment in several
   rulings: on the one hand, that of contractual and non-contractual
   (indirect) management formulas and the conditions for their
   applicability. And, on the other hand, the particular rules applicable
   to the participation of non-profit entities in their provision. This
   paper reviews the aforementioned doctrine, paying special attention to
   the recent ruling of the CJEU of 14 July 2022 C-436/20 ASADE case, the
   importance of which lies in consolidating some previous interpretative
   lines of the CJEU and making progress in clarifying the treatment of
   these services.},

Abstract = {In view of academic and policy discussions about a persisting gap
   between human rights and peacebuilding in the UN system, this article
   examines how peacebuilding has been integrated into the work of the UN
   Human Rights Council (HRC). The analysis draws on interviews with UN
   Member State attaches and representatives of non-governmental
   organizations, as well as a range of HRC documents focusing on Myanmar
   between 2006 and 2021. The findings complement the existing academic
   literature with nuanced insights into the interaction between human
   rights and peacebuilding practitioners from a human rights,
   institutional perspective. The analysis reveals that the HRC is aware of
   the link between human rights and peacebuilding, implicitly supports
   peacebuilding and seeks to strengthen institutional cooperation through
   the prevention resolutions. However, despite efforts to increase
   engagement, explicit linkages and coordination with the UN's
   peacebuilding institutions in New York remain rare. Institutional silos,
   concerns about sovereignty and mandate overlap, fears of politicization
   as well as a lack of political will and capacity constraints present
   obstacles to cooperation. This article points to the need for a better
   information flow and stronger interaction between human rights and
   peacebuilding actors in Geneva and New York to enhance mutual
   understanding. Improving synergies between human rights and
   peacebuilding institutions in Geneva and New York is key to bridging the
   overall gap between human rights and peacebuilding-both in policy and
   practice.},

Abstract = {What we mean by human rights remains perhaps too anchored in the
   international legal frameworks that took shape after the Second World
   War. Those legal frameworks tend to take a myopic view on human rights
   duty-bearers. If human rights are to remain relevant for core societal
   challenges, such as climate change, exploitation of natural resources,
   or increasing inequalities, we need a better understanding of how human
   rights can engage more explicitly and effectively with power and
   inequitable and unjust global socioeconomic and political structures.
   Over the last 15 years, an ever increasing number of scholars and
   practitioners of human rights have been seeking to identify other
   duty-bearers beyond the territorial state, ranging from foreign states
   and international organizations to companies, in an effort to expand the
   relevance of human rights law in the quest towards global justice. This
   article identifies key challenges, takes stock of the current state of
   affairs, and suggests future directions for human rights law in tackling
   global structural inequities and injustices.},

Abstract = {This study provides the first empirical evidence of ethnic identity bias
   in the context of the dominant-party authoritarian electoral system in
   Russia's multi-ethnic republics. I run vote-choice survey experiments in
   Tatarstan, Buryatia, and Sakha, in which the respondents choose between
   the dominant United Russia candidate and a system-opposition A Just
   Russia candidate. First, I find that the party vote in previous
   elections is the best predictor of the vote and candidate evaluation in
   the experiment, revealing the traction of party support in Russia's
   electoral process. Second, titular voters demonstrate a strong
   preference for co-ethnic candidates regardless of the party they
   support. I rely on the arguments of social dominance theory to explain
   the prevalence of ethnic bias in voting among titular citizens of ethnic
   republics.},

Abstract = {In the literature, the period 2017-2018 has been identified as a time
   when feminist discourse emerged in the Russian media, with the topic of
   domestic violence (DV) as one of the main sub-discourses. This suggests
   that mainstream media can act as an agent of positive social change in
   relation to gender issues, even amid a broader `conservative turn'. This
   study interrogates this argument by examining changes in representations
   of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Russian media during the COVID-19
   pandemic, at a time when increased attention was given to the global
   `shadow pandemic' of violence in the home.},

Abstract = {Feminist scholarship regards the Western scientific revolution and
   twentieth-century agricultural modernization as patriarchal endeavors
   and technoscientific regimes as entangled in societal interests and
   politics. In this article, I engage with these perspectives by focusing
   on women scientists working in Brazil's leading agricultural sciences
   organization, Embrapa. My analysis draws on life history interviews with
   three women, juxtaposing their personal and career trajectories with the
   history of the organization, which is a symbol of the triumph of science
   over nature. Besides filling the gaps in a male-dominated history, these
   women's accounts reveal what I argue to be feminist struggles for more
   equitable and pluralistic agricultural sciences and practices. I refer
   to them as ``fringe heroines{''} as they adopt research agendas that are
   at odds with the prevailing technoscientific paradigm and often find
   themselves subject to condescending attitudes and discrimination. These
   fringe heroines experienced a short-lived moment in the limelight during
   a period of progressive politics in Brazil. However, confronted by a
   less favorable context during the Bolsonaro era, they have taken a step
   back but have maintained their resolve to swim against the tide in their
   unyielding quest for justice and diversity with respect to agricultural
   knowledge production. The time is ripe for reflecting on the place of
   their situated struggles and knowledges in the past, present, and future
   of Brazilian agricultural sciences.},

Abstract = {Cybersecurity has attracted significant political, social, and
   technological attention as contemporary societies have become
   increasingly reliant on computation. Today, at least within the Global
   North, there is an ever-pressing and omnipresent threat of the next
   ``cyber-attack{''} or the emergence of a new vulnerability in highly
   interconnected supply chains. However, such discursive positioning of
   threat and its resolution has typically reinforced, and perpetuated,
   dominant power structures and forms of violence as well as universalist
   protocols of protection. In this collective discussion, in contrast, six
   scholars from different disciplines discuss what it means to ``do{''}
   ``critical{''} research into what many of us uncomfortably refer to as
   ``cybersecurity.{''} In a series of provocations and reflections, we
   argue that, as much as cybersecurity may be a dominant discursive mode
   with associated funding and institutional ``benefits,{''} it is crucial
   to look outward, in conversation with other moves to consider our
   technological moment. That is, we question who and what cybersecurity is
   for, how to engage as academics, and what it could mean to undo
   cybersecurity in ways that can reassess and challenge power structures
   in the twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {The Green Deal, the European Commission's current economic and
   environmental flagship initiative, demands policy change in many fields.
   One of them is the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which has a history
   of complex and controversial reforms. This raises a classic question of
   EU studies: To what extent and under what conditions can the Commission
   act as a policy entrepreneur? Analysing its efforts to align the latest
   CAP reform with the Green Deal, this article shows that, whilst
   struggling to make an impact in the legislative arena, the Commission
   used its implementation powers to pressure member states to engage with
   the Green Deal in their national CAP plans. In doing so, it effectively
   blended hard and soft law to strengthen its position. The case offers
   evidence how Commission entrepreneurship can materialize even under
   adverse conditions.},

Abstract = {This article interrogates the normative coherence of the label of
   `digital constitutionalism'. In particular, I argue that the use of the
   label `constitutionalism' in digital contexts often conflates the
   practical realities of existing contractual governance models with the
   superficial appeal of constitutional structures. As a result, the label
   is misleading in both normative and qualitative terms as it obscures the
   true nature of the governance architectures to which it is applied,
   which are more appropriately understood as implementing a distinct genre
   of `private policy'.},

Abstract = {Among analysts of China-Russia relations, it has been common to assume
   that bilateral rapprochement has primarily been rooted in geopolitical,
   security, and balance-of-power considerations. This article argues that
   the corresponding Realist theoretical approaches can explain some
   important incentives for Sino-Russian rapprochement, but struggle to
   account for how substantive bilateral alignment has actually become. The
   article posits that a particularly useful theoretical approach for
   examining the motives underlying Sino-Russian strategic alignment is
   ``Omnibalancing{''} - a variation of balance-of-power theory that
   combines considerations of system-level balancing with a simultaneous
   focus on both leaderships' prioritization of domestic threats and regime
   security. Due to the increasing convergence of their authoritarian
   regime types, a major factor accounting for the dynamism of China-Russia
   strategic cooperation has been both governments' shared concern for
   regime survival/legitimacy, and their concrete policy cooperation in
   recent years has reflected their preoccupation with shoring up regime
   security against domestic challenges to authoritarian rule.},

Abstract = {Hate speech and incitement have been instrumental in atrocity crimes
   that have occurred in India, even prior to its independence. These
   atrocities include targeted killings of minorities based on religious
   and ethnic identity, and demonstrate persistent features of systematic,
   orchestrated violence that is fuelled by a Hindu nationalist ideology.
   This ideology is routinely promulgated at the highest levels of
   political leadership. This article traces both the historical and
   institutional character of hate speech and incitement in India to
   understand its repeated manifestation over time. Through case studies of
   recent violence, it considers the implications of new legal
   developments, technology and the COwD-19 pandemic on the character and
   dynamic of hate speech, incitement and atrocity violence in India. It
   considers key reforms and areas for accountability on which the
   international community could engage the government and civil society in
   India on the issue of hate speech and incitement to promote atrocity
   prevention at the domestic level.},

Abstract = {Globalization did not negate state power. It changed the toolkit. We
   expected the norms and incentives of the liberal economic order to push
   regimes in places like China and Russia to democratize. Instead,
   authoritarianism appears to be thriving. This article argues that
   authoritarians have learned how to take advantage of the institutions
   underpinning globalization for their own illiberal ends. They use courts
   in major economic powers to negate the effects of international
   institutions and to target their political competition. They subvert our
   expectations by repurposing the basic premises of liberalism -
   predictability and openness. The article demonstrates these claims by
   examining how the institutions of multiple international economic
   regimes, which were designed as constraints, have been turned into
   offensive tools. The findings illustrate that International Political
   Economy (IPE) scholars need to begin analyzing how governments learned
   these tactics and whether we can reconcile the contradictions they
   exploit.},

Abstract = {What types of sources did people seek out for local information about
   COVID-19? In this study, we explore the information-seeking repertoires
   that Illinois residents had for obtaining information about the spread
   of COVID-19 within their local communities. We use data from a statewide
   survey of adults living in Illinois to identify five distinct
   repertoires that differ in terms of the range of sources consulted and
   the level of information sought. We then examine how differences in
   information-seeking repertoires relate to sociodemographics, the type of
   geographic community respondents live in, and their level of concern
   about COVID-19. Our results show similarity and divergence in the ways
   people sought out information about COVID-19 in their local communities,
   with local news playing a key role in all information-seeking
   repertoires.},

Abstract = {International human rights law has long ignored women's realities,
   reproducing an epistemological blind spot that has impacted transitional
   justice mechanisms such as truth commissions. In the early 2000s, this
   blind spot was challenged by Peru's Comision de la Verdad y
   Reconciliacion (CVR; Truth and Reconciliation Commission). The lessons
   learned in Peru about including gender in transitional justice processes
   have nourished the application of transitional justice in Colombia. This
   article examines the inclusion of a gender perspective in Peru's CVR and
   highlights the advances and lessons that inform Colombia's Comision para
   el Esclarecimiento de la Verdad, la Convivencia y la No Repeticion (CEV;
   Commission for the Clarification of Truth, Coexistence, and
   Non-Repetition). Furthermore, it underscores the innovative
   contributions of Latin American decolonial and communitarian feminisms
   to reframing the inclusion of gender in the context of Colombia's CEV.
   We argue that these feminisms allow the recognition that ``woman{''} is
   a plural subject intersected by race and class; challenge liberal
   feminist conceptions of gender; propose a reconceptualization of time;
   provide a historical explanation of the reasons behind violence against
   women; and give an important centrality to nature, territory, and the
   sacred in the explanation of violence and in peacebuilding.},

Abstract = {The spread of COVID-19 sparked debates about whether incumbents should
   focus on saving lives or the economy. Politicians' decisions in this
   dilemma could determine whether they remain in office. ``Saving the
   economy{''} is predicted to affect re-election chances positively in
   economic voting theory. However, a public health crisis can shift the
   electorate's preferences in favor of expanding healthcare support at the
   cost of the economy. We examine whether there is a trade-off between
   ``saving lives{''} and ``saving the economy{''} for the incumbent in
   receiving higher political support. Based on two experiments conducted
   in Russia, we measure if individuals are more likely to support, vote
   for, and extend the power of the incumbent based on their policies.
   Although both experimental factors encouraged support, the
   economy-driven policy had a larger effect on voting than the
   healthcare-driven one.},

Abstract = {People who seek public benefits for their families often struggle to
   navigate the complicated labyrinth of U.S. safety net programs. We show
   that states can meaningfully improve access for families in need-even in
   the absence of significant policy change-by adopting widely used
   technology and common research practices. Technology and research can be
   applied to each stage of benefits delivery: outreach, application, and
   renewal. The suggestions we offer vary in their ease of implementation:
   some are simple, like sending repeated renewal reminders through as many
   channels of communication as possible; others are more involved, like
   bundling together separate program applications. We argue that if states
   are to succeed at simplifying the enrollment process-and thereby
   increase the share of eligible people receiving benefits-they can help
   their own cause by building and maintaining a modern technological
   infrastructure for data collection and analysis, and then act on what
   those data reveal.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the problematique of giving voice to homegrown
   traditions of constitutionalism in individual African countries. The
   scholarly discussion is combined with an applied concern about whether
   this could instil a wider grassroots embrace of the country's
   constitution, thereby consolidating constitutionalism and ensuring
   longevity. The investigation is carried through the lens of two
   sub-categories of the concept of constitutional identity: a
   representative one that reflects a country's particular political,
   social and cultural makeup, and an aspirational one that sets goals and
   ideals. The challenge, in both scholarly and applied terms, is how to
   ensure that a constitution instils a sense of public ownership by
   becoming more representative of a country's underlying makeup while also
   giving voice to modern aspirations to protect and promote individual
   human rights, and in doing so, also becoming self-sustaining as the
   foundational basic law guiding future generations. Attention is paid not
   only to the forms of constitutions but also to their function in both
   reaching ideals (in the positive sense of success) and staving off
   pitfalls (in the negative sense of success). The article also discusses
   whether these are best achieved through gradual terms over time or
   through the sudden big bang of mega reforms.},

Abstract = {Two-generation (2Gen) initiatives-social programs that invest in both
   children and their caregivers-have been lauded for their potential to
   improve multigenerational well-being and upward mobility. 2Gen advocates
   argue that these kinds of social investments likely outperform
   investment in a single generation, because they should create spillover
   and multiplier effects that more effectively boost well-being and
   mobility from poverty. We review empirical research on 2Gen initiatives
   in education and workforce, parenting, housing, and health. While most
   2Gen initiatives either have null effects or have not been rigorously
   evaluated, there is strong evidence of positive spillover benefits to
   children when parents access programs that significantly improve family
   economic resources. We also find evidence of positive effects on both
   generations when interventions involve intensive home visiting. We
   conclude with a critique of current 2Gen initiatives, arguing that the
   focus on family skill building is insufficient to disrupt
   multigenerational poverty.},

Abstract = {Women are extremely underrepresented in Japanese political life. One
   possible reason for this is that voters are biased against women.
   Compared to American voters, to what extent are Japanese voters opposed
   to women political leaders? What kinds of stereotypes do they have about
   women politicians? To answer these questions and probe the external
   validity of American studies on this topic, we conducted a survey that
   elicits respondents' attitudes toward women political leaders. First,
   our list experiment outcomes revealed that approximately 10\% of
   Japanese, and 20\% of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) supporters,
   oppose a woman becoming prime minister. Second, we also identified
   respondents' gender stereotypes by asking them directly about their
   impressions of politicians, which revealed that Japanese voters have
   strong stereotypes for men and women politicians regarding their policy
   areas of expertise and personal characteristics. These stereotypes are
   strongest among men and older voters as well as voters who support the
   LDP. Our findings have broad implications for the literature on gender
   and politics beyond the study of Japanese politics.},

Abstract = {How is women's engagement in armed insurgency shaped by intimacy? This
   article seeks to answer this question by exploring how political
   struggle for women is caught up in the entanglements of the intimate and
   the political. Drawing on fieldwork on the Bangsamoro conflict in
   Mindanao, Philippines, it analyzes four women's stories about their
   trajectories as insurgents. Their accounts reveal that relational ties
   of kin, community, and marriage bound them to the insurgency and
   preceded ideological commitment; however, these relational ties also
   ruptured their involvement. Moreover, collective and personal closeness
   with war made political struggle an inevitable part of growing up and
   surviving. Contradictory commitments, dilemmas, and disruptions in their
   relational lives caused by critical events of conflict are read in the
   women's political participation. The article's conceptual answer is an
   intimate politics of insurgency, which underwrites women's engagement
   and, more importantly, their maneuvers to fulfill conflicting political,
   ideological, relational, and gendered obligations. Intimate politics, I
   argue, brings attention to women's work of unsettling and remaking
   boundaries between the intimate/private and the political/public, which
   allows them to reconcile continued political action and life as a whole
   inside conflict.},

Abstract = {In this essay, we first briefly recount the post-Soviet history of
   social science in Russia, with particular attention to the role of
   international collaborations in spurring its growth, and we review the
   accelerating attacks on university autonomy and international
   collaborations that preceded Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine in
   February 2022. Then we consider developments since the February 2022
   invasion that, in our view, signal the demise of academic freedom. We
   consider how Russia-based social scientists have negotiated the mounting
   challenges to the practice of their craft. We draw on interviews with
   Russian and American social scientists involved in international
   collaborations conducted in summer 2021 and interviews with Russian
   social scientists carried out in spring and summer 2022, as well as
   scholarly and journalistic accounts of developments within Russian
   universities and research institutes.},

Title = {Revolutionary pills? Feminist abortion, pharmaceuticalization, and
   reproductive governance},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 13},
Abstract = {This article was named the winner of the 2021 Enloe Award. The committee
   commented:This article embodies the spirit of the Enloe Award by helping
   us conceptualize self-medication abortion as a part of ``reproductive
   governance,{''} or how multiple actors beyond the state participate in
   providing and facilitating reproductive health care. This framework is
   crucial to understanding that access to abortion pills certainly can
   increase bodily autonomy, illustrating the effectiveness of grassroots
   feminist activists in meeting the needs of those who wish to terminate
   pregnancies. At the same time, the manufacturing and distribution of the
   pills also empower a whole host of actors that promote corporatized
   care, neoliberal agency, and population management. The article stood
   out to the committee as an original and exciting feminist intervention
   in global conversations about abortion access, and we commend the author
   for the strong theoretical framework, robust methodological approach
   involving ethnographic research in Mexico, and provocative insights.This
   article examines two pills that are used to induce abortion in the
   context of feminist ``accompaniment{''} for self-managed abortion
   practice in Mexico: misoprostol and mifepristone. For many feminist
   activists, abortion pills facilitate bodily autonomy in contexts where
   abortion is legally and socially criminalized. However, my ethnographic
   research demonstrates that pills are also ``territorialized{''} through
   assemblages of pharmaceuticalized medicine, where private-sector and
   civil-society organizations have become protagonists in the provision of
   abortion health care and the governance of reproductive conduct.
   Feminist abortion accompaniment works to remedy these limitations by
   ``reterritorializing{''} pills into new assemblages with practices
   grounded in principles of solidarity, justice, and bodily autonomy. It
   is only through these practices that abortion pills become truly
   revolutionary.},

Abstract = {This article examines the determinants of public opinion on
   differentiated integration (DI) in the European Union (EU).
   Specifically, it tests whether citizen attitudes are informed by the
   national experience of opt-outs and exclusions from full participation
   in EU policies. The study generally finds that support for DI strongly
   depends on the mode of DI. Even though `multi-speed DI' is only
   temporary, it is evaluated more critically than durable treaty opt-outs
   establishing `multi-tier DI'. We suggest that citizens from opt-out
   countries oppose multi-speed DI out of concern that it would render
   their exemptions temporary, whereas citizens from new member states tend
   to be critical towards the often involuntary and discriminatory
   transitional arrangements that were imposed by the old member states.},

Abstract = {This article explores the indicators and targets identified in the
   Canadian Indicator Framework, a localization of the UN Sustainable
   Development Goals for the country of Canada. Applying a critical
   theoretical lens and a human rights approach, the authors explore each
   of the `ambitions' proposed by the federal government and assess their
   suitability in meeting the magnitude of transformative change that will
   be necessary to meet the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
   Development. In considering each of the Canadian ambitions proposed to
   realize Sustainable Development Goals 1 to 17, and the framework as a
   whole, the authors conclude that a business-as-usual stance has been
   applied. Many of the Canadian ambitions have `no specific target'
   identified, offering no baseline measures or concrete standards from
   which to benchmark and monitor progress. The ones that do are not
   tremendously transformative, leading to a framework that does not
   present a dramatic departure from existing policy and practice
   arrangements. The character of the Canadian ambitions to the Sustainable
   Development Goals are revealed, not as concrete change strategies, but
   as mere aspirations, albeit more for the status quo than for
   transformational action. To translate the Canadian ambitions into
   actions, human rights must be infused into the Canadian Indicator
   Framework, and these must be substantive, de facto, rights-rights that
   people can actually claim, and hold state actors accountable to.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 4},
Abstract = {Our everyday life is entangled with products and services of so-called
   Big Tech companies, such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook. International
   relations (IR) scholars increasingly seek to reflect on the
   relationships between Big Tech, capitalism, and institutionalized
   politics, and they engage with the practices of algorithmic governance
   and platformization that shape and are shaped by Big Tech. This
   collective discussion advances these emerging debates by approaching Big
   Tech transversally, meaning that we problematize Big Tech as an object
   of study and raise a range of fundamental questions about its politics.
   The contributions demonstrate how a transversal perspective that cuts
   across sociomaterial, institutional, and disciplinary boundaries and
   framings opens up the study of the politics of Big Tech. The discussion
   brings to the fore perspectives on the ontologies of Big Tech, the
   politics of the aesthetics and credibility of Big Tech and rethinks the
   concepts of legitimacy and responsibility. The article thereby provides
   several inroads for how IR and international political sociology can
   leverage their analytical engagement with Big Tech and nurture
   imaginaries of alternative and subversive technopolitical futures.},

Title = {The Dislocation of LGBT Politics: Pride, Globalization, and
   Geo-Temporality in Uganda and Serbia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 4},
Abstract = {Scholars consider the translatability and efficacy of ``western{''} LGBT
   politics as they diffuse, but pay little attention to the role of its
   histories and cultures as geo-temporal phenomena. Focusing on Pride
   events, this article demonstrates how such oversights inhibit a full
   account of the widely diverse impacts of similar actions in different
   places. We explore the ways in which Pride events, as a mode of
   activism, go global and integrate in vastly different contexts: Serbia
   and Uganda. Paying particular attention to acts of violence and the
   instrumentalization of Pride as geopolitical, we argue that divergent
   outcomes connect to the diffusion of Pride as creative of geo-temporal
   dislocations of politics and history. Incorporating the concept of
   extraversion, we demonstrate that the intertwining of the domestic and
   international facilitates the transformation of politics in terms of
   foreseen outcomes and unintended consequences. Overall, we propose a
   framework that advances an understanding of homophobic and homophilic
   politics as instrumentalizations of geo-temporal dislocations that
   underpin the global fight for LGBT rights. As a challenge to the
   progress narrative nearly intrinsic to western international relations,
   this approach is useful to explore processes that shape other types of
   transnational politics, such as democracy, climate change, and peace
   movements.},

Abstract = {This chapter discusses the linguistic history of the Paraguayan Chaco
   focusing on the current state of Indigenous languages and communities in
   the region. An overview of the linguistic landscape given the current
   state of research is provided, including linguistic classifications,
   language vitality, a discussion of (mis)naming, and the relationship
   between current language communities and ethnic groups. Some
   sociopolitical forces that influence Indigenous communities are
   identified, which includes a discussion of Indigenous language policy
   which promotes Paraguayan Guarani but marginalizes the minority
   Indigenous languages of the country. The history of dispossession and
   displacement of Indigenous peoples in the Chaco is reflected in
   contemporary efforts by Indigenous people to regain their land rights
   and cultural and linguistic autonomy. Given that research on the
   Indigenous languages of Paraguay is still a developing field and the
   languages of the Paraguayan Chaco are still largely under-described,
   this work is important in that it presents the current state of research
   on these languages and offers a counter-narrative to the national
   discussion of Indigenous languages in Paraguay.},

Abstract = {While social media data are used increasingly in studies of social
   movements, social media evolves far more rapidly than academic research
   and publication. This chapter argues that researchers should adopt
   historical and archival approaches to social media data. Treating social
   media data as an ``instant archive{''} - one that is self-curated, is
   co-constituted, and changes rapidly - we caution researchers to pay
   attention to the features of this archive and their implications for
   working with the data therein. Applying insights from recent discussions
   of archival methods for social science research to the specific features
   of social media data, we explore how platform features, repressive
   effects, and user innovations affect the content of the instant archive.
   We then offer strategies for researchers' methodological approaches,
   including how best to select units of analysis and platforms, how to
   collect and interpret archival materials, and how to identify silences
   in the data.},

Abstract = {This article is a historiographic review of the literature on the
   Olympic Games and the Cold War. The topic has been a growth area among
   scholars of both diplomatic history and the history of sports over the
   past three decades. Most of the literature has been in English, but a
   significant amount of work has appeared in French, German, and a few
   other languages. Despite the proliferation and richness of the
   historiography, some large gaps in coverage still exist, and some
   important issues still need to be explored.},

Abstract = {This paper looks at the possibilities of fiction in understanding
   intelligence, taking two female 20th century writers as case studies,
   Barbara Pym, and Muriel Spark. It considers how they did or did not draw
   on their wartime experience in their fiction. It asks why fiction still
   matters in an era of ever-more accessible archives and public records.
   It concludes that authorial choice, self-censorship, redacting and
   editing by others suppressed Barbara Pym's official wartime experience
   as an Examiner or censor. It suggests that the role was undervalued both
   at the time and subsequently as a source of intelligence. The paper
   concludes that Muriel Spark exploited to the full a short exposure to
   black propaganda, highlighting how three of her works of fiction offer
   readers insights into ethical questions of deception, manipulation, and
   surveillance.},

Abstract = {Behavioural economics works toward more realistic accounts of economic
   action, which includes efforts to endogenise the `social'. In its social
   strand, behavioural economics is specifically concerned with fair
   outcomes in interactive economic games, which are explained by reference
   to social preferences, norms and institutions. While these concepts also
   matter to scholars in political economy and socioeconomics, behavioural
   economists seek to go further in specifying their behavioural and
   evolutionary foundations. This article critically evaluates evolutionary
   research strategies in the social strand of behavioural economics, which
   aim to uncover the evolutionary origins of fairness in economic
   experiments. Representatives of this field offer new support for the
   classical idea of `doux commerce', or the civilising function of
   markets, by suggesting that cooperation with strangers in economic
   exchange fundamentally shaped the course of human evolution. Their
   explanatory framework is gene-culture coevolution, which covers long
   timespans of human existence. However, the case for the virtuous effect
   of markets in human prehistory remains ambiguous: basic concepts, causal
   mechanisms, and timescales of analysis vary to an extent that it is
   possible to arrive at very different projections of `doux commerce' into
   the past. With regard to the present, these fulfil a similar function in
   naturalising market moralities.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND GENDER},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 23},
Abstract = {A growing body of research recognizes the impact of gender on social
   movement activity. Yet, far less attention has focused on the deployment
   of repressive methods in a gendered manner. The study contributes to
   comparative politics literature by proposing a typology of repression.
   At the start of mass mobilization, state authorities tend to invoke
   patriarchal norms to ridicule and stigmatize activists. Next, the
   coercive apparatus targets protesters through the use of psychological
   intimidation, physical violence, and sexual violence, as well as legal
   and economic repression. At the end of protests, the police resort to
   debasement and dehumanization of jailed protesters in a gendered manner.
   Drawing on the case of Belarus, one of the most restrictive political
   regimes in Europe, the study illustrates how repressive methods are
   gendered throughout different phases of mass mobilization. The study
   seeks to expand our understanding of various ways in which individuals
   are subject to repression.},

Abstract = {Women's empowerment is now a global development objective. However, the
   instrumentalization of this approach to gender equality has prompted
   calls for research into the financing of interventions. With donors now
   reporting the gender credentials of their spending, this article follows
   the money for one region-Southeast Asia-to investigate how donors are
   engaging with women's economic empowerment. Through a systematic review,
   it identifies and codes women's economic empowerment projects. Data is
   analyzed according to geographic distribution, thematic distribution,
   and participant types. The article offers important insights into
   funding patterns and deficiencies in current reporting practices. It
   finds, first, while there is a more thematically diverse mix of projects
   being funded than indicated in previous research, women's economic
   empowerment continues to be interpreted in Southeast Asia as women's
   market inclusion, continuing the trend of instrumentalization. Second,
   and consistent with emergent research highlighting the political uses of
   aid transparency, it demonstrates that donors are engaging in gender
   wash by inadequately and incorrectly reporting project characteristics.
   By upselling their gender credentials, donors are characterizing their
   activities as advancing gender equality despite often intensifying the
   challenges faced by women, underscoring the urgent need to reform
   reporting practices.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) is a democratic organization but faces severe
   cases of democratic backsliding. The literature deems the EU a
   hospitable environment for and reluctant to reign in backsliding. This
   study focuses on the tactics that backsliding governments employ to
   preserve this hospitable environment and the conditions under which they
   succeed. I argue that backsliding governments seek to repurpose the
   practice of accommodation that permeates EU decision-making for the
   protection of their backsliding projects. Doing so promises backsliders
   an escape from their precarious bargaining position in a democratic
   organization but comes with constraints. Backsliders must limit
   opposition carefully to a subset of EU competences,
   backsliding-inhibiting competences, that threaten their backsliding
   projects the most. Moreover, they can only rely on accommodation in the
   Council if the democratic member states perceive opposition as justified
   and remain insulated from political accountability by Europe's
   parliaments. I present evidence based on quantitative and qualitative
   analyses of bargaining positions, processes, and outcomes in EU
   decision-making. The results have implications for understanding the
   EU's autocratic predicament, the opportunities of backsliding
   governments, and the role of autocracies in regional and international
   organizations.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explore the potential of art to create alternatives
   to hegemonic narratives in post-traumatic societies and the role of art
   in the re-politicization of both the artist and the audience. It
   discusses the role of art in constructing the ethics and memory of Never
   Again through the visual artworks of Guillermo Nunez (1930) and Ariel
   Dorfman's (1942) play Death and the Maiden (1990). Such artistic
   productions enable the re-participation of the traumatized body in
   political life not only through the represented story but also through
   the active reflection and agency of the art producer and the viewer. In
   this way, they contribute to making visible the passive remembering that
   is often underestimated in the battle of memories, and to transforming
   abstract and generalizing facing practices in transitional periods into
   individual and specific `face-ings.'},

Abstract = {Inclusion of the expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) in the 2021 American
   Rescue Plan was, for many, a feasibility test of the impact of a
   permanent child allowance in the U.S. The CTC expansion was short-lived,
   however, so evaluations of its effects cannot provide complete evidence
   on the long-run impacts of a permanent expansion of the benefit. Here,
   we predict the long-term effects of a permanently expanded, refundable
   CTC. We use theory from standard economic models, frameworks from
   behavioral science and child development, and empirical evidence from
   literature that has evaluated previous long-term cash and quasi-cash
   transfers to families with children. We find that provision of the
   benefit would lead to increased future adult earnings and tax payments;
   improved child health and longevity; and reduced costs in health care,
   crime, and child protection. We predict that benefits to society would
   outweigh costs nearly 10 to 1, with most benefits due to the tax
   credit's refundability.},

Abstract = {While there has been work on whether women are more tolerant of
   outgroups, the ethnic politics literature has generally overlooked the
   role of gender in explaining interethnic trust. Whatever attention
   exists often focuses on the gender of the subject-that is, who is doing
   the trusting-with mixed results. One reason is that the object being
   entrusted is either not specified or assumed genderless. In this paper,
   we call attention to the gender of an important entrusted object in
   interethnic relations: children. We argue people are less willing to
   have their daughters-compared to their sons-marry an ethnic outgroup.
   Additionally, this willingness declines as the cultural distance widens.
   We test this using a survey experiment in Romania where we leverage the
   diversity in ethnicity and a gendered language structure. Our results
   highlight the importance of accounting for gender-based differences in
   studying interethnic trust.},

Abstract = {The growing influence of social media platforms, and the disinformation
   that circulates in them, has transformed the public spheres. How to deal
   with disinformation is an open normative, empirical and political
   question in contemporary democracies. In this article, we outline an
   agenda on the institutional strategies pursued in the European Union
   (EU), the normative understandings of the public sphere that such
   strategies imply, and the analytical challenges to undertake this line
   of inquiry. We argue that there is an emerging competition in the EU
   field of disinformation - constructed by actors coming from different
   pre-existing fields, such as journalism or foreign policy - not only to
   define what is `true' from what is `fake', but also to determine the
   sort of the public sphere and democracy we ought to strive for. This
   perspective allows us to anticipate which actors might be empowered (or
   disempowered) depending on how disinformation is addressed in regulatory
   terms.},

Journal = {NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {The article argues for taking political economy seriously in the study
   of corporate accountability in transitional justice processes. Corporate
   actors are now commonly involved in transitional justice (that is,
   attempts at doing justice in the aftermath of mass violence). However,
   the literature is still limited by an inclination to treat political
   economy as context, rather than as a structuring factor intervening both
   on the war-related or authoritarian violence and on the efforts to make
   corporate actors accountable. This article proposes three shifts towards
   a better understanding of the political economy of corporate
   accountability in TJ: from a focus on the proximate economic causes of
   war to a genealogical view of pre-war, wartime and post-war economies;
   towards a more holistic view of conflict financing; and from an emphasis
   on the political economy of war to the political economy of violence.
   These shifts allow us to analyse a greater variety of political
   economies of corporate accountability, address more diffuse
   responsibilities for violence and injustice, and cover forms of violence
   that extend over longer periods of time. While holding broader relevance
   for the field, the arguments are illustrated with reference to the
   former Yugoslav region and the Bosnian War.},

Abstract = {Throughout the past decades, the EU's agency landscape has continuously
   expanded in size and scope. In this article, we address the lack of
   longitudinal data on EU agencies' formal independence. We introduce a
   newly revised index to measure the formal independence of EU agencies
   from other EU institutions over time. Applying a rules-as-data approach
   we coded 206 regulations and amendments to develop a new dataset
   covering the formal independence of all 39 EU agencies from 1975 to
   2022. This longitudinal overview provides first insights about the
   development of formal independence at the case and population levels. At
   the case level we identify frequent, albeit gradual reforms of EU
   agencies' independence. At the population level, we observe remarkable
   stability in overall independence, but find stark variation across
   different independence dimensions. Overall, EU-level principals have
   shifted over time from controlling individual decisions to controlling
   the agencies' general decision-making apparatus.},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Despite it being not only central to the politics of critical studies on
   men and masculinities but also one of Connell's four patterns of
   masculinity developed alongside the now-canonical `hegemonic
   masculinity', the concept of `complicit masculinity' has received little
   attention. This article suggests that complicit masculinities should be
   understood as political masculinities, in that they are from the
   beginning shaped by the existing politics and power relations that
   construct gender. This means acknowledging that masculinities are always
   at risk of complicity. Rather than this rendering the notion of
   `complicit masculinities' redundant, I draw on a range of critical
   studies on men and masculinities to argue that identifying complicity as
   a feature of masculinities: first, allows us to identify three
   interrelated dimensions of complicity, which I label as `intentional',
   `structural' and `intersectional' complicity; and, second, can serve as
   the starting point for a men's profeminist politics.},

Abstract = {This article critically explores tensions concerning development from
   contemporary feminist thought and praxis in Latin America. In Ecuador,
   development is seen as an outdated and irrelevant theoretical framework
   from a variety of feminist perspectives, including feminist political
   ecology and decolonial feminisms. Nevertheless, development discourse
   and practices persist and are central to public policy with a gender
   focus throughout the country. This results in tensions between
   governmental and autonomous feminist perspectives that are present in
   local spaces, such as the province of Esmeraldas in Northern Ecuador.
   Drawing on research conducted with Afro-Ecuadorian peer researchers,
   including interviews, oral histories and social-cartography methods,
   this article will demonstrate how Afro-Ecuadorian women are challenging
   dominant ideas and practices of development from the emerging ideas of
   Black feminism in Ecuador and moving towards a Black feminist political
   ecology in the Americas.},

Title = {Realizing a blockchain solution without blockchain? Blockchain,
   solutionism, and trust},
Journal = {REGULATION \& GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {789-805},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Blockchain is employed as a technology holding a solutionist promise,
   while at the same time, it is hard for the promissory blockchain
   applications to become realized. Not only is the blockchain protocol
   itself not foolproof, but when we move from ``blockchain in general{''}
   to ``blockchain in particular,{''} we see that new governance structures
   and ways of collaborating need to be developed to make blockchain
   applications work/become real. The qualities ascribed to (blockchain)
   technology in abstracto are not to be taken for granted in blockchain
   applications in concreto. The problem of trust, therefore, does not
   become redundant simply through the employment of ``trustless{''}
   blockchain technology. Rather, on different levels, new trust relations
   have to be constituted. In this article, we argue that blockchain is a
   productive force, even if it does not solve the problem of trust, and
   sometimes regardless of blockchain technology not implemented after all.
   The values that underpin this seemingly ``trustless technology{''} such
   as control, efficiency, and privacy and the story that is told about
   these values co-shape the actions of stakeholders and, to a certain
   extent, pre-sort the path of application development. We will illustrate
   this by presenting a case study on the Red Button (De Rode Knop), a
   Dutch pilot to develop a blockchain-based solution that enables people
   who are in debt to communicate to their creditors that they are,
   together with the municipality, working on improving their situation,
   thereby requesting a temporary suspension from debt collection.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the popular image of the nuclear future of
   Czechoslovakia in the mid-1950s and analyzes the push for a
   Czechoslovak-Soviet nuclear utopia. The article describes the foreign
   orientation of Czechoslovakia's nuclear research through 1955 and the
   first joint nuclear activities between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet
   Union. The article also shows how Czechoslovak-Soviet friendship was
   integrated in practice into the image of the peaceful use of nuclear
   energy, and it analyzes the image of civilian nuclear activities that
   was presented to Czechs and Slovaks in a campaign of popularization in
   the mid-1950s. Soviet ``nuclear assistance{''} to Czechoslovakia,
   announced in January 1955, corresponded with a change in the popular
   vision of the nuclear age in Czechoslovakia when a remote nuclear future
   was transformed into a ``lived utopia.{''}},

Abstract = {John le Carre is credited with re-defining spy fiction into something
   widely considered as more `authentic'. His work emerged during a period
   replete with spy scandals and public investigations. This article
   considers the intersection of the public history of intelligence with le
   Carre's early novels, particularly The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. It
   reveals how the author drew creatively on that public history to shape
   his narratives and underpin the mood of his stories. Finally, it probes
   the `insider knowledge' in the stories, illustrating that, contrary to
   le Carre's protestations, there exists a demonstrable correspondence
   between fact and fiction.},

Abstract = {This article presents a textual analysis of areas of convergence and
   divergence between the United Nations (UN) Framework for the Immediate
   Socio-Economic Response to COVID-19 and the six National Action Plans
   (NAPs) on Women, Peace and Security (WPS) of the Arab States region. The
   article contributes to debates on the centering or sidelining of gender
   analysis and planning in crisis response to the nexus between COVID-19
   and gender, peace, and security. Gender and gender planning inform the
   textual analysis, which shows that there are significant areas of
   overlap between the UN COVID-19 Framework and the NAPs. Divergences,
   such as the greater emphasis on economic recovery in the UN COVID-19
   Framework, expose the gaps in engagement with the socio-economic and
   subsistence harms in the WPS agenda. Given the impact of the COVID-19
   crisis, and the expectation of future novel outbreaks, the article
   provides evidence that rather than sidelining gender in times of crisis,
   existing tools such as NAPs should be centered in planning responses.},

Abstract = {The study of intelligence oversight captures the inherently political
   nature of secret intelligence. However, many studies of intelligence
   oversight adopt rather instrumentalist views that omit important
   political aspects of the policy process. Typically, these studies focus
   on obstacles to effective oversight. This article discusses how the
   effectiveness of oversight can be assessed by applying broad evaluative
   categories that contain programmatic, process-related, political, and
   durability dimensions. Empirically, the study probes the case of Sweden
   as an illustration. Swedish oversight arrangements have on balance been
   successful in some dimensions, particularly the programmatic dimension,
   which arguably also contributed to its relative longevity.},

Abstract = {The study attempts to explain the determined resistance of Ukrainians to
   Russia's aggression based on empirical data from a survey of Ukraine's
   population obtained on the eve of Russia's full-scale invasion. The
   willingness to resist has been determined by societal identity, which
   combines pro-Western orientations and Ukrainian-speaking identity. At
   the same time, factors of regional affiliation and linguistic behavior
   were not found to have influence. An indicator that ranks respondents'
   possible reaction to the war showed the differentiated nature of
   Ukrainians' willingness to resist. The willingness to engage in various
   types of struggle was conditioned by distinct gender roles and
   socioeconomic resources. This explains the comprehensive scope and mass
   character of Ukrainian resistance to the war. The societal will to fight
   was manifested among the Ukrainian military and spread to civilians.},

Abstract = {State aid rules are an important part of the European Union's (EU)
   competition policy that aims to ensure a fair competition in the common
   market. These rules directly affect national and sub-national
   governments of member states, which are sometimes confronted with
   different and opposing claims about what to do. The question is how
   implementing civil servants interpret and resolve these claims in
   practice. In this article, discourse analysis is applied to identify how
   civil servants apply and interpret state aid rules based on empirical
   research in the Netherlands. The main finding is that, even within the
   existing regulatory framework of one member state, the application of
   state aid rules is understood differently based on the discourses we
   identified. We describe the content, dissemination amongst civil
   servants and the relationship of these discourses with compliance. The
   article shows that discourses matter and help to understand how state
   aid rules are applied.},

Abstract = {Opinion polls suggest that Vladimir Putin has broad support in Russia,
   but there are concerns that some respondents may be lying to pollsters.
   Using list experiments, we revisit our earlier work on support for Putin
   to explore his popularity between late 2020 and mid-2022. Our findings
   paint an ambiguous portrait. A naive interpretation of our estimates
   implies that Putin was 10 to 20 percentage points less popular than
   opinion polls suggest. However, results from placebo experiments
   demonstrate that these estimates are likely subject to artificial
   deflation - a design effect that produces downward bias in estimates
   from list experiments. Although we cannot be definitive, on balance our
   results are consistent with the conclusion that Putin is roughly as
   popular as opinion polls suggest. Methodologically, our research
   highlights artificial deflation as a key limitation of list experiments
   and the importance of placebo lists as a tool to diagnose this problem.},

Abstract = {This article offers an alternative approach to measuring the distance
   between parties. It is aimed to introduce the Manhattan metric and
   hierarchical cluster analysis. These analytical tools measure
   differences based on parties' voting in parliament rather than
   ideological distance (polarisation). Through these tools, I delineate
   distances between parties in the Czech Republic after 2017 and reflect
   on the purpose of pre-electoral `anti-Babis' coalitions emerging in
   October 2020. The analysis shows that incentives to form alliances were
   primarily strategic rather than a sign of any pre-existing trend towards
   cooperation in parliament.},

Abstract = {Preschool policy is motivated by the notion that early childhood care
   and education increases school readiness, which, in turn, provides a
   foundation for lifelong advantages and greater success in adulthood. We
   question the degree to which this simple skill-building model is an
   effective framework for preschool policy: while investments in preschool
   education boost school readiness in the short run, some recent studies
   show that initial gains either quickly disappear or turn negative.
   Taking advantage of end-of-preschool gains requires considerable effort
   toward optimizing classroom learning experiences, integrating the
   learning goals of preschool and K-12 schooling, and pushing for new
   discoveries about early-life skills and capacities that preschools are
   uniquely positioned to target. Supporting parental employment and access
   to affordable childcare also benefit child development, so we argue that
   the preschool policy portfolio should include mechanisms that more
   broadly expand childcare access to support family capacities.},

Abstract = {Multilateralism is in crisis. States increasingly contest, undermine and
   even withdraw from international organisations and other multilateral
   institutions. Challenges emanate not only from emerging powers but also
   from established Western states and civil society. No other actor but
   the EU is more intimately entangled with multilateralism. This article
   therefore reviews to what extent and how the EU has actively sustained
   multilateral institutions since 2016. It identifies three types of
   mechanisms: the defence, reform and extension of multilateral
   institutions. Based on interviews with senior officials in the EU
   institutions and the member states, the article finds that the EU has
   proven to be rather successful in temporarily defending existing
   institutions. However, it largely failed to reform multilateral
   institutions and extend multilateral institutions to new areas. In doing
   so, the article contributes to our understanding of the EU as a foreign
   policy actor and the processes of the crisis of multilateralism.},

Abstract = {This article argues that, given the centrality of gender for recent
   processes of autocratisation, it has become imperative to understand and
   theorise the conditions underpinning democratic resilience against
   opposition to gender equality. I conceptualise democratic resilience as
   the outcome of critical actors'efforts to represent marginalised groups
   in the face of threats to existing gender equality rights. The case
   study is Romania's 2020 `gender identity' bill, which would have
   prohibited discussion of `gender' within the educational system but was
   eventually ruled unconstitutional. I identify two key causal mechanisms
   through which civil society organisations were able to shape this
   outcome:framing, which emphasised the bill's non-compliance with
   democratic norms and constitutional principles; and learning, which
   prompted a reflection by the two key institutional actors, that is, the
   president and the Constitutional Court, as to the importance of core
   democratic principles for politics and society in post-communist
   Romania.},
