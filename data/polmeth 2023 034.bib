Abstract = {Amid a relative withdrawal of western, liberal states from the Middle
   East, the United Arab Emirates have taken over some of the burden of
   regional security assistance - doing so redefining norms and practices
   of security assistance. Unlike western counterparts, the UAE are
   investing into security assistance in Libya or Yemen, not so much as a
   means of state and nation-building overseas, but as means of building
   networks allowing the small state to project influence and power with
   few normative strings attached. More so, the UAE deliver security
   assistance via surrogates as discrete means of statecraft allowing Abu
   Dhabi to compete overseas with plausible deniability. Many of these
   surrogates do not only challenge the state's monopoly over violence but
   ultimately undermine legitimate government institutions by creating
   alternative forms of security sector-based governance. Ultimately, the
   UAE's approach to security assistance is based on divide-and-rule,
   ripening particularly potent networks of surrogates over others to
   ensure that competitors are unable to secure their interests.},

Abstract = {This research aims to identify values related to political and civic
   participation methods among the two groups of radicalised youngsters:
   native youth who support movements labelled as far-right (N= 122) and
   migrant-origin self-identified Muslim youth with strong organisational
   ties with religious communities (N=109) in Germany, Belgium, France, and
   the Netherlands. The study posits that these these radically aligned
   youngsters position themselves against politically moderate European
   citizens, who are less intuitive when making judgements on political
   affairs comparing to them. Diverging from the unifying European values
   and hypersensitivities, these youngsters' political reactions are often
   radical and loud in their safe-to-speak, segregated movements. By using
   the narrations of the range of mainstream modes of political
   participation, the current qualitative research asks what appears
   valuable for the two groups of young people to express their political
   discontent. Findings revealed that both groups highlighted similar
   values regarding voting. Self-identified Muslim youth stressed the
   importance of volunteering and street protests (despite not having
   participated in one). Many native youths, on the other hand, stressed
   the function of unlawful behaviour in street protests to pursue
   political objectives. The findings such as these are discussed
   considering the group differences.},

Abstract = {Divided towns are specific urban units that were once single cities
   before their subsequent division through the drawing of new state
   borders based on arbitrary political decisions. The specific nature of
   such towns thus originates primarily from their common history and their
   location on a border. This article focuses on two examples from Central
   and Eastern Europe, one situated on the Polish-Czech border (Cieszyn and
   CeskATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE Tesin) and the other on the
   Polish-German border (Slubice and Frankfurt an der Oder), in order to
   provide a comparative analysis of cross-border cooperation. Based on an
   analysis of secondary data and literature, we explore the factors deemed
   most essential in the literature for the integration of and cooperation
   between divided towns today - namely historical legacies, cultural and
   political factors, (a)symmetries and border/periphery locations - to
   investigate what similarities and differences can be observed in the
   analysed towns.},

Abstract = {Interest group ideology is theoretically and empirically critical in the
   study of American politics, yet our measurement of this key concept is
   lacking both in scope and time. By leveraging network science and ideal
   point estimation, we provide a novel measure of ideology for amicus
   curiae briefs and organized interests with accompanying uncertainty
   estimates. Our Amicus Curiae Network scores cover more than 12,000
   unique groups and more than 11,000 briefs across 95 years, providing the
   largest and longest measure of organized interest ideologies to date.
   Substantively, the scores reveal that: interests before the Court are
   ideologically polarized, despite variance in their coalition strategies;
   interests that donate to campaigns are more conservative and balanced
   than those that do not; and amicus curiae briefs were more common from
   liberal organizations until the 1980s, with ideological representation
   virtually balanced since then.},

Abstract = {The proposed sale of the Norwegian company Bergen Engines (BE) in
   2020-2021 from Rolls Royce, UK, to Russian-controlled Transmashholding,
   listed for US sanctions, would have increased Russian military
   capability in a way that was not consistent with Norwegian or NATO
   security interests. Yet, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
   initially had no objections. In the New Cold War situation, lessons from
   this case are relevant beyond Norway as regulatory loopholes can be
   exploited by non-allied powers. This article integrates perspectives
   from intelligence and organisation theory, using public documents as
   data, to analyse the BE case processing, its compliance with the
   established regulatory framework, sanctions and public threat
   assessments to understand and explain why the sale to sanctioned
   Russian-controlled entity was not administratively stopped, under the
   Export Controls Act or as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) under the
   Security Act, before the decision-making process escalated into public
   scrutiny and parliamentary critique. This article suggests that
   regulatory frameworks for Norwegian Export Controls and FDI need to be
   strengthened and reorganised. It is also important to define and
   operationalise considerations to national security across ministries in
   Norway. Joint operationalisation is also relevant for NATO and the EU in
   the current security situation.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyze trends in Americans' immigration attitudes and
   policy preferences nationally and across partisan and racial/ethnic
   groups. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Democrats and Republicans shared
   similarly negative attitudes toward immigrants and high levels of
   support for restrictionist immigration policies. Beginning in the 2010s
   and continuing through the early 2020s, however, Democrats' aggregate
   immigration opinions liberalized considerably. We observed increasingly
   liberal immigration preferences among Democrats of all racial and ethnic
   backgrounds after 2016, but this trend was especially pronounced among
   white Democrats. Among Republicans, opinion on immigration remained
   mostly stable over this period, although in some cases it became more
   conservative (e.g., border security) and more liberal on others (e.g.,
   amnesty). The marked liberalization in immigration opinion among
   Democrats has left partisans more divided on immigration than at any
   point since national surveys began consistently measuring immigration
   opinion in the late twentieth century.},

Abstract = {Which factors influence bilateral counterterrorism (CT) cooperation
   between EU Member States? Although scholars have studied European CT,
   the question still needs to be answered. This paper addresses the issue
   by introducing a new theoretical framework that combines CT and Foreign
   Policy Analysis (FPA) literature. As citizens' threat perception
   increases, governments are pressed to act. Overall, centrist cabinets
   tend to rely more on cooperation agreements; likewise, pushed by threat
   perception, left-wing executives also recourse to international
   cooperation. I tested this framework on a newly collected dataset, which
   comprehends bilateral CT agreements signed among EU Members from 2002 to
   2017. As such, this paper fosters studies on EU CT, focusing on a less
   debated issue: bilateral cooperation between EU Member States. The
   results support the initial hypotheses, disclosing a robust influence of
   threat perception and cabinet ideology on the number of bilateral CT
   agreements signed. Furthermore, they show that the perception of the
   threat is more influential on cooperation than the actual impact of
   terrorism.},

Abstract = {This article explores the major drivers, constraints, and prospects for
   the rapidly growing Sino-Saudi relations, and argues that such a
   development should be deemed as the embodiment of the strategy of
   `changing the focus while keeping the balance' that both Beijing and
   Riyadh have been implementing in years. While maintaining friendly
   gestures towards all Arab states, President Xi Jinping's 2022 visit to
   Saudi Arabia demonstrates that Beijing has shifted its focus on the Arab
   world away from the Mediterranean to the Gulf region, both economically
   and politically. On the other hand, as Riyadh's rapprochement with the
   Biden administration has been slow to make significant progress, Saudi
   Arabia has also accelerated its pace of `looking east' while cautiously
   keeping traditional ties with the West. A robust, stable, and preferably
   more transparent relationship between China and Saudi Arabia might help
   mitigate the potential for direct Sino-US confrontation and Gulf
   tensions, benefiting not only the Middle East and the Mediterranean
   region but, against the backdrop of the Ukraine war, more economies at
   both ends of Eurasia.},

Abstract = {The focus on inclusive development within the 2030 Agenda highlights the
   contradiction between an inherent `business-as-usual' approach subject
   to a few restrictions and a radical reformation of the global system.
   Inclusive development is elaborated through the idea of leaving no one
   behind, a human rights and a justice approach. Against this background,
   this perspective argues that there is need for clarity about the words
   used and about the implications of the words used. It defines
   inclusiveness to imply social, ecological and relational elements; that
   inclusiveness is not incorporation of the `other' but based on
   recognition and epistemic justice; and that inclusiveness redefines the
   content of development. It argues that justice needs to be unpacked into
   issues of access to minimum resources and allocation of the remaining
   resources, risks and responsibilities. Achieving access in an unequal
   world will lead to crossing Earth system boundaries and is affected by
   increasing pollution. Both imply that access cannot be met without
   changing rules of allocation, with market-based allocation reproducing
   injustices. Finally, while inclusiveness requires greater partnership
   and responsibility, this is undermined by the way the 2030 Agenda
   ignores liability for harm caused to others. Sharpening the
   understanding of inclusion and justice among key stakeholders and a
   better articulation of the Earth system justice approach is a way
   forward.},

Abstract = {When taking an active part in international climate governance, the
   Chinese government places emphasis in the legislation on addressing
   climate change, which is the key process to make climate change policy
   propelled actively. This article aims to explore how to establish
   China's climate change legislation system in the post-Paris era, to
   achieve China's goal of ``carbon peak and carbon neutralization,{''} and
   better fulfill the emission reduction obligations under the Paris
   Agreement. Drawing on approaches suggested by the Dawes Matrix, to
   explain a climate law system which is based on ``three integrated
   layers{''} in China, this article proposes the core layer of
   policy-oriented integrated climate change law, the most significant
   layer for the legislation on mitigation and adaptation, the supportive
   layer involving safeguard system related to various administration
   regulations, department measures and local legislation, as well as
   relevant guide policies of climate change.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between individuals' attitudes
   towards fairness and their views about tax compliance in developing
   countries. It argues that individuals' attitudes regarding fairness
   shape their views about paying taxes and their ethical stances regarding
   tax evasion. Using survey data for 18 major cities in Latin America, we
   find that individuals who are highly sensitive to fairness are less
   likely to consider paying taxes as a civic duty and more likely to
   justify tax evasion. These attitudes toward tax compliance are not
   inelastic. We also find evidence that individualst argues about
   reciprocity and merit mediate the effect of fairness on personal views
   about tax compliance. Finally, this paper shows that the heuristics
   people use to explain their position in the income distribution make
   them sensitive to inequality, and it affects their tax morale. These
   findings help us better understand the concept of reciprocity and
   provide valuable lessons on the urgent task of expanding fiscal capacity
   to promote economic growth and inequality in developing countries.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Union's (EU) member states
   operationalized different methods to control the virus. By April 2022,
   the EU countries recorded considerably different COVID-19 related
   deaths. In this study, we investigate whether trust in government and in
   the medical staff, COVID-19 related transparency, and different mixes of
   these two, influenced the capacity of sixteen EU countries to manage the
   pandemic. To substantiate our inquiry, we utilize a modified version of
   the Trust-Transparency Matrix. Our study suggests that trust and
   transparency, in the context of the pandemic, operate as contextual
   variables of effective public management. The value of the
   trust-transparency framework is to elucidate general governance dynamics
   and to identify those that are the most pertinent in terms of the
   response to the pandemic.},

Abstract = {Do international remittances increase government tax income in
   developing economies? This study investigates remittances' relationship
   to revenue within Latin American countries. The author builds on recent
   micro-level research by conceptualizing households with remittances as a
   transnational dispersed interest group in the political economy of
   taxation. Remittances increase recipients' wealth and decouple their
   well-being from domestic economic processes. Together, these effects
   suggest that remittances generate tax preferences that align more
   closely with promarket tax policies offered by the political right while
   decreasing the value of social protection expenditures. The author
   hypothesizes that these effects lead remittances to boost tax revenue
   when the right governs, but not the left. However, shifts to the left
   limit remittances' effect on revenue by decreasing income from direct
   taxes on wealth. Results from time-series error correction models, an
   event-study analysis, and twostage least squares models support these
   expectations.},

Abstract = {The productive inclusion of local communities is one of the main
   challenges to sustainable rural development in the Amazon. Existing
   development initiatives often prioritize projects with exogenous
   production systems; thus, local systems are overlooked, despite their
   large coverage. Based on surveys conducted in 107 riparian communities
   and detailed case studies in eight communities doing ranching, logging,
   and fishing, this study describes local management systems developed by
   rural communities in the confluence between the Amazon and Xingu Rivers.
   The study showed that (1) local management systems for buffalo ranching,
   logging, and fishing agreements were found in 61\%, 60\%, and 21\% of
   the 107 riparian communities, respectively; (2) these systems are based
   on local know-how and on technological solutions that are locally
   available; and (3) the improvement and consolidation of these local
   systems require governmental support. The study reveals that local and
   traditional farming practices may underpin sustainable development in
   the Amazon.},

Abstract = {This article explores the interplay between populism and crisis from a
   comparative perspective. While the dominant literature largely takes
   crisis for granted, and thus neglects its underlying nature, we
   undertake a detailed investigation of the crisis of representation in
   Turkey and the 2009 Greek crisis. Adapting Benjamin Moffitt's model of
   the populist performance of crisis to Erdogan's Justice and Development
   Party (AKP) (Turkey) and Tsipras' Syriza (Greece), we argue, first, that
   the ideological core of populist parties plays a crucial role in almost
   all stages of the populist performance of crisis. Second, we show that
   structural political - economic conditions put certain limits on the
   populist performance of crisis. Finally, we suggest that Moffitt's model
   needs to be revised in light of our findings.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to examine the use of the OSCE Moscow
   Mechanism in the war in Ukraine. Following this brief introduction, the
   first section is devoted to OSCE mechanisms in general, with special
   emphasis on the Moscow Mechanism. Against this background, section two
   presents and analyses the conclusions of the reports of the OSCE
   missions to Ukraine. Finally, in the conclusions, the authors point to
   the value of the Moscow Mechanism and its meaning for peaceful
   resolution of conflicts and international security. The research method
   consists of formal-legal analysis of legal acts such as the Geneva
   Conventions on the protection of victims of armed conflicts (1949) and
   Additional Protocol I on the protection of victims of international
   armed conflicts (1977) as well as reports of the OSCE expert missions
   and NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.},

Abstract = {Existing accounts of Kurdish nationalism can be mapped onto the main
   theories of nationalism, that is, primordialism, ethnosymbolism and
   modernism. These theories, however, suffer, respectively, from
   essentialism, circularity and aporia, manifest in their common inability
   to digest the Janus-like character of nations, that is, their display of
   simultaneous modernity and antiquity. This paper develops an alternative
   account through a critical application of the theory of `uneven and
   combined development' (UCD) to the Republic of Kurdistan of 1946. The
   argument unfolds in three steps. First, we argue that the failure of
   mainstream theories of nationalism to explain the nation's historical
   ambiguity lies in their `internalism'. Second, we show that UCD
   overcomes internalism through its plural social ontology and enables a
   retheorising of nations as interactive products of the geopolitical
   mediation of historical capitalism's expansion through societal
   multiplicity. Central to this process was the emergence of nationalism
   as a defensive and emulative ideology of geopolitical self-preservation.
   This involved reversing the sociological and political moments of the
   originary formation of the British imperial nation. We argue that this
   historical reversal underpins the Janus-like form of nations, including
   the Kurdish nation. Third, we substantiate the argument through a brief
   case study of the Republic of Kurdistan.},

Volume = {11},
Pages = {500-515},
Abstract = {Although the increasing precarisation of work is a structural trend of
   neoliberal globalisation, the gig economy has gone further on this path,
   massively relying on spurious self-employment and limiting access to
   labour rights and union protections. In this context, the legal status
   and labour conditions of platform workers have been a contentious field,
   crossed by growing protests and conflicts in several countries.
   Gradually, workers' collective action has led to organising efforts and,
   in some cases, the formation of new labour unions. This process
   developed against a challenging background, marked by notorious market
   power asymmetries, lack of legal protection and governments' reluctance
   to regulate. Also, in most countries, traditional unions' responses to
   gig workers' organising efforts have been quite ambiguous.
   This work addresses the rise and establishment of the Argentinian
   Association of Platform Workers (APP), the first union of delivery
   platform workers in Latin America. This case study will be informed by
   the power resources theory (PRT), which centres on the dynamics of power
   accumulation by workers' organisations in the context of specific
   market, institutional, associational and social conditions (R Berins
   Collier, VB Dubal, and C Carter, 2017). Moreover, this article seeks to
   advance a conceptual framework for a comparative analysis of
   unionisation across countries in order to identify the structure of
   opportunities and challenges for gig workers' organisation (S Etchemendy
   and L Perelman, 2018).},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the extreme hardship suffered by migrants crossing
   through Libya to reach Italy and Europe. The paper documents and defines
   the notion of extreme hardship and argues in favour of an ethics of care
   that provides for protection for those migrants who may not be asylum
   seekers for what concerns their initial motivation for migrating but who
   need humanitarian protection because of the harm suffered while en
   route. Starting with a normative exploration of how an ethics of care
   can and should inform the policy of countries of arrival, this paper
   analyses the specific case of Italy and the emerging case law and legal
   practice in relation to the humanitarian stay permits. Based on the
   analysis of relevant scholarly literature, policy and legal texts and
   interviews with expert informants (lawyers and judges) and taking stock
   of an innovative practice that emerged in Italy in the period 2015-2020,
   the paper also discusses similar provisions in other European countries
   and argues for the possibility to develop and codify a humanitarian
   permit, at national or also European level.},

Abstract = {The victory of the Move Forward Party (MFP) in Thailand at the May 2023
   general elections, contrary to almost all pre -election polling
   predictions,1 signalled a significant departure in Thai politics away
   from the traditional strategies of mobilizing voters. This shift
   occurred rapidly over one election cycle and is especially noteworthy
   because of the substantial influence that political networks, known as
   ``Ban yai{''} (literally, big house), and provincial dynasties have
   wielded for decades, consistently securing victories in parliamentary
   and local elections within their respective provinces.2 These dynasties
   also posed significant challenges to political newcomers unaffiliated
   with their established power structures.},

Abstract = {The growing distrust of citizens towards political parties being the
   main actors of institutionalised politics, expressed through
   anti-establishment emotions, triggers an adaptive supply-side response.
   European political scenes coexist with politicians using anti-elitist
   and people-centred rhetoric, political movements eschewing the party
   organisational format, and institutionalised parties seeking a new
   formula for their relationship with citizens. The use of populist tools
   by political newcomers and old-timers was analysed using examples from
   Poland. The main methods of the analysis include a critical analysis of
   the literature on the subject, content analysis of the statements
   presented by politicians in traditional and social media, individual
   in-depth interviews, and participant observation of political events.
   Adopting a demand-supply approach, three populist-based tactics were
   identified to gain, maintain, or regain electoral support, which make
   varying degrees of use of anti-elitism, people- or citizen-centred
   rhetoric, and anti-party resentment.},

Abstract = {While fossil fuels are a well-researched element of nationalist
   discourse, the relationship between nationalism and renewable energy has
   not yet been adequately explored. We address this gap by investigating
   the impact of the energy transition on the Scottish National Party's
   (SNP) discourse between 1983 and 2021. Through an analysis of SNP
   manifestos and speeches, we discursively trace the evolution of three
   pertinent amalgams of nationalism-green nationalism, resource
   nationalism and techno-nationalism-revealing renewable energy to have
   been co-opted and deployed in all three. Rather than the energy
   transition intuitively resulting in the decline of fossil fuel-based
   nationalisms in favour of those rooted in an emergent renewable energy
   paradigm, we find that adaptations in the SNP's discursive strategies
   allowed the former to co-exist with the latter, enhancing
   complementarity and mitigating goal conflicts.},

Abstract = {Why does the ability of political leaders to control the bureaucracy
   vary? With strong meritocratic recruitment and tenure protections,
   Brazil appears an ideal case for successful bureaucratic resistance
   against political control. However, our analysis reveals how Bolsonaro
   overcame initial resistance by recalibrating strategies, ultimately
   dominating many key sectors of the bureaucracy. Drawing on over 100
   interviews with public officials, we find that strategies of political
   control and bureaucratic resistance unfold in a dynamic, yet often
   predictable, pattern based on leaders' previous experiences and their
   ability to learn, adjust, and tighten their grip on the instruments of
   the state. The Bolsonaro administration transformed the regulatory
   framework and targeted individual state employees, reducing arenas of
   contestation and inducing public sector workers to remain silent,
   implementing the president's policy preferences. We examine these
   control strategies in environmental agencies, their replication, and
   potential long-term consequences.},

Abstract = {European policymakers have identified the need to understand influence
   operations on social media, cyber-attacks or hidden economic investments
   - activities that can be characterised as hybrid threats or hybrid
   warfare. Yet, the difference between hybrid threats and hybrid warfare
   is unclear. In 2019, Mikael Wigell therefore coined the term ``hybrid
   interference{''} to clarify the distinction between ``hybrid warfare{''}
   and ``hybrid threats{''}. However, less attention has been given to the
   activities hybrid interference may consist of. To address this gap we
   have used a morphological analysis, which is a structured tool for
   analysis that addresses all aspects of a concept. Through this method,
   we propose categories that make more sense of the complex phenomenon of
   hybrid interference. These five categories are international politics,
   coercive diplomacy, priming, covert coercion, and sabotage and
   assassinations. This article also identifies problems with referring to
   activities in the category of international politics as hybrid
   interference activities. The result is novel because we place all
   combinations of tools and methods within the concept of hybrid
   interferences in one of the five above-mentioned categories, and as such
   have provided a detailed operationalising of the concept in a
   transparent manner.},

Abstract = {Does ethnic empowerment under colonial rule shape ethnic power even
   after independence? Existing research offers mixed arguments and rarely
   differentiates between different types of political empowerment. Drawing
   on the historical observation that the parliament and the security
   forces were two of the major sources of political power in newly
   independent states, this preregistered study tests whether ethnic
   representation in the colonial constabulary force and the receipt of
   guaranteed communal representation in the colonial legislature reduces
   the risk of postcolonial ethnic exclusion in ex-British colonies. It is
   found that the former has a strong and consistent effect on reducing the
   odds of postcolonial ethnic exclusion, but the latter, despite its
   frequent usage as a form of colonial ethnic empowerment, does not
   prevent political exclusion. The importance of martial vis-a-vis
   rational-legal power in newly independent states and varying levels of
   diachronic continuity between the two forms of colonial empowerment may
   account for the diverging results.},

Abstract = {This article examines the ``Common Social and Economic Space{''}
   agreement signed between the de facto state Abkhazia and its patron, the
   Russian Federation, in November 2020 and its potential implications for
   the further development of Abkhaz-Russian affairs. Based on a careful
   assessment of the gradual development of Abkhaz-Russian relations, the
   content of the new agreement, and the geopolitical context surrounding
   it, the article argues that Russia is using the agreement, which obliges
   Abkhazia to adapt to Russian legislation in vital social, political, and
   economic sectors, to eliminate a crucial legal barrier against Moscow's
   further inroads into the de facto republic. The article concludes that
   this so-called ``harmonization agreement{''} constitutes an important
   preparatory step towards a potential full integration of Abkhazia into
   the Russian Federation.},

Abstract = {The article discusses Georgian political and intellectual elites' and
   citizens' discourses on the country's Europeanization in the context of
   pragmatic and identity considerations. The research is based on Q
   methodology that, in contrast to its traditional use, has been
   integrated into in-depth interviews with political and intellectual
   elites and focus group discussions with citizens. Q analysis reveals
   that both elites and citizens are characterized by Euro-optimistic views
   perceiving Georgia's Europeanization in light of pragmatic
   considerations. The major pragmatic factors are related to the improved
   protection of human rights and the safeguarding of the country's
   security. Unlike previous studies, the current research shows that, at
   least at the rhetorical level, Georgia's Europeanization is not
   perceived as a threat to the national identity.},

Abstract = {How do the goals, targets and indicators of the Sustainable Development
   Goals (SDGs) serve as governance instruments in efforts to achieve the
   SDGs by 2030? This perspective addresses this question in three
   sections. First, it develops an account of how we should understand
   governance for the SDGs that highlights the role of targets and
   indicators, but also institutions and norms, in this model of `soft'
   governance. Second, it then offers a brief assessment of how the SDGs
   have worked as governance innovation since 2015, highlighting changes in
   the infrastructure of the SDGs and some national contexts, but also
   limitations. This section also considers the place of national ownership
   as a principle, integral to the SDGs, which constrains the
   transformative potential of the goals and targets. A final section
   considers how elements and mechanisms of SDG governance might be
   developed further. It points toward the importance of scaling up pockets
   of innovation and goal achievement across jurisdictions and levels of
   governance, while raising questions about expectations for SDG
   achievement beyond 2030.},

Abstract = {Building on arguments from my book Tangible Belonging: Negotiating
   Germanness in Twentieth-Century Hungary, this article examines the sense
   of `being German' in Hungarian-German villages in interwar Hungary. The
   basic argument is that rural dwellers possessed a kind of tangible
   belonging (a tangible sense of being German, in this case) defined by
   the immediate world around them and that this tangible belonging was
   continually in negotiations with other constituencies trying to define
   Germanness, such as Reich Germans, Hungarian-German leaders, and the
   Hungarian state as well as other Hungarians. This article also engages
   with the concept of national indifference, which has become a very
   common catchphrase in explanations concerning belonging in East Central
   Europe, especially in borderland regions and on the margins of states.},

Abstract = {The considerations of how Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to
   global climate action under the Paris Agreement are ambitious and fair,
   or equitable, is expected to guide countries' decisions with regards to
   the ambition and priorities of those contributions. This article
   investigates the equity aspect of the NDCs of four cases (Canada, the
   EU, Kenya, and South Africa) utilizing a combination of document
   analysis and expert interviews. It interrogates both the NDC documents
   themselves and, uniquely, the role of international and domestic equity
   considerations within the domestic policy processes that led to the
   formulation of the NDCs. For this, 30 participants and close observers
   of these processes were interviewed. We find countervailing effects of
   equity on ambition, with an enabling, or ambition-enhancing, effect
   resulting from international equity, in that these four Parties show
   willingness to do more if others do, too. In contrast, tempering effect
   appears to result from domestic equity concerns, for example with
   regards to real, perceived, or anticipated adverse distributional
   impacts of climate action across regions, sectors, and/or societal
   strata. Political cultures differ across the four case studies, as do
   the key actors that influence domestic policies and the preparations of
   NDCs. This paper also demonstrates that research on equity in NDCs can
   benefit from expanding its scope from the contents of NDC submissions to
   also examine the underlying decision-making processes, to generate
   insights that can contribute to future NDCs being both equitable and

Abstract = {Many studies exploit close elections in a regression discontinuity
   framework to identify partisan effects, that is, the effect of having a
   given party in office on some outcome. We argue that, when conducted on
   single-member districts, such design may identify a compound effect: the
   partisan effect, plus the majority status effect, that is, the effect of
   being represented by a member of the legislative majority. We provide a
   simple strategy to disentangle the two, and test it with simulations.
   Finally, we show the empirical relevance of this issue using real data.},

Volume = {33},

Pages = {61-74},

Abstract = {The article analyses the education ideologies and policies of two Danish
   right-wing populist political parties, the Danish People's Party and the
   New Right Party. The two parties differ in their political trajectories
   and profiles, but both represent a right-wing populism emphasizing the
   opposition between the people on the one hand and the elite and its
   alliance with foreigners on the other. In a national context with a
   strong welfare state tradition, right-wing populism has gained
   considerable influence on other political parties including the Social
   Democrats. In mapping the education policy of the two parties, the
   article draws on partisan political manifesto texts prepared for the
   2019 general election, on studies of voter attitudes in that election
   and on position taking of parties in parliamentary work. It is concluded
   that the education policies of the two parties focus mainly on the
   content of education, emphasizing national and Christian values and
   presenting foreigners and immigrants, especially from predominantly
   Muslim countries, as threats. Education does not feature strongly in the
   work of these parties, but their views still have an impact. The example
   of the Danish People's Party shows this; it has secured parliamentary
   majority for Liberal-Conservative governments and influenced their
   education policies.},

Abstract = {The main thrust of the scholarship on nationalism has so far been
   concerned with its origins. But nationalism also has effects. Whether it
   underpins the nation-building efforts of states, is mobilised by
   counter-state forces or is used in everyday life, nationalism might
   implicate a wide range of substantive outcomes, including political
   regimes, public goods provision, citizenship and immigration laws, and
   different patterns of conflict. Yet-with a few notable exceptions-the
   consequences of nationalism have received significantly less scholarly
   attention. In response, the aim of this Exchange is to create a new
   dialogue between different strands of scholarship around what we know
   and do not know about the consequences of nationalism. We organise this
   Exchange around the following questions: (1) What is nationalism? (2)
   How can we measure nationalism? (3) What are the consequences of
   nationalism? (4) What are new research frontiers?},

Abstract = {This article examines the effects of electoral engineering in the 2021
   Moroccan parliamentary elections. It demonstrates that Morocco's
   proportional system, introduced in 2002 and reformed in 2021, is
   designed to co-opt political parties, prevent a predominant party and
   promote party system fragmentation, in line with the monarchy's
   interests. Nevertheless, the electoral system is not imposed on
   political parties. The analysis of the process of electoral reform
   yields evidence of the political parties' involvement in electoral
   engineering, the changing political stances of the Moroccan parties, the
   role of administrative parties as intermediaries of the Minister of the
   Interior and, ultimately, the connivance between the political regime
   and the political parties, which acquiesce to the electoral rules in the
   expectation of being rewarded with seats and even office. In addition,
   the in-depth electoral analysis and the electoral simulation conducted
   in this paper reveal that the 2021 electoral reform led to an extreme
   multi-party system with balance between parties. The electoral
   amendments were particularly detrimental to the largest party, and to a
   lesser extent to the second and third parties. By contrast, the
   electoral reform benefitted small and medium-size parties in the new
   regional districts, where most of them are significantly
   overrepresented.},

Abstract = {In 1979, a group of activists belonging to the EPLF (the Eritrean
   People's Liberation Front) came across a materialistic interpretation of
   the national question, which was penned at the turn of the century by
   one Dov Ber Borochov (1881-1917), a Russian-Jewish intellectual who was
   a leading ideologue of Marxist Zionism. Among the fruits of this
   encounter was a book advocating the Eritrean people's right to
   self-determination. Owing to developments in the Soviet Union and
   Marxist circles in the 1920s, Borochov's works were all but ignored
   throughout the remainder of the century. How, then, did a Spanish
   translation of his treatise, Nationalismo y lucha de clases (known in
   English as The National Question and Class Struggle), find its way into
   the hands of Eritrean nationalists? Furthermore, against the backdrop of
   Moscow and Havana's open support for Ethiopia, what attracted these
   Eritreans to the thought of an obscure Marxist-Zionist intellectual?},

Abstract = {Existent research shows that affective polarization has been
   intensifying in some publics, diminishing in others, and remaining
   stable in most. We contribute to this debate by providing the most
   encompassing comparative and longitudinal account of affective
   polarization so far. We resort to a newly assembled dataset able to
   track partisan affect, with varying time series, in eighteen democracies
   over the last six decades. We present results based on two different
   operational measures of affective polarization: Reiljan's Affective
   Polarization Index, based on reported partisans only, and Wagner's
   weighted distance from the most liked party, based on the whole
   electorate. Our reassessment of affective polarization among partisans
   confirms that an intensifying trend is observable in a number of
   countries but it is, by no means, generalizable to all established
   democracies. Regarding the longitudinal assessment of affective
   polarization among the electorate, we confirm that US citizens have
   become more affectively polarized over time.},

Abstract = {Following the EU ambitions to become a climate neutral continent by 2050
   and the need to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels, the Union has
   to strengthen its efforts to accelerate renewable energy deployment and
   financing instruments are crucial for achieving this objective. The role
   of this article is to trace changes introduced by the EU with regard to
   the renewable energy and its financing instruments together with the
   factors that have stimulated or hindered their development. The study
   also tries to indicate opportunities connected with recently adopted
   instruments in particular Union renewable energy financing mechanism.
   The article is based on an analytical model supported by comparison and
   statistical methods. In conclusion, it is underlined that the main
   positive effect of new financing instruments lies in facilitating a more
   cost-effective deployment of renewable energy across the EU, in areas
   that are better suited for it in terms of natural resources.},

Abstract = {Social trust is crucial for the functioning of societies and states as
   well as for the wellbeing of individuals. In this article, I expand on
   previous literature and scrutinise the role of definitions of group
   membership in the form of national belonging as a key predictor of three
   distinct dimensions of social trust: particularised trust, trust in
   strangers and identity-based trust. Drawing on recent data from the
   European Values Study, I find that stronger ethnic conceptions of
   nationhood are related to higher identity-based trust, whereas the
   reverse holds for trust in strangers. The latter relationship, however,
   must be qualified regarding majority conceptions at the respective
   national level. Results for particularised trust, however, point towards
   a more complex relationship than outlined in the theoretical
   expectations. Thus, this article contributes to extant literature by
   presenting a comprehensive argument linking all three dimensions to
   conceptions of nationhood challenging simplified notions of generalised
   trust. Further, I go beyond extant studies by combining conceptions of
   nationhood at the individual level with several country-level variables
   to demonstrate the robustness of the results.},

Abstract = {This article examines the extent to which history forms national
   identity among Latvian youth. Being a multiethnic country, Latvia
   provides a unique opportunity to study the role of history in
   nation-building among dominant and minority ethnic groups. The majority
   of Latvia's ethnic minorities are Russian-speaking; therefore, a
   peculiarity of the Latvian case is the influence of the historical
   narratives promoted by Russia. The research problem of the paper is the
   formation of national identity when a foreign country promotes distorted
   historical narratives to discredit a state. The empirical findings are
   based on 30 in-depth interviews with young people. The main conclusion
   is that history plays a rather limited direct role in forming national
   identity among youth in Latvia. The influence of Russia's historical
   narratives is observable but not as strong as expected in the context of

Abstract = {Although scholars often portray Mexico as caught in the ``middle-income
   trap,{''} this description obscures important subnational variation in
   patterns of economic development. We leverage this variation by
   examining the case of Queretaro, a state with high levels of structural
   transformation and economic growth since the 1980s. We reconstruct the
   historical trajectory of its two leading industries, automotive and
   aerospace. We observe that while both have cumulatively delivered real
   developmental gains, each also exhibits a complex mix of strengths and
   weaknesses. We further find that these industries' advancements and
   hindrances over time appear closely related to the kinds of
   ``partial{''} coalitions - groups of actors from the state, private
   firms, and civil society organizations such as labor unions - which
   participate in industry-level decision-making. Both industries saw
   periods of ``upgrading{''} when the partial coalitions supporting them
   were expanding their cognitive diversity while avoiding gross imbalances
   in the distribution of power among their members. They likewise
   experienced periods of stagnation when either of those coalition
   conditions underwent major change. These findings suggest that debates
   on escaping the middle-income trap should consider how changes in
   partial political coalitions affect policy models and options.},

Title = {Foreign Aid, Norm Diffusion, and Local Support for Gender Equality:
   Comparing Evidence from the World Bank and China's Aid Projects in
   Africa},

Abstract = {Does foreign aid change local attitudes toward gender equality? Drawing
   on a theory of norm diffusion through intervention, we contend that when
   donors integrate norms into aid projects, such norms can be diffused to
   individuals in recipient countries. The World Bank and China are two
   comparable donors to examine this relationship. We matched the geocoded
   aid projects of the two donors from AidData and Afrobarometer surveys in
   Africa to test our hypotheses. Our strategy is to compare respondents'
   attitudes toward gender equality who were near a site where the project
   had been implemented at the time of the interview to those who were
   close to a site where the project would be started after the interview.
   We find that the World Bank aid increases local support for gender
   equality and the results differ across sectors and gender. Aid going to
   gender-sensitive sectors has the most significant impact on women's
   attitudes toward gender equality. In contrast, Chinese aid shows no
   similar effects. This study sheds light on the linkage between aid and
   social norm change and is expected to exert implications for
   policymakers and development practitioners adventuring in the land of
   aid.},

Abstract = {Bandwagoning by stealth refers to a situation when a government of a
   small state tries to accommodate a great power turned to aggressor amid
   a strong public opposition. We explain it with the example of Georgia's
   foreign policy towards Russia in the period of 2012-2022. It is argued
   that Georgia's attempt for rapprochement to Russia since 2012 can be
   explained by two unit-level variables: (1) a belief of the country's
   leadership in the need to accommodate Russia and (2) a societal and
   public opposition to the Russia-accommodating policy. A conflictual
   dynamic between the Russia-accommodating government and Russia-sceptic
   public resulted in bandwagoning by stealth - a defacto and partial
   bandwagoning with Russia without formally changing Georgia's declared
   pro-Western foreign policy.},

Title = {Transitioning Guerrillas: An Analysis of the Internal Cohesion of the
   Former FARC in Their Transit from War to Democracy},

Abstract = {The emergence of ex-rebels' political parties after peace accords
   creates a vehicle for political reintegration, which in turn has
   positive effects on peace and democracy consolidation after war.
   However, many of these parties tend to break apart and disappear,
   elevating the risk of renewed cycles of political violence. In times of
   war, cohesion plays a pivotal role in maintaining the bonds among
   members of armed organizations. It empowers them to perform effectively
   even in the face of challenging conditions and continues to be a
   critical factor during postconflict transitions. By means of a
   quantitative analysis of former FARC guerrillas in Colombia, now part of
   a newly founded legal political party, we test whether ideology,
   organizational dynamics, or individual perceptions and motivations help
   to explain their levels of cohesion. Our results show that even if all
   dimensions add up to the observed cohesion levels, perceptions of
   internal democracy, and inclusion, are the most relevant. We argue that
   assistance to former rebels in their organizational reengineering
   efforts after war will help to reduce the risk of the negative effects
   of rebel party collapse.},

Abstract = {Redistricting reformers have proposed many solutions to the problem of
   partisan gerrymandering, but they all require either bipartisan
   consensus or the agreement of both parties on the legitimacy of a
   neutral third party to resolve disputes. In this paper, we propose a new
   method for drawing district maps, the Define-Combine Procedure, that
   substantially reduces partisan gerrymandering without requiring a
   neutral third party or bipartisan agreement. One party defines a map of
   \$2N\$ equal-population contiguous districts. Then the second party
   combines pairs of contiguous districts to create the final map of N
   districts. Using real-world geographic and electoral data, we employ
   simulations and map-drawing algorithms to show that this procedure
   dramatically reduces the advantage conferred to the party controlling
   the redistricting process and leads to less-biased maps without
   requiring cooperation or non-partisan actors.},

Title = {Needs Analysis and Payback Models for Tractor Design Based on Field Data
   from Farmers in Sudan},

Abstract = {The adoption of agricultural machinery in countries with a developing
   economy can have a significant impact on improving well-being and
   pro-poor growth. However, this requires farmers to buy into mechanized
   farming, which is more likely to happen if the machinery meets their
   needs. The objective of this paper is to identify deciding factors for
   traditional farmers to adopt machinery and identify design requirements.
   Payback models were developed based on these design requirements,
   willingness to pay, and expected returns. Thirty-six farmers in Sudan
   were interviewed throughout 2019-2021. Six of these farmers were
   provided tractors during 2020 and 2021. Differences in net-profits
   between the 30 control and 6 treatment farms during the mechanized
   farming seasons were used in the models for expected profits. There were
   no significant differences in tractor design preferences between the
   treatment and control groups. Two cost models were estimated using a
   95\% confidence interval: entire Delta profit (entire additional profit
   from mechanized farming above nonmechanized) and percentage of total
   profit (percentage of total net-profits willing to spend). For the
   average farm size in this study (44.39 acres) and a market available
   tractor that satisfied all farmer needs, payback was 3.92 years {[}2.34,
   8.54] and 4.57 years {[}3.39, 6.38] for the models, respectively.},

Abstract = {How do peacebuilding institutions affect political behavior? This
   article studies the historic victory of the Colombian left in the 2022
   presidential elections in light of the implementation of local
   peacebuilding programs through the 2016 Peace Accords. Using a
   quasi-experimental design, we show that the Development Plans with a
   Territorial Focus (PDET), a central component of the 2016 Peace Accords
   between the government and the FARC, increased the vote share for the
   leftist coalition, Pacto Historico, in the 2022 elections by increasing
   voter turnout in PDET regions. In a departure from existing literature,
   we find that the explanatory effect of violence on vote share is
   significantly reduced when we include an indicator for PDET
   implementation and additional covariates. While there is a substantial
   body of work examining the effects of conflict violence and the presence
   of armed actors on elections, there has been relatively little focus on
   how the peacebuilding has affected vote choice and political behavior.
   We see our project as a bridge to fill this gap in the literature.},

Abstract = {Do elections increase responsiveness of legislators to their
   constituents ? Previous studies that examine the effect of electoral
   proximity have been unable to hold the roll-call agenda constant and
   control for differences in unobserved covariates between legislators.
   This paper utilizes a natural experiment in four state
   legislatures-Arkansas, Illinois, Florida, and Texas-where term length
   was randomly assigned. This design compares the responsiveness to
   constituency opinion of those randomly assigned to a two-year term to
   those assigned a four-year term on different issue areas, like the
   economy, environment, and crime. I find no evidence for an electoral
   proximity effect on responsiveness. In addition, in the Illinois State
   Senate, the causal effect of electoral proximity on responsiveness is
   measured on several individual roll-call votes, including the
   legalization of medical marijuana and gay marriage.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper reviews the concept of the demographic dividend and the
   empirical evidence therefor. The demographic dividend is mainly the
   result of fertility decline (lower number of births, lower population
   growth) which translates into a population age structure with a larger
   work force (age 15-64) and a smaller proportion of children (age 0-14),
   together with initially few elderly persons (age 65+). In turn, this
   favors economic growth, but it also has many consequences for households
   and for state budgets, as well as long-term consequences for population
   size and the environment. The first part of this paper shows the small
   correlations at the national macro-economic level between dependency
   ratios and economic growth. The second part shows the strong
   correlations at the household level between levels of fertility, child
   mortality and modern education. The third part discusses the many other
   correlates of the demographic dividend. The often-cited and
   controversial focus of the demographic dividend on economic growth hides
   many other positive effects of fertility control on households, on state
   budgets, and, in the long-run, on societies and the environment.},

Abstract = {Interviewers' postinterview evaluations of respondents' performance
   (IEPs) are paradata, used to describe the quality of the data obtained
   from respondents. IEPs are driven by a combination of factors, including
   respondents' and interviewers' sociodemographic characteristics and what
   actually transpires during the interview. However, relatively few
   studies examine how IEPs are associated with features of the response
   process, including facets of the interviewer-respondent interaction and
   patterns of responding that index data quality. We examine whether
   features of the response process-various respondents' behaviors and
   response quality indicators-are associated with IEPs in a survey with a
   diverse set of respondents focused on barriers and facilitators to
   participating in medical research. We also examine whether there are
   differences in IEPs across respondents' and interviewers'
   sociodemographic characteristics. Our results show that both
   respondents' behaviors and response quality indicators predict IEPs,
   indicating that IEPs reflect what transpires in the interview. In
   addition, interviewers appear to approach the task of evaluating
   respondents with differing frameworks, as evidenced by the variation in
   IEPs attributable to interviewers and associations between IEPs and
   interviewers' gender. Further, IEPs were associated with respondents'
   education and ethnoracial identity, net of respondents' behaviors,
   response quality indicators, and sociodemographic characteristics of
   respondents and interviewers. Future research should continue to build
   on studies that examine the correlates of IEPs to better inform whether,
   when, and how to use IEPs as paradata about the quality of the data
   obtained.},

Abstract = {This themed section seeks to initiate a debate about the changing nature
   of what we call nation promotion. That is, promotional practices aimed
   at creating, communicating and managing versions of national identity to
   advance economic or political goals. These practices-badged as `nation
   branding', `public diplomacy', `country branding' or `soft power-emerged
   more than two decades ago, in a context characterised by the
   proliferation of digital communication technologies, the intensification
   of globalisation and international cooperation, and the shift in the
   balance of power from states to market forces. However, as we outline in
   this introduction, nation promotion operates today in a very different
   environment, marked by a crisis of neoliberal globalisation, the
   changing communication environment and mounting global challenges. The
   three articles that make up this themed section tackle the changing
   practices of nation promotion by focusing on the impact of at least one
   of these structural shifts, offering conceptual and analytical tools for
   making sense of these transformations.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The growth of populism in the EU member states, as a large-scale
   internal challenge to the European integration project, has a projection
   on foreign policy of both national states and the European Union. The EU
   foreign policy, towards Russia, is the area where the deviation of
   populist programs and strategies from the positions of the mainstream is
   most clearly manifested. In this regard, it is necessary to determine
   the foreign policy orientations of the populist radical right parties of
   the EU member states regarding the EU foreign policy, towards Russia,
   and opportunities for their synchronization. The main conclusion of this
   research is that populist foreign policy orientations highlight the
   internal heterogeneity of the populist phenomenon. Populism in power and
   in opposition does not have the capacity to change the EU's foreign
   policy towards Russia. The nature of populism as an ideology, the
   instrumental use by right populists of the `theme of Russia' for
   `internal consumption' and their mainstreaming in power are a
   significant barrier to the real challenge of the EU policy towards
   Russia.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to a growing literature on the international
   political world views and foreign policy agendas of European radical
   right parties with data from in-depth interviews with current and former
   elected representatives of Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) and
   Rassemblement National (RN), focusing on their attitudes towards the
   United States and Russia. Despite very different party structures, the
   interviews point to a common pattern of intra-party variation. Those who
   display deeper attachment to `elite' and `people' categories shaping
   interpretations of political events, revealed by attachment to
   conspiracy theories, showed inclination to more radical foreign policy
   agendas. This includes a stronger inclination to move away from
   traditional US-led Western or NATO allies and security frameworks and a
   stronger preference for cooperation with Russia. For those less deeply
   committed to notions of malign elite conspiracy, anti-American thinking
   was less prominent. For them, a sense of shared values and therefore
   cultural kinship with Western democracies retains relevance, and
   attitudes towards Russia are notably more cautious. This highlights the
   diversity of worldviews within the radical right, including with respect
   to the boundaries of transnational kinship.},

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has developed cultural policy initiatives that
   seek to promote cultural Europeanization with the purpose of
   constructing European identity narratives and facilitating citizens'
   sense of belonging to Europe and the EU. The article focuses on the
   citizens' perspective to cultural Europeanization through ethnographic
   research on one central action in the EU cultural policy, European
   Heritage Label (EHL). We analyse the interviews conducted in selected
   EHL sites with Central and East European (CEE) citizens who were
   visiting the sites as well as with cultural heritage practitioners
   working at three EHL sites located in CEE countries. We ask how the
   practitioners and the visitors engage with European identity narratives
   and elaborate their European belonging. We especially scrutinize how
   everyday encounters and experiences, such as mobility, shape
   identifications with `Europe' and perceptions of what is `European'. The
   interviews are interpreted in the theoretical framework of `being' and
   `becoming' European. This framework indicates a centuries-long liminal
   position of the Central and Eastern Europe. It enables us to scrutinize
   CEE citizens' sense of belonging to Europe in an intersection of dual
   Europeanization, i.e. cultural Europeanization and `Europeanization' of
   the CEE countries to overcome this liminal position and become `true'
   Europeans.},

Abstract = {The principle of Common Heritage of Mankind (CHM) is a fundamental
   principle for the international community to explore and exploit deep
   seabed mineral resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Many
   provisions in Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
   Sea reflect this principle. As the international institution to
   implement the principle of CHM, the International Seabed Authority has
   the dual mandate of managing deep seabed resources and marine
   environmental protection. However, in the process of implementing the
   principle of Common Heritage of Mankind, there is a misalignment between
   reality and ideal as envisioned by the Convention. This article reflects
   on the relevant norms and practices of the International Seabed
   Authority (ISA) in implementing the CHM principle and presents a
   critical assessment of the development of the sharing mechanism through
   the ISA, focusing on benefit sharing and technology sharing. This
   article also proposes that information sharing and transparency is a
   procedure-reinforcing mechanism to promote benefit sharing and is
   especially important to the decision-making process of the ISA, which
   includes the promulgation of the rules, regulations and the approval of
   the plans of work submitted by the applicants. These decisions have
   practical significance and direct impacts on the development of the
   sharing mechanism for deep seabed resources.},

Abstract = {Despite great advances in the last decades, there is an enduring gender
   gap in a majority of the countries. Gender is prevalent in all aspects
   of life, and it is impossible to avoid gender roles. The choices
   regarding gender roles are threefold: Accept them, reject them, or have
   an ambivalent stand. When voters grow incongruous with their parties,
   they look for an alternative which is ideologically closer to them.
   However, evaluating this vote shift without the full effect of gender
   will provide an incomplete picture of electoral politics. I theorize
   that when voters are faced with female candidates or female party
   leaders, their assessment of gender roles will be a deciding factor for
   whether the intended vote shift will be realized. I apply this extended
   theory of ideological and gender role congruity to a high gender gap
   context, Turkey, utilizing district level electoral data. Taking into
   account the spatial dependence of factors that affect voting behaviour,
   I empirically demonstrate that for two ideologically opposing parties,
   the salience of gender politics through the ranking of female candidates
   on the closed-lists and presence of national female leadership affected
   their vote share in line with my theoretical expectations in the 2018
   general election.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has given further centrality to science within the
   public debate. But it has also acted as a great multiplier for
   pseudoscientific (conspiracy) theories. This exploratory study
   investigates the determinants of pseudoscientific beliefs in five
   European countries, using data from a survey conducted in May 2021. The
   concept of pseudoscience is theoretically framed and then
   operationalised by constructing a Pseudo-scientific Beliefs Index (PBI).
   Results show that exposure to scientific information does not `protect'
   against unsound scientific claims, if not complemented by a correct
   understanding of the division of scientific labour. Pseudoscientific
   views are strongly associated with distrust of official science. But, in
   the context of today's information abundance, even more relevant is the
   spread of epistemological populism, which fosters reliance on
   alternative sources and the pseudo-expertise of `alternative scientific
   authorities'. The embrace of `alternative scientific facts' is also
   associated with electoral support for populist parties.},

Abstract = {This study seeks to add to the burgeoning literature on the relations
   between nationalism and environmentalism by examining the ideas of A. D.
   Gordon (1856-1922). Gordon is not well-known outside the realm of
   Zionist scholarship. Nonetheless, a close re-examination of his ideas
   reveals that Gordon offers a hybrid brand of deep eco-national theory
   that frames traditional deep ecological themes within a general theory
   of nationalism. Whereas Gordon's theory introduces the `nation' as a
   central notion to deep ecology thought, at the same time, it adds an
   ecological dimension rarely taken into account in theories of
   nationalism. This analysis further shows that although Gordon's
   pioneering eco-national theory had high potential for bridging between
   the two disciplines, it eventually faded into obscurity like
   eco-national ideas elsewhere. As Jewish national independence came into
   view, Gordon's distinctive eco-nationalism was overshadowed by
   anthropocentric-based Zionist politics.},

Title = {Chinese Economic Statecraft in Southeast Asia and Its Uneven Impact in
   Laos and Cambodia},
Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {59},
Number = {04},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper examines how China has successfully translated its economic
   might into political clout in Laos and Cambodia. The country's role as a
   major trading partner, foreign investor, and provider of aid to both
   countries has contributed substantially to their national development.
   This massive influx of Chinese investment and aid has also yielded
   positive results, as both countries have demonstrated a more
   accommodating attitude toward Beijing on a variety of issues. However,
   Chinese economic statecraft has had differing degrees of influence on
   the foreign policymaking of Laos and Cambodia, particularly with regard
   to their foreign policies toward Vietnam, a critical secondary state in
   Southeast Asia. While Cambodia has been less hesitant to bandwagon with
   China, Laos is still seeking to balance between China and Vietnam. This
   paper argues that Laos and Cambodia's existing perceptions of Vietnam
   dictate in part how they respond to China's economic inducements and
   affect the outcomes of Chinese economic statecraft.},

Abstract = {Opposition to LGBT rights remains a contemporary fixture within the
   United States in spite of increasingly liberalizing attitudes toward
   LGBT individuals. In this paper, I argue that a potentially overlooked
   factor driving this opposition is rural identity-or an individual's
   psychological attachment to a rural area. Using data from the 2020 ANES,
   I find that rural identity predicts less favorable estimations of LGBT
   individuals. Rural identifiers are also less likely to support pro-LGBT
   policy measures than nonrural identifiers. Nevertheless, I find the
   magnitude of the effects of rural identity on anti-LGBT views to be
   surprisingly small. It is also the case that, on average, rural
   identifiers exhibit net-positive estimations of LGBT individuals and are
   broadly supportive of LGBT rights, suggesting that elected officials
   enacting anti-LGBT legislation in rural areas of the United States are
   potentially out of step with the preferences of their electorate. These
   findings also have implications for what it means to hold a rural
   identity beyond a generalized animosity toward urban areas, and for
   understanding urban-rural divergences in US public opinion on issues
   such as LGBT rights.},

Abstract = {From a bottom-up perspective, cleavage theory links the socio-economic
   trends existing in the political community with the shape acquired by
   party politics. Globalization and European integration impacted European
   society, creating novel socio-economic divides and bringing new social,
   cultural and economic issues into the political discussion. The impact
   of the novel cleavage over the pre-existent societal socio-political
   fractures acquires a central role in the study of European Union
   politicization. Deploying critical discourse analysis (CDA) and
   discourse-historical approach (DHA), this study aims to comprehend how
   the emergence of a novel cleavage has influenced the discourse of the
   mainstream European parties. The manifestos of the European Christian
   democratic, socialist and liberal parties from the last three European
   Parliament elections are analyzed to assess the contemporary relevance
   of the left-right political competition in a scenario characterized by
   the salience gained by transnational issues and the electoral success of
   populist elites.},

Abstract = {September 11, 2001 resulted in the drastic expansion of intelligence and
   surveillance capacities in the New York City Police Department (NYPD)
   and the NYPD has continued to adopt emergent surveillance technologies.
   These tools have investigative applications beyond counterterrorism and
   many worry their use is outpacing oversight and regulation. The
   transformations of the NYPD in the early 2000s were followed by major -
   if lagged - changes to the external oversight of police and surveillance
   tools, including the 2013 establishment of an Office of the Inspector
   General for the NYPD and the Public Oversight of Technology (POST) Act
   in 2020. This article tracks these developments and their capacity to
   mitigate information asymmetries, enhance transparency, and ultimately
   influence the use of police surveillance technologies in New York City.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Since independence in 1945, Indonesia has managed to carry out its
   foreign policy according to a unique doctrine described as ``independent
   and active{''} (bebas dan aktif). To be independent means that Indonesia
   does not side with world powers, while being active means vigorously
   carrying out peaceful policies and actively participating in the
   peaceful settlement of international issues. The doctrine is not a
   neutral policy but does not align and bind the country with the
   superpowers or any military pact. Instead, being independent and active
   primarily serves the national interest while allowing the Indonesian
   government to collaborate with other nations. However, the doctrine's
   implementation has varied according to the different interpretations of
   successive presidents. This paper explains Indonesia's independent and
   active foreign policy during President Joko Widodo's presidency. It
   contends that while the doctrine has continued to underlie Indonesia's
   foreign policy, the formulation of President Joko Widodo's foreign
   policy is unique in its practical approach, prioritizing the national
   interest and the domestic advantages of foreign relations. In the
   president's worldview, foreign policy has been instrumental in promoting
   the nation's development.},

Abstract = {This article examines the contemporary discourse of eco-nationalism and
   its promotion of national sovereignty and belonging. I consider some of
   the strategies, symbols and narratives by which nationalist movements
   and political leaders have evoked environmental problems and
   particularly the global threat of climate change to justify excluding
   populations from `native' lands, erect walls or other physical
   boundaries around national territories, and limit international traffic
   of people and goods. This promotion of nation seizes on concerns for
   continued collective existence, turning away from participation in
   global networks of culture, capital and cosmopolitanism to act as a
   bulwark against these networks. As such, it presents a mirror image of
   global nationalism: whereas the aim is still to take heed of global
   phenomena, these phenomena now appear as dark clouds on the horizon,
   from which national citizens must take cover.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the Hungarian and Turkish responses to the
   EU's handling of the 2015 refugee ``crisis{''} through a postcolonial
   feminist IR framework. Drawing on hypermasculinity, we argue that both
   countries utilise migration to overcome their postcolonial and masculine
   anxieties by confronting their positions within the international
   hierarchies. Our examination of policy statements and speeches by Viktor
   Orban and Recep Tayyip Erdogan between 2015 and 2016 reveals three
   masculinised responses. First, both leaders portray themselves as acting
   out of paternal authority, while painting the EU as weak or inhumane.
   Second, they depict the EU as incompetent and their countries as
   competent providers of security. Third, they present themselves as
   protectors of European values, and the EU as in need of protection.
   These rhetorics suggest that both leaders used the ``crisis{''} to
   challenge the current international hierarchy. Despite this, we argue
   that they are only concerned with their countries' rankings within the
   hierarchy, not the system itself. Our postcolonial feminist reading of
   the ``crisis{''} reveals that these masculinised framings are in fact
   counterproductive and only serve to confirm both Hungary and Turkey's
   positions at the bottom of the international hierarchies, and their
   subordination to the EU as the EU's others.},

Abstract = {The 2023 SDG Summit, which will take place in September during the
   United Nations (UN) General Assembly high-level week, aims to review the
   state of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the implementation
   of the 2030 Agenda. As 2023 marks the mid-point to 2030, this meeting
   aims to respond to the impact of multiple and interlocking crises facing
   the world. The COVID-19 pandemic is only one of these critical crises.
   The pandemic meant an enormous backlash for the implementation of most
   SDGs, as discussed in the UN Secretary-General's mid-term progress
   report ``Toward a Rescue Plan for People and Planet.{''} Therefore, it
   is at once an important background to the Summit and one that highlights
   the common overarching structural issues that underlie SDG
   implementation, as the pandemic not only posed a global health crisis
   but also led to lasting changes in policy areas concerning the SDGs and
   the 2030 Agenda, such as health, mobility, trade, industry, finance, and
   sustainability. This paper engages with the impact of the COVID-19
   pandemic on the practices of the UN High-Level Political Forum (HLPF)
   and the short-term policy narratives around the SDGs. Its goal is to
   document some of the changes the pandemic triggered in practices of
   sustainability governance, based on the findings of a 4-year project
   that draws on qualitative analysis of participatory observations at the
   HLPF meetings, document analysis, and in-depth interviews.},

Abstract = {With the United Nations' Agenda 2030, countries worldwide have committed
   to a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030.
   Among them is SDG 15, known as Life on Land. What makes this SDG special
   is that several of its targets had been scheduled for completion by
   2020- raising the question what should happen to these targets after
   2020 as they have not yet been achieved. With the approaching 2023 SDG
   Summit in mind, this perspective paper examines how the Kunming-Montreal
   Global Biodiversity Framework, which was adopted under the Convention on
   Biological Diversity in late 2022, might provide guidance for the
   implementation of SDG 15 and maintain the momentum for action until
   2030. Three areas are critical. First, concerning protected areas, the
   strengthened rights-based approach of the Kunming-Montreal Global
   Biodiversity Framework should be integrated into SDG 15. Second, the new
   framework promotes the sustainable use of biodiversity more clearly than
   SDG 15 and should hence guide transformation of the biodiversity-based
   economic sectors. Finally, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity
   Framework provides the first quantified financial target for global
   biodiversity action, and at the SDG Summit, that target should be
   reinforced by additional financial commitments. Guidance in these three
   areas can be integrated into the SDG Summit's Political Declaration and
   into the voluntary pledges that countries are expected to make at the
   Summit, and it can inform the review of the SDG indicators.},

Abstract = {Despite mixed results in the past, multi-stakeholder partnerships (MSPs)
   are considered important governance instruments for achieving the
   Sustainable Development Goals. This perspective discusses the `next
   generation' of MSPs, comparing them to previous generations, and whether
   they can contribute to transformative change. The discussion is based on
   a first analysis of nearly 500 MSPs collected in the Transformative
   Partnership 2030 project, comprising a subset of initiatives on the
   Partnership Platform maintained by the United Nations. Three
   observations are made. First, only a small number of the 7000 or so
   entries on the Partnership Platform are active MSPs. Second,
   international organizations and national government are the main
   partners in MSPs. The most common functions are related to soft
   governance such as knowledge dissemination and information exchange.
   Third, MSPs mainly connect environmental and social SDGs, notably
   between climate change, biodiversity, health and education. They are
   less focused on the economic goals, addressing the drivers of
   unsustainable behavior. The perspective recommends an update of the
   Partnership Platform, more research on how to harness potential
   synergies across SDGs in MSPs and more attention to meta-governance of
   MSPs, at the UN level.},

Abstract = {In 2015, the United Nations agreed on 17 Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs) as an ``integrated and indivisible{''} set of policy objectives
   with the aim, among others, to unite the diverse and vast system of
   international organizations under one shared normative agenda. And yet,
   have these SDGs really become such an integrative force in global
   governance? Our conclusion here is negative, and our research suggests
   that the SDGs have not lived up to these high expectations. We find
   instead that the 17 global goals have not been taken up by a substantial
   group of international organizations, and some organizations rather
   cherry-pick those goals that best fit their own agenda and interests. To
   overcome these challenges and to fulfill the promise of integrated
   global sustainability governance enshrined in the SDGs, we propose three
   urgent actions: first, to further push the use of the SDGs across all
   international organizations, in particular regional organizations
   outside the United Nations system; second, to facilitate better
   collaboration across policy domains; and third, to focus attention on
   those SDGs that are so far ``left behind.{''}},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of several decades of neoliberalism in Eastern Europe,
   the social fabric of post-socialist societies is frayed. In this
   context, nationalist cultural policies and everyday displays of national
   belonging have emerged as key instruments of social solidarity. There
   has recently been a drive of state initiatives in Latvia in the field of
   cultural policy aimed at strengthening national identity. In this paper,
   we focus our attention on one particular cultural policy initiative,
   Latvian Films for Latvian Centenary. Drawing on qualitative interviews
   with 16 film directors who participated in the Centenary film programme,
   the paper explores how artists and cultural operators involved in this
   programme are mobilised as national(ist) subjects and how they see their
   work within such a framework. We argue that nationalist cultural policy
   can be successfully implemented because the artists, themselves formed
   as responsible political and moral subjects in the tradition of Latvian
   cultural nationalism, share a regard for culture and the arts as a
   resource for sustaining the political statehood and the national
   community. However, the artists also recognise the limitations of their
   work as a source of social cohesion and solidarity in a society that is
   ethnically divided.},

Abstract = {List experimentation is a common survey methodology that purports to
   reduce or eliminate social desirability bias. While some studies have
   assessed list experimentation's effectiveness in achieving that goal, to
   our knowledge, this is the first ever experimental evaluation of
   interviewer effects on list experiment performance. We embedded a list
   experiment about immigration attitudes in an in-person survey
   administered to 718 white respondents. Randomly assigning Caucasian and
   Latinx interviewers, we find strong evidence that responses to the list
   experiment differed by interviewer ethnicity, thus failing to fully
   eliminate social desirability bias. A follow-up survey of 1,460 online
   respondents revealed similar difference-in-differences when merely
   priming the ethnic identities of survey researchers through pictures.
   The results of this study shed light on patterns of interpersonal
   communication about sensitive issues and how social context shapes the
   reporting of political attitudes, even when methodology specifically
   meant to mute sensitivity biases is employed.},

Abstract = {How does the execution of horizontal accountability mechanisms affect
   cabinet members' instability? This article analyzes distinct features of
   no-confidence motions (NCMs) in presidential systems, using a
   mixed-method research design that identifies elements of legislative
   control mechanisms in Peruvian and Colombian polities. Although the
   congress in presidential systems rarely approves NCMs, high salience
   policy shocks trigger their proposal, resulting in the dismissal or
   resignation of the cabinet member in question. Those results are subtle
   opportunities for opposition legislators to indicate the incompetence of
   the incumbent government in particular policy areas. This study
   contributes to understanding how contextual factors affect the
   effectiveness of the check and balance principle in presidential
   systems.},

Abstract = {Prior research suggests that citizen attitudes toward electoral laws and
   reforms derive from how individuals weigh two competing considerations:
   the rule's procedural fairness and one's partisan self-interest (or how
   they perceive the policy affects their party's electoral prospects).
   Recent experimental work shows that despite a role for fairness
   concerns, policy support levels shift (at least to a degree) based on
   its anticipated impact on who votes. We examine how the presentation of
   the trade-off between fairness and partisan advantage influences
   election reform opinions. Using two sets of survey experiments, we find
   that priming fairness reduces, but does not eliminate, the effect of
   partisan self-interest in shaping policy evaluations. Priming a reform's
   constitutionality so as to provide cover to infringe upon fairness
   considerations, however, does not exacerbate the impact of partisan
   self-interest on support for adoption. These results expand our
   understanding of how citizens weigh different factors when assessing
   electoral policies.},

Abstract = {Over the last decade there has been a growing convergence between
   Putin's Russia and West European right-wing populist parties (WERPPs)
   that are growing in consensus around Europe. Such relationship, depicted
   as ``marriage of convenience{''}, benefits both Putin in his quest for
   the international legitimization of his political regime and WERPPs in
   their rally for power at both the national and the European levels.
   Grounded on a mix of populism, opposition to the European Union and
   radical right-wing ideology, does this marriage survive the Ukrainian
   crisis or does it transform itself in a ``divorce of convenience{''}?
   This work uses an original dataset of more than 900k tweets collected in
   the period between 2013 and 2022 and produced by two Italian populist
   parties and shows what shapes WERPPs' communication about Russia.
   Moreover, it empirically demonstrates how fragile, mutable and exposed
   to the influence of contextual factors this relationship is.},

Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {What shapes Americans' policy preferences: partisanship or policy
   content? While previous studies have addressed this question, many of
   them focused on high-salience policies. This raises an identification
   challenge because the content of such policies contains party cues. The
   current study employs a diverse set of low-salience policies to discern
   the unique effects of party cues and policy content, before the issues
   are ``hijacked{''} by the parties. These policies are embedded in an
   original conjoint experiment administered among a national US sample.
   The design enables me to assess the effects of policy content and
   partisan sponsorship orthogonally. Contrary to previous studies, I find
   that respondents are attentive to policy content on low-salience issues,
   and it influences their policy preferences similarly or even more than
   party cues, across policy domains. Moreover, the support patterns and
   levels of Democrats and Republicans for many low-salience policies are
   similar. Party cues, by contrast, polarize partisans' preferences across
   domains.},

Abstract = {In this chapter, we conceptualise an ideal framework that captures three
   reinforcing levers for measuring local government performance in
   sub-Saharan Africa, specifically Ghana, namely policy pronouncement,
   political processes and internal operations, and policy implementation.
   Given data limitations we employ a `next best' approach to apply this
   framework and measure local government performance by combining a
   weighted `quality of reporting' measure with selected available measures
   on political processes and internal operations, and policy
   implementation, so as to construct a composite index for local
   government performance (LGI). We also look at the relationship between
   our performance indices and other indices of local government
   performance in Ghana, as well as poverty headcounts. We find that, on
   average, urban districts perform better than their rural counterparts
   and also districts located in the southern half of Ghana perform better.
   Our constructed composite index is positively correlated with indices
   from Ghana's district league tables. It has a negative relationship with
   poverty headcount in districts, indicating that districts with lower
   poverty incidence are more effective and responsive to their citizens.
   The findings provide a snapshot of institutional performance across
   Ghana's districts, and offer a more comprehensive basis for considering
   variations in subnational institutional performance, including the
   effects of decentralisation than previous studies of Ghana - or indeed
   African countries more broadly.},

Booktitle = {DECENTRALISED GOVERNANCE: Crafting Effective Democracies Around the

Year = {2023},
Pages = {335-369},
Abstract = {A substantial decentralisation reform occurred in Colombia school
   education in 2001. The government established an arbitrary rule that
   granted municipalities with a population greater than 100,000 almost
   complete autonomy to provide education services (certification). Going
   beyond some mechanisms identified in previous policy evaluations (such
   as a higher proportion of higher-quality teachers) we analysed how
   reform affected the investment of local resources in education and the
   distribution of the total budget in key areas of the school system.
   Certified municipalities experienced an increase in education
   expenditure, after discounting teachers' payroll, because of increased
   efficiency in the management of total resources, both locally raised and
   central government transfers. This allowed higher expenditures in school
   infrastructure, education quality, and other education-related
   programmes, all key components of education policy. In addition, after
   2002 the competitiveness of public schools increased in certified
   municipalities, compared to non- certified areas. Achieving better
   student outcomes was primarily explained by changes in the allocation of
   resources in certified municipalities that resulted in increased
   efficiency after gaining autonomy. Lastly, certification enhances
   competitiveness of public schools as against private ones.},

   questions and research goal of the research and, hence, the book. It
   elucidates the reasons behind the multi-methods approach and explains
   all the methods that I used to carry out the research for this book.
   This chapter is of fundamental importance since it explains the choices
   that have made possible: a) the analysis of the evolution of laws and
   policies on the phenomenon of GBVAW at the international level; b) the
   reason why the focus of the comparison is on GBVAW policies, and
   specifically the level of Government Responsiveness; c) and the reasons
   and modalities of the comparative analysis between two similar realities
   at the national level: Italy and Spain.},

Pages = {301-333},
Abstract = {Historically, the practice of registering births with government
   authorities has been rare in developing countries, often limited to
   major urban centres. The absence of systematic birth records can be a
   serious impediment for implementing government policies related to
   children such as school enrolment requirements for children of primary
   school age or restrictions on minimum age of marriage. Recent
   initiatives to create digital birth records in a number of countries has
   the potential to address this issue and enhance the capacity of local
   government authorities to implement state policies. In Bangladesh, there
   has been increased provision of birth registration at local,
   governmentrun digital centres linked to a national database, and having
   a birth certificate has been made a requirement for receiving various
   government services including school enrolment and marriage
   registration. Using first-hand survey data on households with adolescent
   girls from a rural district in one of the poorest regions in Bangladesh,
   we document the knowledge, understanding, and behavioural response in
   relation to these policies at the household level. We also document the
   phenomenon of invalid birth certificates and provide suggestive evidence
   that it is due to limited local administrative capacity to register
   births.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the EU's neighbourhood policy towards Egypt. Using
   the higher education sector as a case, it explores the EU's policy to
   induce reforms through governance transfers and Egypt's response to this
   offer. The main questions are: (1) To what extent do EU policy
   objectives and governance approaches influence the reform of higher
   education in Egypt? (2) Which factors facilitate or hinder the reform
   process at various levels of intervention? Theoretically, the research
   draws on concepts of EU policy and governance transfers to partner
   states and the significance of contextual factors for reforms within
   these states. Methodologically, the analysis applies a qualitative
   approach based on official documents and semi-structured expert
   interviews with European and Egyptian officials. The analysis suggests
   that factors on both sides of the cooperation contribute to limiting
   policy implementation: the overly complex and rather unspecified
   governance concepts of the EU and the difficulties in Egypt to implement
   policies through decentralized action.},

Abstract = {Since 1989, the dominant characteristics of civil society in Eastern
   Europe have been associated with voluntary activism and organizations
   located between the state and the sphere of the household, mushrooming
   especially in the urban setting and pursuing what has been
   teleologically projected as the climax of post-socialist consolidation:
   secular-liberal cosmopolitan democracy. Apparently non-civil, illiberal,
   or even reactionary citizens' actions and associations have been
   developing alongside those cultivating liberal democracy. Our Slovak
   examples show that to identify existing civil society in the societies
   of Eastern Europe, the bulk of whose inhabitants are post-peasants -
   rural and nominally urban citizens valuing and practicing the country
   life - we need to pay attention to the populism that we call
   post-peasant progressivism, mobilizing the autochthonous civil society
   in and of the country. The dividing line between reactionary and
   progressive elements of this village civility is blurred from the
   perspective of the dominant characteristics of Western civil society,
   but the potential of this rural civil society for progressive
   transformation remains high in these post-peasant communities.},

Title = {A New Perspective on the Natural Resource Curse},
Journal = {WORLD},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Pages = {670-683},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Early papers found empirical support for a natural resource curse-the
   notion that exporting natural resources is detrimental to economic
   growth. Later papers, using reportedly improved econometric models and
   data, largely reversed these early findings by estimating that natural
   resources improve economic performance. However, this changing
   coefficient on natural resource dependence over time may not only be a
   function of model or data quality. Masked by this evolution in the
   economics literature is the possibility that the fundamental
   relationship between natural resources and economic performance has
   changed over the past several decades. This paper sheds a new
   perspective on the substantial resource curse literature by repeatedly
   estimating a single econometric model on data that evolve over time. The
   coefficient on natural resource dependence is estimated to steadily
   increases with the passage of time from a value that is negative and
   significant (for 1970, the basis for much of the early literature) to a
   positive and significant value a few decades later. Whatever natural
   resource estimated initially with data from 1970 seems to have evolved
   into a resource blessing over time.},

Abstract = {Gender inequality affects the labour market of any territory. Despite
   government measures to eradicate it, it continues to cause
   discrimination. In this article, the gender inequality in the European
   labour market between 2002 and 2021 is analysed to advance the knowledge
   of this complex phenomenon. After reviewing the main theoretical
   contributions, the most suitable indicators are defined. The results
   reveal that the gender pay gap has increased in the European labour
   market, despite indicators such as the Gender Equality Index, employment
   rates, or levels of occupational segregation showing favourable
   progress. Therefore, governments must design efficient policies, mainly
   on pay equity, to achieve equal conditions in the European labour
   market.},

Abstract = {The Europeanisation of national political parties is often considered a
   crucial element in the democratisation of the EU. Yet, party
   Europeanisation has remained limited. The traditional argument
   explaining this is that the low political relevance of European affairs
   creates limited incentives for party organisations to Europeanise. But
   what happens in a context where Europe is politically relevant? Denmark,
   with its high parliamentary and public scrutiny of European affairs,
   provides us with such a case, allowing a view through the looking glass
   on whether and how national political parties Europeanise in a
   Europeanisation-friendly context. This article finds that Danish parties
   Europeanise rather differently from what has previously been found
   elsewhere, focusing strongly on internal cohesion, to the detriment of
   transnational cooperation. As such, empirically scrutinising a
   long-standing theoretical argument, this article adds much-needed nuance
   to the debate on party Europeanisation, its causes and relevance.},

Abstract = {Developmental state scholars argue that through ``embedded autonomy{''},
   state activism can steer society towards positive outcomes without
   capture by private interests. This paper questions this claim through a
   case study of such activism in Singapore. It argues that not only may
   rent-seeking have been encouraged by Singapore's use of industrial
   policy but that such a policy goes hand in hand with attempts by state
   actors to create an economic culture that legitimises such behaviour.
   The wider implication drawn is that mission-oriented state activism may
   require extensive cultural engineering to foster consensus over the
   relevant ``missions{''}, but this level of social penetration also
   increases the risk of private interests capturing the state in less
   visible ways.},

Title = {Keeping Promises? Democracies' Ability to Harmonize Their International
   and National Climate Commitments},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {170-200},

Abstract = {Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, global emissions have put the
   world beyond its goals. While there are calls for increasing ambition,
   countries must match their current international commitments at the
   national level. Democracies were assumed to comply with their own
   international commitments, yet their ability to adopt national
   mitigation policies that are consistent with their nationally determined
   contributions (NDCs) varies. This study applies the Vertical Policy
   Harmonization Index to quantify the extent to which countries'
   mitigation commitments are vertically harmonized in their NDCs and
   national policies. Using qualitative comparative analysis, I investigate
   the role of institutions, interests, and ideas in shaping the vertical
   (dis)harmony of twenty-four democracies. I find that fossil fuel
   dependency constrains the harmonization of mitigation commitments, even
   in the face of high vulnerability and low abatement costs. Moreover, the
   results support the previous findings of an ambiguous relationship
   between veto points and mitigation commitment. However, the roles of an
   established green party and public opinion in shaping disharmony remain
   unclear.},

Abstract = {This article provides a reflection on the jihadist threat, the policies
   and actors that deal with this threat and the impact of jihadism and
   counterterrorism in Western Europe in the past twenty years. It
   describes how the threat, counterterrorism policies and their impact
   have developed over time and demonstrates how threat perceptions in
   society and the political arena have not always been aligned with the
   actual threat. There have been periods of disbalance between the threat
   and responses to it, leading to both overreactions and inflated threat
   descriptions and fear levels, as well as periods with limited attention
   that might have contributed to unpleasant surprises at a later stage.
   Against this backdrop, the article criticises the incident-driven
   approach to counterterrorism and warns against both overreactions as
   well as `jihadism fatigue'.},

Title = {Retail Price Differences between Packaged and Unpackaged Fruits (Apples)
   and Vegetables (Tomatoes, Peppers)},
Journal = {WORLD},

Abstract = {Since, according to many scientific studies, price is a very important
   factor when buying fruits and vegetables, it is interesting to study
   whether price differences between them occur in retail markets. Because
   of the discussion regarding sustainability, we performed an
   observational, orienting study on the retail prices of frequently bought
   packaged and unpackaged fruits and vegetables (apples, tomatoes, and
   bell peppers) in the Munich area in February and March 2022. We also
   differentiated between organic and non-organic produce. The relationship
   between the type of packaging (packaged versus unpackaged) and the
   retail price (EUR/kg) was determined by means of correlation
   coefficients, and we examined whether unpackaged products were more
   expensive than the packaged variants. The results differed for the
   organic and non-organic variants of the products, as well as among the
   individual fruit and vegetable varieties. We found a tendency towards
   unpackaged products being more expensive than packaged fruits and

Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has run numerous missions under its Common
   Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Researchers have long highlighted
   various challenges, which ultimately hamper the EU's ability to conduct
   crisis management operations abroad. However, only rarely are those at
   the forefront of CSDP given a voice. Building on recent contributions
   that focus on the everyday implementation of peace operations and
   drawing on an extensive set of in-depth interviews with European police
   officers, we examine mission members' perspectives on challenges
   regularly discussed at headquarter levels. We show how seemingly mundane
   challenges, such as tight control imposed on missions by Brussels-based
   institutions, an extensive mission-internal bureaucracy and a rigid
   adherence to administrative logics, can significantly hamper missions'
   everyday operation on the ground. We also highlight that staffing CSDP
   missions is more complex than simply meeting quantitative targets and
   the difficulties that arise for missions' day-to-day operation when
   officers lack necessary skills and mission personnel rotates frequently.
   In addition, we also offer a glimpse into the ways in which police
   officers cope with these challenges.},

Abstract = {The Philippines is not typically the focus of transitional justice (TJ)
   scholarship. Yet, it has had to deal with violent legacies pertaining to
   each generation of TJ and has installed several TJ initiatives in
   response to this. This has given rise to a densely populated TJ
   landscape, spanning different periods and regions and including both
   formal and informal initiatives within various TJ pillars. In spite of
   this plethora of initiatives, the Philippines can hardly be called a
   `successful' case of dealing with violent legacies - with the recent
   election of Bongbong Marcos as the most striking example thereof. In
   this article I argue that this can be understood in light of the absence
   of a genuine TJ ecology: there has not been an encompassing approach in
   which various kinds of initiatives interact with each other based on
   intersecting normative objectives. I argue that the case of the

Abstract = {A standard text-as-data workflow in the social sciences involves
   identifying a set of documents to be labeled, selecting a random sample
   of them to label using research assistants, training a supervised
   learner to label the remaining documents, and validating that model's
   performance using standard accuracy metrics. The most resource-intensive
   component of this is the hand-labeling: carefully reading documents,
   training research assistants, and paying human coders to label documents
   in duplicate or more. We show that hand-coding an algorithmically
   selected rather than a simple-random sample can improve model
   performance above baseline by as much as 50\%, or reduce hand-coding
   costs by up to two-thirds, in applications predicting (1) U.S.
   executive-order significance and (2) financial sentiment on social
   media. We accompany this manuscript with open-source software to
   implement these tools, which we hope can make supervised learning
   cheaper and more accessible to researchers.},

Abstract = {This introduction to the themed section `The history of national
   indifference. A critical appraisal' explores the challenges and
   possibilities of the concept of national indifference. It starts from
   the premise that national indifference remains a very useful concept to
   avoid falling into teleological narratives of nationalism. The central
   argument is that national indifference needs to be theorized as a
   non-binary, relative concept that is not the complete opposite of
   national identification. Indeed, the contributions show that national
   indifference has gradations and can coexist with explicit, banal or
   everyday forms of nationalism, both among elites and ordinary people,
   both in and outside of East Central Europe, both before and after the
   Two World Wars. This central argument results from an engagement with
   three areas of debate surrounding the national indifference literature,
   which all relate to its (inadvertent) reproduction of binary
   understandings of nationalism: the dichotomous conceptualization of east
   versus west, nationalisation versus non-nationalisation and elites
   versus masses.},

Abstract = {East Timorese nationalism experienced a unique generational transition
   during Indonesia's occupation hinging onto internationalism in the
   changing world. In contrast to the existing literature on nationalism,
   which is overwhelmingly focused on earlier construction of nationalism
   and post-independence nation building, this article offers a theoretical
   account of the transformation of nationalism from an older to newer
   generation through a socio-historical analysis. In light of interactions
   between nationalism and internationalism, it argues that while the older
   generation relied on a Lusophone cosmology of anti-colonialism derived
   from counterparts in Portuguese colonies in Africa in the 1960s, the
   younger generation took advantage of universal human rights advocacy in
   the 1990s in its aspiration for independence. In doing so, this study
   demonstrates both generational continuity and change in the
   construction, development and transformation of East Timorese
   nationalism.},

Abstract = {In an effort to counteract China's maritime expansionism, Japan has
   endeavoured to be a prominent player in the South China Sea dispute over
   the past decade. While previous studies have emphasized the limitations
   of Japan's South China Sea policy, one question still remains: to what
   extent has Japan's policy been successful? By utilizing Baldwin's
   analytical framework for foreign policy evaluation-which takes into
   account factors such as stakes, effectiveness and costs-this article
   argues that Japan's policy has achieved moderate success. Despite its
   limitations, Japan's policy has been relatively successful as it helps
   to maintain America's military presence in the region, and creates
   normative and diplomatic obstacles for China's activities in the South
   China Sea without damaging Sino-Japanese relations. Additionally,
   Japan's policy helps uphold the rules-based order by strengthening the
   maritime law enforcement capabilities of selected Southeast Asian
   states. The costs of the policy to Japan are acceptable, particularly
   given that it has little impact on the waters surrounding the country.
   Conversely, the policy imposes increased material, normative and time
   costs on China. Given China's uncompromising historical and security
   position in the South China Sea, the qualified success of Japan's policy
   should be acknowledged.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyse security within Europe's Eastern
   Partnership as perceived from the outside - notably by Russia. It
   analyses the impact of Russia's security on European security thinking
   in its Eastern Partnership through the lens of ontological security.
   Russia's relationship with the West, based on its ontological security
   fears, is characterised by the collective trauma and stigma of USSR
   disintegration. Europe's ontological security anxiety and fear in its
   relationship with Russia is caused by the wars in Georgia and Ukraine,
   as well as Russia's hybrid warfare. The ontological security interaction
   in the Eastern Neighbourhood has had two effects: (1) it heightened
   Putin's emphasis on the protection of spiritual, cultural and national
   identity and how the stigma of territorial loss plays a strategic role
   on the ability to build Russian collective identity reflexively; and (2)
   Russia has aimed at a re-construction of Europe along different
   geopolitical lines, whereby Dugin's Eurasian views have shaped Putin's
   discourse. This article analyses the EU's policy and practices following
   the war in Ukraine (in two phases in 2014 and 2022) in the Eastern
   Neighbourhood.},

Abstract = {Authoritarian regimes often direct the course of electoral politics in
   ways that allow them to concentrate and consolidate power. This
   observation applies well to Pakistan and its three autocratic regimes
   under military rulers General Ayub Khan (1958-69), Zia-ul-Haq (1977-88),
   and General Parvez Musharraf (1999-2008). The political reforms enacted
   by Zia-ul-Haq, his devolution programme, and his mode of channelling
   development funds via elected politicians exerted an enduring impact on
   the country's political system. Specifically, we argue that
   institutional changes under Zia's regime have stimulated the rise of
   family politics in replacement of party politics, resulting in the
   formation and consolidation of political dynasties. They have also
   contributed to the capture of local bureaucracy by elected politicians
   thereby entrenching clientelism.},

Abstract = {Japan's gig economy has grown significantly over the last decade.
   Government and business elites have actively sought to promote gig work,
   highlighting the opportunities it offers in terms of greater autonomy
   for workers. This is despite a number of detrimental consequences
   arising from the further flexibilisation of labour markets associated
   with gig work. This chapter explores these developments, discussing how
   the integration of new digital technologies has become a key measure
   through which efforts are being made to increase productivity and
   further growth in Japan's ailing economy. This has acted to deprive gig
   workers of skills and lock them into low-paid and precarious jobs, as
   well as increasing workplace surveillance and control. Reflecting the
   precarious nature of gig work, some of the gig workers have opposed the
   unstable and hazardous nature of precarious work. Nevertheless, social
   conflict in the Japanese gig economy has been limited. This is partly
   due to a high level of consent among gig workers, which has also emerged
   as a concomitant phenomenon of the gig economy.},

Abstract = {The 2023 presidential runoff election in the Czech Republic showed that
   populist candidate Andrej Babi enjoyed support in regions designated as
   structurally disadvantaged. These regions are affected by multiple
   problems, particularly in the social, economic, and educational spheres.
   The present study uses qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to
   determine the reasons for populist support in these regions and whether
   all of them show similar combinations of conditions. In particular, the
   study works with conditions related to social capital and phenomena such
   as civil society. We find that the victory of Andrej Babi occurred in
   regions exhibiting identical combinations of conditions (problems)
   facilitating support for populist candidates.},

Abstract = {By opening the gates on the border to Ceuta in May 2021, Morocco
   explicitly engaged in coercive engineered migration (CEM) to establish a
   tradeoff of sovereignty claims over the Spanish exclave city and the
   Western Sahara territory. In this article, we test Greenhill's theory on
   why stronger liberal democratic states yield to this strategy by weaker
   autocratic states against the public debate in Spain on how the
   government devolved the migrants and relinquished the future of its
   ex-colony in the desert, with evidence from the mass media, official
   documents and personal interviews. We offer an alternative conceptual
   model for CEM by critically recalibrating factors within her domestic
   account and shifting the focus to geopolitical considerations. We argue
   that externalization of border control has tended to blur expected
   differences among political regimes, reducing the risk of ideological
   polarization and hypocrisy costs, typical of democracies according to
   theory, and leaving fear of swamping of hosting resources as the main
   domestic explanation of successful CEM across regimes. It has embedded
   border control in multiple issue-linkages, increasing the leverage of
   countries of origin and transit in the multi-scalar international
   tapestry of migration diplomacy.},

Abstract = {The Anoa is a wild animal endemic to Sulawesi that looks like a small
   cow. Anoa are categorized as vulnerable to extinction on the IUCN red
   list. There are two species of Anoa, namely Lowland Anoa (Bubalus
   depressicornis) and Mountain Anoa (Bubalus quarlesi). In this study, a
   comparison of potential habitat models for Anoa species was conducted
   using Machine Learning algorithms with the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and
   Random Forest (RF) methods. This modeling uses eight environmental
   variables. Where based on the results of Bubalus quarlesi potential
   habitat modeling, the RF 75:25 model is the best algorithm with the
   highest variable contribution, namely humidity of 82.444\% and a
   potential area of 5\% of Sulawesi Island, with an Area Under Curve (AUC)
   of 0.987. Meanwhile, the best Bubalus depressicornis habitat potential
   model is the RF 70:30 algorithm, with the highest variable contribution,
   namely population of 88.891\% and potential area of 36\% of Sulawesi
   Island, with AUC 0.967. This indicates that Anoa extinction is very
   sensitive to the presence of humidity and human population levels.},

Abstract = {A recent paper by Haffner et al. (2023, Political Analysis 31, 481-499)
   introduces an interpretable deep learning approach for domain-specific
   dictionary creation, where it is claimed that the dictionary-based
   approach outperforms finetuned language models in predictive accuracy
   while retaining interpretability. We show that the dictionary-based
   approach's reported superiority over large language models, BERT
   specifically, is due to the fact that most of the parameters in the
   language models are excluded from finetuning. In this letter, we first
   discuss the architecture of BERT models, then explain the limitations of
   finetuning only the top classification layer, and lastly we report
   results where finetuned language models outperform the newly proposed
   dictionary-based approach by 27\% in terms of \$R<\^{}>2\$ and 46\% in
   terms of mean squared error once we allow these parameters to learn
   during finetuning. Researchers interested in large language models, text
   classification, and text regression should find our results useful. Our
   code and data are publicly available.},

Abstract = {The Russian war against Ukraine in February 2022, unleashed an
   unprecedented wave of non-governmental, external resistance directed
   against Russia. In many ways, previous literature on war and resistance
   does not capture the characteristics of this phenomenon. Besides noting
   the presence of civilian war protests outside of the warzone, most
   research has focused on internal resistance during war. In this article,
   we draw on a wider array of resistance literature and present an
   analytical framework that allows us to capture the broad elements of
   non-governmental, external resistance during war - including the
   power-resistance nexus at work. The analytical framework sorts the
   various kinds of resisters, it categorises the form of resistance and
   the targets pursued. The usefulness of the analytical framework is
   demonstrated through an exploration of empirical examples and
   illustrations drawn from media reports gathered during the first 10 days
   of the war in Ukraine. It is concluded that new analytical tools are
   necessary in order to capture non-governmental, external resistance
   during war as it is waged in Europe in the 2020s.},

Abstract = {The Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), despite being regarded as the most
   developed integration project in the post-Soviet area, has faced
   different hurdles in acquiring international recognition. Especially,
   the EU, the EAEU's Significant Other, has been reluctant to formally
   recognize it, in spite of close ties with EAEU member states as well as
   of its own self-image as a supporter of regional integrations. This
   paper focuses on this puzzle and examines how the EU has been
   discursively explaining its non-recognition of the EAEU at the
   institutional level. Based on the analysis of EU-articulated narratives
   since 2010, the paper reveals three dominant representations of the EAEU
   in the EU discourse: (1) Russia's geopolitical project; (2) a
   protectionist union; and (3) a dysfunctional union. These narratives
   have been used by Brussels to create the EAEU's image as a threatening
   Other, thus justifying why the EU cannot formally recognize the EAEU and
   officially engage with it. The paper also identifies five different
   stages of the EU's discursive representation of the EAEU since 2010,
   when its tone and content varied. The paper concludes that such
   non-recognition from the Significant Other still limits the EAEU's
   international agency despite its increasing interest in cooperation with
   non-Western actors.},

Abstract = {Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks by al Qaeda on the United
   States, the terrorist threat has evolved. Two decades on, the world
   continues to worry about violent Islamist terrorist attacks, though now
   the threat picture seems dominated by lone actor plots which often seem
   disconnected from any major terrorist group. This article seeks to
   understand how we got to where we are today by tracing a line through
   the threat that has been seen over the past twenty years to understand
   how the threat and response interact with each other. It also seeks to
   cast a light on how the lone actor threat became the dominant part of
   the threat picture in large parts of the west.},

Title = {Demographic Delusions: World Population Growth Is Exceeding Most
   Projections and Jeopardising Scenarios for Sustainable Futures},
Journal = {WORLD},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {545-568},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The size of the world's population has profound implications for demand
   for food, energy and resources, land use change and greenhouse gas
   emissions. This study examines why most population projections have
   underestimated world population growth, and the implications for actions
   required to achieve sustainable societies. The main determinant of
   future population is family size choices. Population projections by
   different research groups embed different assumptions about drivers of
   fertility decline. The common assumptions that fertility decline is
   driven by economic betterment, urbanisation or education levels are not
   well supported in historical evidence. In contrast, voluntary family
   planning provision and promotion achieved rapid fertility decline, even
   in poor, rural and illiterate communities. Projections based on
   education and income as drivers of fertility decline ignore the reverse
   causation, that lowering fertility through family planning interventions
   enabled economic advancement and improved women's education access. In
   recent decades, support for family planning has waned, and global
   fertility decline has decelerated as a result. Projections calibrated
   across the decades of strong family planning support have not
   acknowledged this change and are consequently underestimating global
   population growth. Scenarios used to model sustainable futures have used
   overly optimistic population projections while inferring these outcomes
   will happen without targeted measures to bring them about. Unless
   political will is rapidly restored for voluntary family planning
   programs, the global population will almost certainly exceed 10 billion,
   rendering sustainable food security and a safe climate unachievable.},

Abstract = {This text builds on existing debates on types of populism in
   contemporary political science literature. Our premise is that with new
   types of populism emerging in the debate, and with the significantly
   increasing number of texts dealing with populism, the types are being
   hollowed out. Using a dataset consisting of a total of 539 texts
   published between 2011 and 2020 containing the keyword populism and
   using a machine-learning based classification model of concordance data,
   we show that (1.) ambiguities and confusions among the different types
   of populism become more prominent over the study period, categories
   become emptier and their usefulness for classification decreases, and
   (2.) the only stable and consensually defined type in the long run is
   right-wing populism. We conclude by recommending to depart from creating
   classifications of types of populism based on specific ideological or
   non-ideological features and to keep these levels (populism and other
   features) - within analysis - separate.},

Abstract = {The European Green Deal (EGD) marked the commitment of the European
   Union (EU) to a carbon-free, socially inclusive economic system. Even if
   conceived as an essentially domestic growth strategy, the EGD is
   inspiring EU diplomacy, as economic cooperation will be needed to
   realize the EGD's ambitious vision. This profile aims to investigate and
   reflect on the potential implications of the EGD for the countries in
   the EU's Southern Neighbourhood, especially in the energy sector,
   agriculture and food system, trade in raw materials, climate action, and
   circular economy. We expect the EGD to result in an increased investment
   in renewable energy, a reduction in emissions, green diplomacy, and
   funding opportunities for green projects and green infrastructures. The
   EGD brings with it attractive opportunities for a better cooperation on
   climate action and opportunities for job creation, green growth, and
   sustainable development. We believe that the EGD has the potential to be
   a win-win deal for the EU and its Southern Neighbours, with the EU goal
   to supply green inputs and of creating a market for green products.},

Abstract = {Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14-life below water-significantly
   elevated global awareness of the importance of the oceans. It is also a
   key SDG for achieving the other 16 goals and targets. However, the
   global community is a long way off achieving this goal and serious
   equity concerns have been raised in the context of SDG 14. This
   perspective paper provides a summary of the overall progress, or the
   lack thereof, in achieving SDG 14 and examines some of the obstacles
   which might undermine the achievement of this goal, such as weak
   indicators and a lack of recognition of Indigenous and traditional
   knowledge. This paper also provides recommendations on how countries and
   stakeholders could take a step closer to achieving SDG 14. Overall,
   reiterating the calls of global experts, it is imperative that SDG 14 is
   implemented in an equitable and just way, without further discriminating
   against developing countries and vulnerable communities.},

Abstract = {The present article maps and analyses the different meanings of the EU's
   resilience narratives in its neighbourhood policy towards authoritarian
   regimes. While a large part of the existing literature has placed an
   emphasis on the role of resilience in EU foreign policy more generally,
   the specific use and representations of resilience in EU policy towards
   authoritarian regimes remains ill-explored. However, it is specifically
   in the context of the EU's relations with authoritarian regimes, that
   references to resilience, and especially `state resilience', are highly
   problematic. Focusing on the EU's neighbourhood policy and the case of
   Belarus, we present a discourse analysis of the different uses of the
   term resilience in the official discourses of key EU institutions. In a
   first-order critique, we examine how the EU's narratives construct
   resilience, and in particular for whom, what, when, where, and why. We
   show that the EU's resilience discourses are inherently state-centric
   and present highly contradictory goals of resilience-building. In a
   second-order critique, we demonstrate the problematic political
   implications of the EU's usage of the term resilience, including the
   omission of `everyday forms of resilience and resistance' from the EU's
   narratives.},

Abstract = {Widely held gender stereotypes present obstacles for women experts, who
   are generally evaluated less positively than equally qualified men
   across a range of fields. While audiences may view women as better
   equipped to handle certain feminine-stereotyped issues, Role Congruency
   Theory suggests that expert authority in politics may be incongruent
   with traditional feminine gender roles, leading to a subsequent
   backlash. Building upon the latter theory, I hypothesize that when cued
   to consider the expertise of a news source, the (in)congruence of
   gender-stereotyped roles will activate gender biases which increase the
   gap in evaluations and trust of women and men. Using selection
   experiments, I assess the relationship between domain-relevant expertise
   and gender biases across a range of gender-stereotyped issues. I find
   that women experts are rewarded less for additional expertise and
   punished more severely for a lack of expertise, exacerbating
   gender-based biases relative to the control. I find that this pattern is
   consistent across both masculine- and feminine-stereotyped issues,
   including issues that disproportionately impact women, such as women's
   health care and the gender wage gap. The addition of competing partisan
   cues, however, overwhelms the influence of gender. The normative
   implications suggest women in the media often face an uphill battle to
   advocate for their interests on key issues that affect them even when
   they may have more direct relevant experience in addition to their
   qualifications.},

Title = {Multilateral Climate Finance Coordination: Politics and Depoliticization
   in Practice},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {125-147},

Abstract = {The governance of public climate finance for mitigation and adaptation
   in developing countries is fragmented on both the international and
   national levels, with a high diversity of actors with overlapping
   mandates, preferences, and areas of expertise. In the absence of one
   unifying actor or institution, coordination among actors has emerged as
   a response to this fragmentation. In this article, we study the
   coordination efforts of the two most important multilateral climate
   funds, the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) and the Green Climate Fund
   (GCF), on the global level as well as within two recipient countries,
   Kenya and Zambia. The CIF and the GCF are anchored within the World Bank
   and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,
   respectively, and represent two diverging perspectives on climate
   finance. We find that on both levels, coordination was depoliticized by
   treating it as a technical exercise, rendering invisible the political
   divergences among actors. The implications of this depoliticization are
   that both funds coordinate mainly with actors with similar preferences,
   and consequently, coordination did not achieve its objectives. The
   article contributes to the literatures on coordination, climate finance,
   and environmental governance by showing how a response to the
   fragmentation of climate governance did not overcome political fault
   lines but rather reinforced them.},

Abstract = {During the last decade, democratic backsliding (DB) has become a
   worrying phenomenon worldwide. This article addresses this topic by
   focusing on Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). An overview of the
   literature on DB in this region has identified a relevant lacuna: the
   lack of attention to the role political support indicators (democratic
   satisfaction, government trust) may play in DB processes. Testing
   several hypotheses through different random regression models applied to
   CEE countries for the period 2005-2021, an unexpected puzzle emerges:
   contrary to the expectations, we find that a greater government trust
   contributes to DB. Building on several consolidated findings of the
   system support theory and the classic democratisation literature, we
   address this puzzle, identifying temporal phases, mechanisms and causal
   relations and stressing the relevance of interaction processes among a
   complex set of causal factors to explain DB processes in CEE.},

Title = {Resisting China's ICT Influence in Sub-Saharan Africa: A
   Bandwagoning-for-Profit Perspective},
Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {59},
Number = {01},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In light of the increasingly pivotal role of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in
   the escalating US-China competition, this paper explores why US-led
   anti-Chinese information and communications technology (ICT) campaigns
   have not resonated with African countries. It notes that Washington's
   narrative about China's ICT activities in the region corresponds with
   Stephen Walt's ``balance of threat,{''} emphasizing the threat of China
   and demanding that African states balance against its cyber aggression.
   It argues, however, that American policymakers should focus more on
   Randall Schweller's ``bandwagoning for profit{''} to resist China's ICT
   influence in the region because the pitfalls of malignant Chinese ICTs
   are outweighed by the opportunities and prospects of mobile-driven
   digital transformation there. This paper explores Washington's
   unsatisfactory approach toward the SSA, traces China's long-term
   penetration into the digital sector among African countries, and argues
   that the country's strategic objective in the region is to establish a
   digital ecosystem filled with Chinese technologies and devices. It then
   evaluates the region's digital prospects and the yearning among African
   countries to learn from China's late development path. The paper
   concludes that China is not winning hearts and minds in the region and
   both strategies of balancing and bandwagoning persist in Sino-African
   relations. African countries would not always bandwagon with China if
   there were more alternatives. To resist the country's ICT influence in
   the region, Washington should engage with Africa's ICT industries,
   deepen trade relations and help to grow its digital economy.},

Abstract = {The central-local structure is a unique perspective for both China's
   constitutional law and party-state structure. However, the conventional
   approach to this issue pays great attention to its structural framework.
   This paper takes a unique approach to the functionality of local
   government guidance funds, an increasingly frequently used method for
   local governments to implement national projects like Made in China
   2025. The project has been one of the several controversies between the
   United States and China in their ongoing trade confrontation. Built upon
   an analysis of paradigms in central-local relations, this paper further
   investigates the rule of law movement at the level of local government,
   an often ignored and under-discussed aspect of China's central-local
   structure. The tentative conclusion is that the use of local government
   guidance funds facilitates local competition and promotes the rule of
   law.},

Abstract = {In the face of intensifying strategic competition between the United
   States and China, most Southeast Asian states continue to prefer hedging
   strategies in an effort to maintain autonomy and flexibility. This
   involves deepening ties with both superpowers rather than siding with
   one or the other. Many studies have focused on why and how states hedge,
   but no scholarly analysis to date has considered why a state would
   abandon hedging even when it is not facing a direct security threat.
   While structural realist factors such as external security threats and
   economic rewards remain significant determinants for alignment
   decisions, this article demonstrates that internal threats can also
   compel states to abandon hedging in favour of bandwagoning. The article
   examines two case studies, Cambodia and Myanmar, to demonstrate how
   autocratic rulers in those two countries have stopped hedging and opted
   for closer alignment with Beijing in order to bolster regime security.
   In both cases, political leaders have prioritized personal interests and
   regime survival over national interests.},

Abstract = {The Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) established in 2015 has developed an
   institutional framework that on the paper largely mimics the European
   Union's. The article suggests that a closer examination of the economic
   interdependence in the region adds valuable knowledge regarding the
   development of the organization. The analysis follows a
   (post)-functionalist model and highlights how the integration process
   responds to economic interdependence, and that the integration process
   has the potential of generating spillovers. The Eurasian Economic
   Commission (EEC) has initiated work targeting the removal of non-tariff
   barriers, and business associations in the region are paying attention
   to the organization. Yet, there are also several constraints to
   integration in the region linked to the member states' reluctance to
   delegate substantial powers to the EEC, and their insistence on the
   cooperation as being merely economic. These limitations are in line with
   previous suggestions in the literature regarding non-democratic regional
   organizations.},

Abstract = {With the 1979 revolution, Iran's Security Assistance (SA) underwent a
   significant transformation, from fragmented and ideologically-driven
   support for Islamic movements in the early post-revolutionary stage to
   making SA the centrepiece of its national security strategy. This
   article explores Iran' model of SA by addressing the following key
   questions: How have perceptions of SA and its role in post-revolutionary
   Iran's strategic thinking changed? What constitutes key elements of the
   Iranian SA practice? Is there an `Iranian way' of assisting local
   military partners, and to what extent does it overlap with other states'
   similar practices? The paper identifies a two-stage process of
   evolution, arguing that SA gradually evolved into a strategic tool to
   build a Tehran-led regional alliance model, boost Iran's deterrence
   capability, and counter the US-led collective security architecture.
   With a hybrid ideological and anti-imperialist rationale at its core,
   relying on human bonds and personal loyalties, mixing asymmetric
   operations with sustained force projection, and using a centralized
   command structure with minimum public exposure, Tehran has introduced a
   unique model of security assistance. The paper shows how Iran has moved
   beyond a technical view of SA to gradually shape a holistic model with
   interwoven messianic, economic, and strategic dimensions.},

Abstract = {This paper questions the opportunities that Yellow Vests as a Networked
   Social Movement (NETSM) created for politically underrepresented groups.
   Without a clear authority structure and a formal organisation, NETSMs
   challenge traditional leadership understandings. Nonetheless, their
   ability to determine precision in setting goals, demands, and strategies
   is disputed in the NETSM literature. Considering both aspects, the paper
   evaluates Yellow Vests' success in bridging two underrepresented groups
   inclined to radicalisation. The study rests on 77 interviews with
   young-adult French citizens who support Radical Right movements (n=40)
   or self-identify as Muslim in the public sphere of Paris and Lyon
   (n=37). I argue that Yellow Vests' baseline arguments (e.g., against the
   pension reform and tax hikes) were precise enough to be shared by our
   interlocutors. Meanwhile, our interlocutors left the group boundaries
   sufficiently imprecise so that the movement could reach beyond their
   parochial identities. Bringing the two features together, the movement
   opened up new (e.g., class-based) radicalisation possibilities other
   than those relying on the Islamist and nativist vocabularies. After
   analysing this combination of precision and imprecision in the context
   of several unresolved problems, I conclude that the movement's
   vulnerability emanates from its failure to refine the combination that
   initially symbolised a shared future imagination.},

Title = {The Security-Sustainability Nexus: Lithium Onshoring in the Global North},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {20-41},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The political economy of lithium, a ``critical mineral{''} for the
   renewable energy transition, is marked by two striking developments.
   First, Global North governments that have historically offshored mining
   are onshoring lithium to enhance ``supply chain security.{''} Second,
   these governments have committed to ``sustainably sourcing{''} lithium.
   In this article, I theorize both developments in terms of a novel
   security-sustainability nexus: an interlocking set of policies and
   justifications that promote lithium extraction and emphasize the
   environmental credentials of Global North mining. The
   security-sustainability nexus evidences an alignment between state and
   corporate interests. For public officials, onshoring policies counter
   China's ``dominance{''} over battery supply chains. For mining and auto
   firms, onshoring translates into lucrative incentives, supply security,
   and reputational benefits. However, despite this state-corporate
   alignment, the tensions within the security-sustainability nexus
   illuminate the contradictions of green capitalism. I conclude that the
   geopolitical and socioenvironmental conflicts over the material
   foundations of the energy transition are reshaping the inequalities
   linked to extractive sectors.},

Abstract = {From 2015, China began to promote eco-sustainability in the Belt and
   Road Initiative (BRI) through not only vision statements but also
   specific guidelines and governance initiatives. What has driven these
   policy changes? Bringing together theories of norm localization, norm
   subsidiarity, and policy deliberation, we argue that China's move toward
   green BRI began as a norm localization process where environmental norms
   emerged in the open policy space created by China's top leaders carrying
   the ambition to make the BRI a new global governance model. After
   adopting a broad norm on environmental stewardship, state bureaucracies
   found opportunities to create procedural and operational rules. A novel
   procedural rule-making methodology emphasizing inclusive dialogue with
   host countries has emerged, driven by top leaders' pursuit of
   international leadership and preexisting local norms guiding South-South
   cooperation. With operational rules, different actors follow their
   preferences to localize existing international standards or develop new
   ones.},

Abstract = {This article examines the disruptive effect of coups on party systems.
   Coups are junctures that can increase polarization and explain party
   system disruption-measured in the dynamics and determinants of
   inter-party competition. Until recently, scholars labeled Honduras's
   party system as one of Latin America's most institutionalized, albeit
   based on clientelist linkages. The 2009 coup against President Manuel
   Zelaya abruptly ended decades of two-party rule. We use presidential and
   legislative election results and the AmericasBarometer surveys to assess
   the coup's impact on vote choice. The evidence shows that the coup
   jumpstarted an ideological alignment in a party system where clientelism
   had historically thrived.},

   resilience before the military intervention},

Abstract = {The concept of resilience has become a leitmotif for the current foreign
   policy narrative and practices of most Western states and international
   organisations. It has been more visible due to the pandemic crisis and
   accentuated significantly in the midst of the escalation between Ukraine
   and Russia. This article first discusses various notions of resilience,
   especially unpacking state-centred and societal approaches to
   resilience. In the empirical section, it identifies and compares the
   views and approaches to the resilience of the EU and Ukraine. The
   qualitative content analysis shows that their views on resilience
   identified in the official documents have differed substantially over
   the last few years. Yet, the top-down (or state-centred) approach
   clearly dominates in both environments. While the EU links resilience to
   stabilisation of the area, Ukraine has formulated the concept only
   recently, connecting it first with the desire to belong to the EU
   community, but soon tested it in the face of a Russian attack.
   Therefore, the war has triggered severe discussion, not only about the
   future commitment of the EU to the Eastern region but also pushes both
   actors (often unwillingly) towards adapting their societies in a rapidly
   changing world and possibly towards reformulating the concept as such.},

Abstract = {A key security partner of the region for more than a decade, the
   European Union today faces growing challenges and the potential failure
   of its policy towards the Sahel. While the cycle of violence does not
   appear to be receding, rivals such as Russia - but also Western allies
   such as Turkey or the Gulf states - are building new partnerships in the
   region. Contesting the idea that exogenous factors alone explain
   strategic shortcomings, we explore instead how the evolution of EU
   initiatives aimed at preventing and countering violent extremism (P/CVE)
   has contributed to strategic misalignments with Sahelian partners. The
   choice of new international partners by Sahelian states does not
   primarily follow from ideological reasons, but rather displays tactical
   ductility and sensitivity to political costs and strategic opportunity.
   The EU assistance to the emergence of a regional security model, based
   increasingly on securitization and militarization through ambiguous, at
   times incoherent and self-referential policies, should be examined to
   better understand the weakening of political influence in the Sahel.},

Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {4},
Pages = {911-934},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {Media coverage of affective polarization-partisans disliking and
   distrusting out-partisans while liking and trusting in-partisans-is
   abundant, both creating and reflecting a belief among the public that
   partisans are more affectively polarized than they are. These trends
   suggest that affective polarization among partisans could be viewed as
   socially desirable, which may then shape partisans' expressed attitudes
   and behavior. To examine this, I run four original surveys and study two
   broad research questions: (1) Does this social desirability exist?; and
   (2) Can it influence partisans' expressed affective polarization? I find
   that affective polarization among partisans is indeed socially desirable
   and that, largely motivated by self-presentation desires, this social
   desirability can shape partisans' expressed affective polarization.
   However, my results also suggest that affective polarization responses
   are rather ingrained in partisans, and that while partisans are aware of
   this social desirability and its effect on their behavior, small changes
   in survey context do not necessarily produce large changes in affective
   polarization responses. Overall, the results offer necessary nuance to
   our understanding of affective polarization, implying that social
   desirability-which can be shifted by contexts-can alter how affectively
   polarized people act.},

Abstract = {Repeated fires cause peatlands to degrade. Fire management has been
   carried out, but fires continue to occur, especially during the dry
   season. Through social capital that exists in the community based on the
   local wisdom of the Banjar people in environmental management, it is
   hoped that peatland fires can be overcome in this area. This research
   aims to analyze the social capital of the Banjar people in mitigating
   land fires based on local wisdom and the environment. The sample in this
   study was 250 people who live in an area prone to fires on peatlands in
   Banjarbaru, South Kalimantan, Indonesia. There are three variables in
   this study, namely Trust (T), Network (N), and Norm (N). There are 33
   Likert scale questions (1-4, strongly agree-strongly disagree). We also
   conducted interviews with 20 members of the Fire Care Community (MPA) to
   obtain information about the social capital of the Banjar community in
   mitigating land fires. The analysis used is Structural Equation Modeling
   (SEM). The study results show norms have the greatest influence on
   disaster mitigation of peatland fires compared to trust and social
   networks. Norms in the community in the form of values from peatlands,
   rules, norms, and sanctions regulate the community more to deal with the
   problem of peatland fires than trust and social networks},

   Least Squares, and conduct inference using ``dyadic-robust{''} variance
   estimators. The latter assumes that dyads are uncorrelated if they do
   not share a common unit (e.g., if the same individual is not present in
   both pairs of data). We show that this assumption does not hold in many
   empirical applications because indirect links may exist due to network
   connections, generating correlated outcomes. Hence, ``dyadic-robust{''}
   estimators can be biased in such situations. We develop a consistent
   variance estimator for such contexts by leveraging results in network
   statistics. Our estimator has good finite-sample properties in
   simulations, while allowing for decay in spillover effects. We
   illustrate our message with an application to politicians' voting
   behavior when they are seating neighbors in the European Parliament.},

Title = {Illiberal spectatorship - the disfigurement of citizenship in Hungary
   and Poland},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 13},
Abstract = {Hungary and Poland have been forerunners of democratic backsliding in
   Europe. Both governments have been building an `illiberal democracy'
   using the populist promise to return power to the people. We argue that
   despite this promise, the Fidesz and PiS governments have undertaken
   political reforms that turn citizens into spectators with a very limited
   say or take in politics and willing objects of propaganda and
   disinformation. The turning of citizens into spectators is integral part
   of democratic backsliding as illiberal policies empty citizenship of its
   meaning, thus facilitating transition to autocracy. Illiberal regimes 1)
   capture media to control public opinion, 2) remove the opportunities for
   citizens to exercise their political agency, 3) redefine the contours of
   the political community to the extent that critical citizens' belonging
   is questioned, 4) and instead of political choices, they present an
   emotional spectacle, often based on propaganda, fake news or straight
   lies. Spectators do not merely watch the show, they assist in its
   creation as fans of leaders who supposedly express and realize their
   collective will - the voice of true people. This way, spectatorship
   becomes the societal and cultural underpinning of the illiberal regime,
   where leaders fake democracy to hoard and hold onto power.},

Abstract = {Differential access to life-saving COVID-19 vaccines reveals the
   inequitable distribution of wealth and power in the global system. While
   several countries have developed homegrown vaccines to avoid being
   priced out of markets dominated by transnational drug companies,
   Brazil-a country with a significant research and pharmaceutical
   base-lagged behind those of other middle-income countries. Why? This
   paper blends insights from dependency theory and the theory of global
   capitalism to demonstrate how political coalitions, leadership, and
   normative frameworks negatively affect state capacity and technological
   development. First, austerity in public investment in research,
   development, and innovation prior to and during the pandemic limited the
   amount of resources necessary to create homegrown vaccine candidates.
   Second, political leadership informed by science denialism did not
   prioritize the development of vaccines and even discouraged their use.
   The analysis of vaccine development in Brazil reveals that having a
   pharmaceutical base and strong leadership committed to scientific
   principles and backed by a political coalition seeking to expand social
   democratic rights play a vital role in developing treatments and
   responding to health crises.},

Abstract = {Analyzing the appearances of political figures in large-scale news
   archives is increasingly important with the growing availability of
   large-scale news archives and developments in computer vision. We
   present a deep learning-based method combining face detection, tracking,
   and classification, which is particularly unique because it does not
   require any re-training when targeting new individuals. Users can feed
   only a few images of target individuals to reliably detect, track, and
   classify them. Extensive validation of prominent political figures in
   two news archives spanning 10 to 20 years, one containing three U.S.
   cable news and the other including two major Japanese news programs,
   consistently shows high performance and flexibility of the proposed
   method. The codes are made readily available to the public.},

Abstract = {Invasive alien species (IAS) contribute to biodiversity loss, yet
   animals deemed invasive are both part of biodiversity and individuals
   themselves. This poses a challenge for global environmental politics, as
   governance system goals for biodiversity conservation and animal
   protection can conflict. Using an integrative governance (IG) framework,
   we map global and European Union IAS and animal governance instruments
   and systems, and relationships between them. Relationships are explained
   by actors' unequal power dynamics, prioritization of human and
   environmental health, hegemonic anthropocentric discourses, and trade
   globalization. These factors encourage valuing certain animals-native
   and domestic-above others. Relationships between the governance systems
   have been limited. However, integration is deepening because of the
   transnational and interlinked nature of biodiversity loss and other
   issues, such as climate change and biosecurity. Nevertheless, as
   engagement with nonhuman entities brings new challenges, practicing
   greater IG could go further than this, as acknowledgment of animals'
   interests is lacking in IAS governance.},

Abstract = {The Philippines has historically been known to have one of the most
   robust and politically active civil societies in the world. With a deep
   affinity with democracy, civil society became a reliable bulwark against
   abuses of power and endemic corruption. However, it came under attack
   under the populist, illiberal Duterte administration (2016-2022) through
   intimidation, persecution, massive disinformation, and even outright
   violence. This article examines why Philippine civil society - despite
   its attempted pushback against democratic erosion - was generally
   neutralized by Duterte. Apart from its weakened state given polarizing
   elite conflicts in the 2000s, Duterte engaged in executive assaults
   against civil society through the four strategies of exploiting
   divisions within civil society; securitizing public; regulating civic
   space to weed out opposition voices; and controlling the media
   environment. This article concludes by examining the implications of a
   weakened civil society and prospects for its reinvigoration under a
   restored Marcos dynasty, which won the 2022 Philippine presidential
   elections.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to consider the relationship between sport and
   identity formation by examining testimonies of 24 British women who
   attended the Solheim Cup golf tournament in 2019 to support a
   transnational team made up of professional European women players.
   Relatively little is known about the effects of transnational sports
   teams on identity formation, not least because such teams are themselves
   rare. The Solheim Cup, contested by teams of female professional golfers
   representing the United States and Europe, is one such example. The data
   set consists of interviews with women who attended the competition that
   took place in a period of political uncertainty between the UK
   electorate voting to leave the European Union and Brexit actually taking
   place. The paper analyses the women's views in relation to national
   identity, European identity and cosmopolitanism. Although it emerges
   that most of the women felt more European in the context of a
   competition involving a team representing Europe and were opposed to the
   United Kingdom leaving the European Union, they could also be described
   as cosmopolitan as a result of their educational level, social class and
   experience of living in or regularly visiting foreign countries.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the case of Georgia, this article seeks to understand better
   how the EU's partners adjust to the uncertainty of the EU's offer as
   part of the Eastern Partnership, and how their identification narratives
   evolve in response to this indeterminacy. We use the concept of
   liminality to capture the imprecision of the EU's offer and the state of
   in-betweenness of the EU's associated partners. Through an analysis of
   Georgia's identification practices, we then shed light on how Georgian
   elites have pushed for an identity-driven self-representation as a key
   political strategy vis-a-vis the EU. We argue that such repositioning
   and, more recently, the tactical use of the Association Trio reflect
   Georgia's approach to developing its agency in response to uncertainty.},

Title = {Free speech versus defence of the nation? The media as sources of
   national insecurity in Ukraine},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {82-106},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {The media can cause concern in the context of national security: they
   are described as potential tools and targets of attack that can be
   ``weaponised{''}, and as a space where ``information war{''} is waged.
   Governments may try to block media that are deemed a security threat,
   but the rationale for taking such an action deserves careful
   consideration, given the tension between media restrictions and the
   democratic principle of free speech. This article scrutinises the
   security rationale for restrictions imposed by Ukraine on Russian and
   ``pro-Russian{''} media from 2014. When justifying restrictions,
   Ukrainian officials highlighted the threat of media content both
   distorting perceptions of reality and weakening the foundations of
   Ukrainian nationhood. We, therefore, analyse survey data to investigate
   whether the use of the banned media was associated with variation in
   Ukrainian citizens' perceptions of truth and national values. We find
   that the use of the banned media was linked to mistaken beliefs about
   the veracity of news headlines, both true and false; it was also
   associated with lower support for democracy in Ukraine (a key national
   constitutional value). This evidence from the Ukrainian case informs our
   discussion about the media's impact on national (in)security and
   rationales for media restrictions in democratic contexts more broadly.},

   164-178) introduces a theoretical framework for understanding
   redistricting and electoral systems, built on basic statistical and
   social science principles of inference. DeFord et al. (2021, Political
   Analysis, this issue) instead focuses solely on descriptive measures,
   which lead to the problems identified in our article. In this article,
   we illustrate the essential role of these basic principles and then
   offer statistical, mathematical, and substantive corrections required to
   apply DeFord et al.'s calculations to social science questions of
   interest, while also showing how to easily resolve all claimed paradoxes
   and problems. We are grateful to the authors for their interest in our
   work and for this opportunity to clarify these principles and our

Title = {Evaluating Pre-election Polling Estimates Using a New Measure of
   Non-ignorable Selection Bias},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {575-601},
Month = {SEP 4},
Abstract = {Among the numerous explanations that have been offered for recent errors
   in pre-election polls, selection bias due to non-ignorable partisan
   nonresponse bias, where the probability of responding to a poll is a
   function of the candidate preference that a poll is attempting to
   measure (even after conditioning on other relevant covariates used for
   weighting adjustments), has received relatively less focus in the
   academic literature. Under this type of selection mechanism, estimates
   of candidate preferences based on individual or aggregated polls may be
   subject to significant bias, even after standard weighting adjustments.
   Until recently, methods for measuring and adjusting for this type of
   non-ignorable selection bias have been unavailable. Fortunately, recent
   developments in the methodological literature have provided political
   researchers with easy-to-use measures of non-ignorable selection bias.
   In this study, we apply a new measure that has been developed
   specifically for estimated proportions to this challenging problem. We
   analyze data from 18 different pre-election polls: 9 different telephone
   polls conducted in 8 different states prior to the US presidential
   election in 2020, and nine different pre-election polls conducted either
   online or via telephone in Great Britain prior to the 2015 general
   election. We rigorously evaluate the ability of this new measure to
   detect and adjust for selection bias in estimates of the proportion of
   likely voters that will vote for a specific candidate, using official
   outcomes from each election as benchmarks and alternative data sources
   for estimating key characteristics of the likely voter populations in
   each context.},

Abstract = {This article examines how Brazilian nationalist elites perceived Jews,
   Judaism and Zionism during the military dictatorship period (1964-1985).
   Although an explicit antisemitic discourse was socially unacceptable in
   Brazil, many nationalist officials and intellectuals who discussed
   Jewish and Zionist Brazilians among themselves during those years were
   using a discourse of Jewish disloyalty. This discourse depicted Jews who
   adopted a diasporic stance (maintaining certain ethnic and national
   boundaries and supporting the State of Israel) as not loyal enough to
   Brazil. Tracing the history of this discourse, the article shows that it
   was inspired and informed by particular Brazilian notions of race,
   ethnicity and diaspora, and especially the national narrative of racial
   democracy. As such, it was a uniquely Brazilian discourse, even as it
   shared several common characteristics with how Jews were perceived and
   discussed in other countries. This is illustrated by comparing the
   Brazilian and Argentine nationalist discourses of Jewish disloyalty.},

Abstract = {Secularisation theory contends that religiosity and trust in religious
   organisations tend to decline when trust in their secular counterparts
   increases. However, it is puzzling why religious organisations receive
   public trust as high as their secular counterparts in countries where
   religiosity is low. If religious organisations are deemed to be doomed
   as trust in secular counterparts rises, why do people still trust them?
   We argue that a high level of trust in religious organisations is
   associated with their importance in nation-building and national
   identity construction: Individuals with a strong national identity are
   more likely to trust religious organisations. Using both qualitative and
   quantitative data about public trust in the Armenian Apostolic Church
   (AAC) and Georgian Orthodox Church (GOC), this study finds that the
   historical role of religious organisations in strengthening national
   cohesion and building national identity during times of instability
   leads ordinary citizens to place both generational and strategic trust
   in these religious organisations.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether rising polarization in Americans' partisan
   judgments has positive implications for political participation. Drawing
   on cross-sectional and panel survey data, we find evidence that
   polarized judgments are related to pre-election intent to vote, as well
   as to post-election self-reported voter turnout. Polarized evaluations
   also predict greater reporting of participation in campaign activities
   beyond voting. Polarization in candidate evaluations consistently has
   more of an impact than affective polarization. However, our results
   suggest that polarization in evaluations of both parties and candidates
   includes an expressive component that does not necessarily translate
   into political action. Roughly one-quarter to one-third of the actual
   change in turnout can potentially be attributed to polarization in
   evaluations of Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.},

Abstract = {The diversification of actors in global climate governance may entail
   risks, but it is also linked to enhanced democratic performance and
   opportunities for innovation. To what extent has this diversification
   fostered a parallel multiplication of perspectives in urban climate
   policy? To answer this question, we analyze the evolution of urban
   narratives based on 463 international policy documents issued between
   1946 and 2020. Our analysis shows that, instead of leading to
   diversification, the proliferation of actors is accompanied by a growing
   homogenization of urban narratives. Language appears to become
   progressively uniform across organizations and over time, with
   approaches emphasizing multi-actor governance, integrated planning, and
   co-benefits becoming dominant. Three factors explain this
   homogenization. First, actors with a long history of involvement in
   international development exert a significant amount of influence.
   Second, there is a tendency toward language harmonization in
   international policy. Third, urban climate narratives stabilize through
   association with broader policy paradigms. In conclusion, the
   diversification of actors in international climate policy is mediated by
   processes of narrative alignment, which foreclose possibilities for
   divergent thinking.},

Abstract = {Legislative allies are widely recognized as key to social movement
   success, but the emergence of their alliance with activists remains
   understudied. This article proposes a strategic approach to this
   phenomenon based on the cases of the environmental, labor, and LGBT+
   movements in Chile and their allied legislators. According to this
   approach, an alliance emerges due to two necessary conditions. Movement
   organizations must display tactical capacity, which signals their
   adaptability and competence to participate in Congress. And a socially
   skilled leadership creates the trust required for movement leaders and
   legislators to cooperate during the lawmaking process. This approach
   emphasizes that alliances emerge from activists' strategic efforts to
   build a social tie, whose effectiveness is mediated by legislators'
   expectations and congressional norms. By specifying the strategic
   dimension of an alliance, this study highlights the capacity of
   activists to foster cooperative relations with state actors.},

Abstract = {This article explores the impact of community policing on democratic
   policing in conflict-affected areas of limited statehood with divisive
   politics by way of a case study of Lebanon from 2008 to 2016. It argues
   that community policing leads to unequal empowerment and that it
   reflects and reproduces the existing politics of the context in which it
   is applied rather than promoting democratic changes, as the proponents
   of community policing usually claim. Specifically, the analysis of two
   cases of community policing in Lebanon shows that it reflects policing
   aimed against perceived threats to the country's consociational
   power-sharing arrangement and the sectarian balance on which it is
   based, namely Palestinian and Syrian refugees as outsiders who do not
   fit into consociational categories. The community policing projects in
   the Palestinian Nahr al-Bared camp and the urban Ras Beirut area of
   Beirut represent different contexts within Lebanon and so also show
   variation in the state's intent behind, and approach to, community
   policing. Still, the similarity in outcome in both cases, policing of
   `outsiders' as threats to the consociational order, suggests that
   community policing exhibits flaws independently of where, how, and why
   it is being applied.},

Abstract = {Large-scale microdata on group identity are critical for studies on
   identity politics and violence but remain largely unavailable for
   developing countries. We use personal names to infer religion in South
   Asia-where religion is a salient social division, and yet, disaggregated
   data on it are scarce. Existing work predicts religion using a
   dictionary-based method and, therefore, cannot classify unseen names. We
   provide character-based machine-learning models that can classify unseen
   names too with high accuracy. Our models are also much faster and,
   hence, scalable to large datasets. We explain the classification
   decisions of one of our models using the layer-wise relevance
   propagation technique. The character patterns learned by the classifier
   are rooted in the linguistic origins of names. We apply these to infer
   the religion of electoral candidates using historical data on Indian
   elections and observe a trend of declining Muslim representation. Our
   approach can be used to detect identity groups across the world for whom
   the underlying names might have different linguistic roots.},

Abstract = {Who is more influential in shaping citizens' health-related behaviors,
   experts or politicians? We conduct five conjoint experiments on 6,255
   residents of France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United
   States, asking them to evaluate COVID-19 vaccines alongside randomly
   varying endorsements from national politicians and medical
   professionals. In every country, our results show that citizens are more
   likely to rely on medical professionals, the experts, more than on
   politicians when choosing a COVID-19 vaccine. Even after accounting for
   citizens' political alignment with the government, our evidence reveals
   that politicians play a very limited role in shaping vaccine acceptance.
   These results have implications for the role of political elites in
   shaping people's behaviors amid a large-scale crisis.},

Abstract = {After its first funding period from 1991 to 1994, LEADER was positively
   evaluated as a successful strategy to empower actors at the regional
   level, enable regional development and contribute to territorial
   cohesion within the European Union. Critical studies, however, have
   highlighted elitist tendencies in LEADER processes and asked whether the
   proclaimed goal of strengthening `the local' contributes to new or other
   forms of social and spatial injustice. Our research focus lies in how
   representation, distribution, and recognition-as the three interrelated
   dimensions of justice according to Nancy Fraser-are featured in the
   discourse related to redesigning a local development strategy (LDS).
   During this process, which is conceived as the most open and inclusive
   phase in each LEADER funding period, we conducted expert interviews and
   participatory observations in a case study region and gathered media
   reports, documents, and official regulations. In our analysis of issues
   of representation, distribution, and recognition, we also focus on the
   spatial scales that are referred to and the ways in which the involved
   actors challenge and justify the status quo. Our analysis explicates the
   actors' implicit normative understandings as well as their different
   perspectives and positions considering perceived injustice. Even though
   the LDS process provides opportunities to negotiate these positions and
   to work towards more just representation, distribution, and recognition,
   they are partly constrained by structural and individual dependencies.},

Abstract = {The Kalmyks have lived in southwest Russia for about four centuries.
   Whilst cul- tural assimilation with neighbouring peoples has been an
   ongoing process since the Kalmyks first settled in the lower Volga from
   1630, the twentieth century, which saw the rise and fall of several
   political regimes in Russia, was the most dramatic period in the group's
   history in that it had a deep impact not only on their social structure,
   reli-gion, and way of life but also on their identity. Subjected to
   various political ideologies, not to mention punitive mass deportation
   to Siberia and Central Asia from 1943 to 1956, the Kalmyks had to
   constantly negotiate their identity not only with the Tsarist/Soviet/
   Russian state but also among themselves. Whilst today's self-narratives
   of Kalmyk eth-nic identity are inextricably linked to the discourse of
   post-Soviet cultural revival, in order to explain the fluidity and
   dynamics of Kalmyk identity this paper takes a com- prehensive approach
   to the history of the Kalmyk people since their first settlement on the
   lower Volga. Ethnic identity and its development are narrated
   chronologically, taking into account social structure, religion,
   historiography, and popular concepts to which the Kalmyks have been
   subjected, and which they have embraced, in the course of their history.},

Abstract = {Separation or ``perfect prediction{''} is a common problem in discrete
   choice models that, in practice, leads to inflated point estimates and
   standard errors. Standard statistical packages do not provide clear
   advice on how to correct these problems. Furthermore, separation can go
   completely undiagnosed in fitting advanced models that optimize a
   user-supplied log-likelihood rather than relying on pre-programmed
   estimation procedures. In this paper, we both describe the problems that
   separation can cause and address the issue of detecting it in empirical
   models of strategic interaction. We then consider several solutions
   based on penalized maximum likelihood estimation. Using Monte Carlo
   experiments and a replication study, we demonstrate that when separation
   is detected in the data, the penalized methods we consider are superior
   to ordinary maximum likelihood estimators.},

Abstract = {In an era of unprecedented numbers of migrants from the global south to
   the global north, nationalism has become synonymous with liberal states'
   ethnocentric, xenophobic, and racist immigration policies. The Trump
   administration's treatment of Central American refugees has been taken
   as a prime example. By focusing on liberal cultural nationalism, this
   paper demonstrates that these prevailing perceptions about nationalism
   are unfounded. Although liberal cultural nationalism has been accused of
   endorsing restrictive immigration policies, the degree to which liberal
   cultural nationalism's immigration policies are restrictive is context
   dependent; under certain circumstances, liberal nationalism may call for
   relaxing immigration policies to admit certain types of immigrants by
   invoking the idea of national responsibility. Consequently, liberal
   cultural nationalism offers one of the strongest liberal arguments for
   admitting certain kinds of migrants from the global south. The Central
   American refugee crisis at the U.S. southern border is analysed as a
   case study to illustrate this.},
