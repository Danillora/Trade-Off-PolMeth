   `open strategic autonomy' in action},

Abstract = {(Open) strategic autonomy (OSA) has quickly become the dominant concept
   in European Union (EU) trade policy strategy. This article aims to
   better understand how the concept plays out in policy practice by
   focusing on its discursive use in the rise and fall of the EU-China
   Comprehensive Investment Agreement (CAI). We start from the assumption
   that OSA as an `empty signifier' is sufficiently malleable to account
   for diverging interpretations. Building on existing literature, we then
   construct an analytical framework that distinguishes between trade
   policy paradigms. Subsequently, we utilize Fairclough \& Fairclough's
   `scheme of practical argument' to analyze how the three signifiers of
   OSA - openness, sustainability and assertiveness - are connected in EU
   trade policy debates for or against CAI between May 2020 and September
   2021. Our findings reveal that the concept of OSA can be utilized in
   both economics and foreign policy oriented arguments. While the Trade
   instead of Foreign Policy' (TiFP) paradigm was initially co-opted by the
   neoliberal paradigm, the Trade steered by Foreign Policy (TsFP) paradigm
   became gradually more dominant. These findings also contribute to
   explaining, respectively, the rise and fall of the CAI.},

Abstract = {In authoritarian systems, ethnic power-sharing arrangements include
   important ethnic groups in government and decision-making while putting
   restraints on political competition. However, under conditions of
   democratization, we might expect power-sharing arrangements to fragment
   as political parties seize opportunities to expand their base and appeal
   across ethnic lines. This article draws from the case of Malaysia, where
   multiethnic coalitions built around ethnic parties ruled for 61 years
   but where increasing electoral competitiveness has destabilized
   coalition politics. I focus on the Democratic Action Party (DAP), one of
   the country's most successful parties, which has sought to build a more
   multiethnic support base. I show that its attempts have been stymied by
   enduring norms of ethnically informed coalition building and efforts to
   protect existing ethnic bases by both rivals and allies. The findings
   shed light on the barriers to ethnic party adaptation and on why
   power-sharing practices remain so enduring, even in more fluid and
   democratic political environments.},

Title = {The Unexpected Defeat of an Electoral Champion: The Pheu Thai Party in
   Thailand's 2023 General Elections},

Abstract = {The results of Thailand's 2023 general elections came as a shock. The
   Pheu Thai Party (PTP), which had won the five previous ballots, came
   second to a relative newcomer, the Move Forward Party (MFP). As soon as
   the polls closed, local and international media was saturated with
   articles that tried to make sense of the defeat,1 while condemnations of
   the party's campaign were penned by highprofile PTP members or
   associates, such as Noppadon Pattama,2 a former foreign minister, and
   Thaksin Shinawatra,3 a former prime minister and the founder of the
   movement from which the PTP hails. Yet, there has been little academic
   or systematic analysis of what caused the PTP's failure to deliver on
   its promise of a landslide victory. This article seeks to address this
   gap by providing structural reasons behind its loss, focusing on the way
   the junta -drafted 2017 Constitution imposed an inorganic structure on
   the PTP and how this impacted the party's electoral campaign in 2023.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The creation of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform
   under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
   set out to incorporate Indigenous and local knowledge into the
   science-policy landscape of the climate field. The Platform is a crucial
   case of institutional change, as it signals an incipient shift from a
   science-centric toward a pluralistic approach to knowledge in global
   climate governance. This article traces this process of change in the
   politics and practices underlying the establishment and design of the
   Platform as an interface for Indigenous and local knowledge holders. The
   analysis shows that the sui generis design of the Platform was the
   product of bricolage (recombination) and translation
   (recontextualization) of disparate elements with the purpose of
   accommodating various political demands in an altogether new kind of
   knowledge-policy interface: a diverse boundary organization. The article
   makes an empirical contribution to the historical development of
   knowledge politics in the UNFCCC and a theoretical contribution to the
   study of boundary organizations by advancing a broader conceptualization
   that transcends science-centric approaches.},

Abstract = {Ukrainians' resilience in the face of Russia's 2022 invasion can be
   explained by cumulative identity change through successive revolutions:
   the Orange Revolution in 2004, the Maidan Revolution or Revolution of
   Dignity in 2013-2014 and the current as yet unnamed war. The two phases
   of the war, from 2014 and 2022, have accelerated both the civic and the
   social construction of Ukrainian identity. Post-post-Soviet Ukraine is
   now a consolidated civic and political nation. But there is also an
   increased consensus on traditional nationalist mythology, defined by
   opposition to Russia's aggressive reimperialisation and autocratic
   political culture and by Ukraine's hyper-Europeanisation.},

Title = {How 21st Century Population Issues and Policies Differ from Those of the
   20th Century},
Journal = {WORLD},

Volume = {4},

Abstract = {Population issues and population policies have evolved considerably
   between the 20th and the 21st centuries. In the 1970s, most countries
   confronted rapid population growth, and this situation was particularly
   severe in Asia. Today, on the contrary, more than half of the world
   population is experiencing low fertility and population aging, and
   several countries with very low fertility are facing the prospect of
   depopulation. Only one region, i.e., sub-Saharan Africa, still
   experiences high fertility levels. Similarly, the discussions about
   whether and how to intervene on population trends have also evolved over
   the past 70 years. Demographically focused approaches to family planning
   provision were dominant views in the second half of the 20th century.
   However, since the International Conference on Population and
   Development (ICPD) in Cairo in 1994, international population policy
   paradigms have been reframed to stress the freedom of couples and the
   reproductive rights of individuals. Consequently, policy interventions
   have favored client-focused and gender-sensitive approaches. Finally, to
   help chart the way forward, population policies will need to consider
   several key elements, broadening from a focus on support for family
   planning to an array of policy instruments including health, education,
   and culture, all of which shape future populations. This new policy
   framework includes the prioritization of interventions, policy consensus
   building, the selection of priority constituencies, the
   institutionalization and funding of policies, and the promotion of
   evidence-based and research-driven policies. In addition, in order to
   adapt their interventions to local contexts, population policies will
   need to be holistic, to promote integrated interventions, and to align
   with international development frameworks.},

Abstract = {Studies of elections held by autocrats often assume that institutions
   are strengthened in order to increase the leverage of the dictator. Yet,
   it can also be the case that institutions are purposely weakened when
   autocrats allow for elections. This is what happened in the 2019 Thai
   elections. These elections were notable not for advancing ``national
   reform{''} or democratisation, but for the deinstitutionalisation of the
   party system. Through three mechanisms - constitutional engineering,
   electoral manipulation, and legal rulings - Thailand's royalist elites
   were able to deinstitutionalise the opposition and undermine a fair,
   democratic process. This paper outlines these mechanisms of
   deinstitutionalisation that distorted the outcome of the 2019 elections.},

Abstract = {This article examines the mobilisation of minority groups along ethnic
   and national lines through social media, an area that has not been fully
   explored. The study analyses the case of Russian-speaking minority
   members who were mobilised in support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine
   in 2022 via the messaging app Telegram. By taking a bottom-up
   perspective, the article reconstructs the pathways of the actors in
   these mobilisation processes and draws upon diverse literature in
   digital nationalism, social movements and media studies. The study
   suggests that social media facilitates minority mobilisation through
   three primary functions: It allows for the reproduction of ethnicised
   and racialised boundaries and homogenisation within ethnicised echo
   chambers and provides a `window of opportunity' for micro, meso and
   macro levels of actor engagement in facilitating offline mobilisation.
   Overall, this article provides a theoretical foundation for
   understanding how social media enables and enhances minority
   mobilisation and introduces novel empirical data on the emerging pro-war
   movement prevalent on Telegram and in offline networks of the
   Russian-speaking minority in Germany. The study contributes to the
   developing field of user-generated nationalism and highlights the need
   for more bottom-up research on emerging patterns of online ethnicised
   mobilisation.},

Title = {Whose (in)security? Gender, race and coloniality in European security
   policies: Introduction to the Special Issue},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {335-346},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Building on feminist and postcolonial theoretical approaches across
   International Relations (IR) and security studies, this Special Issue
   advances an emerging research agenda within EU studies by shedding light
   on the gendered and racialised logics of EU security and their links to
   colonial histories and practices. Together, the contributions to this
   Special Issue demonstrate how EU security is intrinsically connected to
   and constituted by histories of colonialism, racism and patriarchy. At
   the same time, they also highlight how the colonial, racialised and
   gendered dynamics that underpin EU security and that are mobilised by
   the EU, its institutions and member states are always complex and
   shifting. Importantly, they do so by decentring our analysis of EU
   security moving our focus often away from the EU and towards different,
   somewhat unexpected sites and geographical locations of EU security. The
   current war in Ukraine underwrites the need for more historical,
   contextual and decentred work on EU security, while also highlighting
   the necessity to reflect on dominant practices of knowledge production
   and the experiences of people living in and with war through a feminist
   and postcolonial lens.},

Abstract = {Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine represents a critical juncture
   for the role gender plays in European security. We argue that the
   Russian invasion of Ukraine is not only gendered in the way other
   conflict are, but the war's essential novelty lies in the fact that it
   is explicitly fought for the so-called traditional values, against
   gender and sexual equalities. Drawing on local decolonial insights and
   theoretical concepts of liberal/illiberal gender orders, we contrast the
   Russian neo-traditionalism with the Ukrainian account of the Russian
   invasion, while seeking to uncover how an imagination of Europe is
   constitutive for these gendered discourses. We show that the
   construction of the narratives is a circular process of ever more
   pronounced neo-traditionalism by Russia which sees Europe as its
   decadent Other. We demonstrate that these discourses have real
   consequences as the Russian illiberal gender order justifies and wages
   real war against Ukraine and gender is turning into the central
   battlefield both in the figurative and the literal sense of the word.
   Russian accounts contrast with Ukraine's hybridised, but increasingly
   emancipatory discourses and practices which have been playing a
   fundamental role in Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion.},

Abstract = {In environmental politics, social movements play a crucial role,
   promoting participatory rights and confronting injustice, inequality,
   and the interests of the powerful. This article examines an
   underexplored topic in the literature on social movements, especially in
   Latin America: the use of litigation to force decisionmakers to comply
   with participatory formats, specifically in the course of opposition to
   hydroelectric dams. These projects often are destructive to the local
   environment and communities. This study examines four cases of
   environmental litigation that halted dam construction in Brazil and
   Chile, singling out causal pathways for successful collective action. It
   focuses on two dimensions of movement success: the implementation of
   participatory formats and the resulting cancellation of dam projects. In
   line with the joint effect model of social movement theory, the
   cross-case comparison of legal disputes shows that pursuing legal
   strategies in parallel to broad social mobilization and the support of
   institutional allies, can lead to successful outcomes.},

Title = {Educational policy agenda, ideological transformation and radical right

Abstract = {The study of the relationship between parties and education policies has
   so far largely disregarded populist parties. Despite the success of this
   party family, little attention has been paid to their proposals in terms
   of education and interpretation of the role of schools and higher
   education in society. The central research question of the paper
   concerns the development of the educational agenda of the Northern
   League party in Italy, from 1994 to 2018. If the general framework
   suggests that political parties are losing power and influence in
   education matters, Italy can be considered an interesting deviant case.
   Education policy is politically divisive, with multiple stakeholders,
   different ideological preferences and vested interests. It should
   therefore come as no surprise that a party, as deeply rooted in the
   Italian party and political system as the Northern League, has invested
   in positioning itself in education policies both in terms of identity
   and argumentative strategies associated with the use of political
   symbols. Against this background, the purpose of the paper is to study
   how the Northern League's education agenda is shaped by symbolic frames
   and rhetorical narratives that illustrate and reflect the ideological
   tenets and evolution of the party over the last decades.},

Abstract = {The use of covert human intelligence sources for the protection of
   national security is an important but under-researched area. In light of
   increased globalisation, and technological developments, examining
   covert intelligence gathering online may have operational relevance.
   This study examined the use of similarities in self-disclosure to
   develop rapport with mock covert human intelligence sources online. A
   sample of 66 participants were asked to assume the role of a CHIS,
   listen to an audio recording of a meeting of the criminal network they
   are part of, and strike a balance between being forthcoming to their
   handler while at the same time not revealing all information they
   possessed. They were then interviewed online by a mock handler who
   opened the conversation in one of three ways: self-disclosing
   information that highlighted similarities between herself and the CHIS,
   self-disclosing information that highlighted dissimilarities, or control
   (no disclosure). Participants completed a follow-up rapport
   questionnaire based on their interaction with the handler. The study
   found that mock sources rated rapport higher in the similarities
   condition in comparison with other conditions; however, it did not
   translate into a significant difference in the intelligence reported.
   The findings of this research and its policy and practice implications
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {In the November 2016 U.S. presidential election, many state-level public
   opinion polls, particularly in the Upper Midwest, incorrectly predicted
   the winning candidate. One leading explanation for this polling miss is
   that the precipitous decline in traditional polling response rates led
   to greater reliance on statistical methods to adjust for the
   corresponding bias-and that these methods failed to adjust for important
   interactions between key variables like educational attainment, race,
   and geographic region. Finding calibration weights that account for
   important interactions remains challenging with traditional survey
   methods: raking typically balances the margins alone, while
   post-stratification, which exactly balances all interactions, is only
   feasible for a small number of variables. In this paper, we propose
   multilevel calibration weighting, which enforces tight balance
   constraints for marginal balance and looser constraints for higher-order
   interactions. This incorporates some of the benefits of
   post-stratification while retaining the guarantees of raking. We then
   correct for the bias due to the relaxed constraints via a flexible
   outcome model; we call this approach ``double regression with
   post-stratification.{''} We use these tools to re-assess a large-scale
   survey of voter intention in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,
   finding meaningful gains from the proposed methods. The approach is
   available in the multical R package.},

Abstract = {A substantial literature has developed around the individual
   determinants of radical political preferences. Widely used to study
   electoral support for far-right parties, this perspective has rarely
   been mobilised to understand the dynamics of radicalisation, or the
   process of going back to the `roots', among fractions of Western Muslim
   youth involved in political Islam. To address this, 37 semi-structured
   interviews were conducted between 2020 and 2021 as part of ongoing ERC
   Advanced Grant research with young (aged 18-30) self-identifying Muslims
   of Turkish and Moroccan descent based in the Paris or Lyon areas. Also
   drawing on the social movements literature, we uncovered two sets of
   factors influencing radicalisation, each based on two distinct
   oppositional sets of attitudes: (1) a feeling of estrangement from
   mainstream societal values, such as morality, secularism, and a
   perceived assimilationist trend emanating from the French national
   frame, and (2) a sense of dissatisfaction towards the
   political-institutional system, which appeared as latent criticisms of
   the current state of representative democracy, distrust of political and
   media actors, and discontent towards the current French party system.},

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, the European Union has presented itself on
   the world stage as a norm entrepreneur and global maritime power.
   However, this claim to power is belied by its recent experience of a
   surge in crises - both of domestic and international origin.
   Nonetheless, the EU's 2021 update to its Arctic Policy noted that, due
   to the Union's strategic Arctic interests, full engagement in Arctic
   matters is a geopolitical necessity for the EU. Given the augmented
   attention on the Arctic region for climate, economic and, increasingly,
   for security reasons, this is not surprising. However, it does beg the
   question of how the EU intends to involve itself more thoroughly in
   Arctic affairs. This article seeks to explore the extent to which the
   Union's foundational narrative of `never again' regarding conflict and
   war can explain EU actions in the Arctic, the EU as a peaceful maritime
   power and its broader approach to ocean governance, particularly in the
   Circumpolar North.},

Title = {Stochastic Evaluation of the Investment Risk by the Scale of Water
   Infrastructures-Case Study: The Municipality of West Mani (Greece)},
Journal = {WORLD},

Abstract = {Social structure is based on the availability of the Water-Energy-Food
   Nexus. To cover these needs of society, several solutions of different
   scales of infrastructures coexist. The construction of infrastructure is
   capital-intensive; therefore, investment risk is always a consideration.
   In this paper, we try to evaluate the investment risk by interest rates
   (IR). We show that IR is a key indicator, which includes multiple
   parameters of prosperity expressing the political and economic status
   quo of the society. The selection of a particular scale influences the
   required capital and is thus one of the most critical decisions. Water
   supply infrastructure is one of the foundations of society, and the
   selection of the optimal scale of such infrastructure is often a great
   challenge in civil engineering. As a case study, we analyse three
   different scales of water supply infrastructures for the area of West
   Mani (Greece), i.e., dam, water ponds, and seawater desalination. We
   evaluate each case by the capital intensity by performing stochastic
   simulations of interest rates and identify the optimal solution as the
   one with the smallest median unit cost, in this case, the water ponds.
   In order to assess the impact of the development level of a country on
   the resulting unit cost stochastic properties we apply the optimal
   solution to various countries with different development levels and IR.
   We show that IR in the least developed countries, being generally higher
   and more variable, increases the unit cost, including its variability,
   which ultimately indicates higher investment risk.},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Scholars, pundits, and politicians use opinion surveys to study citizen
   beliefs about political facts, such as the current unemployment rate,
   and more conspiratorial beliefs, such as whether Barack Obama was born
   abroad. Many studies, however, ignore acquiescence-response bias, the
   tendency for survey respondents to endorse any assertion made in a
   survey question regardless of content. With new surveys fielding
   questions asked in recent scholarship, we show that acquiescence bias
   inflates estimated incidence of conspiratorial beliefs and political
   misperceptions in the United States and China by up to 50\%.
   Acquiescence bias is disproportionately prevalent among more ideological
   respondents, inflating correlations between political ideology such as
   conservatism and endorsement of conspiracies or misperception of facts.
   We propose and demonstrate two methods to correct for acquiescence bias.},

Abstract = {This paper takes as its starting point the contention that media
   representations of crime and policing, and undercover policing in
   particular, matter. Through a multimodal critical discourse analysis
   this paper explores the representations of undercover policing and
   intelligence operations in the animated series Star Wars: The Clone
   Wars. The paper contends that despite its status as science fiction The
   Clone Wars engages with several of the real-life practices and
   challenges of undercover policing and intelligence operations. The
   overall analysis indicates that The Clone Wars projects an important
   critique of the morally problematic nature of the militarisation of
   policing and the routinisation of deceptive undercover policing
   practices. The paper concludes with a reflection on the consequences of
   this depiction, arguing that for those practitioners who are willing to
   engage with representations of their craft in popular culture there are
   valuable practical lessons to be learned from such fictional accounts.},

Abstract = {Drawing on lessons learned from recently completed formative evaluations
   of police co-led CVE programming in Toronto, Ontario and Calgary,
   Alberta, this research aims to underscore the importance of, and provide
   technical guidance on, evaluation and reporting standards in the context
   of multi-agency CVE programming - which ultimately will help to
   facilitate the identification and replication of good practice. The
   results of the evaluative process highlight the need for greater
   articulation regarding intended program outcomes as well as program
   theorising regarding the underlying mechanisms that connect program
   activities and outputs with said intended outcomes. Both evaluations
   also demonstrated the importance of prioritising collaboration at both
   the evaluation-level and the program-level to facilitate successful and
   robust program implementation. As such, this study also yields findings
   that speak to the beneficial role that the evaluative process itself can
   play in facilitating the evolution of CVE programming.},

Abstract = {This chapter on the evolution of international, inter-regional, and
   regional documents on GBVAW reveals the different ways in which the
   phenomenon has been addressed by the various organizations: from a
   purely private issue to a problem that undermines equality between men
   and women up to the gender mainstreaming approach. The latter considers
   the gender variable within policies and does not consider women merely
   as vulnerable subjects and victims but also as subjects with an agency.
   Regarding the relations among states, the evolving approach among the
   various bodies moves from the consideration of GBVAW as a problem to be
   dealt with at the national level, especially in the UN documents of the
   first years, to a greater emphasis, clear at a CoE level, and recently
   resumed - especially with the Daphne programs by the European Union -
   towards the sharing of best policy practices and an interconnected
   effort among MSs.},

Abstract = {The evolution of the UN and CoE documents has influenced the decisions
   and the legislative developments of the EU on GBVAW. For example, it was
   only in the 1990s, with the global awareness of the international
   community, that the EU started to play ``a more active role{''} in
   preventing and fighting GBVAW (Montoya, 2013, p.6). The role of explicit
   legislation is key to refining the legal systems' response to GBVAW
   since there is no space left for interpretation that may tolerate
   violence. (Montoya, 2013, p. 7). For this reason, this chapter focuses
   on Spain and Italy, considered separately at a national level and,
   later, in a comparative perspective by also pointing to the influence
   that those international, inter-regional, and regional documents have
   had on the individual countries.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, Brazilian voters have grown polarized between
   supporters of the Partido dos Trabalhadores (Workers' Party, PT), known
   as petistas, and its opponents, known as antipetistas. What explains
   this animosity? One potential source of polarization is partisan
   stereotyping, a tendency for partisans to misperceive the social
   composition of both their own side's bases of support as well as their
   opponents'. We show that most Brazilians overestimate the extent to
   which petistas and antipetistas belong to party-stereotypical groups
   such as Afro-Brazilians, evangelical Christians, or poor or rich people.
   We then show that stereotyping is associated with polarization: the
   greater the bias in perceived partisan group composition, the greater
   the perceptions of partisan political extremism and feelings of social
   distance toward the partisan out-group.},

Abstract = {Scholarship on autocratisation has investigated the strategies of
   cooptation and repression that autocratic and autocratising regimes
   employ to maintain and enhance their power. However, it has barely
   explored how civil society reacts to these strategies. Concurrently, the
   existing research on civil society and social movements mostly suggests
   that civil society organisations (CSOs) will either resist autocratic
   repression or disband because of it, thereby often neglecting the
   possibility of CSOs' adaptation to autocratic constraints. In this
   article, I seek to bridge these theoretical gaps with empirical evidence
   from Cambodia. I argue that for CSOs that operate in autocratic and
   autocratising regimes allowing themselves to become coopted by the
   regime can constitute a deliberate strategy to avoid repression, secure
   their survival, and exert social and political influence. However, while
   this strategy often seems to be effective in allowing CSOs to survive
   and escape large-scale repression, its success in enabling civil society
   to exert social and political influence remains limited, owing to
   structural limitations embedded in the autocratic context. Moreover,
   CSOs' acceptance of cooptation often enhances divisions within civil
   society.},

Abstract = {This paper complements the limited scholarly interest in the case of the
   Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)'s consistent practice of
   word-deed gaps, or ``hypocrisy{''} according to some scholars, by
   employing the insights of organisational sociology. Specifically, it
   introduces a claim that the gap between ASEAN's words and deeds can be
   understood as an organisational response to its material and political
   vulnerability in relation to its major external stakeholders, aiming to
   ensure its survival and adaptability. Accommodating multiple, or
   sometimes even conflicting, demands from various external actors, ASEAN
   may be able to secure its material and diplomatic engagement in
   developmental and political regionalism within Southeast Asia. However,
   ASEAN also wants to protect its local identity and practices; or it may
   want to avoid forced internal reforms at an undesirable scale and pace.
   In this context, organised hypocrisy would likely become a vital
   consideration for the complex institution. For ASEAN, this paper notes,
   these word-deed gaps reflect the way it wants to manage conflicting
   external demands as an international social agency.},

Abstract = {This article argues that there are four conditions that create a
   conducive political climate allowing civil society and the media to hold
   the government accountable during the time of pandemic (2020-2021) i.e.,
   the diagonal accountability: 1) the undemocratic formation of the
   Muhyiddin Yassin's government that lacked public mandate, which in turn
   made the government unstable and prone to political pressures; 2) the
   relative freedom of print and online media in reporting negative news
   concerning the government; 3) civil society's ability to find creative
   ways around pandemic restrictions to protest; and 4) socio-economic
   fallout from strict pandemic measures built up public resentment against
   the government and contributed to its unpopularity. Analyzed through the
   lens of political process model, and augmented by interviews with
   protest participants, the four conditions enable civil society and media
   to take advantage of the unstable political situation, namely in carving
   up democratic spaces amidst various restrictions imposed by the
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses attitudes around the projection of the EU among
   Latin American elites, namely the determinants of support for a Free
   Trade Agreement between the two regions and the trustworthiness of the
   EU government. We take as data elite surveys conducted in 15 Latin
   American countries (2014-2019) and consider sociodemographics, ideology,
   support for democracy, views of foreign powers, exports to the EU, and
   electoral democracy. Results show that ideology and support for
   democracy are key determinants of support for an interregional FTA, and
   that the trustworthiness of governments in the US, China, and Spain
   covary with attitudes toward the EU. The latter (trust in the government
   in Spain) proves to be the main driver and, furthermore, its impact is
   conditional on the economic strength (observed as exports) of the EU:
   wherever the EU is not a strong economic actor in Latin America, trust
   in the Spanish government does nothing but improve the image of the EU.},

Title = {Do Statist Ideology and State-Sponsored Nationalism Intervene in
   Pakistan's China Policy? A Neoclassical Realist Perspective},
Journal = {ISSUES \& STUDIES},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {In its relations with China from 1972 to 2018, Pakistan has endeavored
   to extract and mobilize its domestic resources while conducting a
   foreign policy of balancing under systemic pressures and power
   disparities. Statist ideology and state-sponsored nationalism have been
   both useful and influential in this process. While there is abundant
   literature on ideology, nationalism, and Pakistan's foreign policy using
   theoretical foundations, a neoclassical realist approach has yet to be
   made. This paper seeks guidance from neoclassical realist theory as
   explored in the works of Taliaferro (2006) and Schweller (2004). We
   argue that Pakistan's ties with China have been facilitated domestically
   by an Islamic statist ideology and anti-Indian state-sponsored
   nationalism. These both have facilitated internal balancing through the
   extraction and mobilization of natural resources and emulation while
   externally they justified Pakistan's balancing efforts aimed at
   countering a perceived Indian threat. The nation's military and civil
   elites therefore agree on the necessity of closer ties with China.},

Abstract = {Agricultural supply chains of forest-risk commodities such as soy, palm
   oil, and cocoa have risen to the top of the global sustainability
   agenda. Demand-side actors, including consumer-goods companies,
   retailers, and civil society organizations have coalesced around a
   growing number of sustainable supply chain policies. However, despite
   rapid advances in tools and methods to convert data into useful
   information about impacts and policy effectiveness, and their
   implementation for decision-making is lagging. There is an urgent need
   to examine such demand-led action and understand how to accelerate
   progress towards agricultural supply chain sustainability. Here, we
   explore how demand-side actors within globalized supply chains see
   limitations in knowledge and barriers to progress in the context of
   forest-risk commodities. We draw from 20 semi-structured interviews and
   two focus group discussions with manufacturers, retailers, NGOs, and
   data providers. Our findings show that civil society pressure in
   consumer regions is perceived as a key driver guiding action, that
   certification is commonly sought to reduce detrimental impacts, but that
   collaboration to tackle systemic issues remains a gap. Companies also
   highlight the need for simple, timely, and meaningful metrics to assess
   impacts-practical usability concerns that need to be considered in the
   search for ever-greater accuracy in capturing complex phenomena.},

Abstract = {How and to what extent do the European Union's (EU) presence and
   projects in Georgia respond to principles and commitments relating to
   conflict and context sensi-tivity and local ownership? Drawing on local
   turns unfolding in both European studies and peace and conflict studies,
   the article focuses on EU support to Georgian inter-nally displaced
   persons (IDP s) and discusses how this is received and perceived by
   actors on the ground in the context of the EU's crisis response and the
   post-conflict setting in Georgia. The discussion is based on data from a
   questionnaire distributed to 40 respondents in three IDP settlements and
   by seven interviews with Brussels-and Georgia-based EU officials, as
   well as local and national authorities, non-governmental organization
   practitioners, and international organizations implementing EU projects
   in Georgia. Despite the existence of EU-sponsored measures of assistance
   targeting Georgian IDP s and the overall positive perception of the EU's
   role in large sectors of Georgia's society, the analysis reveals that
   the EU does not seem to be fully capable of interacting with local
   stakeholders and beneficiaries in an effective way. This limits the EU's
   ability to uphold the principles of local ownership and conflict
   sensitivity.},

Abstract = {We use a unique panel of household survey data-the Austrian version of
   the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for
   2008-2011-which have been linked to individual administrative records on
   both state unemployment benefits and earnings. We assess the extent and
   structure of misreporting across similar benefits and between benefits
   and earnings. We document that many respondents fail to report
   participation in one or more of the unemployment programs. Moreover,
   they inflate earnings for periods when they are unemployed but receiving
   unemployment compensation. To demonstrate the impact of income source
   confusion on estimators, we estimate standard Mincer wage equations.
   Since unemployment is associated with lower education, the reports of
   unemployment benefits as earnings bias downward the returns to
   education. Failure to report unemployment benefits also leads to
   substantial sample bias when selecting on these benefits, as one might
   in estimating the returns to job training.},

Title = {Gendering EU security strategies: a feminist postcolonial approach to

Abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between the EU's current
   re-imagining as a global security actor and its stance as a global
   promoter of progressive gender norms. For this purpose, we analyse how
   gender and race are constitutive of the meanings of security and Europe
   in major EU security strategies, and how this relates to the way gender
   (equality) is addressed as a policy issue. We find that, in the context
   of waning liberal world order and manifold internal and external crises,
   EU security actorness is constructed through narratives of
   masculinisation that entail feminisation of the EU's own past as a
   ``peace project{''} and ``soft power{''}; Othering of non-EU spaces and
   subjects; colonial perspectives on the EU's role in the world as ``White
   Man's burden{''} and the reconstruction of whiteness through notions of
   ``neutral{''} masculinities associated with technocratic
   professionalism, superior knowledge production, and market rationality.
   This intersectional gendering of EU security limits the emancipatory
   potential of gender policy through the racialisation of Other women and
   the simultaneous invisibilisation of postcolonial structures of
   inequality. Our analysis provides the groundwork for addressing how and
   why the EUropean security project continues to reproduce intersectional
   power relations and insecurities, despite commitments to gender equality
   and non-discrimination.},

Title = {Do Fiscal Transfers Affect Local Democracy? Lessons from Chilean

Abstract = {Extant literature concurs that fiscal transfers affect local democracy
   when they grant subnational governments nontax revenue. Yet there is
   nonetheless a mismatch between this concept and existing measures, which
   consider the whole transfers local governments receive, including both
   tax and nontax revenue. This article studies the Fondo Comun Municipal
   (FCM), the most important intergovernmental grant in Chile, and provides
   a novel measure of nontax revenue. It uses this measure alongside the
   whole FCM transfer to test the rentier hypothesis. On the one hand, it
   shows that both measures increase the incumbent party vote share,
   although the effect of our measure is smaller. On the other hand, it
   finds that the FCM transfer has an impact on the probability of
   reelection and the competitiveness of elections, but this effect
   disappears when using our measure. Overall, the findings suggest that
   rents from transfers do not lead to strong electoral dominance in
   unitary states.},

Abstract = {Engaging people with controversial and emotive issues that are
   inherently complex is challenging, especially when those issues are
   multifaceted or multidisciplinary, span environmental, economic, social,
   and political contexts, are global in scope, or where circumstances and
   implications differ spatially. Teaching such issues requires teachers
   and learners to navigate a challenging landscape of nuance and
   conflicting perspectives; immersive place-based learning might
   facilitate more meaningful exploration of such issues, but this has not
   previously been studied. In a multi-institution international study, we
   surveyed 164 participants (12 groups; 9 institutions) before and after
   an immersive fieldtrip in South Africa to assess perceptions on
   contentious issues. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed that participants
   had statistically significant opinion shifts for 17 of 18 statements,
   including those where change was likely due to improved knowledge or
   indicative of deeper attitude shifts. Generalised Linear Modelling
   revealed that propensity for opinion shifts was not influenced by
   demographics (age, gender), location (country of origin) or trip type
   (formal or informal). We conclude that in an increasingly complex world,
   context-relevant immersive experiences that facilitate deep learning by
   providing opportunities to explore contentious issues in situ are an
   ever-more valuable tool, not just for attainment but also for developing
   personal perspectives and as a catalyst for societal transitions.},

Title = {Energy Use Patterns of Pearl Millet (Pennisetumglaucum (L.)) Production
   in Haryana, India},

Abstract = {Pearl millet (Pennisetumglaucum (L.)) is the fifth most important cereal
   crop in the world after rice, wheat, maize and sorghum. A resolution
   adopted by the UN General Assembly on 3 March 2021 decided to declare
   2023 as the International Year of Millets. Millet has been promoted due
   to its nutritional value and low irrigation requirement. In this study,
   pearl millet was selected for energy auditing, and its production amount
   is a direct function of energy input. The production of pearl millet
   needs to be augmented to fulfill an increasing demand. Pearl millet is
   produced using various sources of energy. This study was conducted to
   examine the energy use pattern of different categories of farmers, such
   as small, medium and large, for pearl millet production in Hisar
   district, Haryana, India. The energy was distributed in different
   operations, including preparatory tillage, sowing, interculture,
   fertilizer, irrigation, pesticide, harvesting, threshing and
   transportation. The source-wise energy (direct and indirect) and
   operation-wise energy consumption were calculated for all categories of
   farmers. The average energy input of small, medium and large farmers was
   2849.09 MJ.ha(-1), 3027.21 MJ.ha(-1) and 4021.50 MJ.ha(-1),
   respectively. The highest energy was consumed in fertilizer application
   (52\%), with the lowest in seed (2\%). The energy ratios of small,
   medium and large farmers were 3.92, 9.40 and 13.80, respectively. This
   study could improve the agricultural production systems of pearl millet
   regarding the energy values of the inputs and outputs.},

Abstract = {Discussions surrounding a new labor law in Egypt, started after the 2011
   uprising. However, this law has not yet been promulgated until today.
   How can this delay be explained? The present article argues that the
   delay reflects the difficult position in which the post-2014 regime
   found itself and the difficult choices it had to make. Building on a
   systematic reading of Egyptian media from 2014 to 2020, this article
   reconstructs discussions about different versions of the draft law,
   identifying dilemmas the post-2014 regime faced: on one hand, it sought
   to opt for a more nuanced approach to flexibility and deregulation while
   also limiting the arbitrary power of employers over workers that had led
   to wildcat strikes under Mubarak. On the other hand, it sought to
   prevent international companies from stopping imports from Egyptian
   factories and suppliers due to their lack of compliance with
   international labor standards. In response, the regime coopted moderate
   segments of the independent unionist movement and adopted some
   labor-friendly measures that were rejected by employer representatives.
   This led to a postponement of a decision regarding the law.},

Abstract = {The debate around ``fake news{''} has raised the question of whether
   liberals and conservatives differ, first, in their ability to discern
   true from false information, and second, in their tendency to give more
   credit to information that is ideologically congruent. Typical designs
   to measure these asymmetries select, often arbitrarily, a small set of
   news items as experimental stimuli without clear reference to a
   ``population of information.{''} This pre-registered study takes an
   alternative approach by, first, conceptualizing estimands in relation to
   all political news. Second, to represent this target population, it uses
   a set of 80 randomly sampled items from a large collection of articles
   from Google News and three fact-checking sites. In a subsequent survey,
   a quota sample of US participants (n = 1,393) indicate whether they
   believe the news items to be true. Conservatives are less
   truth-discerning than liberals, but also less affected by the congruence
   of news.},

Abstract = {In many contexts in the Mediterranean, Security Assistance (SA) is
   perceived to have contributed to state fracture or prolonged conflict.
   In Tunisia, in contrast, SA has increased the performance and capacities
   of the security forces in matters of counterterrorism and migration
   control. However, in this article, by analysing SA's reordering impacts,
   I argue that it has interacted with political developments to
   reconfigure Tunisia's volatile political landscape in two ways. Firstly,
   SA programmes have acted to reinforce the coercive capacities of
   Tunisia's security forces vis-a-vis the general population. Secondly,
   vertical SA practices contributed to the reconfiguration of power
   dynamics between different actors in Tunisia's security sector, helping
   consolidate power in the increasingly authoritarian hands of the
   executive as well as the increasingly politicized security forces.
   Furthermore, in the final section of this article, I reflect upon the
   entanglements between security assistance, Tunisian political economy
   and the economic interests of many provider states. In doing so, I make
   the case for a `recoupling' of security studies and political economy in
   analysis of external interventions in the Mediterranean to better
   understand their reordering impacts.},

Abstract = {Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine has moved the latter and its
   foreign policy into the limelight. Since Ukraine's independence in 1991,
   the scholarly literature has focused overwhelmingly on its path towards
   European integration and its relationship with NATO and Russia
   respectively. Systematic accounts of Ukrainian foreign policy and
   Ukraine's relations with actors outside the post-Soviet, European and
   transatlantic context are, however, largely missing. This applies also
   to Ukraine's relations with countries in North Africa, notably Egypt,
   Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. Geographically and culturally
   distant, and in the absence of reverberating historical legacies,
   successive Ukrainian governments have neglected the region while
   passively observing how Russia, particularly in recent years, has
   widened its regional influence. This profile sheds light on Ukraine's
   relations with North Africa and offers an empirical contribution to the
   analysis of Ukraine's evolving foreign policy in light of Russian
   military aggression since 2014. It argues that Ukraine needs to develop
   a more complex foreign policy that goes beyond EU and NATO membership.
   To gain full ownership over bilateral developments, in times of conflict
   and crisis, Ukraine has to adapt to geopolitical realities and attend to
   a wider range of countries, such as the ones in North Africa.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between racism and the memory
   politics of the anti-communist underground in Poland. It explores a
   covert antisemitism behind the conservative nationalist hegemonic
   project of transforming the anti-communist underground into the
   ideologically charged symbol of the Cursed Soldiers. It demonstrates
   that under the conditions of the condemnation of antisemitism, the
   symbolism of the Cursed Soldiers has become a covert way of expressing
   anti-Jewish prejudice in hegemonic memory politics. The paper argues
   that this covert antisemitism must be seen in the broader context of
   historical racialised antisemitism and racialised structures of Polish
   national identity. The paper challenges the notion of Poland as a
   country free from racism, by unpacking the role of racialisation in the
   dominant understanding of Polishness. It demonstrates how the memory
   politics of the Cursed Soldiers fit into the racialised logic of the
   dominant ideology of Polish national identity.},

Abstract = {Survey research methodology is evolving rapidly, as new technologies
   provide new opportunities. One of the areas of innovation regards the
   development of online interview best practices and the advancement of
   methods that allow researchers to measure the attention that respondents
   are devoting to the survey task. Reliable measurement of respondent
   attention can yield important information about the quality of the
   survey response. In this article, we take advantage of an innovative
   survey we conducted in 2018, in which we directly connect survey
   responses to administrative data, allowing us to assess the association
   between survey attention and response quality. We show that attentive
   survey respondents are more likely to provide accurate survey responses
   regarding a number of behaviors and attributes that we can validate with
   our administrative data. We discuss the best strategy to deal with
   inattentive respondents in surveys in light of our results.},

Abstract = {By now, most political systems around the world hold regular multiparty
   elections of different quality and type. However, we know relatively
   little about the effect of elections on corruption, especially in
   high-discretion, public procurement contracts implementing development
   aid. To address this gap in the literature, we employ unmatched
   comparisons and matching estimators to analyze a global government
   contracting dataset that provides an objective proxy for corruption: the
   incidence of single bidding in competitive markets. We find that, all
   things being equal, corruption risks increase in the immediate
   pre-election period: single bidding is higher by 1.3-6.1\% points. We
   demonstrate that the corruption-enhancing effect of elections is
   stronger under conditions of (i) high electoral competitiveness, (ii)
   medium-level party institutionalization, and (iii) ``localized
   collective goods{''} clientelism.},

Abstract = {Climate performance in publicly traded companies has become an important
   focus for climate action. Non-state actor-led initiatives have emerged
   as influential governors in this arena, intended to plug gaps in public
   climate change regulation. This article addresses the key question, are
   such non-state led climate initiatives exerting a positive influence on
   corporate climate performance? To answer this question, we empirically
   evaluate the effects of eighteen such climate initiatives on corporate
   climate performance, distinguishing between ``internal{''} and
   ``external{''} initiatives. Based on an original data set of corporate
   climate initiatives that prioritize climate performance in the private
   sector, we find that each additional climate initiative has little to no
   impact on climate performance, modeled as scope 1 direct emissions, but
   does exert a positive influence on scope 2 indirect emissions. Our
   findings have implications for the trajectory of the private sector's
   climate transition, as well as the potential of corporate initiatives to
   steward effective climate action.},

Abstract = {Given the severity of climate change and environmental degradation, we
   might need to take the stance that our students can contribute to
   solutions for environmental problems. In this forum article, we propose
   a solutions-based pedagogy for global environmental politics in which we
   take students as experts and a potential source of innovation, akin to
   how students are treated at technical universities. We believe this
   approach to hold the promise of creating solutions as well as an
   empowered generation of future problem solvers. We think that
   international politics students are uniquely placed to find solutions to
   pressing environmental problems with their state-of-the-art knowledge on
   international politics in combination with idealism and an ability to
   think outside the box. We propose a course that harnesses this
   potential. This article provides a theoretical underpinning for a
   solutions-based pedagogy and places it within the wider pedagogical
   traditions in international relations, in particular critical
   pedagogies.},

Abstract = {In decentralized systems, citizens struggle to identify which level of
   government provides local goods. This problem is particularly salient in
   weakly institutionalized party environments, where politicians at
   different levels of government are less likely to benefit from partisan
   coattail effects. This article asks how citizens attribute credit for
   local public goods. I argue that citizens have a strong tendency to
   attribute credit to local politicians. As a result, citizens will
   respond differently to credit-claiming behavior by local and national
   politicians. Local politicians experience a ceiling effect, in which
   credit claiming has no effect on how citizens attribute credit. However,
   national politicians have no such ceiling and can claim credit to
   increase the likelihood that citizens will attribute credit to them. As
   a result, both political actors can receive credit for the same local
   goods. The article tests and supports these theoretical predictions
   using a vignette survey experiment in Colombia.},

Abstract = {As the multilateral climate transparency mechanism increasingly blurs
   the differentiation between developed and developing countries, it
   catalyses international pressure on the latter to adopt more ambitious
   mitigation policies and stringent reporting. This article delves into
   the relationship between the International Consultation and Analysis
   (ICA), a climate transparency mechanism under the United Nations
   Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the mitigation
   policies of emerging economies, namely Brazil, China, India, Indonesia,
   and Mexico. Using the conceptual framework of reflexive capacity, we
   explore how the ICA enhances the ability of these countries' governments
   to recognize, reflect upon, and respond to demands for mitigation
   information. Our research draws on interviews with key government
   officials, UNFCCC personnel, and experts involved in the ICA process,
   participant observation, and extensive analysis of primary documents
   including the Biennial Update Reports, Technical Analysis Synthesis
   Reports, and countryspecific submissions. The findings demonstrate that
   the ICA fosters the enhancement of government actors' reflexive
   capacities by furthering their understanding of transparency's
   significance, advancing their technical reporting expertise, and
   subjecting individual country performance to scrutiny. Such capacities
   not only lead to improvements in domestic practices related to the
   generation and disclosure of mitigation-related information but also
   empower these countries to assert their entitlement to differentiated
   responsibilities in the face of increasing demands for mitigation and
   reporting. The enhanced reflexive capacity and heightened scrutiny are
   anticipated to play pivotal role in facilitating the development of more
   ambitious mitigation policies and more effective climate transparency
   mechanisms at both domestic and global levels.},

Abstract = {Reductions in premature mortality are widely attributed to economic,
   educational, and medical factors. This study contributes to our
   understanding of the influence of political factors in preventing early
   death and gender inequalities in health outcomes. We analyze data from
   life tables of the World Health Organization, 2000-2015, to estimate the
   annual, sex-specific standard deviation of the age-at-death distribution
   across 162 countries. We apply dynamic panel model analyses to assess
   the association between political liberalization and inequalities in
   premature mortality. Our findings show reduced inequalities in premature
   mortality in liberal democracies, with men benefiting
   disproportionately. We theorize that liberal democracy may motivate
   governments to respond to citizens' desires for policies that improve
   health and reduce risks. As democratic liberalization increases,
   premature mortality falls for men, which may be accounted for in part by
   reduced male mortality from injuries. Reductions in premature mortality
   for women appear to stem primarily from improvements in maternal
   mortality across regime types. Our findings support the idea that
   democratization may provide public health benefits, especially for male
   citizens.},

Abstract = {Approximately 15\% of the world's population have a disability-and
   nearly 4 out of 5 live in the Global South. However, disability is
   seldom mentioned in global health and international development
   research. People with disability experience attitudinal and
   environmental barriers that limit their social inclusion. Due to
   different cultural perspectives and institutional capacities worldwide,
   people with disability experience various social conditions. In many
   settings, moralized beliefs toward disability assume one's value, while
   medicalized beliefs are influenced by biomedical infrastructure. We
   develop a theoretical framework that cross-arrays these moral and
   medical dimensions to argue different framings of disability present
   varied opportunities for social inclusion. As a demonstration of this
   framework, we use data from the Accelerating Core Competencies for
   Effective Wheelchair Service and Support (ACCESS) Project (2014-2017)
   (n=6601) to analyze social inclusion differences in India, Kenya, and
   Nicaragua. We found that Nicaragua reported the highest count of social
   inclusion, followed by Kenya and India, respectively. These findings
   support our theoretical framework, respectively, which suggests there
   are three unique disability regimes-moral regime, integrative regime,
   and civic regime. We conclude that disability in the Global South is
   more complex than the Western perspective that emphasizes a
   unidimensional moral-to medical-to-social model continuum.},

Abstract = {This article explores the current and future dynamics of Southeast
   Asia's maritime cooperation with China and India. Southeast Asian states
   do not only have diverse agendas when it comes to non-traditional and
   traditional maritime security issues, but their prioritization of these
   threats also vary. Those variations primarily define Southeast Asian
   interests for partnerships with actors such as India and China. Given
   China's geographical centrality, its strong economic relationship with
   countries in the region and the proximity of its military power,
   Southeast Asia states will remain far more invested in maritime security
   cooperation with China than India. Yet, China's territorial and maritime
   jurisdictional disputes in the South China Sea, and its overpowering
   shadow on the region, have contributed to anxiety among Southeast Asian
   states and their search for other security partners. The evolving threat
   of China's rise and polarization within the region gives New Delhi
   opportunities to engage. India-China rivalry is also a significant
   motivation for New Delhi to engage in Southeast Asia's maritime
   security. Two avenues for this include naval arms transfers and training
   for sea denial missions to claimant countries in the South China Sea,
   and cooperation in Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) against illegal,
   unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.},

Abstract = {Scholarship evaluating public support for redistribution has emphasized
   that stereotypical perceptions of low-income people inform citizens'
   willingness to redistribute wealth to the poor. Less understood,
   however, is the extent to which stereotypical perceptions of high-income
   people lead to greater willingness to raise taxes on high-income
   individuals. These perceptions likely involve resource-based
   considerations (i.e., what rich people have). However, following recent
   scholarship, perceptions of the wealthy may also involve more
   fundamental, trait-based considerations (i.e., who the rich are as
   people). In this Research Note, we isolate causal effects, utilizing
   conjoint experiments, of both resource-based and character-based
   attributes of the rich on support for taxing wealthy people. We find
   evidence that two character traits-avarice and elitism-significantly
   increase support for raising taxes on wealthy individuals, and this
   pattern appears to be the case even among groups generally opposed to
   redistribution (e.g., Republicans and conservatives). We conclude that,
   while resource-based considerations remain important, the scholarly
   literature on redistribution may also benefit from a deeper
   understanding of the trait-based foundations of public attitudes toward
   taxing the wealthy.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyse the factors that influence a greater
   or lesser decrease in gender inequality, paying special attention to the
   role of social policy. To this end, a measure of inequality in the
   distribution of income between men and women has been developed and a
   panel of data has been estimated for 33 European countries and a time
   period of 15 years. The results show that income inequality in general,
   as measured by the Gini index, and gender inequality based on
   differences in the distribution of income between men and women are
   closely linked, and that retirement benefits and women's educational
   attainment are the tools that most improve gender equity in income
   distribution.},

Abstract = {This study explores why the implementation of domestic environmental
   policies that tackle transboundary air pollution has been undermined by
   comparing the cases of the Republic of Korea (Korea) and Singapore.
   Heavy smog recurs in Korea and Singapore every year despite various
   attempts to reduce air pollution through the signing of environmental
   cooperation agreements and the introduction of domestic measures. While
   existing scholarship has examined intergovernmental cooperation aimed at
   mitigating transboundary air pollution, this study focuses on domestic
   factors affecting policy implementation processes at the national level.
   How do domestic factors shape governmental policy actions within
   environmental cooperation agreements in the cases of Korea and
   Singapore? I employed a process-tracing method to analyze the
   entanglement of domestic stakeholders from the late 1990s to 2019. By
   drawing upon domestic politics theory, I find that domestic dynamics,
   intricately linked to other stakeholders, have limited the effectiveness
   of policies implemented to address poor air quality. This finding
   suggests that domestic politics play a critical role in establishing
   effective regional environmental cooperation in the long run.},

Abstract = {This Forum article reports on a meta-review of more than 19,000
   published works on water security, of which less than 1 percent
   explicitly focus on race or ethnicity. This is deeply concerning,
   because it indicates that race and ethnicity-crucial factors that affect
   the provision of safe, reliable water-continue to be ignored in academic
   and policy literatures. In response to this finding the Forum calls for
   building intersectional water security frameworks that recognize how
   empirical drivers of social and environmental inequality vary both
   within and across groups. Intersectional frameworks of water security
   can retain policy focus on the key material concerns regarding access,
   safety, and the distribution of water-related risks. They can also
   explicitly incorporate issues of race and ethnicity alongside other
   vectors of inequality to address key, overlooked concerns of water
   security.},

Abstract = {Social scientists have become increasingly interested in how
   narratives-the stories in fiction, politics, and life-shape beliefs,
   behavior, and government policies. This paper provides an unsupervised
   method to quantify latent narrative structures in text documents. Our
   new software package relatio identifies coherent entity groups and maps
   explicit relations between them in the text. We provide an application
   to the U.S. Congressional Record to analyze political and economic
   narratives in recent decades. Our analysis highlights the dynamics,
   sentiment, polarization, and interconnectedness of narratives in
   political discourse.},

Title = {Choosing among the chosen? Electoral lists and party primaries in Europe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {96-109},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Primaries are becoming the preferred mechanism to select parliamentary
   elites in an increasing number of parties across Europe. Recent
   literature has shown that certain party-level characteristics favour the
   implementation of this inclusive method of selection. However, despite
   its great relevance in party life, the impact of the electoral system
   has not attracted enough attention. In this article we wonder if the
   type of electoral list (blocked or not blocked) has an effect on how
   participative the method of candidate selection is. We expect primaries
   to be more popular where electoral lists are blocked, as an intermediate
   mechanism for the electorate to influence an otherwise leadership-driven
   process of candidate selection. However, the results of a survey of
   2,561 candidates from 37 parties show that this expectation is not met,
   as primaries seem to be more common precisely in non-blocked lists
   systems, with this effect being especially visible among right-wing
   parties. These findings suggest that the type of list might play a key
   role in this important aspect of internal party life.},

Abstract = {Identity formation is a complex process and has been discussed by
   post-structuralist discourse theorist Ernesto Laclau. This paper focuses
   on Laclau's proposed ideas on the means of identity production and
   populism and studies the popular independence movement for Bangladesh
   under that rubric. It locates charismatic leadership as a necessary
   condition for populism and identifies Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
   as the charismat suturing the various chains of equivalence that rose to
   become the populist movement that resulted in the nation's struggle for
   independence in 1971. This paper also looks at the transformational
   leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and acknowledges it as a necessary
   condition for the patterns of identity creation in East Bengal in the
   late 1960s.},

Abstract = {The Middle East and North Africa, of which the southern and eastern
   Mediterranean sub-region constitutes the bulk of the population and
   territory, is the world's most securitized region. It is also the
   leading recipient of security assistance but provides the least security
   of any global region. A related paradox is that this region, the states
   of which are the world's least democratic, receives the bulk of its
   security assistance from democracies. This article draws upon the causes
   and consequences of these two paradoxes to investigate relationships
   between securitization, security systems, and insecurity in the
   Mediterranean and broader MENA region. These paradoxes are products of
   historical legacies and limited access orders that characterize the
   region's political economies. They are key drivers of `Faustian
   Bargains' between providers and recipients of security assistance and
   the costs of those relationships. The article concludes with a review of
   proposals to improve the balance of costs and benefits of SA,
   recommending a dual strategy of seeking to reform recipients'
   civil-military relations while changing military roles and
   responsibilities of both partners in security assistance relationships.},

Abstract = {We propose and explore the possibility that language models can be
   studied as effective proxies for specific human subpopulations in social
   science research. Practical and research applications of artificial
   intelligence tools have sometimes been limited by problematic biases
   (such as racism or sexism), which are often treated as uniform
   properties of the models. We show that the ``algorithmic bias{''} within
   one such tool-the GPT-3 language model-is instead both fine-grained and
   demographically correlated, meaning that proper conditioning will cause
   it to accurately emulate response distributions from a wide variety of
   human subgroups. We term this property algorithmic fidelity and explore
   its extent in GPT-3. We create ``silicon samples{''} by conditioning the
   model on thousands of sociodemographic backstories from real human
   participants in multiple large surveys conducted in the United States.
   We then compare the silicon and human samples to demonstrate that the
   information contained in GPT-3 goes far beyond surface similarity. It is
   nuanced, multifaceted, and reflects the complex interplay between ideas,
   attitudes, and sociocultural context that characterize human attitudes.
   We suggest that language models with sufficient algorithmic fidelity
   thus constitute a novel and powerful tool to advance understanding of
   humans and society across a variety of disciplines.},

Abstract = {Primary voters frequently support the candidates they think have a
   greater chance of winning the general election over the candidates who
   most closely reflect their policy preferences-a perception referred to
   as ``electability.{''} While electability is typically taken to mean
   ideological moderation, recent research highlights the potential for
   candidates' demographic characteristics to affect such perceptions.
   Using a conjoint experiment conducted with a sample of nearly 3,000
   likely Democratic primary voters in June 2019, we show that women and
   candidates of color were seen as less electable than their white, male
   counterparts despite being preferred more frequently, holding policy
   stances and general election strategies constant. These effects were
   independent of respondents' hostile sexism and racial resentment, and
   mediation analysis indicates that electability concerns reduced overall
   support for women and candidates of color. The results replicate and
   extend recent findings related to ``strategic discrimination{''} in the
   US electorate.},

Abstract = {There has been increasing concern among commentators and scholars about
   polarization in Canada. This note uses the Canadian Election Study from
   1993 to 2019 to measure trends in ideological divergence, ideological
   consistency, and partisan-ideological sorting in the Canadian mass
   public. It finds only mixed evidence that Canadians are diverging
   ideologically and becoming more polarized-ideological distributions are
   unimodal and trends toward more dispersion are slight and driven
   entirely by the last two election cycles. Canadians are, however,
   becoming modestly more ideologically consistent and much more
   sorted-that is, partisanship, ideological identification, and policy
   beliefs are increasingly interconnected. These findings call for
   additional research on the causes and consequences of mass polarization
   in Canada and further efforts to situate these results, along with
   findings from the United States, in a comparative context.},

Title = {Estimating the Between-Issue Variation in Party Elite Cue Effects},
Journal = {PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {4},
Pages = {862-885},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Party elite cues are among the most well-established influences on
   citizens' political opinions. Yet, there is substantial variation in
   effect sizes across studies, constraining the generalizability and
   theoretical development of party elite cues research. Understanding the
   causes of variation in party elite cue effects is thus a priority for
   advancing the field. In this paper, I estimate the variation in party
   elite cue effects that is caused simply by heterogeneity in the policy
   issues being examined, through a reanalysis of data from existing
   research combined with an original survey experiment comprising 34
   contemporary American policy issues. My estimate of the between-issue
   variation in effects is substantively large, plausibly equal to
   somewhere between one-third and two-thirds the size of the between-study

Abstract = {In the wake of the new security situation in Europe, Sweden has decided
   to apply for membership in NATO. After over 200 years without war, the
   country must now be set to defend not just itself, but its allies as
   well. Are Swedes ready for this? Previous research has shown a high
   willingness among Swedes to defend their country. But what actually
   explains this high defence willingness among Swedes, given their
   unfamiliarity with the task? To examine the willingness of the country's
   population to contribute to the military, we make use of survey data
   collected before and after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It
   turns out that the most general explanation for defence willingness,
   namely threat perception, has little or no explanatory value in the
   Swedish context. Surprisingly, this was true before the full-scale
   invasion of Ukraine, as well as after. Furthermore, context-specific
   explanations citing the prevalence of emancipatory values among Swedes
   find no support either. However, this study does find robust support for
   gender, trust and political orientation as important explanatory factors
   for defence willingness. Our findings thus underscore some challenges
   facing Sweden as a newcomer to NATO, as political divides along lines of
   gender and trust widen.},

Abstract = {Does the exercise of the right to petition allows citizens to act
   politically? This paper looks at the practice of presenting
   institutional petitions to Moroccan municipalities since the inception
   of this right. It inquires on the ways in which citizens and
   associations employ petitions to engage with their local government. By
   discussing the diverse trajectories of citizens' exercise of the right
   to petition, this paper will highlight the interdependence of
   depoliticization and (re-)politicization at the local level. It is based
   on extensive qualitative and quantitative research on municipal
   petitions, the process that led to their presentation and their outcome,
   conducted over 20-months of presence in the field (February 2020 -
   December 2021). Reviewing the outputs of the petitions presented in the
   city of Tangier, this paper shows that the performance of the right to
   petition entails both dynamics of top-down de-politicization and
   pathways for re-politicization of citizens' action. Further, the
   institutionalization of the right to petition and the limits to
   initiatives' implementation curtail the political relevance of
   engagement through petitions. At the same time, it challenges local
   power balances by creating a frame that allows for further political
   engagement.},

Abstract = {Climate change is the greatest governance challenge humanity has ever
   faced. Understanding why some governments successfully reduce greenhouse
   gas emissions and others fail is thus imperative. While regime type is
   often hypothesized to be a source of variation in greenhouse gas
   emissions, empirical findings about the effects of democracy and
   autocracy on climate action are contradictory. This research note
   reconciles these inconsistencies and adopts a quasi-experimental
   approach to investigate the relationship between democratization and
   greenhouse gas emissions. A fixed effects model with a synthetic control
   estimator is used to construct appropriate counterfactuals and evaluate
   the effect of regime type on emissions with data from the World Bank and
   Varieties of Democracy Project. The analysis shows that movement toward
   democracy does not have a significant effect on emissions, suggesting
   that research on the politics of emissions reduction should focus on
   factors other than regime type.},

Abstract = {Global environmental politics is at a critical juncture as the Earth
   System emergency deepens. The core environmental policies and actions of
   governments, intergovernmental organizations, corporations, and, to a
   lesser extent, mainstream nongovernmental organizations are visibly
   failing to deescalate this emergency. In response to these failures, we
   argue, dispossessed individuals, Indigenous peoples, grassroots
   activists, and civil society campaigners are joining forces to challenge
   market-liberal and institutionalist thinking and initiate new ways of
   organizing political and social life that prioritize biological
   integrity and social justice: what we describe as ``biojustice
   environmentalism from below.{''} Global environmental governance,
   meanwhile, is at a crossroads, becoming increasingly polycentric as
   biojustice environmentalism surges and as corporations seek to capture
   governance spaces through multistakeholder initiatives. How surging
   biojustice environmentalism in a polycentric governance landscape plays
   out in the coming years, we conclude, will be crucial for humanity's
   ability to stem the escalating global environmental crisis.},

Title = {Strategic Triangles, Actors and Agency: Georgia and Abkhazia in a

Volume = {11},
Number = {2-3, SI},

Abstract = {In scholarly debates as well as in public discourse, Georgia is often
   reduced to being one of the states ``in-between{''} Russia and the
   European Union (EU), and part of a ``contested neighbourhood{''}. The
   breakaway region of Abkhazia is usually not even credited with that,
   being treated as a mere appendage to Russia. In this special issue we
   challenge such approaches by analyzing the forging of Georgia's and
   Abkhazia's strategic paths as much more complex processes than are often
   assumed. In a context defined by the crisis in Russia-West relations, we
   explore actorness and agency - in the case of Georgia, within the
   strategic triangle of Georgia, the EU and Russia; in the case of
   Abkhazia, within the Abkhazia-Georgia-Russia triangle. Our aim is to
   expand the scope of analysis in two directions: first, by exploring what
   actors are shaping Georgia's and Abkhazia's strategic orientation, and
   second, by examining how these actors operate and interact in forging
   these entities' strategic paths.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the new triangle of relations between the United
   States, the European Union, and China through the concept of
   trilateralism from polarity theory. Following this model, we examine the
   three bilateral relationships of US-China, US-EU, and EU-China that make
   up this global triangle. Economic relations between the United States
   and China provide the operational framework for this triangle and should
   currently be viewed as a cooperative rivalry rather than a traditionally
   hostile one like that seen in the Cold War. The EU also plays a key role
   in the triangle due to its strategic autonomy and significance to the
   other two. We argue that relations in the global US-EU-China triangle
   can be characterized in terms of cooperation but do not exclude rivalry.
   These global trilateral relations are marked by flexibility and openness
   that encourage the development of relations with third countries.},

Title = {Prioritization of Socio-Ecological Indicators for Adaptation Action in
   Pauri District of Western Himalaya},

Abstract = {Socio-ecological systems have increasingly faced climate-change impacts,
   which have adversely affected the lives and property of inhabitants. The
   present study aims to prioritize adaptation actions along an altitudinal
   gradient (<1200 m asl (Zone A), 1201-1800 m asl (Zone B), and >1801 m
   asl (Zone C)) in Pauri District, Uttarakhand. A cross-sectional survey
   research design was employed to prioritize adaptation action from 545
   randomly selected households in 91 villages. A multi-disciplinary
   bottom-up indicator-based approach was applied to identify and normalize
   sectoral indicators, and PCA was used to prioritize sectoral indicators.
   Adaptation actions were designed with prioritized sectoral indicators
   along the altitude and stakeholder consultations. The prioritized
   indicators varied along the altitudinal gradient, and more than 50\% of
   the indicators for the same sector were different along an altitudinal
   gradient. Sectoral adaptation planning along the altitude is pertinent
   in the mountain because they contribute to adaptation planning
   differently. Additionally, the mainstreaming of adaptation strategies
   with national and regional development measures is also required.
   Finally, cross-sectoral resource management that combines users,
   planners, scientists, and policymakers should be formulated along the
   altitude within the district. These findings contribute to minimizing
   the gap between policy/program fabrication and local requirements. The
   evidence-based valuable knowledge for decision-makers could enable
   Himalayan communities to adapt to the impacts of climate change
   effectively. Adaptation planning is also critical for designing
   adaptation projects for the Green Climate Fund, Adaptation Fund, and
   funds from multilateral and bilateral agencies. It will facilitate
   Nationally Determined Contributions, which aims to adapt better to
   climate change by enhancing investments in development programs in
   vulnerable sectors.},

Abstract = {The ecological footprint (EF) has been used as an environmental
   indicator in most of the past research. Due to the complex linkages
   between economic growth and human development, EF has been inadequately
   understood in policy making. This research attempts to investigate the
   impacts of economic growth, human capital, biocapacity, and urbanization
   on the factors affecting the ecological footprint (EF) of five South
   Asian countries. To provide empirical evidence, this study utilizes the
   annual data from 1990 to 2022 for Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal,
   and Sri Lanka. The findings confirm the positive contribution of GDP,
   human capital, biocapacity, and urbanization to EF. The causality
   analysis shows feedback association between GDP and EF, human capital
   and EF, and biocapacity and EF.},

Abstract = {Currency crises are the most common type of financial crisis in recent
   decades, but little is known about how the public views these events.
   This paper argues that voters' perceptions of their economic
   self-interests in general, and their employment prospects in particular,
   influence their attitudes about currency crises and preferred policy
   responses. We hypothesize that individuals with high degrees of job
   insecurity will be more concerned about currency depreciation, more
   opposed to orthodox policy responses such as raising the interest rate,
   and more supportive of unorthodox policy responses, such as intensifying
   capital controls. Data from nationally representative surveys in two
   countries experiencing currency crises recently-Argentina and
   Turkey-support our argument. A follow-up survey experiment in Turkey,
   which randomly primed some respondents about deteriorating labor market
   conditions, provides further evidence. Overall, the results show that
   concerns about the labor market have a strong and systematic influence
   on how voters respond to currency crises.},

Abstract = {Although protests are an essential part of modern politics, scholars in
   nation branding, public diplomacy and soft power have had very little to
   say about these episodes. Discussions in the field have only marginally
   addressed dissent and disruption, falling into a methodological statism
   that emphasises what states do to construct and legitimise specific
   versions of national identity. Debates on nation promotion consequently
   overlook how individuals and organisations outside the state and outside
   national boundaries can be equally important in the construction and
   communication of national images. Drawing on domestic and foreign news
   coverage of protests in Brazil, Romania and Chile, we propose three
   frames to analyse the relationship between protests and nation
   promotion: (1) protests as threats, (2) protests as expression of the
   true nation and (3) protests as strategic communications. These frames
   shed light on how bottom-up efforts contest-overtly or
   covertly-state-sponsored versions of national identity and how protests
   are visibility arenas where competing discourses about the nation are
   communicated. Protests should therefore be acknowledged not as mere
   disruptions to national images or reputations but as another expression
   of the contingent, multifaceted and shifting nature of nationhood,
   particularly in highly mediatised contemporary societies.},

Abstract = {The contemporary extreme right is home to diverse milieus, some of which
   challenge or confuse stereotypical understandings of the threat. This
   study seeks to describe and organise the different milieus of the
   Australian extreme right into a typology based on the past decade of
   observable violent activities. The typology proposes a threefold way to
   view the Australian extreme right: 1. ethnocentric milieus, who
   asymmetrically evaluate other peoples and cultures, commonly informed by
   abstractions and preconceptions, especially as related to religion or
   ethnicity; 2. anti-government milieus, who fixate on the government and
   its policies as the primary source of societal woes; and 3. religious
   milieus, spanning numerous religious traditions and faiths, who anchor
   their worldviews in theological constructions. Having developed this
   typology, we revisited counteractions anchored in international practice
   and domestic legislation. We suggest that the existing domestic
   legislative environment is sufficient to manage these threats when
   informed by international practice.},

Abstract = {The growth in online platforms and documentary aggregator sites has
   revolutionised the process of Jewish family history research. This
   article records how the loss of EU citizenship rights following
   Britain's departure from the European Union encouraged the author to
   investigate their own family history. Drawing upon the author's
   findings, it describes how communal record books left on the shelves of
   town halls across Romania for over a century have been given new life
   thanks to the efforts of community archivists. This article chronicles
   their efforts to identify, preserve and digitise these documents which
   help to shed light on the history of the Jewish community of Dorna
   Watra, now Vatra Dornei, a small town in the former Austrian crownland
   of Bukovina. This article provides a detailed evaluation of the
   opportunities facing Jewish family researchers and the strengths and
   weaknesses of online aggregator sites such as Ancestry.Com and
   JewishGen.},

Abstract = {Are those things on which Americans most disagree the same things that
   divide liberals and conservatives or Democrats and Republicans? How has
   this changed over time? To answer these questions, I use 350 subjective
   items from five decades of the General Social Survey. Estimating
   disagreement with ordinal dispersion and using a novel measure of
   sorting by party and ideological identification, I find an increasing
   positive association between the two phenomena. In the 1970s, the
   likelihood that opinion on contentious items divided partisans was low.
   Since then, this probability has increased. Disagreement has been more
   consistently associated with higher levels of ideological sorting,
   though this relationship has also strengthened since the 1980s. I then
   ask which items and substantive domains have propelled the
   politicization of disagreement. I decompose the estimated coefficients
   between disagreement and sorting by item to quantify their contribution
   in each decade. I find that opinions from two domains play a large role
   throughout the period: public spending, and sexuality and abortion.
   Nevertheless, there is a great deal of heterogeneity within domains and
   over time. Though disagreement between Americans has increasingly
   sorted, a relatively small number of items drive this relationship in
   any one decade. Even among voters, a good proportion of disagreement
   remains unrelated to ideological or partisan divisions.},

Abstract = {Although populist radical right parties (PRRPs) are actively studied in
   recent years, few research has addressed their approach to education
   policy. Previously not considered one of their signature issues, this
   paper argues that education has become important for PRRPs too. In a
   case study of the Austrian Freedom Party (FPo), one of the most
   longstanding and successful PRRPs in Western Europe, we explore key
   pillars of the FPo's educational positions and their development over
   time. Drawing on qualitative content analysis of party programs,
   election manifestos and plenary debates from 1990 to 2020, our analysis
   shows that the policy area of education has indeed become an ideological
   battleground for the FPo. Its educational positions are largely grounded
   in the ideological core of PRRPs and comprise a fundamental critique of
   mainstream parties' dominance in educational institutions
   (anti-mainstream); a nativist division on all levels of education
   (nativism); the advocacy of merit-based educational institutions coupled
   with authoritarian instruments of schooling (merit); and a plea for more
   liberalisation and competition in schools (liberalisation). Over time,
   positions become more nuanced, albeit only within the already
   established traits. These findings corroborate theoretical arguments for
   the influence of growing party age and government experience on PRRPs'
   positions.},

Abstract = {Cosmopolitanism, which is often defined as openness to other cultures
   and individuals, is significant for understanding processes of
   stratification in contemporary, globalised societies that are home to
   increasingly diverse populations. In this paper, we broaden the
   perspective on cosmopolitanism to include cultural, interpersonal, and
   political dimensions. We test the associations between these types of
   cosmopolitanism and three types of correlates: socio-demographic
   characteristics, personal exposure to other cultures, and exposure to
   other cultures via various media. We analyse data from nine European
   countries that differ in the characteristics of their population,
   cultural traditions, and political models. Results indicate that
   differences between respondents in the nine countries are better
   explained by individual characteristics than by country characteristics.
   Furthermore, it is mainly personal and mediated exposure to other
   cultures, rather than socio-demographic variables, that play a
   significant role in influencing respondents' cosmopolitan tendencies.},

Abstract = {Based on the Global Party Survey (GPS) database, this research article
   explores the interaction between populism and Islamism in the Middle
   East and North Africa (MENA) party systems. Drawing on the ideational
   approach to populism, this analysis shows that Islamist parties do not
   share a common populist profile. Rather, we can speak of three broad
   profiles according tSalamanca, Spain, Institute of Iberoamericao the
   three main dimensions of populism. While the Moroccan Party of Justice
   and Development (PJD) displays a populism dominated by people-centrism,
   the Rally of Algerian Hope (TAJ), the Tunisian En-Nahda (EN), and the
   Jordanian Islamic Action Front (IAF) profiles are dominated by
   anti-elitism. On the other hand, the Turkish Justice and Development
   Party (AKP) is heavily influenced by Erdogan's leadership and its
   strongman impetus.},

Abstract = {Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) methods have
   significantly improved their performance. However, more complex NLP
   models are more difficult to interpret and computationally expensive.
   Therefore, we propose an approach to dictionary creation that carefully
   balances the trade-off between complexity and interpretability. This
   approach combines a deep neural network architecture with techniques to
   improve model explainability to automatically build a domain-specific
   dictionary. As an illustrative use case of our approach, we create an
   objective dictionary that can infer conflict intensity from text data.
   We train the neural networks on a corpus of conflict reports and match
   them with conflict event data. This corpus consists of over 14,000
   expert-written International Crisis Group (ICG) CrisisWatch reports
   between 2003 and 2021. Sensitivity analysis is used to extract the
   weighted words from the neural network to build the dictionary. In order
   to evaluate our approach, we compare our results to state-of-the-art
   deep learning language models, text-scaling methods, as well as
   standard, nonspecialized, and conflict event dictionary approaches. We
   are able to show that our approach outperforms other approaches while
   retaining interpretability.},

Abstract = {Adaptation has become a priority in global climate change governance
   since the adoption of the Cancun Adaptation Framework and the Paris
   Agreement. Adaptation to climate change has been increasingly recognized
   as a multi-level governance challenge in both the United Nations
   Framework Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) regime and academic
   literature. This recognition often includes, explicitly or implicitly,
   the role that learning can play across governance levels to accelerate
   and scale up responses to address adaptation challenges. However, there
   is no comprehensive assessment in academic literature of how multi-level
   learning has been considered in the UNFCCC regime, what the enabling
   factors are, and the outcomes of such learning. Drawing on approaches
   suggested by multi-level governance and learning literature, this paper
   seeks to fill this knowledge gap by focusing on the ways in which the
   UNFCCC multilateral process enables multi-level learning for the
   governance of adaptation and how it could be enhanced. This will be
   accomplished through a legal-technical analysis of the enabling factors
   of multi-level learning in the governance of adaptation under the
   UNFCCC. Qualitative research methods have been applied for the thematic
   analysis of selected documentation, complemented by interviews and
   personal observations of adaptation negotiations in the UNFCCC and the
   Paris Agreement. Results are presented according to three research
   questions oriented to understand how institutional design of adaptation
   under the UNFCCC enables multi-level learning; the learning strategies
   adopted across levels of governance; and the way the UNFCCC regime
   understands the contribution of multi-level learning for adaptation
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Previous research shows that domestic unrest, and especially violent
   conflict, raises political risk and discourages foreign direct
   investment (FDI). However, prior work primarily has studied private
   Western multinational corporations, not authoritarian China, the second
   largest overseas investor, which has both state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
   and privately-owned enterprises (POEs). This paper investigates the
   effects of domestic conflict on overseas Chinese FDI. We first compare
   Chinese SOE and POE investments in host states facing political unrest.
   Next, we disaggregate political unrest, examining the effect of violent
   and non-violent campaigns on Chinese SOEs and POEs. We then disaggregate
   the sector of FDI inflows. Contrary to prior conflict studies, we find
   host states under political unrest, and specifically violent campaigns,
   attract Chinese SOEs no matter the economic sector, whereas POEs are
   more risk averse. Our findings show that Chinese SOEs favor higher risk
   investments, suggesting the need for theoretical nuance in the domestic
   conflict and FDI literature.},

Abstract = {The ``near unanimous focus in the literature on successful cases of
   securitization{''} is demonstrated by Ruzicka {[}2019. Failed
   securitization: why it matters. Polity, 51 (2), 365-377] to be as
   problematic as it is untenable. The call to interrogate ``failed
   securitisation{''} is one this article responds to, focussing on the
   securitisation of asylum seekers and refugees in the United Kingdom, and
   the puzzle of why this securitisation has, in many respects, failed in
   Scotland. With the normatively troubling securitisation of migration
   deepening throughout Europe and beyond, this divergence in Scotland
   requires much greater attention. Exploring both discursive and
   non-discursive security mechanisms, empirically, the article reveals
   that whilst some securitisation policies have been enacted in Scotland,
   the UK Government-driven securitisation of asylum seekers and refugees
   has not succeeded there entirely and many elements have failed. By
   attending to devolution, overlapping jurisdiction and multi-level
   governance, the article sharpens the theorisation of ``failed{''}
   securitisation, with implications for broader understandings of
   ``success{''} in securitisation studies, in two principal ways. First,
   by demonstrating that effective contestation of securitisation, resting
   on formal authority and policymaking power, can play a key role in
   securitisation failure, and second, by revealing that binary notions of
   ``failed{''} and ``successful{''} securitisations are insufficient:
   securitisations can both fail and succeed simultaneously.},

Abstract = {Several watershed events preceded the dissolution of Yugoslavia. One of
   these was the toppling of the Vojvodina autonomist leadership in October
   1988. This was preceded by a series of rallies throughout Vojvodina in
   the summer of 1988, which may have seemed like a spontaneous affair and
   the work of ``ordinary citizens.{''} It was called ``the
   antibureaucratic revolution.{''} However, these rallies, including a
   standing group of demonstrators, continually and always referring to the
   grievances of Kosovo Serbs, turned out to be supported by the Serbian
   political elite centered in Belgrade. The elite, still headed by the
   Serbian Communist Chief Slobodan Milosevic, gave thrust and coordination
   to efforts to organize the rallies. The Vojvodina leadership was toppled
   for their alleged ``failing to understand the plight of Kosovo
   Serbs.{''} The overthrow was, further, with a view to achieve the
   Serbian elite's pet project, the ``united Serbia{''}-that is, doing away
   with Vojvodina's and Kosovo's autonomy. Written sources (including
   recollections by Yugoslav leaders of the time) and written sources are
   considered in research on the events.},

Abstract = {The Republic of Cyprus is a small EU member state, whose domestic
   structures replicate a durable tradition of centralisation, limiting the
   overall role of local government . This work employs the vertical
   research dimension of top-down Europeanisation to investigate the
   influence of European Integration vis-a-vis the promotion of gender
   equality at the municipal Level . It adopts a local government
   comparative viewpoint to analyse the adoption of the European Charter
   for Equality of Women and Men in Local Life by the Cypriot
   Municipalities (2011-present). This work utilises specific analytical
   frameworks (Europeanisation and Historical Institutionalism) to provide
   a theoretically and empirically informed analysis based on empirical
   data resulting from three field studies (2013, 2019 and 2021) and
   respective electoral data. Our research results suggest that the effects
   of Europeanisation, in terms of promoting gender equality, have been
   limited due to long-lasting formal and informal institutional
   restrictions.},

Abstract = {Public participation professionals (PPPs) are individuals hired to
   design, implement, and facilitate participatory forums. Since PPPs are
   seen as third actors who ensure that dialogue between sponsors and
   citizens in these forums is fair and open, perceived impartiality is
   important to their profession. While studies on the impartiality of PPPs
   have mostly focused on their interactions with citizens in these kinds
   of forums, less attention has been paid to the role of PPPs as third
   actors interacting with sponsors. This article seeks to describe some
   strategies PPPs use with sponsors to ensure fair and open dialogue in
   participatory forums. Based on 35 interviews with PPPs in Quebec, six
   strategies employed by PPPs to maintain impartiality are described in
   detail. An organisational field approach was used to identify these and
   other strategies and capture the nature of the interdependence and
   mutual recognition among PPPs.},

Abstract = {The article explores how gendered relations of power and masculinity are
   articulated in the Hungarian illiberal government's rhetorical, legal,
   and spatial marking of borders and surrounding right-wing discourses in
   relation to categories of ``East{''}/{''}West.{''} After the Hungarian
   government declared and gradually normalized its illiberal regime,
   particularly in response to the European refugee crisis in 2015, it
   passed various anti-migration, anti-gender, and anti-minority laws and
   policies in the name of defending Hungarians against both the influence
   of the ``feminine{''} West and the ``hyper-masculine{''} Eastern Other
   seeking refuge in Hungary. This article examines how the Hungarian
   government constructs the illiberal state, negotiates its geopolitical
   position, and propagates illiberal values as ``masculine{''} to
   articulate and assert its sovereignty against spheres of the
   ``feminized{''} international, particularly against the West. In
   parallel with these processes, subnational competing discourses of
   masculinized sovereignty emerged between the Hungarian government and
   the mayor of asotthalom. By utilizing an intersectional analytical
   framework, this article maps how these competing discourses of
   masculinized sovereignty operate at the national and local levels,
   against the unfolding of the 2015 humanitarian crisis and its aftermath.},

Abstract = {This article aims to make a threefold contribution to the study of soft
   power. First, considering that the potential of soft power of illiberal
   states is both underestimated and distorted, this study presents a
   two-dimensional conceptualization of Russia's soft power, distinguishing
   between Russia's posture toward the liberal international order, and
   sources of Russia's foreign policy. Second, it analyzes whether Russian
   soft power in the Western Balkan countries remains ideologically
   relevant beyond its hitherto conceptualizations as either the result of
   its historic cultural ties with the region, or a reflection of Russian
   foreign policy strategies. Through an analysis of elite discourses and
   news media as exemplified in speeches, press releases, and interviews,
   this article locates, challenges, and develops on Russia's soft power
   indicators in the Western Balkans. Finally, it contributes to
   surmounting the residing liberal democratic bias in the study of soft
   power of illiberal states, showing that not only can they be
   ideologically attractive but that their scope of influence differs
   according to the multi-layered nature of soft power.},

Abstract = {Administrative capacity depends on organisational and human factors that
   can enhance or diminish the performance of local governments. To analyse
   the effect of these factors, efficiency scores of municipal governments
   were calculated and regressed against organisational and staff
   characteristics, using double bootstrap data envelopment analysis, on a
   sample of 1470 Mexican municipalities. Of the variables related to staff
   characteristics, the proportion of employees with college education, and
   remunerations, have a positive and statistically significant effect on
   efficiency. Of the organisational characteristics of local governments,
   the number of computers per employee was the main variable explaining
   the efficiency of municipal governments.},

Abstract = {Studies of network governance have found that network management
   contributes to the effective performance of the network. Nevertheless,
   the influence of politics on the relationship between network management
   and network performance has not yet been examined. This is particularly
   true within traditional minority communities that have only partially
   adopted aspects of modernity and democratic governance. We conducted a
   survey among 160 Arab Israeli network members to examine the
   relationship between network management and perceived network
   performance by taking into account the effect of internal and external
   politics. Our findings show that network politics and hamula politics
   have a moderated mediation effect on this relationship. The study makes
   a theoretical contribution by emphasising the role of socio-cultural,
   managerial and political aspects of traditional communities when trying
   to develop local network governance. In these frameworks, the adoption
   of local network governance is challenging because democracy and network
   governance are still under-developed.},

Abstract = {Increasing citizen dissatisfaction with democracy leads governments and
   municipalities across the globe to seek new ways of including and
   empowering citizens. Little is known about whether `Digital Democratic
   Innovations' (DDIs) could contribute to this goal. We developed a new
   DDI in a Swiss municipality, dubbed Demokratiefabrik, where 1,079
   citizens co-created a questionnaire that served as an official Voting
   Advice Application for candidates and voters in communal elections. We
   find that while sophisticated and allegiant citizens and left-green
   voters participated more in the DDI, they did not dominate the process
   of creating the questionnaire. Intriguingly, citizens with lower
   political trust were particularly active on the platform, suggesting
   that DDIs might give disenchanted citizens a new voice in the political
   process. Overall, carefully designed DDIs can be a venue for inclusive
   citizen participation, involving and empowering local citizens in
   decision-making.},

Abstract = {This chapter offers a sketch of what the author calls the
   ``mestizo/decolonial{''} version of theorizing globalization. The
   argument is that if we live in a globalized world, it is because it was
   also colonized, that is, colonization is one of the strongest and oldest
   forces of globalization. Then, the chapter considers the role of what
   Jurgen Habermas called the bourgeois category of the ``public sphere{''}
   in the age of globalization(s). Two questions are key: How does the
   concept of the ``public sphere{''} relate to globalization? If we can
   talk about a world society that has been partly created by processes of
   globalization, can we also talk about the rise of global public spheres?
   In this context, a second question is raised: in the putative age of
   world public spheres, can we also continue to talk about the rational
   and rationalizing dimension of the public sphere as the
   social/political/cultural/economic sphere in which something like
   ``public opinion{''} can, could, should be wanted or had? The final
   section offers an analysis of the ``newer or latest structural
   transformations{''} of the public sphere by focusing on the effects of
   the rise of ``social media{''} and new ``communication technologies{''}
   and their effects on the political.},

Abstract = {In 2006, the authorities of the de facto state of Transnistria
   unilaterally held a sovereignty referendum. Almost all voters supported
   Transnistria gaining internationally recognized independence and
   subsequently integrating/associating with Russia. Despite such clear
   results, the poll was not recognized internationally and, consequently,
   not implemented. However, this was not a problem for the Transnistrian
   leadership, since the primary objective of the referendum was not to
   reallocate sovereignty, but to domestically empower Transnistria's
   President Igor Smirnov. Based on the discourse of Transnistria's next
   president, Yevgeniy Shevchuk, this article argues that the referendum
   was not placed in the dustbin of history. Analysis of the official
   Transnistrian news published during his presidency from 2011-2016 shows
   that Shevchuk re-exploited the 2006 sovereignty referendum. His aim was
   not to reallocate sovereignty either, but to reach the following goals:
   1. procure legitimacy of the Transnistrian sovereignty cause
   internationally; 2. empower Transnistria vis-a-vis its parent state,
   Moldova; 3. boost relations with Transnistria's patron, Russia; and 4.
   empower himself domestically. Arguably, the argument about the strategic
   use of past unilateral sovereignty referendums also works in cases of
   other de facto states, which can be analyzed using the analytical
   framework presented in this article.},

Abstract = {The term `paradox of the plenty' was coined to describe an often-found
   inverse relationship between royalty revenue and economic development.
   The main causal mechanism is thought to be a substitution effect whereby
   governments use royalty revenue to lower taxes instead of investing in
   activities that promote long-term economic growth. However, the
   occurrence of a `natural resource curse' differs widely both for
   countries and subnational jurisdictions. Based on a dataset that traces
   1,078 municipalities in Colombia from 2006 to 2017 and utilising a
   policy reform in 2012 that reduced royalty revenue for producer
   municipalities, we argue and find that municipal fiscal effort is higher
   when producer municipalities have more-efficient administrations. Our
   findings have important implications for the design of policy that
   allocates royalty revenue across subnational jurisdictions, in
   particular for developing countries where administrative efficiency
   tends to vary widely between local governments.},

Abstract = {This study aims to empirically examine whether alternative combinations
   of economic and institutional conditions influence access to sanitation,
   drinking water and electricity services in Ghana using fuzzy clustering
   and regression analysis. Drawing on secondary data from 2021, five
   clusters of local government districts are identified: big, wealthy
   urban districts; rural, poor districts; middling districts; small
   districts and badly managed districts. The cluster membership scores for
   all districts are included in hierarchical regressions predicting access
   to sanitation, drinking water and electricity services. The main
   findings from this analysis are that big, wealthy, urban districts are
   associated with good infrastructure, whereas rural, poor districts and
   badly managed districts are associated with weak infrastructure access.
   To distribute infrastructure services more widely, initiatives
   addressing the economic disadvantages experienced by poor, rural
   communities and efforts to improve local public administration quality
   are needed.},

Abstract = {This paper adopts a transaction costs (TCs) approach towards analysing
   the transactions of local governments in the service sector. The
   objective of the paper is to expand the analysis of the TCs concept by
   going beyond the conventional service-type-driven models. This study
   examines the cost of monitoring (MC) service contracts in Poland as
   perceived by local government officials, focusing on different forms of
   externalisation. The research involves utilising quantitative methods to
   examine how five distinct governance structures influence perceptions of
   TCs. The study suggests that the entity type, whether a public or
   private agent, affects the perceptions of monitoring costs in
   contractual agreements. The research found that the monitoring costs
   associated with public sector contracts are perceived to be higher than
   in public-private transactions, challenging previous findings. Further
   research on Inter-Municipal Cooperation should focus on the final
   product quality monitoring area, representing the most costly aspect of
   multi-principal structures.},

Title = {Remunicipalization of water services in France and inter-municipal
   cooperation: who's at the helm?},
Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {In this paper, we address the remunicipalization question from a novel
   perspective: by looking at ``who is at the helm{''}. Using a
   comprehensive panel dataset covering the complete universe of French
   drinking water services from 2009 to 2021, we show that the type of
   local governments in charge of supervising water services
   (inter-municipal cooperation or not) influences the decision to
   remunicipalize. We argue that this is because the costs of negotiating
   the remunicipalization of water services as well as the level of
   involvement in the investment and supervision of water services vary
   according to the type of local government. We conclude by discussing the
   lessons to be learned from our study concerning the future of
   remunicipalizations in France.},

Title = {Leveraging Commercial Communications for Defense IoT},
Booktitle = {IOT FOR DEFENSE AND NATIONAL SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Pages = {327-337},
Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) can trace its origins back to the
   forerunner of the Internet, the ARPANET. The ARPANET was a project
   conceived of and funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)
   within the United States Department of Defense (DoD), so in a very real
   sense, there would be no IoT without the initial investment from DoD. In
   recent years, with the advent of Internet-enabled e-commerce, cellular
   communications, and Wi-Fi, the private sector has invested much more
   heavily in communications technology than DoD. The IoT is a private
   sector innovation and thus represents a capability transitioning from
   the commercial world to the DoD. To leverage the full potential of IoT
   for defense and homeland security, government agencies should look to
   the private sector and leverage communications innovations to the
   greatest extent possible, and target government investment towards
   meeting unique requirements not fully addressed by the private sector.},

Abstract = {Whilst torture is an age-old phenomenon, prevalent in Western societies
   since the oldest available records, the twentieth century brought about
   significant transformations in its conceptualisation. Torture remains
   the subject of complex and controversial debates, both from academic,
   political, and legal approaches. Dwelling on the current
   problematisations of this concept that recognises torture within the
   logic of its social production, this text explores the connection - and
   its omission - between State violence and torture against migrants. The
   chapter examines the case of the Spanish State's failure to protect
   migrant victims of torture's rights, as well as the physical aggression
   at borders, by which migrants are subjected to different forms of
   violence by the migration control apparatus.},

Title = {Fiscal impacts of electoral abstention: a study on the electorate
   biometric update in Brazilian municipalities},
Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1074-1109},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Because electoral abstention may generate a difference between the
   preferences of general voters, i.e., those who are eligible to vote, and
   the preferences of effective voters, i.e., those who do vote, policies
   adopted by incumbents may differ according to differences in turnout
   rates across the electorate. The Brazilian biometric electorate update
   offers an innovative opportunity to explore exogenous variations in
   abstention rates, allowing us to verify its impact on public policies,
   especially local public expenditures. By combining propensity score
   matching, differences-in-differences and instrumental variables models,
   we find that the electorate biometric update decreased abstention rates
   in local elections in Brazil, which, in turn, changed local public
   spending composition towards expenditures on education. The remaining
   categories of public expenditures explored in this study, however, seem
   not to be affected by the change in the electorate composition.},

Abstract = {In the UK, during austerity local governments face pressures to identify
   transformative financial solutions to parks provision and to protect
   parks as public spaces. Yet, how local government officers balance these
   demands is under-explored. This article discusses the transfer of
   Newcastle upon Tyne's parks from local government to a new entity, Urban
   Green Newcastle. Working within a project framework, across the local
   authority, and in public consultation, we show how local government
   officers crafted narratives to legitimise their work and to provide an
   ex-post rationalisation for: creative working; the changes to democratic
   accountability in the new model; and the risks involved in creating UGN.
   The article deepens our understanding of local government officers'
   agency during austerity via its attention to legitimisation narratives.
   We show how local government officers contribute to the (re)conception
   of parks as public spaces through the negotiation of alternative
   narratives of parks management, governance, and democratic
   accountability.},

Abstract = {At the local government level in the US, the process of privatisation
   has been a dynamic one of experimentation with market delivery and
   return to public delivery when privatisation fails to deliver. National
   survey data show what drives this experimentation are pragmatic concerns
   with service cost and quality. Service and market characteristics, local
   government capacity and regulatory framework matter. In contrast to
   current international debates about the potential of remunicipalization
   to be a political reassertion of the public sector, for US local
   governments it is primarily a process of pragmatic municipalism. While
   some shifts in private finance and state regulatory environment favour
   private actors at the expense of local government, federal investments
   since COVID-19 provide funding and policy preference for maintaining a
   public role.},

Abstract = {This essay will focus on the Israeli immigration policies relating to
   asylum seekers, showing how they can be qualified as a form of (mainly
   psychological) torture. Firstly an outline of Israel's employment of
   torture against political dissidents will be laid out, together with an
   analysis of why administrative detention can be understood as a form of
   torture too. The attention will then be moved to the treatment of
   African asylum seekers, describing the harsh conditions they have to
   endure while staying in Israel prior to their deportation from the
   country, emphasising the features which can qualify them as forms of
   torture.},

Journal = {LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Pages = {545-572},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {In societies with a neo-corporatist tradition, organised interests like
   civil society organisations (CSOs) are largely embedded in the
   policy-making process. However, as (local) governments increasingly
   experiment with new forms of democratic innovation, this challenges the
   traditionally privileged position of CSOs in the policy-making process.
   We investigate the attitudes of local CSOs towards different types of
   policy decision-making instruments with an increasing level of
   decision-making power by individual citizens. Cluster analysis and a
   subsequent multinomial logistic regression analysis on survey data show
   that the extent to which CSOs appreciate increased participation of
   individual citizens is related to an organisation's role in democracy
   (policy influence) and relationship with local government (financial
   dependence).},

   local authorities affect the functioning of local democracy? We examined
   the theoretical and practical factors associated with the opportunities
   and risks inherent in an intervention policy in Israel called convened

   Parties by Seats at the Municipal Level (ENCPSML) and a number of
   measures that together express the degree of democratic representation,
   governability and voter turnout. We compare the functioning of democracy
   before and after the convened committees in 31 local authorities and a
   control group of 191 local authorities during four elections in
   2003-2018. Contrary to what one might expect, convened committees did
   not hurt the exercise of democracy and in some cases, improved it. We
   discuss the practical and theoretical implications of these findings in
   the context of multi-level governance, local democracy, regulation and
   coping with local crises.},

Abstract = {The high infant mortality rate of illegitimate children in Dualist
   Hungary urged politicians to create a modern state child welfare system
   for the protection of abandoned children whose upbringing became a
   national matter. Their main concern was providing adequate nutrition for
   infants and increase their chances of survival. The article examines how
   demographical concerns and national-political ideals influenced the
   evolution of the child welfare system in multi-ethnic Transylvania,
   first as part of the dual monarchy and after the First World War as a
   province of Romania. The Hungarian state children's asylums offered a
   variety of nursing programs for abandoned infants, where the foster-care
   system often resulted in their Magyarization at a later age. During the
   First World War, the new objective was the protection of infants
   together with mothers and the promotion of breastfeeding in order to
   ensure the viability of the Hungarian nation. National arguments were
   used in both time periods to support infant protection initiatives. In
   interwar Transylvania, the urban-rural ethnic distribution influenced
   the development of infant protection facilities: all state investments
   were channeled toward the ``authentic{''} Romanian countryside, while in
   the ``foreign{''} urban environment ethnic minorities focused on their
   own institutions.},

Abstract = {State-society relations in authoritarian settings are a recurrent topic
   in the respective literature. Phenomena ranging from loyalty and apathy
   to dissent, open protest, and resistance have been widely researched.
   The different patterns of regime response or the way authorities
   mobilize forces themselves have been discussed to a much lesser extent.
   This contribution analyzes the gradual deterioration of the
   state-society relationship in Belarus. These fragile relations have been
   brought to the brink of collapse by the authorities' mishandling of the
   ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the fraudulent presidential election in
   August 2020, which became a catalyst for the eruption of mass protests
   in the country. As a consequence, Belarus has developed into a state
   obsessed with security concerns. The pretense of legitimacy and the
   promise of a social welfare state have been replaced by an unvarnished
   clientelist dictatorship, relying on an inflated security apparatus. The
   article identifies indicators for an increased ``securitization{''} of
   state politics in recent years and corresponding measures that guided
   authorities in their endeavor to counteract societal resistance. The aim
   is to shed light on how securitized interactions have become emblematic
   of dysfunctional state-society relations in Belarus.},

Abstract = {Who are the people who, in the face of extreme repression, unexpectedly
   take to the streets en masse in an authoritarian state? This article
   aims to answer this question with reference to the case of the
   Belarusian anti-Lukashenka mass mobilization of 2020. It employs unique
   data from an original online protest survey among citizens of Belarus
   who were 18 or older and residing in the country at the time of the
   protests (Onuch et. al.; MOBILISE 2020 \& 2021; n = 17,174), fielded
   August 18, 2020-January 29, 2021.(2) This survey was designed to: (a)
   capture as many protesters as possible; and (b) capture a large enough
   sample of non-protesters as a comparative reference group enabling us to
   better understand how different anti-Lukashenka protesters (n = 11,719)
   were from non-protesters (n = 5,455). Guided by theoretical and
   empirical expectations of contentious politics scholarship, we first
   provide descriptive statistics about the socio-demographic
   characteristics of the protesters, self-reported protest grievances and
   claims, and median protester preferences on a range of attitudes and
   policies. This portrait of the protesters is followed up by regression
   analysis to test whether these patterns hold at a statistically
   significant level when comparing protesters and non-protesters.},

Abstract = {In 2019, I published my book Globalization and Health, which looked at
   the relationship between these two key concepts. In it, I argued that
   globalization may increase our vulnerability to infectious disease
   outbreaks, but it also provides us with the tools and opportunities to
   stop disease outbreaks before they spread too quickly. A few months
   after the book was published, the global COVID-19 pandemic began. In
   this chapter, I reflect on how the book's arguments hold up in light of
   our collective lived experience with the pandemic since 2019. I
   highlight three areas in which the interplay between health and
   globalization(s) deserves greater attention, and I take myself to task
   for not giving more direct and explicit attention to the international
   political economy of global health.},

Abstract = {This article explores the socio-emotional dimension of national
   belonging in post-Soviet neoliberal Latvia from the perspective of
   national pride. I propose this perspective since national pride shapes
   the character of national belonging. Studies show that national pride in
   socioeconomic and political attainment is low in post-Soviet countries
   and Latvia particularly. Influenced by social bond and commitment
   theories, this study explores why this might be the case by establishing
   national pride as a relational emotion of national belonging. For
   understanding national pride it is not enough to explore how people
   relate to their states. It is also necessary to understand how the
   states relate to their people, whether they recognize their state
   constituents, their needs and feel pride in them, and whether they shape
   social bonds among people. This study explores this question: how does
   the character of state-society relationship accounts for the low
   national pride in post-Soviet neoliberal Latvia? To answer, I combine
   the analysis of the post-Soviet civil discourse and an in-depth
   exploration of the narratives of 59 emigrants that have left Latvia
   toward the West in the post-Soviet era. The bonds formed between the
   Latvian political elite and Western countries during the post-Soviet
   transformations brought into Latvia neoliberal ideas and policies that,
   I argue, formed an insecure state-society bond, eroding an opportunity
   for national pride to flourish and weakening national belonging.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the trauma of war present in the collective memory
   of the inhabitants of the village of Bojszowy. It may transform into a
   cultural trauma that significantly determines the community's identity.
   Combining four strands of literature-memory studies, nationalist
   studies, historical studies, and psychological studies-the authors argue
   that in the community under study, the trauma connected with Upper
   Silesians' service in the Wehrmacht during World War II constitutes such
   a collective cultural trauma. Based on the study of the collective
   memory of the Silesian community and interviews with the Silesian
   intellectual elite, the article analyzes in detail how the memory of
   these events has changed the identity of the Upper Silesian community in
   recent years. This does not mean that we underestimate the importance of
   the other elements that make up the Upper Silesian tragedy. A
   combination of local circumstances meant that the service of Silesians
   in the Wehrmacht was crucial to the occurrence of cultural trauma (in J.
   Alexander's terms).},

Booktitle = {GLOBALIZATION: Past, Present, Future},

Pages = {145-160},
Abstract = {As globalization has partially retreated since the Great Recession of
   2008-9, it has taken on an increasingly regionalizing form and force,
   with both integrating and fragmenting consequences. By advancing six
   large-scale economic corridors, China's Belt and Road Initiative has
   unleashed a round of regionalizing globalization by corridorizing local
   and translocal urban and economic development along large-scale
   Chinadriven transport projects. In this chapter, I first conceptualize
   economic corridorization as a new round of globalization from below that
   enriches and advances the discourse on globalization. Then I trace and
   explore the cross-border geoeconomic pathways shaped by China-driven,
   rail-led regional economic corridors, through the paired cases of the
   China-Europe Freight Train and the China-Laos Railway. The analysis
   focuses on how logistics and trade flows along these rail-enabled
   corridors foster new translocal economic ties, industrial restructuring,
   redistributes consumption power, and thus fosters regional globalization
   from the middle and below. The chapter concludes on how this type of
   corridorized regionalization reterritorializes the extant paths of
   globalization and creates new economic pathways of globalization.},

Title = {Globalization and Africa's Future Sustainable Development},

Year = {2023},
Pages = {245-259},
Abstract = {Africa is a continent with vast human and material resources, but its
   progress towards sustainable development has been slow and sometimes
   discouraging. Some of its challenges have stemmed from its insertion
   into the global economy and accompanying power structures from at least
   the fifteenth century. As the continent's economic progression has not
   reflected the full value of its assets, Africa houses alarming numbers
   of impoverished people and nations today. Even as these groups battle
   political and economic instability, the COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted
   additional burdens. As a developing continent, Africa must leverage its
   strengths and match the trajectory of a globalized economy that promises
   genuine and sustainable development. However, several challenges have
   created bottlenecks that hinder this agenda, which this work seeks to
   explore further. This chapter considers the interactions between
   globalization and sustainable development in Africa, including its state
   before globalization, the promises of sustainable development, and the
   benefits globalization and sustainable development may bring to Africa.},

Abstract = {At the basis of the development of capitalism, fed from the beginning
   with low-cost and high-productivity labour, there are two elements that
   operate in symbiosis: racism and torture. One feeds on the other,
   because both are an expression of the same hierarchical violence,
   created and applied with the aim to subjugate, control and devalue the
   workforce. This essay aims to explore the historical and intimate link
   between torture and racism, also putting into play an important
   analytical category: political economy.},

Year = {2023},
Pages = {320-332},
Abstract = {This chapter takes stock of the corpus of knowledge about reimagining
   globalization. It also proposes an analytical framework for discerning
   future globalizations. The framework consists of a set of dyadic
   markers: globalization and deglobalizaton. Between these rival
   narratives are four subnarratives: hyperglobalization,
   antiglobalization, alterglobalization, and reglobalization. Each
   subnarrative has moments when its appeal grows and then dips. In order
   to interrogate these powerful narratives, I examine historical trends,
   what explains them, and the extent to which they are objectified. This
   is a matter of who gets their story told. Whose and which knowledge
   comes into play?
   Empirical evidence reveals that the levels of global connectedness lie
   somewhere between what the enthusiasts of hyperglobalization claim and
   what the proponents of deglobalization seek, amid deep and shallow
   globalization. The slowdown in the global economy in the 2020s does not
   signify a retreat from globalization. The data rather show sustained
   interconnectedness of nations and dependence on overseas suppliers. The
   combined effects of the coronavirus pandemic, supply-chain disturbances,
   Brexit, and the Ukraine War have brought both barriers to cross-border
   flows and inefficiencies, but not a sizable withdrawal from
   globalization. By all indications, the tides of globalization will
   continue to tack back and wash forward.},

Abstract = {Despite the creation of regions and communities in the second half of
   the 20th century for resolving ethnic tensions between the French- and
   Flemish-speaking communities, provinces are still relevant to understand
   contemporary Belgian politics. Observing provincial political dynamics
   is essential to understand multi-level political elite dynamics and
   territorial cleavages in contemporary Belgium. For instance, political
   parties are internally structured in provincial federations, and federal
   elections rely on provincial electoral districts. Combined with
   constitutional factors such as language and region, this article
   investigates the provincial origins of ministerial elites in all Belgian
   federal cabinets between 1980 and 2020. It observes that provinces are
   far from being perfectly present in a balanced manner in the federal
   government: some provinces are overrepresented while others - in
   particular large provinces - are underrepresented. This provincial
   imbalance is stable over time and independent on the types of cabinet
   but can be explained by party strategies and vote-seeking
   considerations.},

Abstract = {A survey experiment was conducted at the Union Council level in
   Bangladesh to gauge if citizens emphasise the power of the public
   manager (popularly known as Chairman of the Union Council) more than
   their corrupt practices. The analysis gauges that perspective based on
   citizens' perception of public managers' trustworthiness at the local
   level. The chronic absence of empirical research on local government
   public managers in a country from the Global South prompted us to focus
   on Bangladesh to carry out this research. The analysis of the two
   independent sample populations in the survey experiment suggests that
   local citizens have normative trust in less powerful but honest public
   managers. Our findings highlight that citizens in rural local government
   in Bangladesh have a certain degree of normative political awareness,
   which allows them to evaluate the public manager's trustworthiness, not
   merely based on the power distance or patriarchal culture.},

Abstract = {The article examines the aspects of contention and conflict escalation
   before and during the period from November 2013 till February 2014 in
   Ukraine that have not yet received due attention in research. It studies
   the contention between the government and the opposition and the
   concomitant Maidan protest mobilizations by groups advocating unity with
   Russia, and opposing the visions of political community of the radical
   groups making up part of the Maidan coalition. Conflict escalation is
   studied as a combination of structural conditions, choices and actions
   taken by conflict agents, and evolving discursive factors that enable
   political violence. The analysis indicates that while structural
   conditions played a role, conflict escalation is a nonlinear and
   agency-driven process, evolving through mutually influencing choices and
   actions of the competing parties, that either drive escalation or lead
   to deradicalization. The article suggests that the modes of contention
   and radicalization between the government and the opposition opened
   opportunities for groups supporting unity with Russia to escalate their
   demands, to radicalize their visions of political community, and to
   build leverage with Russia. In conclusion, several key narratives and
   discursive processes enabling the legitimization of the use of force and
   the implications for peacebuilding are discussed. The findings help to
   understand better the environment in which violent conflict further
   escalated in 2014.},

Booktitle = {GLOBALIZATION: Past, Present, Future},
Year = {2023},
Pages = {193-207},
Abstract = {We on the planet are experiencing a change of era, no longer an era of
   changes. In the era of changes (1500-2000) or the era of the
   Westernization of the world, changes were linear and within the frame of
   the colonial matrix of power. The concepts of newness, evolution,
   development, transition, and postmodernity are concepts singling out the
   changes in a linear, universal time. The change of era cannot be
   understood as a transition in the linear time of Western modernity but
   as an explosion and the reconstitutions of planetary cultural times.
   That explosion marks the advent of the third nomos of the Earth and the
   dispute for control of the colonial matrix of power by states not
   grounded in Western political theory and beyond the scope of
   international relations after the Treaty of Westphalia (1648). Russia's
   2022 special operation in Ukraine, responding to NATO's provocations,
   with the collaboration of Ukrainian government, to ``contain{''} Russia,
   is a signpost of the change of era and the advent of the multipolar
   world order that is tantamount with the advent of the third nomos of the
   Earth. The second nomos, the Carl Schmitt narrative, was tantamount with
   the Westernization of the world and the colonial matrix of power.},

Abstract = {By analyzing selected Slovene newspapers, the article discusses the role
   of slivovitz in the reproduction of everyday nationalism in interwar
   Yugoslavia. The article is based on an analysis of texts containing the
   word slivovka (the Slovene word for slivovitz or plum spirit) that
   appeared in three major Slovene newspapers and three minor Slovene
   pro-Yugoslav newspapers in the period 1919-1945. In the period in
   question, slivovitz did not (yet) have the role of a signifier of the
   Yugoslav state, the Yugoslav nation and other elements associated with
   Yugoslav identity, but it was becoming part of the ``structure of
   national feeling{''} - the specific experience of life in a given time
   and place that was common to the Yugoslav nation. Slivovitz, frequently
   included in repetitive and everyday habits, practices and assumptions,
   began to define the Yugoslav nation through a specific culture of
   drinking and drinks and became a component of this everyday, largely
   unnoticed reproduction of the Yugoslav nation.},

Booktitle = {GLOBALIZATION: Past, Present, Future},
Year = {2023},
Pages = {260-274},
Abstract = {How can debates about the future directions of globalization be best
   advanced, particularly those concerning the interchange of bodies and
   objects from refugees and tourists to body parts and viruses, when
   global relations are mediated through disembodying technologies from
   data platforms and digitalized surveillance to biomedicine? From the
   other side, how are we best to understand processes through which more
   embodied processes of globalization all tend to be managed, surveyed,
   and controlled through those more abstracted mechanisms of technological
   mediation? This chapter elaborates a methodologically consistent way of
   answering those questions. It investigates the tensions between these
   different forms of social interchange, arguing that disembodied
   globalization is now the dominant form of globalization, and is likely
   to be into the future. By exploring themes of embodiment, including
   human reproduction, sexual identity, vaccination, and genetic
   engineering, the chapter seeks to show how technoscientific intervention
   associated with ideologies of overcoming bodily constraint are remaking
   what it means to be human.},
