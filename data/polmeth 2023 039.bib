Abstract = {This study investigates the effects of receipt and anticipation of
   intergovernmental revenues on local governments draw on accumulated
   fiscal reserves to cushion the impacts of COVID-19-related fiscal
   stress. Several studies have been conducted on determinants of fiscal
   reserves accumulation. However, little is known about the determinants
   of government draw on fiscal reserves, beyond revenue shortfall, in
   times of fiscal stress. Dwelling on the premise that government's draw
   on fiscal reserves is influenced by factors beyond revenue shortfall and
   controlling for the effects of revenue shortfalls and other factors, we
   analysed local government survey data to determine the effects of
   intergovernmental revenue on government draw on fiscal reserves. Results
   show that draw on fiscal reserves is significantly constrained by
   percent of FY 2020 revenue received from federal and state governments,
   but significantly and positively inluenced by revenue losses and percent
   of FY 2021 revenue anticipated from federal government.},

Abstract = {The concept of Torturing Environments allows a better understanding of
   migration detention spaces and the impacts they have on people on the
   move. This chapter analyses the conditions and impacts derived from
   them, in spaces located in different border areas: Mexico (N=57), Greece
   (N=160) and Spain (N=110). The results indicate that the spaces analysed
   could be considered as torturing environments which generate tear and
   wear on people on the move. These spaces do not represent isolated cases
   but are examples of how migration policies use detention as part of a
   deterrence policy.},

Abstract = {After Putin's return to the Russian presidency in 2012, a further turn
   toward authoritarianism has been coupled with attacks on Western
   secularism, multiculturalism, and alleged moral decay. At home, the
   Kremlin has been increasingly preoccupied with defining and addressing
   problems related to citizens' bodies, linking ``traditional values{''}
   to national security. Central to this discourse are issues relating to
   reproductive norms. This analysis uses the Foucauldian concept of
   ``biopower{''} as an epistemic point of departure in an attempt to
   understand the central role of reproduction in the Kremlin's identity
   project. Administering the bodies of a population simultaneously
   produces and delimits that population according to bodily criteria.
   Thus, this ``bodily turn{''} in Russian nation-building may be
   understood as ``bionationalism,{''} a depoliticizing style of
   nationalism that relies on biopolitical techniques. The analysis
   explicates the mechanisms of this style of nationalism: how and why this
   discourse functions, legitimates problematic practices, excludes
   ``abnormals,{''} expands the state into the everyday lives of citizens,
   and marginalizes and even securitizes alternative notions of national
   identity. Putin's bionationalism may be read as an existential
   nationalism and thereby as producing a specific mobilizational context.},

Abstract = {Citizen engagement in all public activities is the hallmark of any
   democracy, as it contributes to increasing public accountability,
   strengthening the legitimacy of political processes and thus enhancing
   people's trust in public institutions. Against this backdrop, social
   media applications have emerged as essential tools for citizen
   engagement. Although the literature over the last two decades has
   devoted increasing attention to the use of social media for citizen
   engagement, there need to be more comprehensive efforts to map and
   systematise contributions published on the topic to date. The present
   study offers a systematic review of the studies on citizen engagement,
   investigating how the literature has addressed the topic so far, the key
   themes analysed, and the related findings. In this way, it offers an
   original knowledge map that identifies the antecedents and determinants
   of the citizen engagement process via social media and the different
   models it may assume.},

Abstract = {People moving from smaller to larger cities often do so in search of
   better economic opportunities. But what motivates migration from larger
   to smaller cities, which are acknowledged to offer fewer available jobs
   and prospects? This study's empirical findings, in the context of South
   Korea, reveal that an individual's willingness to move to a
   smaller-sized, secondary city is positively associated with the
   perception of local public goods there, but, surprisingly, not
   significantly aligned with job opportunities. However, this valuation
   differs by marital status and family-life-cycle stage. In addition, our
   results illustrate the importance of non-employment factors:
   dissatisfaction with current residency and place ties (e.g., length of
   previous residence and psychological place attachment) are strong
   factors motivating internal migration intention to smaller secondary
   cities. We discuss the implications of these findings for local
   government and policy makers in small cities that aim to attract new
   young and middle-aged adult residents.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we seek to break new ground by empirically investigating
   the relationship between cooperating entities, local government
   institutions and transaction costs and its effect on cost efficiency for
   water services through consortia in Brazilian local government. Drawing
   on an institutional and transaction cost framework, our results show
   that the institutional arrangements employed in water service provision
   have had a significant effect on cost efficiency, measured by total
   expenditure per user, between 2011 to 2019. Through a Generalized
   Estimating Equations (GEE), we found that cost efficiency increases
   slowly for those units performing under bureaucracies and faster under
   public enterprises. In all instances, dedicated asset specificities and
   contract management complexity explained differences in water service
   provision cost efficiency. These findings have theoretical significance
   as well as significant public policy implications for intermunicipal
   cooperative agreements.},

Abstract = {Residents of marginalised neighbourhoods have long been governed as a
   vulnerable group in need of help. Increasingly, however, they are
   expected to be active citizens and (co-)creators in improving their
   neighbourhood. While much is written about the shift towards more
   participatory governance, less is known about how this shift manifests
   in the work practice of urban professionals, particularly in
   marginalised neighbourhoods and in terms of citizen (dis)empowerment.
   This paper explores how urban professionals give shape to citizen
   participation in a marginalised Dutch neighbourhood. I found that they
   navigated between narratives of `vulnerability' and `active citizenship'
   and employed `selective empowerment': a differentiated approach in which
   they ascribed a significant supportive role to themselves and
   facilitated participation within a normative framework. The research
   offers a more nuanced image of `empowerment' than previous studies
   suggest, demonstrating that a discursive shift in governance approach is
   not automatically synchronised with urban professionals' work practice.},

Abstract = {This chapter explores whether and how refugees' past experiences of
   torture at home interconnect with extreme violence at borders and impact
   migration journeys. To do so, it draws upon eight months of ethnographic
   fieldwork at the Bosnian-Croatian border, which includes sixty-eight
   interviews. The chapter suggests that racialisation and `othering' of
   people makes torture a fluid practice that migrates across globalised
   borders, despite their institutional format remaining unchanged. By
   shedding light on complex relational patterns of torture in migration,
   the text contributes to the literature on torture, racial studies and
   critical migration and border studies.},

Pages = {74-89},
Abstract = {This chapter first discusses the lack of consensus on how to define
   deglobalization, a term that is likely to become the buzzword of the
   mid-twenty-first century. There are at least three different accounts of
   deglobalization. First, deglobalization is defined as a series of
   processes that serve to ``reverse{''} globalization. Second,
   deglobalization is celebrated as an emancipatory project decentering the
   West and aiming at reglobalization. Third, from a historical
   perspective, deglobalization is understood as a temporary phase or
   ``wave{''} that is constitutive of global polity. Then, the chapter
   focuses on the popular indices and measurements of globalization that
   are employed to better grasp the current state of globalization and
   predict whether it will be replaced by deglobalization. While
   quantitative measurement and indices serve to provide the ``big
   picture{''} in terms of comparing hundreds of nation-states across
   certain (economic, political, social, and technological) dimensions of
   globalizations, they attract much criticism, not only for their
   methodological nationalism, but also for overlooking the complex,
   nonmeasurable aspects of globalization.},

Abstract = {There is a boom in the power of right-wing parties that are becoming
   government parties in Latin America and Europe. It has been pointed out
   that these are distinguished from traditional right-wing parties by
   their common ideology that transcends national contexts, which is why
   they have been grouped as New Right-wing parties. This article questions
   whether these parties share ideological themes or whether they are
   heterogeneous and obey national interests. This study systemizes the New
   Right-wing parties' programs and classifies them to answer the question.
   This corpus is then studied through frequency, network, and principal
   component analysis. Two conclusions are reached from this. First, these
   parties agree on issues such as provider States and nationalist claims,
   and, second, their programs have diverse themes that do not show the
   formation of an identifiable transnational ideological agenda in their
   programs. Consequently, grouping these parties as an ideologically
   homogeneous phenomenon can make invisible the fact that they are parties
   that adjust to particular demands of their political environment, in a
   logic that obeys more catch-all parties than ideological and dogmatic
   parties.},

Abstract = {Despite their vast relevance to democracy, scholars have paid little
   systematic attention to the scrutiny function of local councils. To
   stimulate such research, this study theorises the concept of council
   scrutiny. First, we outline the rationale, wider policy context, and
   conceptualisations. Next, we present and discuss an actor-centred
   institutionalist approach to introduce an analytical framework that
   depicts council scrutiny as a loop comprising eight interrelated parts.
   These parts include the institutional context and policy environment,
   intrinsic motivations and actor properties, scrutiny objects,
   objectives, constellations, the scrutiny process as such, and its
   effects and personal rewards. Finally, we explain how this analytical
   framework may serve as a vehicle for a more comprehensive and detailed
   study of the various aspects of council scrutiny.},

Abstract = {Scholars have treated images from the golden age of Transylvanian
   photography, recently elevated to prominence through the digitization of
   archives, as ``authentic{''} portrayals of peasant culture. However,
   Hungarian, Romanian, and Saxon nationalists in Transylvania utilized
   photographs to brand place and nation in the global market, as well as
   to make claims to territory and assert competing national hierarchies. I
   examine here Saxon historian, folklorist and travel writer Emil Sigerus'
   Durch Siebenburgen: eine Touristenfahrt in 58 Bildern (Through
   Transylvania: a Tourist Trip in 58 Pictures), published repeatedly
   between 1905 and 1929. Sigerus' photographic survey of Transylvania's
   natural landscape, built environment and diverse populations branded
   Transylvania in general and Transylvanian Saxons in particular as a
   tourist destination unspoiled by the passage of time. Sigerus also
   projected an ethnically stratified social hierarchy on Transylvania's
   heterogeneous population, with Saxons at the apex; asserted Saxon
   ownership of urban centers, thereby reinforcing Saxon claims to a
   ``civilizing mission{''} in Transylvania; and laid claim to territory,
   simultaneously redirecting tourism from other parts of Transylvania to
   Saxon nationalists' benefit. By careful curation, then, Sigerus
   projected a strong nationalist message often overlooked in the analysis
   of individual images as ``objective{''} sources of evidence.},

   diversity and ethnic minorities' visibility. Focusing on the 2018 local
   elections in Flanders (Belgium), we find that female Turkish/Maghrebi
   (i.e., visible ethnic minority) candidates outnumber their male
   counterparts in less diverse districts and rightist parties, whereas an
   opposite picture emerges in more diverse districts and leftist parties.
   Surprisingly, however, female candidates with less visible minority
   backgrounds outnumber their male counterparts in all contexts. These
   results imply a confirmation of the `ethnic community argument', while
   casting doubts on the `deterrence' argument. Taken together, our
   findings clearly highlight the conditionality of the selection of ethnic
   minority male versus female candidates in Proportional Representation
   list-systems.},

Abstract = {Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are expected to play a pivotal role
   in mobilising financial resources for infrastructure. However, the
   promotion of PPPs has faced challenges to their success in many
   countries. This study empirically analysed the determinants of
   initiation and adoption in PPP projects. It employed Tobit regression
   models with a Chinese provincial-level panel dataset from 2009 to 2019
   for evaluating how government, market, and operating environment affect
   the number and investments in PPP projects. The results unveiled that
   local governments are motivated by fiscal pressure to initiate PPP
   projects. They also showed that the successful adoption of PPPs is
   associated with the activeness of private capital in local markets while
   neither PPP policy nor PPP fund at provincial level could facilitate the
   formation of PPPs. This study distinguished the initiation of PPP
   projects from their adoption, through which the truly key determinants
   of formatting PPPs were successfully identified.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBTs) operate in an adversarial
   rapidly- evolving environment, necessitating fast, robust and resilient
   decision-making. The success of machine learning, in particular deep
   learning methods, can improve the performance and effectiveness of
   IoBTs, but these models are known to be brittle, untrustworthy, and
   vulnerable. In this chapter, we discuss the principles and methodologies
   to make machine learning models robust, resilient to adversarial
   attacks, and more interpretable for human-on-the-loop decision-making.
   We also identify the key challenges in developing trustworthy machine
   learning for IoBTs.},

Abstract = {Robotic devices have several applications in commercial and defense IoT
   establishments. However, robots may not always have the capacity to run
   complex AI based applications, and high speed connectivity to exploit
   applications in cloud or data centers may not always be present. This
   situation arises in both defense and commercial contexts, with defense
   environments lacking sufficient network stability, and commercial
   environments concerned about data privacy and communications costs. The
   exploitation of AI capabilities at the edge can enable many use-cases by
   bypassing issues with network connectivity. At IBM Research, we have
   been developing Distributed AI technology and working on several IoT use
   cases using a robotic dog to enable applications such as visual and
   thermal inspections to identify anomalous conditions in industrial
   assets. In this chapter, we will lay out those use-cases, and discuss
   key Distributed AI components that enable such IoT applications, and how
   a robotic environment allows for new capabilities such as re-positioning
   a robotic sensor for optimal sensing. We will also discuss relevance of
   the use-cases to a military environment.},

Booktitle = {GLOBALIZATION: Past, Present, Future},
Year = {2023},
Pages = {176-192},
Abstract = {Since having achieved its independence from the British in 1947, India
   has continued to adapt its political and economic models to meet the
   challenges and imperatives posed by an ever-shifting global environment.
   Beginning with India's shift from socialism (1947-91), which ushered in
   a revolution known as ``neoliberalism by storm{''} following its
   historic currency crisis, this chapter focuses primarily on India's next
   evolution, known increasingly as authoritarian neoliberalism and beyond.
   Appearing to engender antiglobalization populist elements (as evidenced
   by current prime minister Narendra Modi's fiat dictates aimed at
   demonetizing the national currency as well as severing multiple
   free-trade agreements), this next phase appears to embrace a
   mercantilist-style, strong-state, commandand-control ethos. This
   illiberal evolution of ``neo-liberalism{''} is a highly nuanced and
   complicated model, fraught with paradoxes and contradictions that need
   to be better explored and explained.},

Year = {2023},
Pages = {290-305},
Abstract = {This chapter explores contradictory dynamics of the recent, current, and
   future prospects of globalization revealed by the COVID pandemic of
   2019-22. Situating the analysis in the COVID-19 pandemic world, it
   examines how the COVID-driven process shaped/shifted ideals about
   community, belonging, and security organized around the citizen/nation/
   state trio in a globalized international system. It contends that the
   COVID pandemic may have stirred or animated simultaneously centrifugal
   nationalisms within the Western world and the richer countries,
   resulting in neopopulist policies and protectionist measures. It also
   argues that these same policies, exposing the structural precarities
   around the world, particularly acutely in the Global South, will likely
   fuel centripetal migrations across the globe. In the end, however, the
   chapter argues, both dynamics will likely further globalization, for
   both are a priori bound up with (and within) the already globalized
   productive infrastructure, composed of digital and knowledge industries,
   manufacturing and transportation sectors, and trade and finance
   institutions. Ultimately, it suggests that globalization is here to
   stay, though taking on different forms as evinced during the COVID-19
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {Local governments mandated with establishing a voucher market can have
   multiple options for the specific type of voucher model they choose.
   What determines the local choice of voucher model in such a multi-option
   scenario? This article focuses on the importance of market capacity and
   theoretically argues that market capacity is shaped not only by private
   providers' production conditions but also by the wider private market
   attractiveness. Empirically, the relationship between market capacity
   and local governments' choice of voucher model is tested in a voucher
   market for homecare for the elderly. Based on regression analysis, the
   article finds that higher market capacity, not least in terms of higher
   market attractiveness, increases the likelihood of choosing a voucher
   model with competitive tendering compared to a voucher model based on
   fixed price and quality terms.},

Abstract = {After Ekrem Imamoglu won as Istanbul's mayor, the contestation between
   the city and central government resembled other cases of liberal mayors
   winning in illiberal populist regimes. To expand liberal democracy, the
   mayor sought to reinvigorate effective democratic citizenship by
   increasing access to information, creating more inclusive governance
   networks through public participation opportunities, limiting the
   regime's clientelism and rent-seeking opportunities in real estate and
   contracting, and (re)creating social solidarity. The national government
   responded by extensively covering ``scandals{''} and continuing populist
   rhetoric to maintain polarization, limiting the city's financial
   resources, and moving power and projects to agencies they still
   controlled. This article uses Istanbul to develop this model and
   illustrate how Imamoglu has made progress in each area despite the
   central government's effort to constrain his administration.},

Abstract = {This article explores the national identity argument in unsettled times
   by using the COVID-19 pandemic as a test case. It uses a longitudinal
   survey among Jewish Israelis to examine whether the pandemic influenced
   levels of national identity and solidarity and whether it altered their
   relationship. The findings indicate a clear reduction in levels of
   solidarity, national attachment, and national chauvinism over time. They
   also show that the positive connection between national attachment and
   solidarity grew stronger, while the connection between national
   chauvinism and solidarity became weaker and insignificant. These
   findings provide complex evidence for the national identity argument.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the protest against the 2019 Nobel Prize in
   Literature to Peter Handke as an example of transnational memory
   activism. It analyzes from a transnational mobilization perspective how
   activists achieved a globally visible protest in Stockholm and what role
   memory played in the protest mobilization and framing. Genocide
   survivors and former refugees, human rights activists, journalists, and
   academics formed a transnational protest coalition. In this way, they
   drew international attention to their outrage at the honoring of an
   author who is criticized for denying the Bosnian genocide. The analysis
   shows that memories of the violent dissolution of Yugoslavia and
   genocide united the diverse protesters as a ``memory community{''} and
   shaped their framing. The protesters warned of the potential
   repercussions of the Nobel Prize to Handke for the internationalization
   and normalization of genocide denial. They argued that locally, Serb
   nationalist politicians can find legitimation in it for divisive
   politics. Moreover, they put the prize in a larger context of globally
   rising right extremism and islamophobia that find inspiration in the
   very Serb nationalist ideology and its propagators of the 1990s
   conflict.},

Title = {Taking the ``Race{''} Out of Master Race: The Evolving Role of the Jew
   in White Supremacist Discourse},
Journal = {NATIONALITIES PAPERS-THE JOURNAL OF NATIONALISM AND ETHNICITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 13},
Abstract = {Across Europe and North America, political leaders and elites use
   ethnoreligious appeals based on white supremacist ideology with
   increasing success. Yet this rhetoric frequently includes positive
   references to Jews and Israel. What explains this pivot away from the
   historic reliance on the so-called ``nefarious, menacing Jew{''}? Rather
   than interpret the transformation of the white supremacist Jewish trope
   as an ideological shift, this article demonstrates that the
   transformation reflects a mainstreaming of white supremacist discourse.
   More specifically, as white supremacist discourse increasingly finds a
   home in successful nativist political parties, framing Jews as a
   religion rather than a race sidesteps hurdles to attracting votes.
   Second, positive references to Israel rather than Jews demonstrates the
   evolution of an identitarian strand within white supremacy rather than a
   de-escalation of racist ideology. A comparison of the German AfD and the
   American Republican Party, two parties that increasingly employ white
   supremacist rhetoric alongside pro- Jewish rhetoric, illustrates the
   phenomenon. Within a larger political context, the de-racializing of
   Jews in white supremacist discourse reflects a shift in twenty-first
   century nativism from a preoccupation with race and nationality, to a
   focus on civilizational, cultural, and religious identities.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mini-lateral `clubs' occupy an increasingly prominent place in the
   international environmental governance landscape. Yet few studies have
   looked at how differences between clubs influence the results they
   produce. This paper aims to fill this gap in understanding by testing
   hypotheses on how different clubs' membership con-stellations and
   leadership (connected to large events) affect ambitions in outcome
   documents of the G7 and the G20. It tests those hypotheses by employing
   text and data analytic techniques to compare stated ambitions in
   environmental documents of G7 and G20 over the past two decades. The
   analysis reveals that the G7's language is generally stronger than the
   G20; and that strategic leadership connected to large events may
   contribute to raising those ambitions. These findings highlight the
   importance of mini-lateral clubs as forms of environmental governance
   and, more generally, illustrates the use of text mining in environmental
   governance research.},

Title = {From partial to integrated perspectives: How understanding worldviews
   can expand our capacity for transformative climate governance},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {There is now widespread recognition that the dominant approaches to
   addressing the climate crisis to date have been insufficient. One reason
   for this is their failure to account for the influential role played by
   inner dimensions such as worldviews, values and beliefs in shaping how
   we understand and respond to this urgent issue. This paper explores how
   worldviews are both an insufficiently understood factor and an
   under-utilised tool that could enable more transformative governance
   responses to climate change. It introduces the concept of
   developmentally-based worldviews, focusing on the five worldviews most
   prevalent amongst leaders and man-agers today and how climate change is
   understood and approached by each. Applying a worldviews perspective to
   the global climate governance arena, the paper shows how operating from
   Conformist, Expert and Achiever worldviews can result in less capacity
   to respond to change and uncertainty, engage in reflective learning and
   be open to multiple perspectives -all aspects regarded as important for
   achieving transformative action -than operating from Pluralist and
   Strategist worldviews,. Tools such as mindfulness training and
   developmentally -informed leadership education are likely to be helpful
   in further developing the capacity of individuals and organisations to
   engage in truly transformative climate governance.},

Abstract = {There is a form of power whereby the moral relationship governs those
   who are part of, or affected by, relationship. Called ``acceptance
   governance,{''} it develops ``power-with{''} in a decolonial manner,
   reframing agency as guided by accountability. Power-with leads to
   minimal moral relations between worlds out of which processes of
   acceptance build justice and right relations from the bottom up. There
   are two senses of acceptance, however, the second being accepting the
   conditions of acceptance. Power-with then becomes grounded ``power
   from,{''} a new form of power uncommon in the literature. In addition to
   cohering with a number indigenous traditions as well as with ecological
   versions of civic republicanism, acceptance governance provides one way
   to internalize ecological reflexivity within norms of planetary
   governance and contributes to analysis of institutional and personal
   capacities for participation, knowing, and healing from injustice common
   significant strands of ESG research today.},

   futures: Extending an action situations approach to the
   Water-Energy-Food nexus},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite near-global consensus on the Sustainable Development Goals and
   the Paris Climate Agreement, unre-solved and politically contentious
   trade-offs have undermined implementation. One exemplary case facing
   difficult trade-offs are Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus cases. Here, we
   extend the nascent `Social-Ecological Action Situations' framework to
   analyse past coevolution of WEF nexus cases (or other social-ecological
   systems) to envision possible futures where trade-offs are equally
   considered and minimized. We illustrate the value of the approach for a
   WEF nexus case in Switzerland with upstream hydropower reservoirs,
   water-bound biodiversity, and emerging downstream agricultural
   irrigation needs. The proposed solution-oriented, transformative
   approach goes beyond existing frameworks by analysing past coevolution
   of the intertwined system to build system understanding and to envision
   a future with concrete policies that would result in a higher adaptive
   capacity of the system and a compromise within the WEF nexus. We argue
   that this perspective helps to devise policies to address trade-offs in
   WEF nexus cases and thereby to tackle global crises.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper presents the concept of climate commitment for measuring
   institutional effectiveness in global climate governance at the
   subnational level. The research scope is limited to a top-down
   perspective and the outcome dimension of institutional effectiveness. It
   considers the multi-level governance theoretical approach to assess
   subnational governments' behavior in global climate governance and
   defines subnational governments as the level between the national
   government and cities/municipalities. Climate commitment stands on two
   di-mensions: governance processes and greenhouse gas emissions
   trajectory. The principal component analysis statistical method examines
   the climate commitment variables' behavior and the results for Brazilian
   subnational units (26 states and the federal district). The research's
   contribution offers an alternative approach to subna-tional actors' role
   in global climate governance architecture and an alternative model for
   policy design.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Enforcement and management scholars alike expect that countries
   participating in an international agreement will more likely achieve
   predetermined targets than nonparticipating countries will. The
   management school ascribes this expected association to a constraining
   effect of the treaty; the enforcement school ascribes it to a screening
   effect. If the latter conjecture is correct, the association between
   participation and target achievement should significantly weaken (or
   even vanish) when controlling for targets' ambition level and other
   confounding factors. We test this hypothesis on a new dataset comprising
   three protocols under the Convention on LongRange Transboundary Air
   Pollution (CLRTAP). Our results suggest that the positive association
   between participation and target achievement is robust to controlling
   for confounding factors; hence, our data suggests that these CLRTAP
   protocols have indeed constrained participating states.},

Title = {Seeking ?Systems? in Earth System Law: Boundaries, identity, and purpose
   in an emergent field},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper interrogates the vision and purpose of the nascent and
   developing field of `Earth System Law' (ESL) with a view to asking how
   best to describe what ESL is and how it can contribute to scholarship on
   law in the `Anthropocene.' Drawing on Luhmann's autopoetic systems
   theory of law and complex adaptive systems theory, the paper reflects on
   ESL's identity, boundaries, and role as a scholarly movement and seeks
   to draw out both the prospects and limits of its transformational
   purposes. Such questions are seen as inescapably tied to pragmatic
   considerations of how law and legal systems change, meaning that ESL
   would be best served if its scholars embraced a kind of `translating'
   role to facilitate linkages between law and other domains in search of
   ways for earth systems considerations to be made relevant to law, rather
   than becoming vanguards of a normative legal revolution for the
   Anthropocene. (149 words)},

Title = {MSPs for the SDGs-Assessing the collaborative governance architecture of
   multi-stakeholder partnerships for implementing the Sustainable
   Development Goals},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Multi-stakeholder partnerships (MSPs) involving a diverse set of actors
   are assumed to reduce implementation gaps of the 2030 Agenda and the
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While existing research suggests
   that MSPs can complement state-led efforts in environmental and
   sustainability governance, a deeper understanding of the composition,
   thematic focus, and specific governance functions of MSPs for the SDGs
   is still wanting. In this article, we present the results of a survey of
   192 MSPs registered on the United Nations Partnership Platform,
   analyzing their set-up and organization, partner composition, agency of
   partners, governance functions, SDG coverage, and effectiveness. We
   further complement existing research by investigating whether MSPs
   address SDG nexuses and relate our findings to previously identified
   interlinkages between the goals. Comparing our results to earlier
   studies, we find that MSPs have become more inclusive, involving more
   non-state actors overall, and as lead partners. Our results further
   indicate a complementary role of MSPs in SDG implementation by focusing
   on often underrepresented and cross-cutting goals such as climate action
   (SDG 13), quality education (SDG 4) and gender equality (SDG 5).
   However, there appears to be untapped potential for MSPs to capitalize
   on shared resources and capabilities to address combinations of SDGs
   that are likely to produce negative spillovers among each other.
   Moreover, we find partnerships between actors from multiple societal
   sectors to be potentially more effective than those involving only one
   societal sector.},

Abstract = {Global biodiversity targets have not been met due to weak implementation
   at the national level. National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans
   (NBSAPs) are central for mainstreaming biodiversity by translating
   global ambition into national policies. This study analyzes the
   practical role of global and national biodiversity agendas. Interviews
   from France, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Rwanda, and
   South Africa show that global targets and NBSAPs have raised awareness,
   mobilized initiatives, mobilized support for imple-mentation, and
   fostered accountability. Nevertheless, conflicting interests, weak
   financial support, and poorly integrated institutional and regulatory
   structures remain challenges to implementation. Levers for harnessing
   the role of future NBSAPs to achieve the goals and targets of the
   Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework are: improving
   communication; defining concrete measures and clear responsibilities;
   fostering cross-sectoral commitment; enshrining targets into national
   laws; ensuring adequate public funding; reforming harmful sub-sidies;
   ensuring coordination among sectors and levels of governance; and
   strengthening accountability frameworks.},

Title = {Groundwater salinization in northwestern Germany: A case of anticipatory
   governance in the field of climate adaptation?},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Groundwater salinization due to sea-level rise is a problem that
   governance actors in coastal areas of the North Sea region have overseen
   for a long period. As an ecological problem associated with climate
   change, it can be severely exacerbated by careless water management.
   This paper studies governance processes, actor perspectives and
   responses to groundwater salinization and sea-level rise in the East
   Frisian and Frisian regions of the German North Sea coast. Due to its
   low-lying landscape, large areas of land remain below sea-level, making
   groundwater salinization an urgent concern. Our research questions are:
   (i) What type of anticipatory governance approach can be found with
   actors in the study region concerning groundwater salinization and
   climate adaptation challenges? (ii) How can an alternative anticipatory
   governance approach promote proactive governance processes addressing
   the complex problem of groundwater salinization in terms of awareness,
   preparedness, methods, strategies and policy actions? We conducted
   semi-structured interviews and workshops between 2017 and 2021,
   including a group of 15 actors from private and civil society
   organizations as well as authorities on municipal, inter-municipal and
   state levels. Our study finds that problem awareness in municipalities
   and regional governance levels in East Frisia and Frisia is low. Current
   management of groundwater salinization mainly focuses on technical
   response measures, while precautionary measures are given low
   priorities. With regard to governance approaches, our study identifies
   apparent societal challenges of groundwater salinization at the complex
   interface between water management, human activities and natural
   processes, and sustainable ways to manage and protect groundwater
   resources. However, we found indication for a defensive anticipatory
   governance approach prioritizing risk management and assessing plausible
   futures. In participatory processes, we discussed possible technical,
   non-technical and institutional adaptation options for future
   implementation. Finally, conclusions will be drawn on how knowledge and
   awareness building can contribute to change actors perspectives on the
   overseen problem of groundwater salinization and increase adaptiveness.},

Title = {Ecolabel certification in multi-zone marine protected areas can
   incentivize sustainable fishing practices and offset the costs of
   fishing effort displacement},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As area-based marine conservation coverage expands to meet global
   targets, tension with fishing activities increases. While fully
   protected areas (FPAs) provide the largest range of long-term
   social-ecological benefits, their establishment has been constrained by
   difficulties arising from the short-term costs of protection, and
   associated limitations in economic incentives and in the resources
   required for effective implementation. Building on an existing
   bio-economic model for self-financed FPAs, we examine the economic and
   operational feasibility of establishing an ecolabel approach to balance
   the costs endured by fishers when implementing an FPA. Optimal increased
   profits can be achieved by designating the ecolabelled self-funded
   managed-fishing area for 20-25\% of FPA. Multi-zone MPAs with a price
   premium derived from catch ecolabel certification inside partially
   protected areas surrounding FPAs provide incentives to help fishers
   engage into adopting sustainable fishing practices. Here we pave the way
   for more innovative approaches towards transformative changes for
   fisheries sustainability.},

Title = {`Farming out' biodiversity: Implementing EU nature law through
   agri-environmental schemes},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {European Union (EU) nature conservation law mandates the protection of
   more than 2000 species and habitats. Many of these species and their
   habitats rely on agricultural land, which means that Member State
   imple-mentation of EU nature law necessarily interacts with national
   agricultural policies. The integration of EU biodiversity goals into
   sector-level and farm-level agricultural policies is therefore
   commonplace and, seemingly, in line with the discretion awarded to
   Member States. However, each stage of this multi-level implementation
   process brings the opportunity for goal dilution such that this may
   ultimately undermine the ambitions of the EU's nature conservation
   laws.This article adds to existing literature on multi-level
   implementation through an empirical case study of the Dutch
   implementation of binding EU nature law through an agri-environmental
   scheme. In the Dutch model, implementation takes place through national
   and provincial governmental agri-environmental policies as well as
   implementing actions of (private) agricultural collectives. Our data
   confirms that that the degree of discretion of each actor within a
   multi-level implementation setting strongly affects overall goal
   dilution and goal achieve-ment. By incorporating appropriate controls
   and monitoring at each governance level, benefits of multi-level
   implementation can be achieved while dilution and divergence are
   minimized.},

Title = {Politics of climate change and energy policy in Japan: Is green
   transformation likely?},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {While being proud of energy efficiency and experienced the nuclear
   disaster, Japan is likely to lead the world in energy transiton. On the
   contrary, it has been intransigence around deep decarbonization. Why
   does Japan not take leadership in energy transition and arrest climate
   change? What is the context for Japanese climate/energy policymaking?
   What is the context for the 2050 net-zero target, what are the
   obstacles, and which actors could assist effectively in accelerating
   this transition? This article considers what could make a difference in
   new drivers for national policy, the influence of exogenous domestic and
   international forces. It leads to the question of whether the 2050
   carbon neutrality policy goal could lead to a rapid energy
   transformation away from fossil fuels. This article presents an
   analytical framework to explain Japan's evolving climate-energy nexus,
   illuminating core variables hampering and enabling the attainment of the
   net-zero 2050 target.},

Title = {The politics of adaptiveness in agroecosystems and its role in
   transformations to sustainable food systems},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Food systems are responsible for pushing human resource use past three
   thresholds of safe planetary operating space, yet the potential of
   agroecosystems to contribute to sustainability of food systems when
   managed for multiple benefits is underexplored. This gap has led to a
   call for food systems transformation. Previous reviews have acknowledged
   that governance of food systems transformations is not well understood.
   The aim of this review is to examine the challenges to transformative
   governance of agroecosystems, and the potential to apply existing
   paradigms of adaptiveness in agroecosystems for this transformation.
   Agricultural production landscapes have been found to be a key level of
   governance for realizing sustainability transformations of food systems
   and the landscape concept has been a key paradigm for managing multiple
   social and ecological objectives at a landscape scale. An examination of
   the landscape concept using five transformative governance
   characteristics and applying the earth system governance research lenses
   illustrated two key areas for further investigation and action for
   transformative governance. The first is landscape design for continuous
   social and ecological changes and evolving understandings of
   sustainability, and the second is the allocation of landscape costs,
   rights and benefits in present and future decision-making and among
   human and non-human entities. Managing the pluralistic diversities
   inherent to agroecosystems will be a key dynamic important to governance
   and policy for food systems transformations.},

Title = {Towards earth-space governance in a multi-planetary era},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The recent surge of private enterprise-led space activities is driving
   what is dubbed the New Space revolution. SpaceX as a frontrunner is
   working towards colonizing Mars by 2050, with the goal of transforming
   humans into a multi-planetary species. These developments and the
   imaginaries they generate are reshaping the discourse on planetary
   sustainability, where celestial bodies like Mars are seen as a solution
   to the challenges facing our Earth. Yet, space and its sustainability
   remain a rather distant concern in earth system governance. In this
   Perspective, we argue that the New Space revolution necessitates a
   corresponding shift in the governance paradigm from planetary to
   multi-planetary for a more integrated approach that recognizes the
   interdependencies of Earth and space sustainability. We propose a new
   governance model, earth-space governance, aimed at promoting justice and
   integrity for all forms of life in a multi-planetary context.},

Title = {Biodiversity policy integration in five policy sectors in Germany: How
   can we transform governance to make implementation work?},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Drivers for biodiversity loss are largely regulated by policies in
   non-environmental sectors. The limited main-streaming of biodiversity
   into respective policies remains yet to be analysed. During the process
   of updating the German National Biodiversity Strategy, we conducted 33
   interviews and a stakeholder workshop to analyse barriers and levers for
   biodiversity integration in five policy sectors: agriculture, forests,
   marine \& coastal areas, business \& industries, rural \& urban
   development. Based on Biodiversity Policy Integration literature, we
   distinguish four leverage points for transformation related to
   inclusive, integrated, accountable and adaptive governance. We found
   that biodiversity inclusive narratives and innovative approaches exist
   but are over-shadowed by conflicting vested interests. Dominant sector
   policies are incoherent and continue to provide harmful subsidies.
   Institutional structures fail to reflexively respond to ambitious
   agendas and are locked into sector specific accountability hierarchies.
   Thus, transformative national planning needs to overcome institutional
   lock-ins and empower agents to develop innovative solutions.},

Title = {Fostering transparency? Analysing information disclosure in
   transnational regulatory climate initiatives},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the context of the first Paris Agreement's global stocktake,
   transnational regulatory climate initiatives hold the potential to
   catalyse states' action and boost the process' transparency. However,
   transnational initiatives' own transparency has been questioned. This
   article investigates the transparency of 56 initiatives by focusing on
   the `quantity' and `quality' of the information disclosed. The analysis
   underscores limits pertaining to both elements. To explain variation,
   the article correlates transparency with the initiatives' type of
   actors, type of regulatory activity, number of functions performed and
   size and identifies what constellations of factors better explain
   transparency and lack thereof via a Qualitative Comparative Analysis.
   Large initiatives which involve public actors and perform multiple
   functions are more strongly linked with transparency. Other factors do
   not yield significant effects. By identifying areas for improvement in
   regulatory initiatives' transparency, the article contributes to a
   better understanding of their role in the stocktake process.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mainstream climate policy discourse obscures power disparities between
   those who contribute the most to climate change and those who are hit
   the hardest, particularly in discussions regarding the appropriate
   targets for intervention, including behavioral change. We reflect and
   critique this obfuscation of power in policy debates, and as a
   corrective, we identify actors with high levels of climate
   responsibility and high capacity for mitigation and adaptation, and that
   intersect different scales of social organization. We visually map these
   overlaps to spur productive dialogue and generate new policy ideas to
   target the worst violators first and encourage action for others where
   it is rooted in what capacities they have. We include examples of how
   power disparities reflect and produce complex climate injustices,
   underscoring the importance of conceptualizing power through a
   multiscalar lens for fair and effective climate policy.},

Abstract = {As investors and financial intermediaries, private banks are
   increasingly confronted with climate change concerns. But to what extent
   do banks identify as the changemakers driving climate alignment forward?
   To advance this question, this paper analyzes the South African banking
   sector with a specific focus on Standard Bank and Nedbank as exemplary
   case studies. Relying on the concept of `climate mainstreaming', we
   critically assess the banks' annual reports and compare their
   self-portrayal with publicly available sources on the bank's business
   practices, chiefly provided by non-governmental organizations and media.
   We find that Nedbank pushes a holistic narrative of climate change as an
   inevitable business opportunity. Standard Bank, in turn, relies on a
   `narrative of balance' between climate change and other profit-oriented
   investments to safeguard its stakes in the fossil industry. In so doing,
   this paper sheds light on greenwashing practices within disclosure
   specifically and the lack of binding corporate regulation more
   generally.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Science-Based Targets (SBTs) are being developed for companies to
   contribute to global sustainability goals, including for `nature'. The
   literature has not yet explored multiple understandings of SBTs. We
   adopt an interpretive approach, using Q methodology to explore framings
   of SBTs amongst 22 scientists and practitioners engaged in SBT
   development. Results show two distinct framings: `we need science-based
   targets to help economic systems move towards global sustainability' and
   `the system itself is unsustainable and needs to change - science-based
   targets can help', with areas of agreement and disagreement. They lean
   towards reformist or radical discourse, at times weaving them together.
   What kinds of `transformation', if any, are SBTs capable of driving?
   Conceptualising SBTs as a boundary object, we suggest that
   sustainability transformations involve paradoxical tensions, including
   where actors appeal to the powerful to drive change, but this inhibits
   the most radical discourses. We conclude with potential implications for
   sustainability science and governance.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Native trees are central elements of sustainable agriculture, providing
   economic futures to rural populations while safeguarding biodiversity
   and ecosystem services. We present a diagnostic methodology for (i)
   identifying `incentive opportunities' for farmers to plant and manage
   trees on farms; (ii) proposing targeted packages of incentive and
   finance instruments; and (iii) describing levers for policy integration
   to support their imple- mentation. In two case studies from Uganda and
   Peru, the `incentive opportunities' consist of providing technical and
   financial support to farmers for planting and managing trees, generating
   income sources from native trees and support from the beneficiaries of
   tree-based ecosystem services, and eliminating incentives for tree
   removal. Many instruments to promote trees on farms already exist, but
   implementation is hampered by weak and fragmented institutions, limited
   funding and low political priority. The proposed methodology can guide
   the development of incentive instruments as part of implementing policy
   strategies for integrated biodiversity conservation and sustainable
   development.},

Title = {Climate change, security and military organizations: Changing notions in
   the Swedish armed forces},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Climate change has become a critical issue in security policy and
   military organizations are ever more involved in handling it. Yet,
   little is known about how armed forces, which often possess substantial
   resources, are hierar-chically structured and have the capacity to
   exercise force, actually account for climate change and its
   rela-tionship to security. This article addresses the research gap by
   analyzing how the Swedish Armed Forces approach climate change and
   related security issues. The article adopts a qualitative case study
   research design and an analytical framework for examining climate
   security discourses, and finds that climate change has become
   institutionalized in the Swedish Armed Forces. The Swedish Armed Forces
   conceptualizes climate change in terms of risks and vulnerabilities, and
   expects the phenomenon to become increasingly critical to its
   activities. Data for the analysis consist of official documents,
   publications and public statements by senior officials in the Swedish
   Armed Forces.},

Abstract = {Shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and shared policy assumptions
   (SPAs) are lauded as a common basis for climate scenario research across
   disciplines, yet they lack essential legal and governance elements that
   are indispensable when assessing future development pathways. This
   article sets out to address this shortcoming by explaining the
   interrelated but distinct features of law and governance and their
   downplayed roles in climate scenario research. We explore the extent to
   which legal and governance features are included in the current SSP and
   SPA development process and then suggest that the substance of legal and
   governance features in climate scenario frameworks could be enriched in
   four ways, by: 1) identifying the nuances of legal and policy
   objectives; 2) assessing the effectiveness of institutions and
   instruments; 3) integrating the assessment of the flexibility and
   adaptability of legal and governance systems into the projection of
   long-term pathways; and 4) responding to the urgent need to integrate
   climate and energy justice while still cautiously considering normative
   principles to be opportunities and challenges. We further argue that
   future climate scenario frameworks should consider law and governance at
   multiple scales and in distinct contexts to improve the usability,
   applicability, and reliability of the integrated pathways. Finally, in
   order to project future risks, this article suggests improvement
   regarding the processes, including inter-and transdisciplinary inclusion
   that can potentially be considered when furthering climate scenario
   frameworks that enhance understanding of the complex, uncertain future
   and the long-term consequences of certain decisions.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Universities are increasingly engaging with the Sustainable Development
   Goals (SDGs). Appeal for the SDGs is partly based on their double
   transformation framing: they are seen as enablers of societal
   transformations and transformations within universities. This article
   aims to understand how the SDGs influence university transformations. We
   analyse how four universities have integrated the SDGs through a
   comparative case study. We propose a framework to determine the impact
   of the SDGs in universities by identifying their scope of change (i.e.
   discursive, institutional, relational, and resource effects) and depth
   of change (i.e. accommodative, reformative or transformative). This
   study shows that discursive effects are the most prominent hinting
   toward transformative change. To lesser extents, primarily
   accommodative, the SDGs have influenced institutional, relational, and
   resource changes. Overall, findings show that for the SDGs to fulfil
   their transformative potential in universities, they should be used as
   more than communications and legitimizing tools.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},

Abstract = {Today's sustainability challenges require significant transformative
   shifts in the private sector, particularly driven by new, potentially
   also more informal, forms of governance. A variety of
   sustainability-oriented inter-mediary organisations encourage and
   support businesses to become purpose-driven to address social and
   envi-ronmental sustainability issues beyond maximising profit. We
   conduct interviews with these intermediaries to theorise how and why the
   broad concept of purpose might be used as an informal means to steer and
   transform business-society relations. We find that by invoking notions
   of systemic goal alignment and individual goal align-ment, the
   simultaneous use of two contrasting but complementary frames allows
   intermediaries to appeal to and potentially engage a variety of
   audiences in their efforts to changing businesses and the economic
   system. Our research contributes to literatures on how the framing of
   purpose in business is used as an informal governance approach for
   driving a sustainability transformation.},

Abstract = {Following the Paris Agreement, states and non-state actors have pledged
   countless commitments to mitigate climate change. Yet, translating these
   words into tangible action and institutionalizing mitigation efforts
   remains a key challenge in post-Paris climate governance. This is
   particularly prevalent in the Global South, where carbon emissions are
   expected to grow most significantly over the next decades. Besides,
   efforts to tackle the climate crisis compete with other human
   development priorities. With this review, we explore the prospects and
   chal-lenges of institutionalizing climate change mitigation in the
   Global South. We (1) map the field in terms of concepts, methods,
   regions, sectors, and topics; (2) suggest a differentiation between
   reform-oriented, trans-formative, and failed attempts to
   institutionalize climate change mitigation, and (3) propose a future
   research agenda. We conclude that a stronger emphasis on
   institutionalization as a political, societal, and discursive challenge
   is crucial for implementing, sustaining, and enhancing climate change
   mitigation in the Global South.},

Title = {How does the professionalisation of farmer collectives enable effective
   agri-environmental schemes? A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis
   of 36 Dutch farmer collectives},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Agriculture is the main land use and one of the main drivers of
   biodiversity loss. In particular, intensive farming practices have
   contributed to biodiversity loss, which is why many governments have
   implemented agrienvironmental schemes (AES). Farmer collaboration at
   landscape level is important to achieve effective AES. The Dutch
   government opted for such an approach and decided that only farmer
   collectives were entitled to take part in AES. In this paper, we
   evaluate 36 Dutch farmer collectives. Through the lens of
   professionalisation, we investigated which characteristics of
   professionalisation enable farmer collectives to work towards an
   effective AES in terms of collaboration at landscape level. We used
   spatial concentration of conservation measures as a measurement of an
   effective AES and, based on expert judgement, selected five
   characteristics of professionalisation that directly impact AES
   effectiveness. We applied a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis
   (fsQCA) in order to explore which of these characteristics singly or in
   combination contribute most to spatial concentration. We found that
   different combinations of characteristics of professionalisation enable
   farmer collectives to work towards spatial concentration. First, we
   found that working on the maintenance and development of qualifications
   of participants is for most farmer collectives important to work on more
   spatial concentration. Second, the combination of having a strategy for
   agrobiodiversity in combination with working on the qualifications of
   the field workers is important. And when the network capability or the
   presence and use of enabling systems are missing, the qualifications of
   the field workers is important. Based on our findings, we conclude that
   the qualifications of participants and fieldworkers (i.e., regional
   coordinator, ecologist and field officer) are the most important
   characteristics of professionalisation to contribute to spatial
   concentration at the moment.},

Title = {Does climate finance enhance mitigation ambitions of recipient

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {International public climate finance is an important catalyst for
   curbing growing emissions from developing countries and enabling them to
   adapt to the impacts of climate change. Developing countries consider
   the fulfillment of their Paris Agreement emission reduction pledges to
   be conditional on receiving climate finance. Prior studies have
   hypothesized that increasing financial support to developing countries
   will likely increase their climate ambitions. With the availability of
   updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and climate finance
   data, this article empirically explores this question. Using two
   empirical strategies, this article found positive but statistically
   insignificant effect of climate finance on the mitigation ambitions of
   recipient countries. This effect on mitigation ambition was higher for
   least developed countries but weaker for small island devel-oping
   states. This article's analysis should be seen as an initial piece of
   the puzzle. Findings of this article can inform climate financing
   strategies of donors enhancing trust with developing countries.},

Title = {Possibilities for mainstreaming biodiversity? Two perspectives on the
   concept of bioeconomy},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The concept of bioeconomy is increasingly gaining prominence as a
   potential pathway to reconcile conservation objectives with economic and
   social aspects. However, so far, dominant bioeconomy approaches have
   paid little attention to potential risks and negative impacts on
   biodiversity. This Perspective argues that it is crucial to integrate
   biodiversity into bioeconomy approaches. We argue that this can happen
   in two ways; by mainstreaming biodiversity into dominant bioeconomy
   approaches which have previously not considered biodiversity in much
   depth, and by giving the sustainable use of biodiversity a more central
   place in bioeconomy strategies. Generally, biodiversity can become a
   central aspect of bioeconomy strategies, but questions around
   distribution, equity, and accountability need to be carefully
   considered.},

Abstract = {The article explores the interaction between the national and
   international standards of the International Criminal Court in the
   implementation of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace, particularly in
   its determination of facts and conduct. First, some statutory
   characteristics of the SJP are analyzed. Subsequently, it is analyzed
   whether its normative framework defies international standards and
   whether its implementation is the basis for a collision of the ICC with
   Colombia, despite the closure of the preliminary examination in terms of
   reparatory sanctions, differential treatment and command responsibility.
   Finally, it analyzes Auto 019 of 2021 to demonstrate how one of the
   chambers of the SJP relies on the application of international
   jurisprudence to attribute criminal responsibility to the top leaders of
   the FARC-EP for war crimes and crimes against humanity},

Abstract = {This research seeks to show that, since the 1970s, Latin American
   countries have experienced three major periods of reduced national
   power, the last of which constitutes a new lost decade, from 2012 to the
   present. To this end, studies on the positioning of the countries of the
   region from the 1960s to the 21st century are reviewed; then, with the
   support of the World Power Index, the crises experienced in the region
   are identified. Finally, the stagnation and setbacks in the Southern
   Cone, the Andes and Mexico during the last decade are analyzed. It is
   concluded that the pandemic, despite its major negative impact, has only
   deepened an already existing medium-term trend and has prolonged the
   peripheral and semi-peripheral positioning of the region in the long
   term.},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {The criminal treatment of minors who transgress the criminal law is a
   recurring con-cern, given the increase in criminality. Justice is
   demanded regardless of whether the fundamental rights of minors are
   violated. This article studies the Adolescent Criminal Responsibility
   System in Colombia, the sanctions it contemplates, its restorative
   justice approach, although framed within criminal law. This system
   considers the deprivation of liberty sanction as a last resort for
   exceptional use, but this principle is not fully applied. At the same
   time, there is pressure to increase sentences, which may violate the
   best interests of the child. It is concluded that it is essential to
   reinforce the application of restorative justice in order to comply with
   the purposes of prevention, reparation, and social reintegration of
   minors},

Abstract = {A BsTRACT . This article analyzes two key issues in the intelligence
   services in Spain: their professional performance and the theoretical
   advance of academic character that drives the use of intelligence in
   different public and private spaces, in search of giving prestige to
   intelligence in the academy. Analyzing especially the work of the
   Spanish researcher Diaz-Matey, it is evidenced that the valuation of
   intelligence both in the public and business sectors impacts the
   functionality and legitimacy of intelligence agencies. It is concluded
   that progress must be made in the processes of democratization and
   declassification, breaking secrecy, so that intelligence permeates the
   general culture, consolidates as an academic discipline and helps to
   make better decisions in all fields.},

Title = {The Panama Canal Expansion: A Failed Game-Changer for Port Throughput of
   Transshipment Ports},
Journal = {REVISTA CIENTIFICA GENERAL JOSE MARIA CORDOVA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {41},

Abstract = {The Panama Canal has played an important role in the history of the
   shipping industry. Therefore, it was reasonable to forecast that the
   Panama Canal expansion would impact port throughput in the six
   transshipment ports located in Panama. To examine this impact, two
   periods were analyzed. The first period covered October 2010 to June
   2016. The second period covered July 2016 to March 2022. The Wilcoxon
   signed-rank test and the IBM SPSS Statistics software were used to
   analyze public data from the Central American Maritime Transport
   Commission (COCATRAM) measuring port throughput. The research concluded
   that the Panama Canal expansion has not produced a statistically
   significant impact on the port throughput of (a) cargo tonnage, (b)
   cargo TEU and (c) vessel calls},

Abstract = {This article presents two case studies on the officer training model of
   the General Military Academy in Spain and the West Point Military
   Academy in the United States. A comparative study is then carried out to
   elucidate whether they provide similar competencies to the cadets of
   each army. For this purpose, the respective curricula that define the
   competencies an officer must have, according to the needs and
   circumstances of each army, are reviewed. Participant observation is
   then added in both cases. This research concludes that both systems
   provide similar competencies, although they vary in their adaptation to
   the needs of each army. Certain areas for improvement in articulation
   and training in skills for the entire professional career are also
   identified in the Spanish case, which may motivate reforms and new
   research.},

Abstract = {This article explores the relations between Iran and Israel from their
   initial strategic alliance as non-Arab countries, thanks to cooperation
   on common interests, through the deterioration of this alliance and the
   emergence of rivalry in the context of the Cold War, to the Lebanon War
   in 2006. It aims to understand the background of this conflict, its
   strategic impacts and implications regarding the hybrid threat posed by
   the strengthening of Hezbollah as a quasi-state army with the backing of
   Iran. Despite not sharing common borders and, consequently, having no
   territorial disputes, the 2006 Lebanon War was the first war between
   Israel and Iran, and has been a determining factor in the evolution of
   hybrid threats in the region},

Abstract = {In recent years, migratory flows along the Colombia-Venezuela border
   have experienced a notable change in their dynamics and profiles. The
   expansion and consolidation of irregular economies with certain roots in
   the border area, as well as the economic and social crisis in Venezuela
   and the conflict in Colombia, have led to governance problems and
   conflicts in bilateral relations between the two countries. This article
   studies the transformation of the Colombia-Venezuela migration
   phenomenon, its implications, and risks for both countries, with
   emphasis on the use of this situation by criminal structures. It is
   concluded that the institutional actions designed to address this
   problem require great collaboration at the regional level, and even the
   participation of extra-regional actors.},

Abstract = {Competency-based training is a learning model based on a constructivist
   perspective of education. This approach is important in training
   processes, especially in the area of formative research. The present
   study was developed through the application of a survey designed ad hoc
   of perception of students who completed their training in the area of
   research. The sample (N=278) is made up of civilians and military
   personnel from postgraduate programs at the Escuela Superior de Guerra.
   It is concluded that students' competencies are essential to promote the
   generation of new knowledge. It is essential for higher education
   institutions to carry out diagnoses to identify strengths and weaknesses
   based on the students' perceptions, who are essential actors in the
   training process.},

   of an exercise under the modality of war games in the Master in
   Strategic Intelligence of the National Academy of Political and
   Strategic Studies of Chile. This methodology was used to practice and
   train the theoretical contents, using all the students, civil and
   military, from various disciplines. The main findings refer to
   individual and group attitudes and capacities, as well as analytical and
   decision-making processes. Additionally, lessons were obtained for the
   program, the game itself, and the professional performance of the
   function. Finally, evidence is exposed that this type of exercise allows
   one to achieve significant experiences in conditions similar to real
   ones and is relevant to complete an educational process in programs of
   this nature.},

Year = {2023},

Abstract = {. This article examines the legal and political theories of Habermas and
   Honneth facing the challenge of implementing an inclusive policy to
   overcome both the conflict and the structural violence generated by the
   Colombian State's failure to recognize the Nasa people. With these
   theoretical assumptions, ways are sought to achieve the implementation
   of the precautionary measures with which the IACHR has ordered the
   Colombian State to reestablish and guarantee the human rights violated
   to the Nasa people. With a qualitative methodology of documentary
   review, it is concluded that any attempt to overcome structural violence
   and implement the precautionary measures issued by the IACHR requires
   the development of a deliberative, legal process of political
   negotiation, redistribution and recognition of the socio -historical
   conditions of these communities.},

Abstract = {A BSTRACT . From the hermeneutics of suspicion, this article explores
   how the critical theory of human rights inspired the Latin American
   perspective of emancipation, which questions the conventional,
   Eurocentric universalism of human rights. A causal and
   philosophical-legal investigation is developed, based on the methodology
   of documentary analysis of bibliographic sources. The research
   identifies three key tools in Latin American thought that have
   influenced the devaluation of the imposed vision of human rights:
   emancipation ideologies, culture and literature. It shows how there have
   been various social and cultural movements that promote said
   emancipation. Finally, the research opens new lines of study on the
   viability of establishing a Latin American culture of human rights,
   challenging the Western knowledge imposed in this multicultural context.},

Abstract = {To analyze the role of the military in Colombian foreign policy, this
   article investigates the decision-making process during the ARC Caldas
   corvette crisis in the Gulf of Venezuela in 1987. For this purpose, the
   article develops a qualitative analysis focused on primary sources,
   aca-demic articles, historical archives, press analysis and interviews.
   Based on the concepts of defense diplomacy and polythink, a fragmented
   and divisive group of politicians / diplomats is evidenced by a lack of
   consensus at the table, the proposal of divergent policy prescriptions,
   and President Barco s diplomatic inclination. Regardless of the
   polythinking symptoms, the article shows the importance of the military
   in decisions that consider all possible courses of action as well as
   their consequences},

Abstract = {Amnesty is a frequently used tool in transitional processes. Colombia
   welcomed the possibility of applying amnesties within the framework of
   the peace agreement, in accordance with the restorative paradigm set
   forth in the agreement. Therefore, point five establishes the creation
   of the Comprehensive System of Truth, Justice, Reparation and
   Non-Repetition, of which the Special Jurisdiction for Peace is part,
   which, in turn, has three Justice Chambers, among which is the Chamber
   of Amnesty and Pardons, which has decision-making jurisdiction over
   these matters. To date, it has issued important decisions that represent
   an essential input to analyze the argumen-tative coherence, the limits
   of this figure and the protection of the rights of victims to justice,

Abstract = {In the mid-1990s, Mexico joined the multilateral trading system,
   strengthening its trade liberalization through a series of domestic
   foreign trade policies. This consolidated the export of finished goods
   and various raw materials, making this market one of the most important
   in Latin America. This article identifies some of these foreign trade
   policies by characterizing the diachronic behavior of exports. For this
   reason, this work, essentially descriptive, considers secondary official
   databases, both local and international. It is concluded that among the
   products that have the greatest impact on Mexico's total exports, some
   sectors stand out, such as beverages, technology, household appliances
   and automobiles, in addition to sectors such as mining and agricultural
   raw materials. All of them have notable importance compared to other
   countries.},

Abstract = {Criminal governance is a phenomenon that is difficult to measure due to
   its clandestine nature, making it equally difficult to study its
   relationship with other problems that, like drug trafficking, severely
   impact particularly vulnerable populations. This article aims to
   investigate the complex relationship between criminal governance and
   drug trafficking in Colombia, through the creation of a Departmental
   Criminal Governance Index (IDGC) and an indicator of drug trafficking
   crimes. This research is novel, as it is based on data mining techniques
   to process large volumes of information. From the definition of
   constructs, the selection of variables and the definition of indicators
   to their measurement, weighting and visualization, this work provides
   inputs for criminal policy and anti-drug policy, including
   differentiated analyzes for each department of Colombia.},

Abstract = {Reducing inequalities in income and health, within and between
   countries, is a global priority for the WHO. This study seeks to examine
   income inequality as a predictor of life expectancy in Colombia. To
   achieve this, a cross-sectional panel data model was developed using the
   DANE's Quality of Life Survey. The predictor variables of life
   expectancy were the Gini coefficient, GDP per capita and, in a novel
   way, monetary poverty, between 2012 and 2019. The results indicate that
   these variables have a significant impact on life expectancy, while no
   significant impact on social mobility was found. The findings can guide
   public policy and governmental decision-making in Colombia.},

Abstract = {The persistence and activity of illegal groups in Colombia can be
   explained through the unfeasibility of the traditional concept of the
   modern State. The objective of this article is to analyze how the
   fundamental principles of sovereignty and governance implied by the idea
   of the modern State are undermined by the endemic presence of illegal
   structures in Colombia. Through an eclectic and hybrid methodological
   approach, it is shown how shared sovereignty and criminal governance
   have been configured in the country, especially after the demobilization
   of the FARC-EP and the distraction of the national security agenda
   regarding its objectives. It is concluded that Colombia must continue on
   the path of cohesion, to consolidate its national interests and protect
   citizens.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research is to propose clusters of violent crimes
   in Colombia by departments together with a neural network structure for
   their classification and prognosis. For this purpose, it is based on the
   analysis of the clustering method, artificial intelligence and the
   definition of violent crimes. Using a quantitative explanatory method,
   the data generated by the National Police on crimes between 2018 and
   2022 was used. As a result, four clusters of crimes and violence factors
   that characterize groups of departments were established, which allowed
   identifying regions with higher and lower impact of criminal acts. A
   double-layer neural network was then proposed that achieved a
   classification and prediction capacity of 97.7\% for crimes according to
   their type and impact, which is expected to serve as a tool for crime
   prevention.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to determine the uses of artificial intelligence in
   the conduct of armed conflicts as a means, through autonomous or
   semi-autonomous weapons, and as a method, in decision-making in
   psychological military operations. Psychological military operations,
   hybrid conflicts, and the potential contribution of this technology in
   the current and future military scenarios are also taken into account.
   For this purpose, information was consulted in primary sources and the
   Delphi method was adapted to respond to six hypotheses and establish
   their influence and dependence. Among the conclusions, the contribution
   of artificial intelligence is established as an efficient tool in the
   conduct of armed conflicts, as a deterrent factor or as a factor of
   direct confrontation, and the importance of strengthening international
   law in the face of this technology.},

Title = {Network police governance to control homicide hotspots in Bogota},
Journal = {REVISTA CIENTIFICA GENERAL JOSE MARIA CORDOVA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {41},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {. The article explores the potential of networked police governance. To
   do so, it uses network analysis to design a simulated network of
   reinforcements among community policing patrols, by urban sectors or
   CAI, based on the observed network data existing in 2016. The simulation
   focuses on the 2016 homicide hotspots and it is proposed to assess

Abstract = {The objective of this document is to investigate the factors that
   determine the claims of terrorist attacks worldwide by terrorist groups
   and to stablish the probability of recurrence. To de-termine the claims,
   we used a logistic discrete choice regression model. Besides, for the
   probability of repeating an attack, we implemented a dynamic negative
   binomial stochastic model with panel data. As far as we know, this last
   topic and modeling have not been previously considered. The main results
   indicate that claims increase when there is harm caused to civilians,
   attack coercion, competition among groups and Islamic ideology; while
   the possibility of repeating an attack gets reduced with the number of
   fatal victims and human rights violations, but it increases with
   govern-ment support to terrorist groups.},

Abstract = {Sovereign immunity is an international doctrine according to which
   neither a sovereign nor a state can be sued by foreign courts. The
   United States regulates this legal figure through the Foreign Sovereign
   Immunities Act of 1976. Said regulation, however, does not define the
   sovereign immunity of heads of state. For this reason, the case of the
   United States v. Noriega is of great interest, since it was the first
   time that the courts of one country tried a head of state of another
   country. In this case, the courts made a mistake by not asking the
   executive branch for official clarification to define General Noriega's
   status as head of state. In that sense, the decision did not adhere to
   strict law and was based on political motivations.},

Title = {The Gaitanista Self-Defense Forces of Colombia as a politicized armed
   group: a new paradigm of organized crime},
Journal = {REVISTA CIENTIFICA GENERAL JOSE MARIA CORDOVA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {42},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {. Since the demobilization of the AUC and the FARC-EP, several armed
   actors have emerged in Colombia that have distanced themselves from the
   insurgency -paramilitary logic that dominated the analysis of the war in
   the country. However, some of these groups have also assumed political
   discourses that question the denomination of criminals by some political
   and academic sectors. This article seeks to go beyond these discussions
   through the politicized armed groups (GAP) category. To this end, a case
   study of the Gaitanista Self -Defense Forces of Colombia, the largest
   armed organization active in Colombia, is elaborated. The organization's
   published discourses are analyzed, in order to understand its
   politicization process, while explaining its criminal dimension.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyze the perspective of some retired officers of
   the Colombian Armed Forces in relation to the violence produced after
   the Peace Agreement with the FARCEP, signed in 2016. For this purpose,
   the most relevant points of the agreement on this issue are analyzed,
   and aspects such as the proliferation of dissidence, drug trafficking or
   the difficulties to co-opt the territory inscribed in the geography of
   violence are addressed. As a result, there is a relative feeling of
   suspicion and skepticism that, in any case, includes elements of
   self-criticism and the need for transformation. The purpose of this
   article is to contribute to the understanding of the perspective of the
   military, who offer a valuable contribution to strengthen the State's
   response in the management of the internal armed conflict.},

Abstract = {A BsTRAcT . The Territorially Focused Development Programs (PDET),
   derived from the 2016 peace agreement, seek to strengthen state
   institutions, and reduce the incidence of criminal organizations in
   areas affected by armed conflict. This article analyzes the correlation
   between resources allocated to state strengthening in municipalities
   prioritized by the PDET and criminal violence rates, through a
   statistical analysis, segmented into four corridors, during the period
   2017-2019 and 2020. The results show that only the Amazon-Guaviare
   corridor reduced violence rates as an effect of investment expenditures,
   particularly enforced disappearances. It is considered that investment
   in the PDETs does not necessarily have an impact on violence rates, as
   there are criminal governance practices in which illegal actors
   rearrange their interests in the territory and adapt to the
   institutional transformations of the post-agreement.},

Abstract = {The security and defense landscape is changing and gradually presents
   more numerous and varied challenges, which should be understood both for
   practical purposes in decision-making and for investigative purposes.
   The objective of this article is to identify the main thematic axes at a
   strategic-level affecting Colombia's security and defense. Under a
   qualitative approach, a content analysis of 62 specialized documents and
   the opinion of 67 experts was carried out, which allowed the
   identification of 25 thematic axes for Colombia's security and defense.
   Among the findings, transnational organized crime stands out as the most
   important issue, followed by political and governmental issues, and
   economic issues. This demonstrates the growing relevance of security
   factors and threats, beyond the traditional state-centric approach.},

Abstract = {With the end of the Cold War, emerging powers such as Brazil, China,
   India, Russia and Turkey have struggled to assert a voice in so-called
   global governance. As a result, the inter-national system, although
   still marked by US hegemony, seems to be changing. In fact, since the
   early 2000s, Brazil and Turkey have increased their participation in
   global governance, to the point of achieving some legitimacy as middle
   or regional powers. In order to establish the regional and global scope
   of these two emerging powers, this article addresses the questions about
   what factors account for the projection of Brazil and Turkey as middle
   powers and how their foreign policy trajectories differ.},

Abstract = {Alternative Development has been a component of the anti-drug strategy
   in Colombia. This article analyzes it in the period 2003 to 2021 in the
   departments of Nari \& ntilde;o, Putumayo and Norte de Santander, in
   order to identify successes and failures in its design and
   implementation. Using a qualitative method, interviews were conducted
   with social leaders participating in the programs that have constituted
   it (Forest Warden Families, PNIS and Col/K53). As a contribution to the
   evaluation of the anti-drug policy and Alternative Development, positive
   factors were identified as community socio-business strengthening and
   the establishment of good relations with technical assistance personnel,
   and negative factors were identified as delays in the implementation of
   productive projects and food security, and the absence of marketing
   support.},

Abstract = {Between 1910-1917, different antagonistic processes, represented in

   participation systems in Colombia, Mexico and Argentina. This article
   describes the contexts of the development of electoral systems and of
   rights and freedoms in these countries, according to two political and
   ideological positions. In this sense, the tensions of power are
   presented between a vision of a liberal State, which privileges
   individual freedoms and rights, and the perspective of the unitary and
   centralist State, which suppresses any type of expression different from

Abstract = {. This article analyzes peace as a dimension of sustainable development,
   using multivariate techniques to study the relationships between eight
   indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals, according to data
   reported by 145 countries up to the year 2021. The differences and
   similarities between countries are described, according to whether they
   belong to the global north or south, as well as by continent, in order
   to observe the relevance of forming a cluster of nations. It is
   concluded that there is great heterogeneity between countries and
   regions, and the corruption perception index is one of the indicators
   that generates the greatest differentiation. Six clusters of countries
   are also delimited by similar situations, which make it possible to
   summarize the challenges faced by countries in promoting peace, justice
   and the constitution of solid government institutions.},

Abstract = {. To analyze the role of the military in Colombian foreign policy, this
   article investigates the decision -making process during the ARC Caldas
   corvette crisis in the Gulf of Venezuela in 1987. For this purpose, the
   article develops a qualitative analysis focused on primary sources,
   academic articles, historical archives, press analysis and interviews.
   Based on the concepts of defense diplomacy and polythink, a fragmented
   and divisive group of politicians / diplomats is evidenced by a lack of
   consensus at the table, the proposal of divergent policy prescriptions,
   and President Barco<acute accent>s diplomatic inclination. Regardless of
   the polythinking symptoms, the article shows the importance of the
   military in decisions that consider all possible courses of action as
   well as their consequences.},

Abstract = {A BsTRACT . The defense of collective rights, and the appropriate
   reparation of damages to victims is a recent development issue in the
   Colombian legal system. Although some legal provisions mentioned damages
   to an indeterminate group of people in cases of negligence, it was not
   until the 1991 Constitution that Colombia established the types of
   actions all individuals or groups can initiate to advocate for the
   integrity of their rights in the face of illegal actions or omissions by
   the State. There is currently no mechanism for groups to sue private
   entities efficiently that guarantees all individual and collective
   rights, akin to class actions. This scientific article delves into the
   multifaceted landscape of collective rights protection in Colombia,
   focusing specifically on the mechanisms and implications surrounding the
   deployment of group actions.},

Abstract = {Intending to propose inter-institutional actions to involve canine teams
   in security and defense in Colombia, this article conducted a literature
   review between 2010 and 2020 to identify the multidimensional security
   model and the use of canine teams. As a result, their use in various
   tasks is evidenced, but their strategic inclusion in environmental
   protection, forensic sciences, and criminal investigation, among other
   areas, is still lacking. To this end, guidelines are proposed to advance
   in this area based on the Defense and Security Policy. It is necessary
   to strengthen the selection, training, certification, and performance
   processes to redesign protocols, standards, and functions for the use of
   canine teams in coordinated operations among various forces.},

Abstract = {In every liberal democracy, there is tension between the exercise of
   military power to sustain institutionality and civilian control of said
   power to maintain democracy. In Latin America, this tension weighs on
   civil-military relations, within the framework of military
   dictatorships, democratic transitions, and subversive threats. This
   article studies the cases of Colombia and Peru, countries with a history
   of conflict that has put their democracy at risk, and that has required
   Military Forces strong enough to face changing threats. At the same
   time, both countries have sought civilian control to guarantee
   governability and democratic legitimacy. It is found that in both
   countries there have been efforts for civilian control of the Armed
   Forces, without completely setting aside military participation through
   Integral Action in the search for peace.},

Title = {Characterization of gold mining actors in Buriticá and Bajo Cauca,
   Antioquia},
Journal = {REVISTA CIENTIFICA GENERAL JOSE MARIA CORDOVA},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Gold mining in Antioquia has not only encouraged the circulation of
   capital, but also the establishment of its own social order. This
   article characterizes the practices and interactions of the different
   actors involved in gold mining in the municipality of Buritic \& aacute;
   and the sub-region of Bajo Cauca, Antioquia, between 2016 and 2022. The
   methodology used for the development of the research was a combination
   of qualitative techniques that included field observation, more than
   seventy in-depth interviews, and consultation of multiple documentary
   sources. One of the main findings is that State agents and criminal
   groups act in collusion to collect revenues, not only from mining but
   also from other sources of State and productive financing, which has a
   negative impact on local communities},
