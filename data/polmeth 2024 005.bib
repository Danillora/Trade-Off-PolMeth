Title = {Perceptions, Reality, and Tolerance for Voting Wait Times in American
   Elections and Their Consequences for Democracy},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 25},
Abstract = {Since 2012, voters in U.S. presidential elections have faced
   increasingly long wait times, depressing turnout, and undermining public
   confidence in the vote. While past studies have quantified differing
   levels of actual wait times, voters' perceptions about these wait times,
   which could directly influence their decision to vote, remain a black
   box. Using a novel nationally representative survey of the U.S.
   population, this study measures voters' perceptions of wait times,
   actual wait times, and willingness to wait. We ask whether some groups
   of voters expect longer waits and whether some are willing to wait
   longer than others. We also examine whether Americans who expect longer
   waits are actually less likely to vote. Overall, there seems to be more
   than willing to wait at the polls: 78 percent say they would wait over
   30 minutes, while only 17 percent said they actually waited that long.
   At the individual level, women and nonwhite voters expect longer wait
   times, while lower-education voters marginally do. Women and
   less-educated voters, but not nonwhite voters, are less willing to wait
   at the polls. And the longer voters expect to wait, the less likely they
   are to vote. A voter who expects to wait 3 hours as opposed to not at
   all is 2.6 percentage points less likely to turn out. These findings
   highlight discrepancies between who expects and who is willing to wait
   through longer lines to cast their ballot. They bring with them
   important implications for policymakers.},

Abstract = {The article addresses Rar \& aacute;muri cosmogony and the causes of
   forced migration within this community. It is a descriptive essay that
   integrates ius-historical, documentary, and phenomenological techniques.
   The main arguments revolve around the threat posed by the destruction of
   the Rar \& aacute;muri traditions and natural environment, which affects
   their sense of belonging and their right to self-determination. These
   factors, exacerbated by violence and forced displacement, result in the
   migration of the communities to nonindigenous territories. The research
   highlights the need to recognize and protect the rights of this
   community to prevent their cultural and territorial disappearance.

Abstract = {The 2024 general election brought about a significant change in the
   parliamentary balance of power. There has already been much attention
   devoted to the issues that dominated the national campaign. Using
   original leaflet data from the OpenElections project, this study extends
   the focus to explore the issues emphasised in local electoral
   communications put forward by parties and candidates in their
   constituency campaigns. The article reveals that the top issues featured
   in election leaflets were health, the economy and the environment. There
   is also evidence of considerable variation across parties in terms of
   the issues emphasised, as well as in the focus of the discussion within
   issue areas and the keywords they tended to prioritise. These findings
   suggest that, while political elites recognise the need to engage with
   the key issues of the campaign, how they engage with an issue depends on
   many factors, including their own record and/or the perceived
   shortcomings of their opponent(s).},

Abstract = {This paper explores the emergence of far-right extremism within local
   political institutions in the United States. Building on theories of
   intergroup contact and group threat, I hypothesize a set of community
   socio-demographic conditions which may foster public support for
   far-right extremism, and test these using a database of county sheriffs
   who aligned themselves with the constitutional sheriff movement - a
   movement closely tied to white nationalism - between 2012 and 2022.
   Findings offer support for both contact and threat dynamics; however,
   which relationship prevails depends on a novel optimal contact
   condition, where the likelihood of a constitutional sheriff is highest
   at particular levels of demographic diversity. Additionally, results
   indicate threat dynamics sourced from economic status, but opportunities
   for positive outgroup interactions and faster demographic
   diversification appear to build resilience against extremism. Notably,
   all identified associations are driven by racial rather than
   nativity-based dynamics, which I suggest is likely due to the
   nationalization of anti-immigrant narratives inducing perceived, over
   experiential, threats. These findings have important implications for
   understanding the local dynamics of far-right extremism and the
   infiltration of fringe ideologies into political institutions.},

Abstract = {This article examines the social and economic impact of the greatly
   vaunted process of personal wealth accumulation. Recent decades have
   seen a significant surge in the level of privately owned wealth in the
   UK, other rich nations and globally. Yet this wealth boom is not
   associated with an historic boost in innovation and business performance
   or a faster rate of growth. The article examines the case for
   distinguishing between `good' and `bad' wealth. `Good' wealth derives
   from activity which contributes to the common good and wider societal
   progress, while `bad' wealth occurs when disproportionate and unmerited
   power is used to seize a larger slice of the economic pie at the expense
   of others. The evidence is that a significant proportion of growing
   wealth pools has come through appropriation and transfer, imposing
   widespread costs on society. Tackling this requires governments to adopt
   strategies to boost good and limit bad wealth accumulation.},

Abstract = {How does the media report on Senate procedure, and how does reporting
   affect the public's views of process and policy? This paper examines
   both parts of this question in the context of the Senate filibuster.
   Using new data on coverage of failed cloture motions over two decades, I
   show that news accounts typically explained these votes in generalized
   ways that obscured minority obstruction or equated the vote with simple
   defeat. These tendencies were more pronounced in television news, and
   they were more common as the ``60-vote Senate{''} became the norm. I
   then use a survey experiment to test the opinion effects of differences
   in filibuster reporting. The results provide some limited evidence that
   more detailed reporting on cloture leads to lower support for the
   underlying policy, and they show that respondents who consumed more
   detailed reporting perceived the Senate's procedure as less fair.
   Partisanship conditioned these effects, with minority-party identifiers
   becoming less supportive of the policy and majority-party identifiers
   less approving of the process. The findings demonstrate that the press
   does not consistently provide voters with a clear understanding of the
   Senate's supermajoritarian processes, and that this reporting has
   consequences for voters' judgments.},

Title = {Who wins when? Election timing and descriptive representation},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 9},
Abstract = {We examine how the timing of local elections affects the success of
   minority candidates, who remain woefully underrepresented in public
   office. We build on research showing that concurrent elections narrow
   racial gaps in voter turnout and leverage changes in the timing of local
   elections in California. Our analysis shows that filling local offices
   in November of even years increases minority officeholding, at least for
   some groups. The results demonstrate how, when, and for whom election
   timing matters. Latinos gain most, potentially at the expense of White
   and, to a lesser degree, Black representation. An investigation of
   potential mechanisms suggests that these effects depend on group
   population size and the magnitude of the turnout changes. An increase in
   the number of co-ethnic candidates running also appears to contribute to
   the representational benefits of on-cycle elections. Finally, the
   effects are most pronounced during presidential elections, when turnout
   improvements are largest.},

Title = {Are Descriptive Representatives More Successful Passing Group-Relevant
   Legislation? The Case of Native American State Legislators},

Abstract = {Descriptive representatives often sponsor legislation that advances
   their groups' policy interests, but it remains unclear how successful
   they are passing such legislation. Colleagues might defer and support
   group-relevant measures from descriptive representatives, perceiving
   them to have greater expertise and legitimate claims to address the
   issues than outgroup members. However, colleagues might also oppose
   those measures in an act of backlash against those groups (especially
   historically marginalized groups) making new claims on the political
   system. To answer the question of descriptive representative success, we
   review 3,401 pieces of legislation related to Native American issues
   introduced at the state level between 2010 and 2020. We find that
   measures related to Native affairs are no more likely to pass if
   sponsored by a Native lawmaker than if sponsored by a non-Native
   lawmaker. However, symbolic measures of Native concern are more likely
   to pass than substantive measures regardless of the identity of the
   sponsor. With more Native Americans running for office than ever before,
   our findings have important implications for considering the effects of
   increased descriptive representation in state legislatures.},

Title = {Beyond coalition and opposition? The effect of councilwide agreements on
   legislative voting behaviour in Dutch municipalities},
Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {A well-established finding in the field of legislative behaviour is that
   parliamentary voting behaviour is nearly always strongly structured by
   the coalition-opposition dynamic, even beyond the issues agreed on in
   the coalition agreement. Can parties break the mould of this
   coalition-opposition division? Several Dutch municipal councils work
   with a councilwide agreement (raadsakkoord) with the specific goal that
   there is no demarcated coalition and opposition. This could open the
   political process up for more issue-driven voting. We test whether
   council agreements change voting behaviour in the local council. By
   comparing voting in these municipalities before and after implementing
   councilwide agreements, we show that these agreements lower the extent
   to which voting is structured by the coalition-opposition division.
   Coalition parties are less likely to vote the same when a councilwide
   agreement is present. The strength of the coalition-opposition division
   depends upon the choices of political parties.
   Die Forschung zum legislativen Verhalten hat etabliert, dass das
   Abstimmungsverhalten im Parlament fast immer stark durch die Dynamik von
   Koalition und Opposition strukturiert ist, selbst \& uuml;ber die im
   Koalitionsvertrag vereinbarten Themen hinaus. K \& ouml;nnen Parteien
   diese Spaltung zwischen Koalition und Opposition durchbrechen? Mehrere
   niederl \& auml;ndische Gemeinder \& auml;te arbeiten mit einem
   Ratsabkommen (raadsakkoord) mit dem spezifischen Ziel, dass es keine
   abgegrenzte Koalition und Opposition gibt. Dies k \& ouml;nnte den
   politischen Prozess f \& uuml;r ein st \& auml;rker themenorientiertes
   Abstimmungsverhalten \& ouml;ffnen. Wir testen, ob Ratsabkommen das
   Abstimmungsverhalten im Gemeinderat ver \& auml;ndern. Durch den
   Vergleich des Abstimmungsverhaltens in diesen Gemeinden vor und nach der
   Einf \& uuml;hrung von Ratsabkommen zeigen wir, dass die Abkommen den
   Grad, zu dem der Gegensatz zwischen Koalition und Opposition das
   Abstimmungsverhalten strukturiert, verringern. Koalitionsparteien

   La recherche sur le comportement l \& eacute;gislatif montre que le vote
   parlementaire est. fortement structur \& eacute; par la dynamique
   coalition-opposition, aussi sur des questions qui ne sont pas r \&
   eacute;gl \& eacute;es dans l'accord de coalition. Les partis
   peuvent-ils briser cette division coalition-opposition? Plusieurs
   conseils municipaux n \& eacute;erlandais travaillent avec un accord du
   conseil (raadsakkoord) visant \& agrave; \& eacute;viter cette d \&
   eacute;limitation. Cela pourrait ouvrir le processus politique \&
   agrave; des votes qui sont structur \& eacute;s par les division th \&
   eacute;matiques. Nous testons si ces accords modifient le comportement
   de vote dans le conseil municipal. En comparant les votes dans ces
   municipalit \& eacute;s avant et apr \& egrave;s la mise en oe uvre des
   accords de conseil, nous montrons que ces accords r \& eacute;duisent le
   degr \& eacute; auquel le vote est. structur \& eacute; par la division
   coalition-opposition. Les partis de coalition sont moins susceptibles de
   voter de mani \& egrave;re uniforme lorsqu'un accord de conseil est. en

   choix des partis politiques.
   Una scoperta ben consolidata nel campo del comportamento legislativo \&
   egrave; che le votazioni in parlamento sono quasi sempre fortemente
   strutturate dalla dinamica coalizione-opposizione, anche oltre le
   questioni concordate nell'accordo di coalizione. I partiti possono
   rompere lo schema di questa divisione coalizione-opposizione? Diversi
   legislativi comunali nei Paesi Bassi lavorano con accordi di
   legislazione (raadsakkoord) con l'obiettivo specifico di non avere una
   coalizione e un'opposizione delineate. Questa prassi potrebbe aprire il
   processo politico a votazioni pi \& ugrave; orientate a temi specifici.
   In questo studio esaminiamo se tali accordi cambiano il comportamento di
   voto nei legislativi comunali. Confrontando le votazioni prima e dopo
   l'attuazione degli accordi legislativi, mostriamo che gli accordi
   riducono la misura in cui le votazioni sono strutturate dalla divisione
   coalizione-opposizione. I partiti di coalizione hanno meno probabilit \&
   agrave; di votare nello stesso modo quando \& egrave; presente un
   accordo legislativo. La forza della divisione coalizione-opposizione
   dipende dalle scelte dei partiti politici.},

   Heterogeneity, Disagreement, and Conflict},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 31},
Abstract = {Every complex organization is sometimes marked by preference
   heterogeneity, disagreement, and conflict. Within political parties,
   such frictions are traditionally viewed negatively, while recent
   research has started to perceive them more positively. How might such
   contradictory evaluations be explained? Through a three-step conceptual
   analysis we (1) identify two analytical perspectives on intraparty
   friction, one rooted in a primarily structural conception of parties,
   one in a primarily behavioral conception; and (2) specify a minimal
   definition of intraparty friction, which underpins a hierarchical
   concept structure to (3) suggest a way to resolve contradictions in the
   consequences attributed to intraparty frictions. Structuralist accounts
   often view frictions as negative due to a more demanding conceptual
   threshold, suggesting different types and levels of risk taking by
   conflict partners. Conversely, behavioralist perspectives see friction
   more often as beneficial because they focus on expressed disagreement
   without necessitating an organizational response. Our conceptual tools
   have important implications for research on membership organizations
   generally.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 28},
Abstract = {Scholars disagree as to whether Americans' attitudes toward local issues
   are structured ideologically and whether these are related to national
   policy ideology. We use two surveys of American adults to assess whether
   and to what extent Americans' local policy attitudes exhibit a similar
   structure as do national policy attitudes. We find that items asking
   about local policy are just as likely to reflect a latent dimension of
   policy preferences as those asking about national policy. Additionally,
   when local and national items are scaled separately, those scales are
   highly correlated. Our findings indicate that attitudes toward many
   local issues are aligned with national ideology. A smaller subset of
   attitudes about local issues appears distinctively local and possibly
   structured by non-ideological cleavages.},

Abstract = {This article reframes understandings of pluralism in democratic theory
   by showing that the management of late and post-colonial identitarian
   conflict was integral to its incorporation into twentieth-century
   political science. It does so by reconstructing the central but
   underexamined place of theories of consociational democracy in efforts
   to reform South Africa's apartheid constitution in the 1970s and S0s.
   Consociational democratic theory offered such promising resources for
   apartheid reform, it contends, because it entwined (a) a conception of
   social pluralism that redescribed apartheid's racial hierarchy as
   identitarian difference with (b) a conception of institutional pluralism
   that curtailed the most transformative possibilities of decolonization
   through universal suffrage. Recovering pluralism's colonial genealogies
   clarifies the conditions under which the recognition of identitarian
   diversity can function as a disavowal of racial domination, positioning
   democratic theory as an adjunct to projects of neo-colonial order.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the determinants of Druze voting behaviour in
   Israel, focusing on three theoretical frameworks: ideological,
   socioeconomic, and kinship theories. Analysing electoral data from 2003
   to 2022, the study examines trends in voter turnout and party
   preferences among the Druze community. Findings reveal a complex
   interplay of factors influencing Druze political choices. The
   ideological theory suggests that shifts in political ideology,
   particularly in response to legislative changes such as the 2018
   Nation-State Basic Law, impact Druze voting patterns. Conversely, the
   socioeconomic theory posits that local economic conditions, education
   levels, and population demographics shape voting behaviour. Furthermore,
   the kinship theory highlights the significance of community ties and
   descriptive representation in guiding political allegiances. Through
   statistical analysis, the study identifies kinship ties, specifically
   the inclusion of Druze candidates within political parties, as the most
   significant predictor of Druze voter support. This suggests that
   community representation holds considerable sway over Druze political
   choices, transcending the influence of ideology and socioeconomic
   factors. In conclusion, while all three theories offer valuable
   insights, the dominance of the kinship theory underscores the importance
   of identity and descriptive representation in shaping Druze electoral
   outcomes in Israel.},

Abstract = {We analyze the winner-loser gap in affective polarization. Using data
   from 37 countries over years 1996 - 2016 from the Comparative Study of
   Electoral Systems (CSES), we find that winners' affective polarization
   is significantly greater than losers', and the difference is due to
   winners' consistently higher in-party favoritism. These findings are
   robust when controlling for partisanship and ideological distance to
   winning party. Although much of the literature focuses on the impact of
   out-party dislike on affective polarization, our results align with
   research in social identity theory indicating that intergroup
   discrimination is driven primarily by in-group favoritism rather than
   out-group dislike. Given that winners are more likely than losers to
   support their favored party's violation of democratic norms, our work
   suggests that in-party favoritism is an important but overlooked
   contributor to problematic implications of affective polarization.},

Title = {Performativity and political organization after the squares: rethinking
   horizontality and verticality},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 13},
Abstract = {This paper explores the role of performativity in political
   organization, especially in relation to horizontality and verticality.
   Taking its cues from the heightened interest in horizontal and vertical
   organization following the post-2010 movements of the squares and new
   forms of party politics that have emerged in their wake, the paper draws
   on Michael Saward's and Judith Butler's accounts of the performativity
   of representation and assembly, respectively, to develop an original
   synthesis of a discursive-organizational approach based on Laclau's and
   Mouffe's discourse theory with an understanding of the role of
   performativity in horizontal and vertical forms of party organization.
   Following initial considerations on performativity as a category that
   tends to be implicitly assumed but under-theorized in theoretical
   perspectives on post-squares organization (e.g. Chantal Mouffe and
   Rodrigo Nunes), the paper presents readings of Saward's and Butler's
   understandings of performativity, which are then linked to existing and
   ongoing work on movement parties and Volksparteien of a new type (VNTs)
   as prototypical types of horizontal and vertical party organization. In
   this vein, the paper develops an integrated framework of
   Discursive-Organizational Analysis (DOA) that combines post-foundational
   discourse analysis (PDA) with performativity theory and serves as a
   bridge between the semantic and pragmatic aspects of discourse.},

Abstract = {At the same time as support for LGB rights and tolerance of
   homosexuality has increased among western democracies, there has also
   been a strong backlash. How can these two trends be reconciled? This
   article answers that question by considering the distribution of public
   opinion over LGB rights in Switzerland. Using a novel method, this
   article shows how Swiss citizens have become more polarized over LGB
   rights, not between those who favor and those who oppose but between
   those who strongly favor and the ambivalent. Some people on the right
   are also increasingly divided amongst themselves. The key driver is the
   growing impact party identity has on people's social attitudes like
   acceptance of pro-LGB policies. Results from Switzerland suggest we will
   find increased polarization in other democracies where the cultural
   political spectrum has become salient.},

Journal = {DEMOCRACY \& SECURITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {21},

Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {The ``national security state{''} concept traditionally examines the
   interplay between security imperatives and democratic governance in the
   United States. While research has expanded it, further refinement is
   needed. This paper advocates for its universal relevance to democracies,
   shedding light on political reorganization driven by national security
   objectives. A qualitative analysis of prior studies reveals six core
   attributes of the concept, enhanced to formulate a robust definition
   that embodies its theoretical and analytical complexities in the
   disciplinary history of security studies. The resulting framework is
   instrumental in exploring how states balance the quest for security with
   democratic principles.},

Title = {Introducing the comparative semi-presidential database (CSPD)},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 10},
Abstract = {In this article, we introduce a new dataset-the Comparative
   Semi-Presidential Database (CSPD)-covering classifications of
   semi-presidential regimes. In contrast to other databases, the CSPD
   offers several classifications based on different definitions of
   semi-presidential regimes along with subtypes of semi-presidential
   regimes. We use definitions developed by Elgie (in: Elgie (ed)
   Semi-presidentialism in Europe, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1999),
   Cheibub et al. (Public Choice 143:67-101, 2010), Shugart (French
   Politics 3(3):323-351, 2005) and Shugart and Carey (Presidents and
   assemblies: constitutional design and electoral dynamics, Cambridge
   University Press, New York, 1992). Additionally, we present a modified
   definition of semi-presidential regimes based on the conceptual
   discussion in the field. The database covers all independent states from
   1900 to 2021. Using empirical analyses, we compare the classifications,
   the importance of conceptualisation and presenting our measurement for
   semi-presidential regimes.},

Title = {The anatomy of populist communication during COVID-19},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 9},
Abstract = {Times of crisis have been argued to function as a springboard for
   populist communication. But what about a crisis that triggers a
   rally-around-the-flag effect, which causes a period of consensus-seeking
   politics and increased trust in institutions and experts? The study
   delves into the impact of the rally-around-the-flag effect triggered by
   the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of populist
   communication in Finland. The findings reveal a notable and temporal
   decrease in populist communication across party lines and various topics
   during the initial year of the pandemic. The study provides novel
   empirical insights into the anatomy of populist communication during the
   pandemic's initial year, highlighting that a crisis not only serves as a
   window of opportunity for populism but can also act as a deactivator of
   such communication.},

Title = {The Postwar Fight Against Fascism: Auschwitz Memory in Leftist Activism},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 8},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on the memory activism of three survivors of the
   Auschwitz resistance and explores the ways in which they linked fascism
   and genocide to economic exploitation. By doing so, our paper excavates
   a leftist-antifascist paradigm of postwar memory that waned with the
   advent of contemporary Holocaust culture. We analyse the memoirs of Oszk
   \& aacute;r Betlen, Bruno Baum, and Hermann Langbein, members of the
   international communist movement before, during, and after the Second
   World War. For these authors, calls to remember Auschwitz were
   inseparable from a struggle for social change in the present, and their
   memory practice was never restricted to writing. Therefore, our paper
   places their memoirs into the wider context of their
   political-organizational work, and shows that their efforts to
   commemorate Auschwitz responded to some pressing issues of their time,
   including the re-militarization and NATO-membership of the Federal
   Republic, reparations, amnesty and reintegration of former Nazis, and
   war crimes trials. Importantly, all these issues were intertwined with
   what they regarded as capitalist restoration and a looming resurgence of
   fascism. Our paper argues that the so-called economic case was central
   to their postwar campaigning because they believed that economic
   exploitation was central to fascism and had wide-ranging implications
   for postwar societies as well. Furthermore, we challenge the prevailing
   view on antifascism by demonstrating that for these authors the economic
   aspect of fascism did not eclipse the genocidal character of fascism and
   the specifically Jewish experience of it. In contrast to some Marxist
   historians, they did not see genocidal policies as merely derivative or
   secondary either. Rather, these leftist-antifascists commemorated
   Auschwitz in ways which regarded economic exploitation and genocide as
   interrelated and constitutive aspects of fascism.},

Abstract = {Online abuse is becoming an increasingly pressing issue for democratic
   societies. Citizens play an important role in curtailing abuse as they
   often moderate online content through counter speech and by reporting
   abusive messages. However, we know little about when citizens actually
   perceive negative comments directed at politicians as being abusive, and
   the factors shaping these perceptions are also understudied. In this
   study, we therefore investigate how citizens perceive criticism,
   insults, threats and sexist remarks directed at politicians on social
   media. Based on a survey experiment with 2,000 Danish citizens, we show
   that citizens' assessments of the abusiveness of such remarks are not
   only affected by the content of the messages, but also by political
   ideology, political trust and gender. Surprisingly, partisanship does
   not seem to substantively affect perceptions of abuse. Our study
   provides novel insights into what exactly citizens consider to be
   abusive behaviour on social media.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY},

Month = {2024 OCT 2},
Abstract = {Engaging with the significant increase in (post-)apocalyptic stories and
   representations in science fiction, this contribution aims at showing
   why a critical reconsideration of this type of cultural expression is
   essential to deal with this apparent pessimism and how its contents may
   be productive for future-oriented social and political thought. The
   reflexive resources present in these fictions are often overlooked for
   critical uses. To bring them to light, using a primarily literary and
   cinematic corpus, the analysis will first identify the predominant
   visions that are presented and characterize the symbolic contents they
   assemble. By reflecting on the forms of sense-making that are conveyed,
   it will then distinguish the functions they can perform. Finally, by
   considering that maintaining the powers to act is what is important in
   these (post-)apocalyptic situations, the argument will lead to an
   analysis of how these powers to act are deployed and the reactions and
   actions that may be thus inspired for an era of ecological crisis.},

Abstract = {This article argues that instituting Citizen Boards of Governance (CBGs)
   is the optimal strategy to democratically contain Big Tech's algorithmic
   powers in the digital public sphere. CBGs are bodies of randomly
   selected citizens that are authorized to govern the algorithmic
   infrastructure of Big Tech platforms. The main advantage of CBGs is to
   tackle the concentrated powers of private tech corporations without
   giving too much power to governments. I show why this is a better
   approach than ordinary state regulation or relying on market mechanisms.
   My proposal follows from the critique of Big Tech's concentrated powers
   and explains how this justifies democratizing algorithms in the digital
   public sphere. My approach thus speaks to a core commitment in
   democratic theory: enhancing the autonomy of the public sphere from the
   centers of powers in modern societies, be it corporations or
   governments.},

Abstract = {Carl Schmitt's influence on many Spanish professors is well known. In
   particular, the Schmittian influence on the generation that suffered the
   Spanish Civil War and continued their academic careers in post-war is
   enormous. In this paper, we trace Schmitt's influence on Manuel Garc \&
   iacute;a-Pelayo's thinking. The topic is very wide. For this reason, we
   can't exhaust the subject. Therefore, we restrict our analysis to some
   of Schmitt's important ideas and concepts which the first president of
   the Spanish Constitutional Court has integrated into his thinking. In
   addition to theoretical coincidences, Garc \& iacute;a-Pelayo shared a
   long friendship with Carl Schmitt from 1936 to 1985. Examples of this
   friendship are some of the unpublished letters reproduced in this text.},

Abstract = {The paper analyses the meaning of plebiscitary democracy in Max Weber's
   work from the two dimensions from which he approaches it: 1) as the
   phenomenon of the transformation of political parties into bureaucratic
   and centralised organisations, and 2) as a type of power within his
   power typology-a type of combined charismatic and legal power. The
   carried out reconstruction of the concept is built on passages in the
   works not usually taken into account, leading to critical conclusions
   with the classical interpretation of the established concept by Wolfgang
   Mommsen.},

Journal = {NATIONAL IDENTITIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {This paper foregrounds Khair's two novels, The Bus Stopped and Filming:
   A Love Story, examining the concepts of home, representation,
   (dis)locations and its non-belongingness, focusing on the discourses of
   Indian nationalism and national identity. There is a massive gap between
   the living styles of rural and urban people in India. How people live in
   a country is vital to a modern nation and its nationalism. Khair says,
   `houses do not make homes' because the concept of home varies according
   to the socio-economic conditions. Many poor people in India do not have
   a permanent home and constantly migrate from one place to another. They
   mostly make a temporary one-night stand for home, but unfortunately,
   their journey becomes a permanent home. That makes their existence
   neither inside nor outside society, creating a different kind of third
   space, but far more precarious than Bhabha's notion of a third space. In
   Khair's novels, the concept of third space is far less empowering than
   Bhabha's notion of third space in postcolonial studies. Khair also shows
   that home is an illusion, not a permanent place that constantly changes
   like a dream and never gets concretised.},

Abstract = {For decades a narrative has dominated interpretations of American
   politics. Democrats formed the New Deal coalition by attracting northern
   white working-class voters in the 1930s. Then beginning in the 1960s the
   party became too liberal, lost the support of the white working class,
   and they began moving to the Republican Party. The purpose of this
   analysis is to assess and question the accuracy of this narrative. Just
   how much support did Democrats have from white working-class voters by
   the 1950s. Was there a decline in the 1960s or 1980 with Ronald Reagan?
   The evidence suggests there are significant problems with the narrative,
   and we need to reconsider what shapes white working-class political
   support.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a theory of societalized politics to investigate
   crisis events in the German civil sphere between 2015 and 2024, and to
   proffer an answer to the disputed question of the preconditions that
   facilitated the rapid rise of right-wing populism in the German context.
   Drawing on civil sphere and societalization theory, the article
   specifies the foundational cultural elements, or binary cultural codes
   (BCCs), upon which German political elites crafted meso-level narratives
   to contest and manage strains in the civil sphere. Through an analysis
   of communicative and regulative institutions' responses to the arrival
   of refugees in 2015, and the publication of the Correctiv.org report and
   the backlash protests it inspired in 2024, the article charts the rise
   of the far-right party Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD), and explains
   its success as due in part to its leaders' capacities to represent
   themselves and their supporters as embodying the BCC's civil democratic
   signifiers. Introducing a theory of societalized politics, the analysis
   demonstrates a processual approach to the construction and contesting of
   crisis events that emerge within the civil sphere itself. The article
   also introduces a civil sphere theory of right-wing populism, which
   frames the phenomenon as the elevation of nativist, primordial
   signifiers born foremost of the noncivil spheres of ethnicity and
   religion. It concludes by arguing that while the German civil sphere is
   in flux, the post-Potsdam civil protests indicate a significant portion
   of the nation's publics remain committed to universalistic, civil
   democratic principles.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, illicit finance has evolved from being considered an
   adjunct to other security threats, such as organised crime or terrorism,
   to a security threat in its own right. For an issue to join the security
   discourse, the case for its relevance and urgency needs to be made by
   policymakers and accepted by a target audience. For illicit finance, the
   securitisation process is ongoing, primarily prompted by Russia's
   full-scale invasion of Ukraine. When done properly, securitising a
   threat ensures that action to tackle it is taken expeditiously. When
   poorly implemented, it can become an extreme version of politicisation
   that leads to unintended consequences. Therefore, it is crucial that the
   inclusion of illicit finance in the security dialogue is grounded in
   sound and logical reasoning. Maria Nizzero explores the evolution of
   illicit finance from domestic policy issue to security threat and how it
   is brought into the national security discourse in the UK.},

Abstract = {There is widespread concern that academic freedom is threatened by
   growing demands for intellectual conformity and attempted censorship
   from intolerant zealots. Student protests over the Israeli-Hamas
   conflict have intensified fierce debates about freedom of expression on
   campuses. This study seeks to understand the nature and scope of
   contemporary threats to academic freedom of expression worldwide,
   especially the role of self-censorship in this process. The first part
   unpacks the notion of a `cancel culture' in academia. The research
   explores processes of self-censorship where scholars are unwilling to
   express their authentic views in public. Mechanisms theorized as
   potentially driving these processes include heterodox status (cultural
   minorities out of step with orthodox views); institutions
   (constitutional principles, laws, and regulations used by the
   authorities to govern academic speech); culture (attitudes towards free
   speech); and academic status (inequalities in academic power and
   security linked with gender and age). To examine these mechanisms, the
   second part sets out the research design. It draws upon survey data from
   the second World of Political Science survey (WPS-2023), monitoring the
   background and attitudes of almost 2000 political scientists living and
   working in around 100 countries worldwide. The third part analyzes the
   results, confirming the reluctance of heterodox scholars to challenge
   majority views. The conclusion in the fourth part summarizes the
   findings, considers their broader implications, and discusses the next
   steps in the research agenda.},

Abstract = {Are legislators ideologically close to their co-partisans? And, when
   not, what policies drive the lack of party unity? To address these
   questions, we propose two measures of intra-party ideological cohesion:
   dissonance and frustration. Based on a survey of legislators across 18
   Latin American countries, we show that half of the region's
   representatives self-identify as substantially far from the mean of
   their parties (dissonance) and almost 40\% perceive large differences
   (frustration). Relying on a series of statistical tests, we find that
   these patterns are distinct for left-wing and right-wing legislators.
   The right is more dissonant than frustrated, and they are also more
   dissonant than the left. In terms of policy, we show that moral issues
   drive dissonance and frustration on both sides of the ideological
   spectrum, but disagreements on economic topics are more correlated with
   ideological distance for the left than the right. In presenting new
   measurements of intra-party disagreements, our paper proposes new
   pathways for the study of party cohesion.},

Title = {Caring breadwinners? A comparative analysis of parental leave policies
   to promote fathers' care work},

Abstract = {The question which policy measures facilitate greater paternal
   participation in childcare and promote the universal caregiver model (as
   opposed to the universal breadwinner model) remains a prominent topic of
   debate. Determining the extent to which states implement such policies
   is equally crucial. This paper analyzes which policies differentiate
   these two family models and foster the paternal shift from breadwinning
   to caregiving. To this end, an analytical grid is developed to identify
   a parental leave policy that is genuinely egalitarian in design. Two
   newly created indices within this grid distinguish between the
   egalitarian policy potential and a traditional uptake of leave. The
   analysis grid is then empirically tested on twenty countries. This
   qualitative, case-specific assessment approach identifies examples of
   egalitarianism-enhancing policies. However, as the differences between
   the two indices suggest, the flexibility in leave take-up between
   parents leaves the potential of these policies largely untapped.
   Die Frage, welche politischen Massnahmen eine st \& auml;rkere
   Beteiligung von V \& auml;tern an der Kinderbetreuung und damit das
   universelle Betreuungsmodell (im Gegensatz zum universellen Ern \&
   auml;hrermodell) beg \& uuml;nstigen, bleibt ein wichtiges
   Diskussionsthema. Dar \& uuml;ber hinaus ist es von entscheidender
   Bedeutung zu ermitteln, inwieweit Staaten diese Massnahmen umsetzen. In
   diesem Beitrag soll untersucht werden, welche politischen Massnahmen den
   Wechsel des Vaters vom Ern \& auml;hrer zum Betreuer unterst \&
   uuml;tzen. Zu diesem Zweck wird ein Analyseraster entwickelt, um eine
   wirklich egalit \& auml;r gestaltete Elternzeit-Policy zu
   identifizieren. Zwei neu geschaffene Indizes innerhalb dieses Rasters
   unterscheiden zwischen dem egalit \& auml;ren Policypotenzial und einer
   traditionellen Inanspruchnahme der Elternzeit. Das Analyseraster wird
   anschliessend an zwanzig L \& auml;ndern empirisch getestet. Mit diesem
   qualitativen, fallspezifischen Bewertungsansatz werden Beispiele f \&
   uuml;r egalit \& auml;tsf \& ouml;rdernde Politiken identifiziert. Wie
   die Unterschiede zwischen den beiden Indizes zeigen, l \& auml;sst die
   Flexibilit \& auml;t bei der Inanspruchnahme von Elternzeit das
   Potenzial dieser Massnahmen jedoch weitgehend ungenutzt.

   La questione di quali misure politiche facilitino una maggiore
   partecipazione dei padri alla cura dei figli e promuovano il modello
   universale di ``caregiver{''} (in contrapposizione al modello universale
   di ``breadwinner{''}) rimane un tema importante. Altrettanto cruciale \&
   egrave; capire in quale misura gli Stati attuano tali politiche. Questo
   studio analizza le politiche che differenziano questi due modelli
   familiari e favoriscono il passaggio dall'uno all'altro. A tal fine,
   viene sviluppata una griglia analitica per identificare una politica di
   congedo parentale che sia realmente egualitaria. Due nuovi indici
   all'interno di questa griglia distinguono tra il potenziale della
   politica egualitaria e il tradizionale utilizzo del congedo. La griglia
   di analisi \& egrave; testata empiricamente su venti Paesi. Questo
   approccio di valutazione qualitativo e specifico per ogni caso
   identifica esempi di politiche che favoriscono l'egualitarismo.
   Tuttavia, come suggeriscono le differenze tra i due indici, la
   flessibilit \& agrave; nella fruizione dei congedi da parte dei genitori
   lascia il potenziale di queste politiche in gran parte inutilizzato.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between exposure to conspiracy
   theories and radicalization, focusing on conspiracy theories from QAnon
   and Russian propaganda. Through an experimental design, 1736 US-based
   participants were exposed to four conspiracy theories either before or
   after answering questions about their activist intentions and radical
   intentions. The results indicate that exposure to conspiratorial
   narratives led to a significant increase in radical intentions but a
   non-significant decrease in activist intentions. This finding supports
   existing literature linking conspiracy beliefs to non-normative
   behavior, suggesting a causal relationship between exposure to
   conspiracy theories and intentions for illegal and violent political
   action. Additionally, results show that individuals who already held
   beliefs in the narratives exhibited higher radical intentions after
   exposure compared to non-believers. This supports theories suggesting
   that conspiratorial narratives play an important role in radicalization,
   particularly when combined with other radicalizing factors. Discussion
   focuses on possible long-term radicalization effects of conspiratorial
   narratives as well as on the ethical considerations stemming from our
   findings.},

Abstract = {This article begins by reflecting on `crisis and democracy' as a
   normative fiction that sustains extant self-other-world relations. An
   alternative is to frame the present as `the time of emergency', which
   implies scope for `emergent' possibilities. In teasing out such
   possibilities, the article makes a case for critical fiction as a way of
   radicalising our relationship to the present, looking initially to
   Foucault's writings on critique before turning to the work of da Silva,
   who reads the present through the lens of a past that is not past,
   thereby troubling a future that need not come to pass.},

Abstract = {What explains that programmatic parties may combine their policy offers
   with clientelistic dispensation? Prevailing knowledge suggests that
   parties top-down diversify linkages, targeting their program at
   wealthier voters while providing particularistic inducements to poorer
   ones. Yet, these frameworks fail to explain the variety of strategies
   used by politicians to link voters within the municipal context, where
   voters' socioeconomic status and electoral competition are less likely
   to vary. I argue that programmatic parties may engage in clientelism at
   the municipal level when they receive bottom-up demands. Leveraging
   evidence from 97 in-depth interviews conducted during multiyear
   fieldwork in three Chilean municipalities, this article shows why and
   how programmatic parties outsource the cost of clientelism to
   neighbourhood associations in exchange for targeted distribution to
   solve the groups' demands. By showing that clientelism in
   programmatic-oriented settings is demand-driven, the article draws
   attention to territorially-rooted local groups as key actors that help
   to explain the variety of strategies parties use to link with voters.},

Abstract = {Many large cities after the success of opposition in local elections are
   becoming `democratic enclaves' in the de-democratising countries. It is
   worth posing a question about the effectiveness of this role in the face
   of further autocratisation at the national level. It requires
   investigating if taking over the power by these democratic forces as
   well as characteristics of major cities, favourable in many aspects for
   democratisation (they have often a `democratic potential') enable the
   cities to play a role of effective democratisers. The author of this
   paper takes this task and analyses the cases of Warsaw and Istanbul. He
   verifies the hypothesis that the combination of long-term democratic
   deficits, including the local level, impact of the de-democratisation
   present at the national level and the current centralisation or
   re-centralisation process undermines the role of both cities as
   democratic enclaves.},

Abstract = {The relationship between varied religious landscape and conspiracy
   theories has not received specific attention in contemporary
   scholarship. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing the articulation
   of radical voices, conspiracy theories, and arguments opposing religious
   plurality. The article focuses on the discursive practices of far-right
   representatives in debates about religious plurality in Poland. I
   analyze radical right-wing arguments on YouTube and how users within the
   Polish context have responded. On the one hand, users in Poland who
   oppose religious plurality are narrowing their Christian values to
   traditional Catholicism and propagating conspiracy theories about
   interreligious dialogue. On the other hand, the people accused of being
   the founders of great conspiracies are not physically present; only
   their image is being constructed. Such a conclusion leads to a clearer
   understanding of Poland's far-right movements, which shape their
   identities through religious norms (arguments) and religious chauvinism
   (context of exclusivism that improves the quality of argumentation) to
   an imagined ``Other.{''}},

Abstract = {Japan is charting a new path to its defence policy through internal and
   external balancing in a tense strategic environment defined by
   uncertainties. While external balancing refers to building wider
   networks of partners beyond its key security ally, the United States,
   internal balancing includes establishing new laws and policy reforms and
   building favourable public opinion. This essay argues that Japan is on
   the cusp of transformative changes in its defence roadmap, which nations
   around the Indo-Pacific and beyond will be watching carefully.},

Abstract = {The paper addresses the role of Czech public service television in a
   polarized society. The research on public service media (PSM) is salient
   concerning their specific role; however, it is increasingly questioned
   in a fragmented and polarized environment. The paper builds on data from
   27 semi-structured interviews and a survey conducted in 2019-2020 (N =
   3,251). While for some audiences, Czech television is a trustworthy
   medium protecting exemplary sets of values, for others, it is biased and
   hostile. The study reveals the deeper interplay between political
   attitudes and media practices, potentially endangering PSM's role and
   position in polarized settings.},

Journal = {DEMOCRATIZATION},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {A growing body of research shows that although populists draw on mass
   support to weaken executive constraints, they rarely transition to
   personalist autocracy. This raises the question of how and why only a
   few populist leaders have been able to leverage mass support to
   establish personal authoritarian rule? Whereas previous studies have
   addressed this in terms of deep social and economic crises or the
   durability of formal and informal democratic institutions, we focus on
   the agency of populist leaders themselves. Specifically, we theorize
   that more experienced leaders are better able to capture state
   institutions and ultimately establish authoritarian rule, particularly
   if they inherit more malleable institutions at entry into office. We
   present a newly enlarged dataset of populist rule, which confirms that
   the transition to full dictatorship is rare. We find that political
   experience has a robust positive association with full democratic
   reversals, while controlling for other factors. Moreover, this
   relationship is pronounced in contexts where institutional regulations
   are less rigid. However, we find little evidence of an independent
   effect of a priori institutional weakness on democratic survival. Our
   findings have implications for the literatures on populism, democratic
   backsliding, and political leadership.},

Abstract = {Research has shown a persistent gender gap in political self-efficacy
   across most Western countries. Nevertheless, the regularity in these
   findings masks the diversity in the measures used to capture this
   construct and little reflection has been undertaken on the extent that
   changing the measures has on the size and the direction of the gender
   gap. This article tests on students aged 14 in 38 countries using the
   IEA International Civic and Citizenship Education Study, the extent that
   self-efficacy in the domain of politics is a unidimensional measure and
   if different gender gaps can be found between self-efficacy measures
   capturing partisan politics compared to broader citizenship
   self-efficacy measures. The findings show that it is only partisan
   political self-efficacy measures where there is a significant gender gap
   and where girls are disadvantaged. This is the case for 37 out of 38
   countries and robust when controlling for different levels of political
   knowledge. When a broader measure of citizenship self-efficacy is used,
   there are much less gender differences, and when there is a significant
   difference, girls outperform boys in 14 out of 38 countries. These
   contrary findings are similar in the same study when comparing the
   measures on interest in politics and interest in social issues.},

Abstract = {Vigilante violence, often targeting religious and sectarian minorities
   and preceded by unsubstantiated rumors, has taken the lives of many
   citizens in India and Pakistan in recent years. Despite its horrific
   nature, such vigilantism receives popular support. Can reducing the
   credibility of rumors via corrections decrease support for vigilantism?
   To answer this question, we field simultaneous, in-person experiments in
   Punjab, Pakistan, and Uttar Pradesh, India, regions where anti-minority
   vigilantism has been preceded by misinformation. We find that correcting
   rumors reduces support for vigilantism and increases the desire to hold
   vigilantes accountable. This effect is not attenuated by prior distrust
   toward out-groups. By contrast, information about state and elite
   behavior does not always shape attitudes toward vigilantism. These
   findings provide evidence that support for vigilantism can be reduced
   through the dissemination of credible information, even in polarized
   settings.},

Abstract = {Social scientists often classify text documents to use the resulting
   labels as an outcome or a predictor in empirical research. Automated
   text classification has become a standard tool since it requires less
   human coding. However, scholars still need many human-labeled documents
   for training. To reduce labeling costs, we propose a new algorithm for
   text classification that combines a probabilistic model with active
   learning. The probabilistic model uses both labeled and unlabeled data,
   and active learning concentrates labeling efforts on difficult documents
   to classify. Our validation study shows that with few labeled data, the
   classification performance of our algorithm is comparable to
   state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost. We
   replicate the results of two published articles with only a small
   fraction of the original labeled data used in those studies and provide
   open-source software to implement our method.},

Abstract = {With some recent exceptions, demands for global reparations have largely
   been ignored by former colonial countries. While the past two decades
   has seen renewed interest in colonial reparations in normative political
   theory and philosophy, this work has focused on determining
   responsibility for redress. By contrast, relatively little has been said
   on the further question of how redress might be sought in face of
   persistent colonial amnesia and apologia. This paper defends
   expropriation-unilateral public takeovers of ownership and/or control of
   foreign assets-as a justified response to overdue colonial reparations.
   In making this case, the paper (1) moves our focus beyond questions of
   responsibility for reparative justice to consider what victims of past
   injustice (and/or their descendants) are justified in doing to obtain
   their due and (2) explores distinctive issues that arise for political
   resistance at the global level.},

Abstract = {Much scholarly attention has focused on partisan affective polarization,
   a growing animosity between Democrats and Republicans in the mass
   public. Less notice has been given to affective polarization among the
   ideological teams, liberals, and conservatives. Yet, we suggest that
   given ideology's particular influence in U.S. politics, ideological
   affective polarization has important and distinct consequences. We begin
   by offering evidence that ideological affective polarization both exists
   and has increased sharply in recent years. We theorize that this shift
   alters the way individuals come to form attachments to ideological
   identities, as well as the structure and tenor of ideology in the United
   States.},

Abstract = {Education is perhaps the most generally used independent variable in the
   fields of public opinion and vote choice. Yet the extent to which a
   person is educated is just one way in which education may affect
   political beliefs and behavior. In this article, we suggest that the
   substantive field of education has an independent and important role to
   play over and above level. Using cross-national evidence for 15 European
   countries we find that a person's field of education is robustly
   significant and substantively strong in predicting voting for GAL and
   TAN parties that have transformed European party systems. Analysis of
   panel data suggests that the effect of educational field results from
   self-selection, a direct effect during education, and a post-education
   effect in occupation.},

Abstract = {Brown v. Board of Education marked the beginning of a long era in
   American politics in which courts, litigation and legal rights were
   associated with progressive causes. That association, however, is now
   eroding. The left's discontent with the Supreme Court is well known, but
   less attention has been paid to liberal concerns about judicial
   policymaking - including some of the very mechanisms honed by liberals
   in the Brown era - that go well beyond the Court. The Brown era obscured
   a simple truth about lawsuits that the next few years are likely to
   clarify: They are much better at gumming things up than they are at
   making things work. Policymaking through litigation, though associated
   with liberals in the Brown era, in fact reflects a deep distrust of
   centralized governance. Given that it is conservatives, not liberals,
   who are more often interested in constraining government, this makes
   lawsuits ordinarily a more congenial policy tool for Republicans than
   Democrats. For many elements of the Democratic agenda of the next few
   years, litigation is likely to prove a clumsy tool, more effective in
   the hands of opponents than proponents.},

Title = {Generational differences in economic perceptions},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {91},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Historical institutionalists have long argued that major events can
   shape long-term economic perceptions, but the identification of
   birth-cohort differences has been stymied by methodological
   difficulties, notably the APC problem. Taking advantage of unique
   Japanese data and tailored Bayesian modeling, we identify cohort effects
   in economic perceptions and show that they follow objective
   macroeconomic trends countercyclically. . Cohorts whose formative ages
   (16-20) overlap with high GDP growth have more pessimistic views about
   the current and future economy, even in later years. We argue that a
   strong economy during one's youth raises baseline expectations and makes
   later, weaker growth appear disappointing. We further find partisan
   differences in cohort effects, particularly on prospective economic
   expectations, with greater pessimism among independents and supporters
   of opposition parties.},

Abstract = {Abortion was decriminalised in Northern Ireland in October 2019. This
   historic change was introduced by the UK Parliament following lengthy
   activist campaigns, national and international inquiries, and regional
   and national court cases. This paper focuses on two legislatures, the
   Northern Ireland Assembly, and the UK Parliament, examining the role
   played by each in how decriminalisation was achieved. Tracing efforts
   dating back to the introduction of the Northern Ireland Assembly in
   1998, the analysis charts how the often-hostile approach to reform
   changed, prior to, and following, decriminalisation. In contrast, the UK
   Parliament's treatment of the abortion issue in Northern Ireland over
   the same period veered from ignorance to apathy to engagement. The paper
   examines the external and internal influences in each legislature,
   illustrating the different discourses within each. In the Northern
   Ireland Assembly, we trace how the debate on abortion was shaped around
   the question of abortion, whereas in the UK Parliament, the issue of
   devolution dominated. This paper offers a unique comparative analysis
   from the position of involved campaigners, of the multi-jurisdictional
   efforts to bring about historic legal change which moved Northern
   Ireland from having one of the most restricted legal frameworks globally
   on abortion to one of the most liberal.},

Abstract = {Most research investigates why the public embraces conspiracy theories,
   but few studies empirically examine how Americans evaluate the
   politicians who do. We argued that politicians portrayed as supporting
   QAnon would garner negative mainstream media attention, but this
   coverage could increase their name recognition and signal positive
   attributes to voters with low trust in media who would feel warmer
   toward those candidates. Although we confirm that candidates friendly
   toward QAnon receive more negative media coverage, our
   nationally-representative vignette experiment reveals that QAnon support
   decreases favorability toward candidates, even among seemingly
   sympathetic sub-populations. A follow-up conjoint experiment, varying
   whether candidates support QAnon, replicates these findings. This paper
   is one of the first to highlight the potential costs of elite conspiracy
   theory support and complicates popular narratives about QAnon.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the perceptions of ethnicity and their impact on
   conflict dynamics and cultural identity with the aim of proposing a
   pathway towards the building of an ethnic cosmopolitan worldview for
   peaceful coexistence. The research adopted a qualitative methodological
   approach with interviews and focus group discussions involving 50
   purposively sampled participants from the Kusaasi, Mamprusi, Mossi,
   Busanga, and Hausa ethnic groups resident in the Kusaug Traditional Area
   of northern-eastern Ghana. Participants recognize the possibility of
   developing a cosmopolitan worldview that respects divergent identities
   and values but also acknowledge the challenges and complexities
   involved. The study argues that the development of ethnic
   cosmopolitanism that integrates all the core values of the
   differentiated ethnic groups in Kusaug holds the potential to
   de-escalate conflicts and to promote peaceful coexistence. Public
   sensitization, education, and awareness programmes are recommended to
   promote tolerance, respect, and appreciation of unity in diversity.},

Abstract = {Robert Reiner famously wrote that the public get the police they
   deserve. Arguably, the police also get the public they deserve. Sir
   Robert Peel and his Commissioners Rowan and Mayne said that legitimacy
   relies on consent and that consent demands the public has trust and
   confidence in the police. A police service asking for that privilege
   must be professional and understand its role of service and protection.
   To do this well, it needs to be humble, but policing has lost its
   humility and no longer understands these concepts (if it ever did). Yet,
   we also need to consider how the public sees the police. Press and
   politics have a disproportionate effect on the reputation of the police
   that is often globalised and catastrophised from the actions of
   relatively few. This cannot be an excuse for poor policing, but a sense
   of balance has to be restored if society is to get the policing it
   deserves. There is a danger, not yet existential, that the actions of a
   minority of officers, the thoughtless interventions of irresponsible
   politicians and the disproportionate reporting of a client rather than
   free press is undermining the model of consent. Before policing can
   demand a balanced critique from politicians and press, though, it must
   get its house in order, and this article offers straightforward
   solutions in recruitment, vetting, and training to solve its current
   problems. Less straightforward is a demand for changes to a culture
   which is not fit for purpose.},

Abstract = {Congressional staff serve as the ``invisible force{''} in Congress by
   helping draft legislation and conduct oversight. Given this, excessive
   turnover among staff is a loss of institutional memory and inhibits
   legislators' ability to effectively conduct their constitutional duties.
   Using a mixed methods research design of interviews and a new survey of
   staff in the 115th session of Congress, I capture staffer intent to
   leave their current position and track whether they actually left their
   position 12 months later. Similar to civil servants, staff who report
   dissatisfaction with coworkers report higher levels of turnover
   intention, while the type of office, age, and level of education impact
   actual turnover. However, the extent to which polarization impacts
   staffers' job satisfaction impacts both intention and actual exit. My
   study makes a unique contributions to the growing body of literature
   devoted to understanding congressional staff by providing important
   insights into how to recruit and retain staff.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that (a) civic constitutionalism is a cohesive body of
   scholarship (b) it offers a detailed challenge to H \& eacute;l \&
   egrave;ne Landemore's account of how to fix democratic politics, while
   at the same time (c) suggesting how to blend compelling features of
   Landemore's approach with a more traditionally-grounded approach (d)
   consequently, democratic theorists of all sorts should consider becoming
   civic constitutionalists.},

Abstract = {The author proposes a Marxian class analysis of undergraduate education
   in U.S. four-year residential colleges and universities, highlighting
   the role of student labor in the production of courses, degrees, and
   campus life (college) and in the production of academic learning
   (knowledge). Undergraduate students are theorized as direct producers
   within two overlapping class structures: academic feudalism (college)
   and academic communism (knowledge). The concept of academic communism is
   argued to be normatively compatible with Marxian and liberal visions of
   higher education: the Marxian commitment to abolish class exploitation
   and the liberal commitment to academic freedom. As a constructive
   response to intensifying criticisms of undergraduate education as we
   know it, a Marxian view of college and knowledge offers an ethically
   grounded defense of the core mission of U.S. higher education, centered
   on undergraduate students and faculty members as coproducers of academic
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {The main objective of the article is to substantiate the generations'
   method for political analysis. In this sense, the article clarifies the
   conceptual and theoretical framework of this approach; shows an example
   of research applied to the study of political leadership, and exposes
   empirical data and ideas that support the usefulness of the generational
   view. The writing has five sections. The introduction investigates the
   meanings of the word ``generation{''}, focusing on the examination of
   the meaning linked to the sociopolitical arena. The second section
   describes the foundations of the theory of generations and proposes a
   qualitative methodology for the generational analysis of the political
   field. The third section presents a study on the generations of the
   presidents of the Government of Spain, between 1977 and 2023, showing a
   proposal for a generational classification of such presidents. The
   fourth section exposes an analysis of the generational relationships
   between the presidents, and between them and their respective government
   teams. The analysis highlights the relevance of second generation of
   presidents (Gonz \& aacute;lez and Aznar) in which a generational
   habitus appears that tends towards the professionalization of politics
   in the following generations. Finally, the conclusions emphasize the
   advantages of the generational method to make contextualized studies of
   sociopolitical phenomena.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in text-as-data provide new opportunities to document
   how elites shape public discourse on contentious issues. Using a novel
   word embeddings approach to measure elite-driven political narratives in
   local news, we analyze Kenyan newspaper coverage of the International
   Criminal Court's (ICC) prosecutions against domestic leaders. We train
   our embeddings on an original corpus of 5,292 Kenyan newspaper articles
   from 2007 to 2020 and identify significant changes in how local media
   vilifies the ICC before, during, and after major investigations. We find
   that as the case progressed, the ICC became more strongly associated
   with terms of bias and illegitimacy, an association that quickly
   dissipated after the court terminated its last proceeding. Our approach
   illustrates the utility of text-based measures of political sentiment on
   contentious issues, with implications for research on media narratives,
   the effects of controversial jurisprudence on public discourse, and
   backlash against international institutions.},

   Undermines Redistributive Politics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},

Volume = {86},

Abstract = {We analyze support for the welfare state across time and space in Great
   Britain. Using multilevel regression and poststratification with
   historical data and an original survey, we show that a virtually
   identical majority of people supported those policies in the mid-1990s
   and in 2020, but patterns of support were very different. Young and
   highly educated people are now the strongest supporters, as are the
   youngest and most highly educated geographic areas, mirroring divides
   over ``second-dimension{''} issues like Brexit. However, young and
   highly educated voters are clustered in a small number of places, with
   the Labour Party struggling to win moderately educated and moderately
   young areas. As a result, the left's problem in majoritarian systems is
   not the rise of second-dimension politics per se but rather how its
   supporters are distributed spatially along that dimension. A majority of
   voters in favor of welfare and redistribution no longer translates as
   easily into winning a majority of places in support.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With the progressing advances in text analysis methods and the
   increasing accessibility of parliamentary documents, the range of
   available tools for legislative scholars has increased massively over
   the past years. While the potential for comparative studies is huge,
   researchers can easily overlook the pitfalls associated with analyzing
   these documents. Against this background, I asses which theoretical
   considerations need to be carefully thought through preceding any
   (legislative) text analysis: I show that a clear definition and
   conceptualization of the unit of analysis such as speech or bill can
   vary substantially depending on the research interest. Furthermore, I
   discuss how the nested structure of legislative behavior and the data
   generating process influence our theoretic assumptions about
   parliamentary behavior. Based on these concepts, I derive some
   recommendations for the theoretical approach to quantitative textual
   analyses of parliamentary documents.},

Abstract = {The Indonesian governments developed the Upsus Pajale policy to achieve
   a goal and solve the problem of food self-sufficiency. Rice, corn, and
   soybean were the main commodities in the plan of Upsus Pajale Policy
   implementation. UPSUS Pajale improve rice, corn, and soybean production
   for food self-sufficiency. This study examined UPSUS Pajale policy
   implementation at the province, district, subdistrict, and farmer
   levels. This study examined rice growing in Banyuasin's tidal lowlands,
   Ogan Komering Ilir's swamplands, and East Ogan Komering Ulu's irrigated
   rice fields. The research method used a combination model of
   quantitative and qualitative (mixed method). Sampling data used
   purposive sampling. NVivo 12 software examined provincial, district,
   subdistrict, farmer interviews, and group discussions. Results affected
   typology management constraints differently. Production input costs were
   the most common issue. This study found that policy was differently
   implemented at various levels. It would be impacted to the success of
   the policy.},

Abstract = {This article demonstrates the value of including youth in deservingness
   and welfare attitude research by investigating Swiss adolescents'
   deservingness opinions and welfare attitudes (N = 1601, mean age =
   14.6). Through a survey experiment focusing on different unemployed
   groups and unemployment-related policies, the study revisits prominent
   research results like the immigrant deservingness gap from a novel
   perspective, generating insights relevant within and beyond the Swiss
   context. First, deservingness is a vital predictor of attitudes towards
   social rights and obligations already in younger years. Moreover, while
   some patterns of adult-centred studies are replicated (older unemployed
   are seen as more deserving than younger unemployed), there are also
   stark deviations: EU unemployed living in Switzerland are not seen as
   less deserving than Swiss unemployed. More research focusing on youth
   can enhance the social legitimacy of policies, clarify the relationship
   between deservingness and welfare attitudes, and potentially indicate
   what to expect from the future of the welfare state.
   Cet article d \& eacute;montre qu'il est pertinent d'inclure les jeunes

   Dieser Artikel verdeutlicht den Mehrwert des Einbezugs von Jugendlichen
   in die Forschung zu Deservingness und wohlfahrtsstaatlichen
   Einstellungen mittels einer Befragung von Jugendlichen in der Schweiz (N
   = 1601, Durchschnittsalter = 14,6). Mithilfe eines Umfrageexperiments zu
   unterschiedlichen arbeitslosen Gruppen werden bekannte
   Forschungsergebnisse (wie z.B. die tiefere Deservingness von
   MigrantInnen), aus einer neuen Perspektive beleuchtet. Die Ergebnisse
   sind relevant f \& uuml;r den Schweizer Kontext und dar \& uuml;ber
   hinaus. Deservingness ist bereits in jungen Jahren ein wesentlicher Pr
   \& auml;diktor f \& uuml;r Einstellungen zu sozialen Rechten und
   Pflichten. W \& auml;hrend einige Muster erwachsenenzentrierter Studien
   repliziert werden (\& auml;ltere Arbeitslose werden als verdienstvoller
   angesehen als j \& uuml;ngere Arbeitslose), gibt es jedoch auch starke
   Abweichungen: Arbeitslose mit EU-Pass, die in der Schweiz leben, werden
   nicht als weniger verdienstvoll angesehen als Schweizer Arbeitslose.
   Mehr Forschung mit Jugendlichen kann die soziale Legitimit \& auml;t von
   Politiken erh \& ouml;hen, die Beziehung zwischen Deservingness und
   wohlfahrtsstaatlichen Einstellungen sch \& auml;rfen und wom \&
   ouml;glich Einsicht \& uuml;ber die Zukunft des Wohlfahrtsstaates geben.
   Questo articolo evidenzia il valore del coinvolgimento dei giovani nella
   ricerca sulla deservingness e sugli atteggiamenti verso lo stato sociale
   mediante un'indagine su giovani in Svizzera (N = 1601, et \& agrave;
   media: 14,6). Utilizzando un sondaggio su diversi gruppi di disoccupati
   vengono esaminati risultati noti, come il divario di deservingness tra
   migranti, da una nuova prospettiva, generando risultati rilevanti nel
   contesto svizzero. La deservingness \& egrave; gi \& agrave; in giovane
   et \& agrave; un predittore degli atteggiamenti verso i diritti e i
   doveri sociali. Vengono replicati alcuni schemi di studi sugli adulti (i
   disoccupati anziani sono considerati pi \& ugrave; deserving dei
   giovani), ma ci sono anche deviazioni: i disoccupati con passaporto UE
   in Svizzera non sono considerati meno deserving dei disoccupati
   svizzeri. Ulteriori ricerche con i giovani possono aumentare la
   legittimit \& agrave; sociale delle politiche, affinare la relazione tra
   deservingness e atteggiamenti verso lo stato sociale e fornire una
   visione sul futuro dello stato sociale.},

Abstract = {Does partisanship reduce the importance of self-interest in local
   political decision-making? I examined the case of homeowners and their
   preferences for lower property taxes, as well as their evaluations of
   zoning and development policy, to answer this question. Relying on data
   from a conjoint survey experiment (n = 2036), I found that homeowners
   were more likely to select a candidate who supported lower property
   taxes than non-homeowners, on average. However, homeowners did not
   express stronger preferences for lower property taxes when evaluating
   candidates from the opposing party, or making decisions in elections
   that featured two-party competition. I supplemented my experimental data
   with survey data from the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study
   (CCES), which asked respondents to evaluate zoning and development in
   their area, as well as their mayor. I found that homeowners were more
   likely than non-homeowners to credit their mayor for favorable
   evaluations of zoning and development regardless of their mayor's
   partisanship.},

Title = {Citizen support for democracy, anti-pluralist parties in power and
   democratic backsliding},

Abstract = {Anti-pluralist parties have come to power in democracies around the
   world. However, only a subset of them have induced democratic
   backsliding while in government, raising the question of why some
   anti-pluralist governments subvert democracy while others are more
   reluctant. I argue that anti-pluralist incumbents undermine democratic
   institutions most severely during times of weak citizen support for
   democracy. In such settings, anti-pluralist parties in power face a low
   risk of voter punishment and public backlash. By contrast, in
   democracies where citizens' commitment to democratic rule is strong, the
   cost of attacking democratic institutions for incumbents is considerably
   higher, making democratic backsliding less likely. I test this theory by
   combining data from public opinion surveys, party systems and democratic
   downturns in 100 democracies and implement dynamic time-series
   cross-section models covering the period from 1990 to 2019. Consistent
   with expectations, periods in which anti-pluralist parties are in
   government during times of weak citizen support for democracy predict
   episodes of democratic decline. These findings have implications for the
   potential of citizens to constrain anti-pluralist incumbents in pursuing
   undemocratic reforms.},

Abstract = {Public trust and perceptions of institutional legitimacy are vital to
   the functioning of the federal court system, and recent work challenges
   the long-standing belief that these attitudes are relatively stable in
   the populace. We posit that one threat to perceptions of trust and
   legitimacy is the lack of representation for women in the federal
   judiciary. Using a series of experiments, we show that, while women
   desire descriptive representation, this is an insufficient condition for
   preserving support for the institution. Substantive representation on
   issues critical to women leads to significantly increased trust and
   legitimacy and lowered perceptions of institutional bias among women.
   While female judges may bring their own social identities to bear in
   their decision-making, our work suggests that efforts to diversify the
   federal judiciary, while important, are unlikely to bolster public
   support for the courts if the new judges and justices fail to
   substantively represent the communities of interest.},

Abstract = {It has often been assumed that the Russian aggression against Ukraine
   demonstrates the fundamental weakness of international law, and that the
   war signals the failure-if not the end-of the post-World War II
   international legal order. This contribution takes issue with this
   simplistic view of how wars of aggression induce change in the global
   normative order and argues-somewhat counterintuitively-that the Russian
   aggression has only served to reaffirm, rather than weaken, fundamental
   global rules relating to the use of force. The question of why
   international law changes-and why at times it resists change-is among
   the perennial puzzles of international relations theory and
   international law. In this contribution I argue that while powerful
   states do exercise a disproportionate influence on the formation and
   transformation of international law, it would be simplistic to assume
   that international law is determined by them, that it can be created and
   changed by unilateral fiat. The law is not merely a reflection of the
   subjective preferences of individual states but an intersubjective
   construct. Hence, wars of aggression launched by powerful states that
   are not supported by the international community at large leave the
   existing legal order intact.
   Oft wird argumentiert, dass die russische Aggression gegen die Ukraine
   die fundamentale Schw \& auml;che des V \& ouml;lkerrechts offenbare und
   dass der Krieg das Versagen oder gar das Ende der V \&
   ouml;lkerrechtsordnung signalisiert, die nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg
   etabliert worden war. Vorliegender Beitrag hinterfragt dieses
   simplistische Verst \& auml;ndnis von Wandel in der globalen normativen
   Ordnung und argumentiert - scheinbar kontraintuitiv - dass die russische
   Aggression nicht etwa die fundamentalen Spielregeln der globalen
   normativen Ordnung geschw \& auml;cht, sondern vielmehr aufs Neue best
   \& auml;tigt hat. Die Frage, warum das Recht sich ver \& auml;ndert und
   warum es manchmal Ver \& auml;nderungen widersteht, besch \& auml;ftigt
   V \& ouml;lkerrechtler und IB-Theoretiker schon lange. In diesem Beitrag
   argumentiere ich, dass m \& auml;chtige Staaten zweifellos eine \&
   uuml;berproportional gro ss en Einfluss auf die Bildung und
   Transformation des V \& ouml;lkerrechts haben; dass es aber simplistisch
   w \& auml;re, anzunehmen, dass diese Staaten das Recht determinieren k
   \& ouml;nnen, dass sie dieses also durch unilaterale Handlungen erzeugen
   und ver \& auml;ndern k \& ouml;nnen. Das Recht spiegelt nicht die
   subjektiven Pr \& auml;ferenzen einzelner Staaten wider, sondern ist ein
   intersubjektives Konstrukt. Daher lassen durch m \& auml;chtige Staaten
   ausgel \& ouml;ste Aggressionskriege, die nicht von der internationalen
   Gemeinschaft als Ganze unterst \& uuml;tzt werden, die existierende
   normative Ordnung intakt.},

Title = {Absolute gains, relative losses: How the poor and the rich view
   redistribution differently},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {320-347},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {How do people perceive the utility of redistribution? Support for
   redistribution is commonly understood as being determined by
   self-interest in a way that is monotonically proportional to expected
   net transfers. However, this would imply that average support for
   redistribution is static and unaffected by changes in the distribution
   of incomes. This study addresses this incongruence by integrating
   concepts from the literature on redistribution preferences, namely the
   diminishing marginal utility of income, inequity aversion and loss
   aversion. These concepts are formalized by making two distinctions
   regarding redistribution: absolute versus relative utility and gains
   versus losses. An analysis of the European/World Values Survey suggests
   that the preferences of the poor are determined by absolute gains, while
   the preferences of the rich are determined by relative losses. In other
   words, the poor care about how much they gain from redistribution, while
   the rich care about the share of their income that they lose from it.
   The findings have important implications for the relationships among
   public opinion, economic development and income inequality.},

Title = {How to reach external citizens? Comparing varieties of transnational
   party infrastructure},
Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {60},
Number = {3},
Pages = {594-620},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With a growing number of citizens living abroad, incentives and
   strategies to reach diasporas have become increasingly important for
   political actors. National political parties respond to new competitive
   transnational environments and engage with citizens living outside their
   country of origin. However, compared to traditional national party
   organisations, we know little about parties going abroad and what
   affects varieties in transnational instruments. To address this
   question, I compare transnational infrastructures of all parliamentary
   parties in Switzerland, Germany and Austria. By examining official party
   documents and information from party secretaries and representatives, I
   evaluate how parties reach external citizens and analyse factors that
   correspond with their organisational models. I find that internet voting
   from abroad does not increase the scope and extent of the analysed
   parties' physical infrastructure, whereas the ability to donate
   correlates with more investment into formal party branches abroad. In
   addition, I argue that larger institutionalised parties are more likely
   to invest in formal transnational infrastructure, and that left-right
   wing ideology and populism have little impact on organisational models
   across the selected countries.},

Abstract = {In exploring protest dynamics, Protest Event Analysis (PEA) has proven
   an indispensable analytic tool. Despite various improvements, PEA faces
   continuous challenges, notably the reproduction of media-specific
   selection biases. This research note aims to contribute to the
   literature seeking to mitigate these issues by exploring the potential
   of PEA based on local newspaper data, which tend to be less selective in
   their protest reporting. The article introduces an original local PEA
   dataset in Germany (2000-2020) and systematically compares it to
   existing national-level PEA data for Germany. The analysis shows that
   while both datasets pick up similar trends in terms of mobilisation
   waves, national level data focus on shorter periods of intense protest
   activity. Furthermore, issues of protest differ: material and social
   issues (including labour and environmental issues) are more prominent in
   local data, while cultural issues (including immigration and gender) are
   more prominent in national-level data.},

Abstract = {How do legislators decide with whom to collaborate? I argue that
   legislative collaborations are shaped by ethnicity and gender, with
   legislators from dominant ethnic groups and men legislators having more
   opportunities to collaborate than non-dominant legislators. These
   dynamics are likely present even when the nature of the collaboration is
   not particularly electorally salient. I test this hypothesis using newly
   collected data on question-asking from local legislators in Delhi.
   Dominant caste men legislators tend to dominate question-asking
   collaborations as expected, with men legislators consistently having
   more collaboration opportunities. The results suggest that legislative
   power dynamics are present even in lower-stakes interactions and may
   mean that simply encouraging additional legislator collaborations does
   not address underlying discriminatory patterns in how dominant
   legislators select their collaborators.},

Abstract = {Recent political developments in established democracies have renewed
   attention to the politics of identity. Some commentators have expressed
   concern that polities are fracturing along increasingly narrow social
   identity lines, in the process, losing their ability to build solidarity
   around shared commitments such as redistribution. This article takes
   stock of the strength of Canadian social identities and their
   consequences for redistributive preferences. It asks: first, which group
   memberships form the basis of Canadians' perceptions of shared identity,
   and second, do these group memberships shape preferences for
   redistribution? This study answers these questions using two conjoint
   experiments that assess respondents' perceptions of commonality and
   support for redistributing to hypothetical Canadians who vary on
   multiple dimensions of identity and need. Findings support that
   Canadians perceive greater shared identity with some of their groups
   (their social class) over others (their region or ascriptive identity),
   but that they overwhelmingly prioritize redistributing toward those who
   need it over those with whom they share group memberships.

Abstract = {This article aims to analyze the results of the European Parliament
   elections held on 6-9 June 2024. The distribution of seats in the
   Parliament is related to the future of the Green Deal. The Greens lost
   some seats, which will mostly have the capacity to affect the
   implementation or development of the green agenda. The key factors
   behind these results are economy, migration, security, and war. After
   the elections, the Parliament elected Ursula von der Leyen as the
   President of the Commission with 401 votes in favor. The Greens and EFA
   group voted for Ursula von der Leyen because they received a promise
   that the Green Deal would continue as planned. This article argues that
   the EU must be loyal to targets regarding the green agenda in order to
   become independent of any foreign power in terms of energy resources},

Abstract = {In the 21st century, Latin America and the Caribbean have become one of
   the key regions for Russia to expand its influence and strengthen the
   `multipolar' world. This Kremlin policy is not a simple reproduction of
   the Soviet model and contains several new features. However, after the
   strong blow to the existing world order by the use of Russian military
   forces against Ukraine, Russia-LAC relations suffered a significant
   impact and changed Moscow's perspectives. The article analyses the main
   features of Russian policy towards LAC countries with a special focus on
   the changes that resulted from the start of the war. Among other things,
   the object of study is to understand whether the type of relationship
   exercised by the Kremlin meant or means at some point an
   intergovernmental alliance of left-wing political forces.},

Abstract = {County sheriffs hold a great deal of discretionary power at the county
   level; however, little is known about the decision-making of sheriffs.
   One key role they hold is overseeing county jails. In this role, county
   sheriffs choose how often to cooperate with Immigration and Customs
   Enforcement (ICE) when they make a detainer request of the county. This
   study investigates the factors influencing sheriffs' decision making,
   specifically whether sheriffs make discretionary decisions based on the
   will of the people. Using ICE data about cooperation with county jails,
   and Cooperative Congregational Election Study (CCES) data, we assess if
   sheriff cooperation with ICE is politically motivated, in congruence
   with preferences of the voters countywide, or are other factors
   potentially influencing sheriffs. We find that sheriffs' decision to
   cooperate with ICE is influenced by the demographics and economy of
   their county rather than their own political affiliation or their
   county's ideological stance on immigration.},

Abstract = {The way in which international actors formulate proposals for reforming
   or establishing public social policies not only varies between different
   organisations but is also dependent on the policy field in question.
   This article compares the positions of two international organisations
   (IOs), the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
   (ECLAC) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), on the two
   related social policy fields of health and long-term care in Latin
   America. We apply qualitative document analysis to reports and strategy
   articles published by ECLAC and PAHO between 2000 and 2015. The analysis
   finds that despite some similar proposals by both organisations, there
   are also clear differences between their positions depending on the
   policy areas. While both organisations see the need to establish
   healthcare and long-term care as a human right, they have different
   ideas on targeted and universal approaches. Moreover, with long-term
   care as a new and emerging policy field, there is still much more
   variation in how the IOs address the topic, while proposals on
   healthcare are shaped by previous debates at international and regional
   levels.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the protection of indigenous peoples and their
   natural habitats in Colombia when investment projects are planned or
   implemented. Special attention is paid to the mechanisms of prior
   informed consultation; and free, prior, and informed consent. The
   Colombian case is relevant because it is at the vanguard of protecting
   the rights of indigenous peoples and their territories, and it is home
   to tough policy choices, balancing indigenous rights, the environment
   (as a megadiverse country), and the economy (highly dependent on mining
   exports). From a law and sustainable development perspective, this
   article analyzes a novel combination of various statistical data sets
   and case law and includes tests of the outcomes of prior informed
   consultation processes and their interaction with environmental
   licensing based on regression analyses. The conclusions point to the
   scale of the use of the protection mechanisms, the patterns in the
   behavior of indigenous peoples and in the outcomes of the mechanisms,
   the need to reinterpret transaction costs, and the crucial role of the
   constitutional court.},

Abstract = {The elimination of Black voting in the U.S. South after Reconstruction
   is the most significant instance of democratic backsliding in American
   history. I use newly collected state legislative roll call data from the
   late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, consisting of more than
   19,400 unique roll calls, to explore Black disfranchisement's
   consequences for legislative representation. Using ideal point estimates
   in a panel design, I demonstrate that disfranchisement is associated
   with substantial changes in roll call voting. In states where
   competition between Democrats and Republicans structured roll call
   voting, disfranchisement precipitated shifts away from more-Republican
   roll call records. In states already dominated by Democrats before
   disfranchisement, disfranchisement often led to relative shifts toward
   the agrarian, reform wing of the Democratic Party. These results
   demonstrate the centrality of Black disfranchisement for the creation of
   the Solid South and the significant impact of Black suffrage on southern
   politics in the years following Reconstruction.},

Abstract = {Expanding suffrage is critical for democratic inclusion. In the United
   States, noncitizen residents are the latest focus of such
   (re)enfranchising efforts. Public opinion plays a significant role in
   the passage of legislation expanding or restricting noncitizen access to
   local elections. Although elite support for noncitizen suffrage is
   well-documented, little is known about public opinion toward such
   noncitizen voter policies. What accounts for voter support for
   noncitizen electoral participation? We argue that the partisan alignment
   between noncitizens and U.S. voters shapes U.S. voters' support for
   noncitizen voting rights. Evidence from two survey experiments suggests
   that U.S. voters are pragmatic in their enfranchising preferences:
   voters increase their support for co-partisan enfranchisement but oppose
   this same policy when considering out-partisans. These dynamics are
   present among both Republicans and Democrats, underscoring the societal
   implications of heightened partisanship on American democracy.},

Abstract = {Why, and under what conditions, do international crises make the
   president's national security agenda? I argue that international crises
   are opportunities for presidents to seek domestic political gains, but
   that presidents are likely to weigh anticipated political benefits
   against anticipated risk of political opposition. I analyze presidential
   National Security Council (NSC) meeting agendas from 1947 to 1993 to
   find that the War Powers Resolution (WPR) of 1973 reduced the likelihood
   of presidential crisis attentiveness, that low approval ratings are
   associated with increased crisis attentiveness, and that post-WPR
   presidents under unified government are likely to be more crisis
   attentive. This article provides fresh analysis of the WPR by connecting
   presidential national security behavior with American domestic politics.},

Abstract = {We examine the relationship between socioeconomic characteristics and
   voting patterns among Arabs in Israel. We combine panel data on
   sixty-three Arab localities with election results and socioeconomic
   indicators for seven election years between 1996 and 2015. Exploiting
   the variation in political preferences and socioeconomic status across
   localities and over time, we find that the trends in Arab turnout are
   consistent with the substantive representation and political exclusion
   theories: that is, the representation of Arabs in Jewish-majority
   parties contributed to turnout, while the events of the second Intifada,
   which included clashes between Arabs in Israel and the Israeli police,
   were associated with a long-term decline in turnout. We also found that
   the preference for Arab parties over Left-wing Zionist parties is
   related to the instrumental voting theory. As the socioeconomic status
   of Arabs in Israel improved, they were less dependent on Jewish-majority
   parties for public goods provision and thus had less reason to support
   them. These findings contribute to understanding the experience of
   minorities in other contexts and to policymakers in Israel and beyond.},

Abstract = {While presidents frequently create new policies through unilateral
   power, empirical scholarship generally focuses on executive orders and
   overlooks other categories of directives. We introduce data on more than
   50,000 unilateral directives issued between 1877 and 2020 and use
   machine learning techniques to characterize their substantive importance
   and issue areas. Our measures reveal significant increases in unilateral
   activity over time, driven largely by increases in foreign affairs and
   through the substitution of memoranda for executive orders. We use our
   measures to formally evaluate the historical development of the
   unilateral presidency and reassess theoretical claims about public
   opinion and unilateral power. Our research provides new evidence about
   variation in the use of presidential authority and opens new avenues for
   empirical inquiry.},

Journal = {ACTA POLITICA},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {Despite the increased importance of environmental issues across Europe,
   there was considerable regional variation in the successes of green
   parties during the 2019 Belgian federal elections. While the green party
   in Wallonia (Ecolo) performed electorally well, the green party in
   Flanders (Groen) was not able to reach a similar success. In the current
   study, we investigate to what extent two classic voting models (the
   spatial model and the issue salience model) can explain the regional
   difference in the success of the green parties in the 2019 federal
   elections in Belgium. Our analyses, relying on data from the 2019 EOS
   RepResent post-election survey, show that voters who considered the
   green issue salient and who were in favour of environmental protection
   supported green parties, in particular when they also associated green
   issue ownership with green parties. This pattern holds in both Flanders
   and Wallonia, though Ecolo seemed more successful in attracting these
   voters than Groen did. This may at least partly explain the regional
   difference in the success of the green parties. In addition, the green
   issue was more salient in Wallonia than in Flanders.},

Title = {Initial feminism in Argentina and the Plus Ultra Women's Pages},
Journal = {IZQUIERDAS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {1-17},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Plus Ultra magazine was published in Buenos Aires between March 1916 and
   December 1930. It was the illustrated supplement of the popular Caras y
   Caretas weekly publication. However, because of its price, the magazine
   was intended for a higher income public. Plus Ultra included a section
   called P \& aacute;ginas Femeninas, which addressed female readers and
   appeared regularly until 1920. Women from the Argentinean upper class
   collaborated with the magazine and published poems, letters, profiles,
   and opinion articles. They also echoed the controversies that took place

Abstract = {We study a new driving factor of women's inclusion in politics: the
   economic empowerment of their mothers. We evaluate Swedish microdata on
   politicians and their parents over fifty years. The results demonstrate
   a strong intergenerational dynamic from mothers to daughters. Female
   politicians come from households where their mother is more likely to be
   employed, earns more in the labour market, and earns a larger share of
   household earnings. This pattern was strong among parliamentarians in
   the 1970s and 1980s when female numerical representation increased
   rapidly in Sweden but is not present in national politics after the
   introduction of gender quotas in the early 1990s or in local politics.},

Title = {Why do local governments privatize? Political representation and
   contagion in the privatization of welfare services in Sweden},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {47},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Previous research has highlighted that decentralization is key to
   understanding the marketization of the Swedish welfare state, while
   local political factors are important to explaining the subnational
   differences in actual degrees of welfare service privatization. Other
   research has highlighted the impact of pragmatism rather than ideology
   in local government's decisions to outsource welfare services, including
   policy diffusion through geographical proximity to highly privatized
   municipalities. However, little research has been done on the role or
   type of political representation and whether this matters to the
   diffusion of welfare service privatization. Thus, there is little
   knowledge about whether local governments are primarily responsive to
   public preferences, the ideological position of the local government, or
   influences from neighboring municipalities. Drawing on the literature on
   political representation and policy diffusion, I test three hypotheses:
   that the local governments are primarily responsive to public
   preferences (sanction representation), that local governments are
   primarily responsive to their own ideological position (gyroscopic
   representation), or that local governments are primarily influenced by
   outsourcing in neighboring municipalities (contagion). Using a
   time-lagged correlational design with survey data covering both local
   politicians and ordinary municipal residents, as well as public accounts
   of municipal outsourcing, I find that public preferences play a
   negligible role to the privatization process. A minor part of the
   between-municipal variation in welfare service privatization can be
   attributed to the preferences of local politicians (gyroscopic
   representation), while a more substantial part is due to pressures from
   outsourcing among municipal neighbors (contagion).},

   considerable political, economic, and humanitarian consequences.
   Combining insights from the Discourse-Historical Approach and
   Corpus-Assisted Discourse Analysis with securitization theory, the paper
   investigates the dominant frames identified in the coverage of the
   border events by the largest Polish television network (TVP). The
   findings suggest that TVP portrayed immigrants and refugees mostly as
   dangerous, relying on the stereotypical image of the Muslim Other.
   Utilizing quantitative methods to analyze large data samples, the study
   illustrates how corpus linguistics tools provide valuable insights for
   social science research.},

Abstract = {In this article, we study the political project promoted by the European
   Commission (EC) for tackling simultaneously socioeconomic and
   environmental issues. Based on a detailed analysis of the most relevant
   EC policy documents (adopted between 2000 and 2020) that explicitly
   articulate ecological and socioeconomic questions, we offer two
   contributions to the literature on eco-social policy. First, we identify
   the nature of what we call the `European Eco-Social Model'. This
   political project subordinates social-ecological goals to the economic
   rationality of growth, competitiveness and profits and de-politicizes
   the efforts to promote more sustainable societies and economies. Second,
   we show how the Commission is repositioning itself as a global leader in
   the transformation to sustainability, attempting to extend its
   particular eco-social model to the whole world. Overall, we argue that
   this `model' is based on self-contradictory assumptions and cannot
   demonstrate how it should be able to solve problems of social inequality
   and climate change on a global level.},

Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {This article is a photo essay that presents the emotions of union
   activists in Hong Kong on the day the Confederation of Trade Unions
   (CTU) decided to cease their operation. It is nested within a larger
   research project on the new unionism movement in Hong Kong triggered by
   the anti-extradition law protest. Reflecting on these emotions, this
   article explores the possibility of using photography to facilitate more
   discussions on unionisation and labour activism. Such reflection could
   offer much insight into the leftist scholarship on solidarity and the
   revival of unionism in the contemporary global landscape.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the Conservative Party of Quebec's (CPQ)
   communication on Facebook and X in the year leading up to the 2022
   Quebec general election. Based on a content analysis of a sample of 800
   messages posted on the social media platforms by the party and its
   leader \& Eacute;ric Duhaime, the analysis highlights the populist
   elements of the publications, as well as the political objectives of its
   online communication. The article indicates that the party may have used
   these platforms to expand its voter base by bypassing traditional media
   filters and speaking directly to voters to take advantage of Quebec's
   hybrid media context. Two conclusions can be drawn from our analyses.
   Firstly, the CPQ appears to have employed a populist, anti-elitist
   discourse to exploit pandemic discontent present in Quebec. Secondly,
   the party used the mobilizing functions offered by social media to build
   a coalition of voters.},

Abstract = {Can democracies attract and elect politicians who are both high-ability
   and from diverse backgrounds? Using data covering the entire Danish
   population, including every candidate for local and national elections
   in 1990-2015, we explore the selection of political candidates. We show
   that Danish candidates and elected politicians have higher ability than
   the voters they represent, that selection on ability reflects individual
   skills rather than social background, that politicians are selected from
   economically diverse backgrounds, and that there is no substantial
   trade-off between ability and representation. Furthermore, we utilize a
   major structural reform, which significantly reduced the number of
   municipalities in Denmark, to show that increased political competition
   did not affect politicians' ability, economic background, or the
   trade-off between the two.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the discussion of terrorist threat in the United
   States has focused almost exclusively on radical Islam. Now, progressive
   politicians increasingly talk about white supremacy as a form of
   terrorism. We explore reactions to this new rhetoric using two survey
   experiments, in which non-Hispanic white respondents are exposed to real
   tweets of Democratic and Republican politicians discussing white
   supremacy and radical Islam as security threats. We formulate two
   alternative expectations: after seeing messages from Democratic
   politicians linking white supremacy to terrorism, whites may either
   diverge in their assessments of Republicans' anti-Muslim appeals
   depending on their own partisanship or they may uniformly rate
   anti-Muslim rhetoric as more acceptable. Both experiments show
   significant increases in the perceived acceptability of anti-Muslim
   appeals when they are presented after messages about white supremacy,
   and these results are driven by white Democrats. Our results highlight
   the potential side effects of political communication about terrorism.},

Abstract = {Does candidate gender matter for vote choice? Whereas experimental
   research suggests an average preference for female candidates,
   observational studies tend to find null effects. In this note, we
   address the recent debate on how to measure voter preferences on the
   aggregate and the individual level. We argue that candidate gender
   preferences exist, but that whether and when they are revealed varies
   between and within voters. Drawing on an observational design and using
   data from over 500,000 individual ballots in Lithuanian elections, we
   employ multilevel regression and exponential random graph models to show
   how voters' candidate gender preferences are distributed across the
   electorate and how they vary in size and direction. We find that about
   half of all voters prefer either male or female candidates. Whereas
   preference for male candidates tends to be revealed in the first and
   second preference votes, preference for female candidates is first
   revealed in lower preference votes. Our results help explain
   contradictory findings in the literature and illustrate how
   observational data and methods can be used to assess voter preferences
   within electorates.},

Abstract = {Since the last time the Royal Navy took significant casualties at sea,
   institutional memory of the response has faded, while our understanding
   of mental health issues and treatment has increased. Ryan Easterday and
   Charlotte Evans use a tragic collision at sea as a case study to examine
   the mental health challenges experienced by the surviving crew following
   a mass casualty event, as well as actions taken to address those
   challenges. By assessing those actions against observed outcomes and
   research-based mental health best practices, the authors identify
   several lines of effort that leaders can employ to ensure Royal Navy
   readiness for similar challenges in the future.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the limitations of traditional sovereign debt
   management in Africa and introduces innovative strategies to address
   these challenges. It critically assesses current practices, identifying
   their inefficiencies and inadequacies in meeting the unique needs of
   African economies. The findings reveal a need for more flexible,
   context-specific approaches that consider the diverse economic
   landscapes of African nations. Additionally, it recommends a shift
   towards models that emphasise sustainable debt levels, local economic
   conditions and more inclusive stakeholder engagement. These strategies
   aim to provide African nations with more resilient and adaptable
   frameworks for managing sovereign debt, thereby fostering long-term
   economic stability and growth.},

Title = {Republican violence in Northern Ireland: a comparative case study of
   County Tyrone},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 10},
Abstract = {Ireland has a long history of political violence emanating from Irish
   republicans' desire to be free from British rule. The focus of this
   article is on the use of such political violence in one particular area,
   namely County Tyrone using a comparative analysis to interrogate
   republican violence during the Anglo-Irish War (1919-1921) and the
   period known as the Troubles (1969-1997). Drawing upon archival sources,
   interviews with ex-security force members and republicans with direct
   experience of the conflict in County Tyrone and the extant literature,
   the article examines whether successive generations of republicans drew
   upon or deviated from established templates of political violence. In
   doing so, it considers the practical and lethal effect of the exchange
   of memories, grievance, justifications, tactics and patterns of past
   episodes of violence. By comparing and analysing differences in the
   political violence employed by successive generations of republicans,
   similar strategies and tactics are identified. These include the use of
   guerrilla warfare, attacks on security forces, the local economy and
   infrastructure, the creation of security force-free zones and the
   fostering of sectarian and representative violence. The research has
   contemporary relevance to improve our understanding, challenge
   misinterpretations and myths of past events and legacies in County
   Tyrone.},

Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {89},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Postal voting is often considered a means to enhance electoral
   participation by minimising the costs associated with voting. This study
   leverages individual-level register data for the entire electorate of
   Finns residing abroad who were provided the option of voting by mail in
   the 2019 parliamentary elections in addition to traditional inperson
   voting. Analysis of their voting trajectories across three parliamentary
   elections (2011, 2015, 2019) using such diverse approaches as
   descriptive statistics, interrupted time series analysis and an improved
   causal identification strategy revealed that the availability of postal
   voting was unlikely to increase electoral participation among this
   particular electorate despite previously low participation rates. The
   observed changes in turnout resembled previous elections, where only
   in-person voting at polling stations was available. The findings
   indicate that postal voting may not effectively address low turnout or
   participation biases.},

Abstract = {This study employs a mixed-methods approach to investigate the nature of
   Facebook posts related to Muslims and LGBTQ+ individuals in Finland,
   spanning a period of 4 years. Through the use of the CrowdTangle
   platform, the researchers extracted and analyzed Facebook posts that
   encompassed predetermined keywords indicative of potential hate speech.
   The findings underscored divergent patterns of engagement and sentiment
   toward these two groups, with implications for the different levels of
   societal acceptance and tolerance exhibited. Posts related to Muslims
   typically elicited controversy and were often depicted as threats,
   whereas posts about the LGBTQ+ community generally advocated for
   inclusivity. However, persistent negative stereotypes about the LGBTQ+
   community were also evident. The analysis also brought to light how
   political parties strategically used these discourses to steer
   conversations, consolidate their ideological positions, and mobilize
   their respective supporters. Grounded in the social identity theory,
   this study sheds light on the complex dynamics of online political
   discourse, revealing its far-reaching impacts on societal attitudes,
   intergroup relations, and formation of group identities. The nuanced
   understanding derived from these observations suggests that
   interventions fostering healthier public discussions on social media
   platforms could contribute significantly to combating societal division,
   prejudice, and bias. This research underscores the importance of
   scrutinizing online discourses to address issues of societal cohesion
   and social acceptance.},

Abstract = {We shed new light on a long-standing question in political science: When
   confronted with costly policy choices, do citizens form their
   preferences using material (economic) concerns or other-regarding
   motivations, such as the distribution of costs, and how are these
   moderated by political ideology? Using the case of carbon taxation, a
   widely advocated policy solution to climate change, we conducted survey
   experiments in Germany and the United States to assess the relative
   importance of these forms of preferences. The results show that
   individuals are primarily concerned with how a carbon tax would affect
   their individual income. There are also important cross-national
   differences with high-income German respondents being more receptive to
   redistributive policy design, especially in contrast to high-income
   Democrats who significantly decrease support for carbon taxation. These
   findings highlight how the constituencies generated by new policies can
   significantly alter the distribution of mass support for action on
   emerging societal problems.},

Abstract = {Although the benefits of increasing descriptive diversity in Congress
   are well explored, less attention has been paid to the positive impacts
   of increasing descriptive diversity in elections. Employing a
   comprehensive collection of campaign platform text from nearly 5,000
   campaign websites, we find that Democratic male and white candidates are
   significantly more likely to take up women's and Black-associated issues
   when a candidate who possesses that identity runs in their same-party
   primary election. Extending our analysis to military veterans, we find
   that Republicans are more likely to discuss veterans' issues when there
   is a military veteran in their primary; conversely, Democrats are not
   any more likely to discuss these issues when they run against a veteran.
   Looking to candidate position taking in the general election, our
   findings suggest that simply the presence of candidates from
   underrepresented populations in elections is important to broadening
   substantive representation in the legislative arena.},

Abstract = {A key grievance of the student labor movement is that across much of
   academia, and especially in the social sciences and humanities, stipends
   tied to PhD assistantships fall short of a living wage. In this article,
   we consider the issue from a pedagogical perspective, expecting that
   higher pay may lead to stronger program outcomes. We collect and
   validate data on assistantship stipends in political science from
   PhDStipends.com, and on tenure-track placements from an analysis of
   departmental placement pages. Graduate pay is significantly associated
   with tenure-track placements in the job market cycles spanning
   2019-2021, independently of program size, rank, student unionization,
   location, and institution type and endowment. Across model
   specifications, a US\$5,000 increase in student pay corresponds with 2.7
   more placements per 100 enrolled students (or 34\% of the median rate)
   over this period.},

Journal = {POLITICAL QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {95},
Number = {2},
Pages = {298-307},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The net zero transition requires concurrent and rapid decarbonisation in
   five major consumption-production systems-transport, housing, industry,
   food and power. These systems differ in their public visibility and
   institutional makeup, as well as in their technologies. Transition
   politics needs dexterity to facilitate transformation of these multiple
   systems. Yet, there remain big contrasts in the rate of change of
   different systems. These are shown by the variation in the fulfilment of
   the 2020 system targets which were set in the 2009 UK Low Carbon
   Transition Plan. Comparison of the transition pathways of renewable
   electricity production and home insulation indicates that current UK net
   zero transition politics is poorly suited to the transformation of
   household energy use. A more proactive state and wider public
   participation are needed for a more effective place-based approach.
   Environmental activism and populist backlash have focused attention on
   everyday transformative change. A new type of transition politics which
   engages with multiple systems is needed to rise to this urgent climate
   challenge.},

Title = {Carl Schmitt's Political Theology: Legitimizing Authority after
   Secularization},
Journal = {POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},
Pages = {83-109},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the last years, a theological turn had a pervasive influence in the
   reception of Carl Schmitt's writings. According to this view, his
   thought has a strong, substantial religious foundation. With regards to
   understanding not only Schmitt's position but also his current influence
   in authoritarian countries, this essay argues that this interpretation
   is misleading and proposes a different and comprehensive analysis of
   Schmitt's concept of political theology that replaces it in a
   political-legal framework. Against the theological reading, it argues
   that Schmitt's concept of ``political theology{''} refers to his own
   conception of legal theory as an attempt to relegitimize authority in a
   secular context. As ``political theology,{''} this legal theory is
   designed to overcome normativism and parliamentarism by
   ``substantializing{''} the legal form. Using Schmitt's post-1933 works
   as an example, the essay shows that, as theology translates faith into a
   written doctrine, legal theory must, according to Schmitt,
   substantialize the legal form by translating the political idea into
   jurisprudence. Hence, this article concludes that Schmitt's theory might
   be described as ``political theology{''} but only in a formal,
   ideological sense. It is part of an authoritarian theory that is not
   religious but uses theology to revive an appearance of absolute
   legitimacy.},

Abstract = {In this article, I adopt the theoretical lens of authoritarian
   neoliberalism coupled with the concept of performativity to analyse
   post-transition Tunisian counterterror politics. In doing so, I argue
   that ``securing the state{''} from discursively constructed
   ``threats{''} such as terrorism, political Islamism and the associated
   instability they are perceived to engender can be understood as a
   performative enactment of statehood in the context of reduced
   sovereignty associated with neoliberal deregulation, as well as a crisis
   of legitimacy faced by successive post-transition governments in
   Tunisia. However, performative counterterror discourses and practices
   are aimed not only at ``flexing the muscles{''} of the state. They also
   seek to construct moral panic surrounding certain groups and thus
   justify the roll out of repressive policing of already marginalised
   communities rather than merely suspected terrorists. This performance is
   intended to distract from some of the root causes of radicalisation in
   contemporary Tunisia: economic inequalities and dispossession linked to
   failed neoliberal deregulation. Thus, through the exploration of the
   Tunisian case between 2014 and 2021, I contend we can best understand
   (in)security in the MENA when adopting an analytical approach bringing
   together security studies and International Political Economy (IPE).},

Abstract = {This article provides an overview of the current state of public service
   media (PSM) funding in Germany, which is primarily supported by a
   household levy, supplemented by advertising, sponsorship and so-called
   `other income'. Germany is an interesting case owing to the complexities
   and challenges associated with funding PSM in a country with a federal
   structure. As such, insights into PSM funding in Germany and the debates
   surrounding it can benefit not only academics, but also policy makers,
   media professionals and others with an interest in PSM funding.},

Abstract = {`Global Britain' is as much a governing instinct as it is a statement of
   current policy: an idea that animates the United Kingdom's international
   relations. And for nine decades the BBC World Service, Britain's
   principal agent of public diplomacy, has been its exemplar. With a
   reputation as a trusted source of reliable news in over forty languages,
   the international BBC sustains a global capacity for intercultural
   dialogue founded on evidence-based journalism. At a time when digital
   media are rewriting the strategic communications playbook and
   reorganising our knowledge practices and behaviours, the BBC maintains a
   vital link between Britain and a transnational community of close to
   half a billion users. Yet, despite these evident strengths, recent
   confusion over the organisation and funding of the World Service means
   that its long-term future is in doubt. This article asks how and why it
   has come to this and what might be done to preserve the journalistic
   integrity and `soft power' of the BBC World Service.},

Abstract = {This study investigates political decisions and epidemiological
   developments. Employing a quantitative approach, this paper examines
   proportions of votes advocating Brexit with the proportional rates of
   Covid-19 vaccinations among individuals aged 18 years and above. A
   discernible pattern suggests a link between lower vaccination rates and
   pro-Brexit inclinations, validating the theory of disinformation
   affecting decision-making. This research finds a correlative
   relationship between political behaviour in voting for Brexit, and
   epidemiological outcomes measured by the uptake of vaccinations among
   various urban centres, towns, and local governmental jurisdictions
   within the United Kingdom. However, the results also show socioeconomic
   control variables are statistically more significant in predicting
   vaccination rates.},

   to alternatives. We examine three types of ``unfair{''} comparisons and
   the reasoning errors associated with each. A theorist makes an obscure
   comparison when one (or more) of the alternatives under consideration is
   underspecified; a theorist makes a mismatched comparison when they fail
   to hold fixed the relevant contextual factors while comparing
   alternatives; and a theorist makes an irrelevant comparison when they
   compare alternatives assuming contextual factors that differ in
   important respects from those they ``should{''} assume given their
   theoretical aims. We then introduce the notion of a modeling mindset and
   show how this mindset can help theorists detect and avoid the three
   types of error. We conclude with a reconstruction of Cohen's camping
   trip thought experiment to illustrate the approach.},

Abstract = {In response to alleged citizen distrust of politics and parties, recent
   reforms have made electoral systems more candidate-centred. Rational
   choice theory claims that candidate-centred voting should make voting
   more rewarding while incentivising candidates to increase their
   campaigning. Behaviouralists point to the higher number of options,
   which would lead to abstention. This study investigates the reforms in
   Bremen and Hamburg, where the simple, single-vote, closed-list PR system
   was replaced with a multiple-vote preferential-list PR system in 2011.
   Employing a difference-in-differences design, the study reveals a
   significant decrease in voter turnout of at least ten percentage points
   in Bremen, Bremerhaven, and Hamburg, compared to the trend in comparable
   German districts. A cross-level analysis of 79 election surveys fielded
   since 2000 in all of Germany, comprising 97,849 respondents, highlights
   that the reforms have widened the participation gap between the lower-
   and higher-educated Bremen and Hamburg citizens compared to elsewhere in
   Germany. These findings contribute to research on electoral systems,
   choice, and voter turnout, emphasising the potential adverse
   consequences that can emerge from complex electoral system redesigns.},

Abstract = {This study examines how protesters' gender shapes public reactions to
   protests and protest repression. Using an original survey experiment, I
   demonstrate that protests involving extensive participation by women are
   perceived as less violent and meriting of repression than male-dominated
   protests. But perceptions of female protesters vary. Patriarchy-defiant
   female protesters like feminists are deemed more deserving of repression
   despite being perceived as equally likely to be peaceful as female
   protesters who emphasize patriarchy-compliant femininities, such as
   women who highlight their roles as mothers and wives. This, I show, is
   because patriarchy-defiant women are viewed as more immoral, which
   renders their protest accounts less trustworthy when they clash with
   government propaganda seeking to legitimize repression. These findings
   underscore the value of disaggregating the binary category of man or
   woman when examining sentiments toward political agents and of
   considering stereotypes when studying perceptions, and ultimately the
   risks and effectiveness, of protest movements.},

Abstract = {Policymakers and scholars have long proposed that willingness to
   participate in armed conflict is influenced by citizens' income-earning
   opportunities. Testing this opportunity cost mechanism has led to mixed
   results. One reason for this might be the fact that current proxies can
   also serve as indicators to test grievance-based theories. In this
   study, we construct a more suitable measure. We use crop calendars and
   crop location data to build an index of agricultural idle time for first
   administration units on the African continent from 1990 to 2017. We test
   the explanatory power of this measure by examining its relationship with
   armed conflict. Our results show that agricultural idle time increases
   the probability of observing armed conflict by more than 20 percent.},

Title = {New Territory, Geographic Diffusion and Civilian Targeting},
Journal = {CIVIL WARS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 3},
Abstract = {Existing research identifies several factors that shape civilian
   targeting, including competition between armed groups. However, the role
   diffusion into new territory - as opposed to continued presence in
   long-established areas - plays is relatively underexamined. This study
   addresses this through a territorial analysis of eight high-activity
   African rebel groups, using Armed Conflict Location \& Event Dataset
   data. It finds that groups are more likely to target civilians in new
   territory, and in areas with a proliferation of non-state armed actors.
   The study attributes this to competition and signalling incentives. This
   has implications for understanding civilian targeting and protection in
   territorially expanding conflicts.},

Abstract = {Women's wings are a common feature of rebellions but we lack a
   systematic accounting of how women organise themselves or are organised
   within and across armed groups. In this article we describe the
   functions of and variation across women's wings globally. We identify
   significant variation in the types, purposes, and autonomy of women's
   wings inside and between groups. We also highlight similarities across
   units, including their role in mobilising women into conflict, pressing
   for reforms, and creating leadership opportunities. We demonstrate that
   women's wings are diverse yet important sites for gendered power,
   negotiation, activity, and outreach within rebellions.},

Abstract = {Russia's war against Ukraine and departure from the Council of Europe
   (CoE) in 2022 raises numerous questions about the effect of
   norm-diffusion in wider Europe. While inclusion in the CoE has provided
   litigation opportunities for Russian citizens, the process of
   ``sovereignization{''} pursued by the regime has brought Russia into a
   downward spinning spiral of authoritarian illiberalism. This study
   discusses expectations derived from the hybrid regime model (containment
   of the domestic opposition as a driver towards full-blown
   authoritarianism) and from spiral theories of human rights compliance;
   it argues that the Putin regime has sought to seal Russia off from
   normative pressures from international organizations in pursuit of
   sovereign norms and values, and construed a separate legal space aimed
   at maintaining authoritarian rule indefinitely.},

Abstract = {Huge debt from multilateral institutions, countries, and private
   creditors, unsustainable loans with onerous default conditions,
   investments that serve to foster political authority, treaties, and
   trading relations with unequal partners have set the African continent
   on a course that threatens its human and economic development prospects.
   While the multilateral relations, treaties, loans, and investments
   represent major opportunities for African countries to boost growth,
   reduce poverty, build infrastructures, and broaden economically, they
   could also constrain developments, and undermine the capacity of poorer
   African countries to create the conditions for the realization of human
   rights. It has been established that debt repayment is often carried out
   at the expense of basic human rights. In addition, debt servicing and
   harmful conditions linked to loans and debt relief often limit
   investment in and undermine the provision of essential public services.
   The study examined the various factors related to human rights,
   particularly in the context of China's loans and financial investment in
   African countries. It delves into specific human rights concerns
   relating to socioeconomic, cultural, civil, political, and environmental
   rights to provide a comprehensive understanding of the human rights
   issues arising from China's engagement with African countries. Human
   rights have also been adopted as measuring tools to assess, measure, and
   prevent the impact of financial relations, debt burdens, and assistance.},

   post-communist some scholars attribute the delay to the Western Balkans'
   political instability and failure to adopt EU norms, the author argues
   that the EU's actions, or lack thereof, are primarily responsible.
   Despite initial momentum following membership, enlargement fatigue and
   concerns over absorption capacity led the EU to tighten accession
   conditions. The article critiques the EU's approach, suggesting that it
   has used enlargement promises as a foreign policy tool, for achieving
   the geopolitical interests of its member states, as seen in the sudden
   granting of candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova after Russia's
   invasion of Ukraine. The author concludes that the EU's enlargement into
   the Western Balkans is more about achieving member states'
   stability-security interests than ensuring membership for candidate
   states.},

Abstract = {Using Nadkarni's theoretical framework, this study argues that T \&
   uuml;rkiye has been unable to raise its relations with Indonesia to the
   level of strategic partnership. This study examines the reasons for this
   in two separate layers: First, as a rising middle power, Indonesia is a
   country where the role of the leader in the foreign policymaking process
   is relatively influential. This situation shows that Turkish
   policymakers should take into consideration the leaders' foreign policy
   orientations in their relations with Indonesia. Secondly, Turkish
   decision-makers need to carefully analyze internal factors such as
   culture and domestic politics when developing relations with
   middle-power countries. In this context, although this study finds that
   military and commercial relations between T \& uuml;rkiye and Indonesia
   have reached a significant level, it argues that this is still not
   sufficient for a strategic partnership. Finally, this study suggests
   that Indonesia and T \& uuml;rkiye should build their relations by
   thoroughly considering the internal dynamics in each country.},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed growing concerns about mutual disrespect and
   civic enmity among democratic citizens. Ordinary people often find
   themselves in a particularly adversarial condition in which they
   shamelessly disregard their opponents and hold them in contempt, and
   vice versa. Each tends to assert their superiority while appearing to be
   impudent to one another. Instead of simply calling for mutual
   respect-deliberative or agonistic-this article aims to understand why
   people are prone to treating their opponents with disrespect in such an
   impassioned situation and how to temper the pleasing sense of
   superiority while redirecting its very motivational power toward better
   ends. Drawing primarily from Aristotle's Rhetoric, my account of
   magnanimity shows that the magnanimous can better manage to interact
   with their opponents, retaining their sense of superiority necessary for
   active political participation while at once preventing themselves from

Abstract = {Members with a migrant background (MMB) are underrepresented in
   political parties. So far, most research on this issue only scrutinises
   the representation of elite-level politicians with migrant backgrounds.
   To enhance this literature, I survey approaches toward the
   party-political integration of MMB at the rank-and-file level. The paper
   is centred around the following question; are local party leaders
   committed to the party-political integration of MMB or are they biased
   against them? In two original studies in Germany, including a field
   experiment and a conjoint experiment, I show that local party leaders
   are equally willing to engage in public discourse about the recruitment
   of MMB and general member recruitment and that many of them declare a
   commitment toward increasing the share of MMB. However, this declared
   commitment is in large part driven by social-desirability bias: when
   asked to declare preferences based on multiple attributes of potential
   members, the commitment to increase the share of MMB disappears for most
   parties. Much more than their migration background, the age and gender
   of potential members dictate preferences: young people and women are
   most often mentioned as preferred new members.},

Abstract = {Energy agendas in national parliaments are crucial when countries seek
   to develop their energy futures while adhering to international
   obligations. This article examines how energy agendas emerge and evolve
   in parliamentary debates using data from Finland over a period of 12
   years. By relying on topic modelling, we can show how the key energy
   agendas relate to an overall energy solution, promoting domestic energy
   production and seeking carbon-neutral energy, and how they evolve
   successively alongside general concerns for the country's task ahead in
   the field. Examining more detailed agendas, in turn, validates the first
   analysis and exposes some differences in the agendas of political
   parties. These differences were few. This further specifies the nature
   of Finnish energy politics, which is often considered consensual except
   for nuclear power and peat as sources of energy. The article
   demonstrates that scholars who examine parliamentary politics may
   benefit from the use of language-based computational methodologies to
   uncover insights that have previously been difficult to attain.},

Title = {From formal subsumption under capital to primitive accumulation of

Abstract = {In contemporary Marxist studies, there has been a revival of two classic
   categories of the Critique of Political Economy, namely, `formal
   subsumption of labour under capital' and `primitive accumulation of
   capital'. In contradistinction to traditional usages, Marxists authors
   consider that both belong, not to the historical past of capitalist
   production, but to its actuality. Regrettably, this recuperation has not
   been accompanied by a more thorough assessment of the methodological and
   political dimensions that are contained in both categories. This article
   aims to address this issue in the light of Marx's use of the categories
   of formal subsumption of labour under capital and primitive accumulation
   of capital. In doing so, it will be demonstrated that they refer to the
   same process, namely, the separation of labour from the objective
   conditions of production, and that, given this internal connection, they
   co-evolve throughout Marx's economic works, from Grundrisse to Capital,
   volume I. Moreover, it will be seen that the substitution of primitive
   accumulation for formal subsumption must be understood in Marx's shift
   from a systematic to a historical approach to the historical process by
   which the capitalist mode of production came to life; and that Marx
   adopted this new perspective on both methodological and political
   grounds. The article also discusses the importance of contemporary
   Marxist scholarship of this examination of the methodological and
   political premises of Marx's use of the notions of formal subsumption
   and primitive accumulation.},

   study of women, gender, and politics; help to shape our field; and
   advance outstanding scholarship. Before our first year ended, the global
   COVID-19 pandemic disrupted normal routines for many professions,
   including within the academy. Access to offices, professional networks,
   and fieldwork was halted or severely limited. Both new and experienced
   teachers quickly transitioned to online teaching. Scholars became ill or
   cared for sick family members. Faculty with preschool or school-aged
   children spent many hours on childcare and homeschooling, leaving them
   with less time for research and writing. Not all impacts were
   necessarily negative: those without caretaking responsibilities enjoyed
   more flexibility and often had more time for research and writing as
   in-person events were canceled and lengthy commutes disappeared.},

Abstract = {Although political self-efficacy is one of the most important
   determinants of political participation, little is known about the
   factors that boost its development or reduce structural differences
   between different social groups. This study tests three
   perspectives-socioeconomic background, social capital and supporting
   school environment-to explain why youth belonging to the
   Swedish-speaking minority in Finland have significantly higher political
   self-efficacy than those belonging to the Finnish-speaking majority,
   despite their minority status. Using the data of 5274 15-16-year-old
   students in a multilevel OLS design, this study indicates that a more
   open classroom climate in minority schools is an important predictor of
   the higher political self-efficacy of the minority youth. The results
   demonstrate the value of promoting classroom environments where students
   are encouraged to express their opinions and discuss political issues
   openly.},

Abstract = {Recent political theory has seen a revived interest in theorizing the
   political party, and, in particular, exploring what the political party
   can do to address its decline and revitalize itself. This renewed
   interest, however, draws largely on the political praxis of party
   politics of established liberal democracies in the United States and
   Europe. In this article, I bring Chinese thinker Wang Hui's (Maoist)
   party theory into the conversation. By engaging Wang's party theory, I
   demonstrate how we can understand party decline in nonliberal democratic
   countries with revolutionary legacies. I then analyze Wang's solution to
   the decline of the revolutionary party, which focuses on the intricate
   relationship between individualistic charismatic politics and party
   politics. Finally, through reading Wang in and beyond the Chinese
   context, I show the problems with Wang's theory and discuss how it can
   learn from the party-movement relationship in other contexts.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has reinvigorated debates about the drivers of
   political trust. Research so far has mainly focused on national-level
   institutions, during the early stages of the pandemic and using data
   from established democracies. However, how does this relationship look
   like if we pay attention to subnational institutions in non-consolidated
   democracies, and further away from the initial COVID-19 outbreak? To
   contribute to this line of research, this article focuses on the local
   level and explores the association between individuals' satisfaction
   with COVID-19 performance and political trust in Nepal. For that, it
   uses novel data collected via telephone interviews (N = 1400) conducted
   between 25 April and 24 May 2021, during the second wave of COVID-19.
   Our main results reveal that satisfaction with local institutions'
   COVID-related performance is significantly and robustly associated with
   levels of political trust at the local level. The association holds even
   when geographical and time specifications are added, trust towards
   national institutions or expectations about local governments are
   included in the analysis and the dependent variable is disaggregated to
   discard measurement biases. The study thereby provides important
   insights into the role performance plays for institutional trust beyond
   the national level and in an unconsolidated democracy.},

Abstract = {Political science instructors have started to make use of the ``staff
   ride{''}-that is, the combined study of a military campaign, structured
   visits to related sites, and after-action analysis. Our study is the
   first examination of the potential utility of this pedagogical tool in
   civilian political science programs. Although the specific knowledge and
   skills that any given staff ride promotes depend on its content and
   structure, the potential benefits include four student learning
   outcomes: (1) staff rides show students how we might draw lessons from
   the past and apply them to present or future problems; (2) students may
   derive an enhanced ability to empathize with military and civilian
   decision makers; (3) staff rides can highlight the normative stakes in
   politics; and (4) they can foster connections among the participants.
   This article describes potential benefits of a staff ride, provides
   detailed instructional models based on the Battle of Gettysburg and the
   Tet Offensive, and considers ways to replicate these experiences in more
   accessible formats.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the strategic use of public news media -
   specifically television (TV) - as an instrument of political influence,
   focusing on Italy's 2011 financial crisis under Berlusconi's
   premiership. Using an original large corpus of over 20,000 hours of
   televised news transcripts and a quasi-experimental design, we
   investigate how political influence altered media coverage and,
   subsequently, public opinion and electoral outcomes. Our
   difference-in-differences analysis, complemented by unsupervised text
   scaling of news content, reveals a significant shift from ``hard{''}
   political news to ``soft{''} news on public TV during Berlusconi's
   tenure. Findings suggest a deliberate reduction in hard news coverage by
   an average of 107 seconds daily, which significantly increased voter
   support for Berlusconi's party. In the conclusions, we discuss the
   broader implications of our findings for media independence in Western
   democracies amid the emergence of artificial intelligence-generated news
   contents and the prevalence of algorithmically tailored news feeds.},

Title = {The limits of nonideal duties: a partial vindication of fair shares},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 4},
Abstract = {Does the failure of others to comply with collective duties create
   duties for us to step in and do their share? Defenders of the so-called
   duty to take up the slack answer this question in the positive. Against
   their view, defenders of fair shares argue that we only have a duty to
   contribute our fair share to discharging the collective duty. This paper
   offers a partial vindication of Liam Murphy's account of fair shares. I
   argue that three common objections to fair shares fail to rebut Murphy's
   account. On the reading I propose, fair shares may ground as - or more -
   extensive duties towards third parties as the duty to take up the slack.
   In addition, fair shares provides something that defenses of
   slack-taking tend to omit - an account of the limits of our nonideal
   duties. The paper highlights previously overlooked aspects of Murphy's
   account and paves the way for future discussions about slack-taking in
   the domain of global politics.},

Abstract = {How does the combination of democratization and violence shape the
   public sphere? This should entail an enlargement of the public sphere
   and an increase in public deliberation. Since framing is a powerful tool
   in determining the scope and contents of public debate, what role does
   framing play in democratizing public spheres? Taking the state of
   Veracruz (Mexico) as a case study, we explore to what extent do print
   media allow for an enlargement of the public sphere in terms of both
   admissible participants and issues. We argue that framing practices
   contribute to a paradoxical situation in which deliberation takes place,
   but whose democratic character is severely compromised by the systematic
   exclusion of certain actors and the subordinate framing of certain
   issues in the media. The result is a hybrid public sphere in which
   ostensibly democratic media help normalize violence, authoritarian
   practices and traditional domination patterns.},

Abstract = {Some research indicates that regional integration is more likely when
   power asymmetry exists among neighbouring states. Theoretically,
   preponderant powers can act as regional leaders because they can promote
   the development of collective goods that will entice others into
   partnerships. Other scholars argue that power asymmetry is a necessary,
   but not sufficient condition for integration. The preponderant power is
   to be willing to lead efforts. We argue that the US cannot lead North
   American regional integration when the voting public consumes negative
   messages concerning its least developed partner, Mexico. Negative
   portrayals of Mexico, whether justified or not, lower US public support
   and contribute to limiting the US political capacity to foster region
   building. The data analysis of a national representative sample (N =
   1,133) using an online survey experiment confirms our hypotheses while
   controlling for various demographic factors and candidate support during
   the 2016 party election primaries.},

   which the Orban regime has organized its own symbolic gender politics.
   My key concept is gendered moral geopolitics, and I demonstrate that
   from the 1950s onward, the various hegemony-building projects expressed
   their relationship to other geographical areas, most notably the
   ``Western{''} core, through symbolic gender politics, and the comparison
   of domestic gender relations with gender relations in the core was a
   prominent rhetorical element of these symbolic politics. This historical
   analysis helps to reveal the structural historical roots of the symbolic
   gender politics of the Orban regime.},

Abstract = {Recent political trends and events have been marked by strong
   educational differences. In addition, education has also been shown to
   be a basis for group identity and group conflict. In this paper, we
   argue that educational groups are likely to understand their position in
   society and their inclusion or exclusion (in politics) as being related
   to their educational level. Thus, it is likely that education-based
   affective attitudes are related to evaluations of the societal and
   political status quo. Using data from nine European countries, this
   article charts the relationships of higher educated-bias (i.e., the
   preference for higher educated compared to less educated groups) with
   different political outcomes. In analyses of preregistered hypotheses,
   we demonstrate that the higher educated show ingroup bias, in particular
   those who identify strongly with their educational group. The less
   educated do not show (significant) ingroup bias. Those who have a
   stronger (positive) bias towards the higher educated display more
   political trust and satisfaction with democracy, and are less likely to
   be populist. We measured support for populism in four different ways
   with populist attitudes, populist voting, affective attitudes towards
   populist party supporters compared with mainstream party supporters, and
   identification with `the common people.'},

Abstract = {Across advanced industrialized democracies, the political centre is
   collapsing as politicians on the far right and far left enjoy increasing
   electoral success. Recent research links import shocks to voter support
   for far-right parties. However, we know comparatively less about how
   these shocks impact individual legislator ideology, especially that of
   mainstream politicians. Do import shocks drive economic or cultural
   ideological shifts among mainstream legislators? If so, to what extent
   do local competitive contexts shape these shifts? Using a dataset of
   French Senate roll call votes, we find that localized increases in
   import exposure moves elite ideology to the left economically; this is
   magnified in departments with majoritarian electoral systems. We show
   that legislators shift their cultural positions in response to import
   shocks, but only when faced with extremist political competitors focused
   on cultural issues. Our results suggest the value of attending to how
   political and economic geography intersect to shape elite policy
   positions.},

Title = {Past Political Asymmetry and Present Public Opinion: How Has the
   Asymmetrical Federation of the EU Shaped Popular Opinion of Its Optimal
   Shape?},

Abstract = {Asymmetries in the formal obligations and rights afforded to sub-units
   are mainstays of many federations that have been extensively studied
   from many angles. However, we know relatively little about how these
   asymmetries shape views on federalism in the future. By leveraging data
   on differentiated integration in the European Union (EU), conceptually
   very similar to asymmetrical federalism, and survey data on attitudes
   toward the optimal future of it, I show that historical exposure to
   differentiated integration resulting from a bottom-up process of demands
   for sub-unit autonomy correlates to increased support for permanent
   differentiation in the future, especially among those critical of the
   EU. However, the opposite applies to differentiation imposed by the EU.
   A legacy of asymmetric federalism may thus breed opposition or support
   for unitary European federalism, depending on both the mode of past
   asymmetry that citizens have been exposed to and their views of the EU.},

Title = {The nomos of citizenship: migrant rights, law and the possibility of
   justice},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 17},
Abstract = {Superficially, citizenship appears relatively simple: a legal status
   denoting political membership. However, critical citizenship studies
   scholars suggest that citizenship is first and foremost a political
   practice. When non-citizens, such as irregularised migrants, constitute
   themselves as citizens through their actions, irrespective of legal
   status, these practices of citizenship have transformational potential
   because they are extra-legal. Yet, there is an ambivalence here:
   rights-claiming migrants tend to frame their key demands within the
   terms of the law often by calling for the regularisation of their
   status. This article addresses this ambivalence by adopting a
   `deconstructive method' to investigate the legal dimensions of
   citizenship as sites of theoretical and political intervention. It is
   argued that practices of rights-claiming by irregularised migrants are
   important to grasp because they mobilise the paradoxes inherent to the
   fact that universal rights are enshrined in the constitutional texts of
   modern citizenship in order to generate new legal meanings and horizons
   of justice. This hypothesis is explored through a series of illustrative
   examples of rights-claiming taking place within and beyond the formal
   confines of legal orders. In so doing, the article sets out a novel
   conceptual framework for analysing how migrants' claims to justice
   strategically negotiate citizenship in its legal form.},

Abstract = {Public ownership has emerged as desirable and achievable in the United
   Kingdom in the 2020s. The ongoing water crisis in England and concerns
   about `greedflation' in sectors such as electricity and gas following
   recent price rises have encouraged interest in public ownership.
   Informed discussion is compromised, however, by a gap in public
   knowledge. This partly stems from the distance of time, a generation or
   more, since publicly owned enterprises operated in these sectors across
   Britain. We argue that public ownership is best understood in terms of
   fundamentals. Our proposed typology presents the predominant form of
   public ownership, nationalisation, as a response to fundamental
   problems, or devised as more efficient management of fundamental
   sectors, or established to achieve fundamental citizenship values. The
   typology is developed in dialogue with historical British experiences,
   then applied to contemporary examples of Scottish government policy,
   namely shipbuilding, social care and railways.},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {In recent years, many emerging actors (e.g., new social movements and
   parties) associate democratic problems with representative institutions.
   Accordingly, as a solution, they propose to introduce direct citizen
   participation in constitution and law making. However, three fallacies
   undermine the potential benefits of citizen participation: (1)
   attributing a moral and/or epistemic superiority to ``the people{''};
   (2) assuming that superiority, expecting to replace representation with
   direct participation; and (3) supposing that the legitimacy deficit will
   be resolved automatically by introducing inclusive direct participation.
   This article argues against these three ideas by providing a framework
   to understand participatory constitution making and briefly examining
   the cases of Chile and Iceland.},

Abstract = {This study examines the effects of corruption on public trust in
   government in Africa at various levels and explores variations across
   stable and fragile states. This study uses Afrobarometer data collected
   from households in 2019 to understand whether this link exists. Using
   ordered logit analysis and marginal effects, the study reveals that
   corruption significantly diminishes trust in government. High levels of
   corruption in the presidency, parliament, and local government are all
   associated with declining levels of trust. This corruption extends to
   judges, magistrate courts, religious, and traditional leaders suspected
   of corruption, who are expected to uphold ethical standards. Corruption
   in the office of the president reduces trust in the president,
   parliament, and local governments, while corruption in parliament
   decreases trust in parliament and local governments. Local government
   corruption impacts trust at the local level. Despite a high level of
   corruption in stable states, corruption in the local government is not
   responsive to public trust. The sensitivity of corruption to trust in
   the government is more pronounced in fragile states than in stable
   states. This study illustrates the pressing need to combat corruption
   and rebuild trust in governments. The findings highlight the need for
   context-specific anti-corruption strategies and policy interventions.},

Abstract = {This essay examines factors responsible for the increase of productivity
   in traditional Malay wau bulan and wau kucing kite-making, indigenous to
   the Malaysian state of Kelantan and appropriated by the state as a
   common biopolitical production and symbolic property. This increase in
   productivity means increased accessibility of the commons among the
   community, achieved through state economic support and efforts by the
   community and state to promote the kite-making craft. Such increased
   productivity contradicts Michael Hardt's reasoning that property's
   productivity is usually reduced. Extending Hardt's theory to Ernesto
   Laclau's ideas on the relationship between the particular and the
   universal, the essay argues that the symbolic propertization of Kelantan
   kite making does not reflect a distinction between the kites' qualities
   as common versus symbolic property. Input from selected authoritative
   kite-making practitioners and recent cultural memory shows that the
   Kelantan community benefits economically from the state's appropriation
   of its traditional kites.},

Abstract = {Orlando Fals Borda is the most distinguished Colombian sociologist, due
   to his status as founder of national sociology, and to his projection in
   global academic networks regarding Participatory Action Research (PAR).
   These notions about his legacy seem to cloud another (geo)political and
   cultural contribution to the Colombian nation and to social science,
   such as his understanding of the limitations of the prevailing forms of
   administrative organization to respond to the spatial policies produced
   and lived from the various territorialities subsumed in the secular idea
   of the centralist state. In this work the ideas discussed in the article
   ``The Territory as a social construction{''} (2000) are analyzed against
   the light of the journeys through moors and wetlands that allowed Fals
   to establish a vision of space as variable and subject to dynamics of
   transformation. His sociological understanding of the territory, or
   other spatial categories such as the region and the province, was
   characterized by a decolonial stance that took issue with the republican
   order established since the 19th century, which led Fals Borda to
   controversial positions on territorial planning. The latter are still
   worthy of attention, both for their disruptive geopolitical positioning
   and for their relevance in the current transition from armed conflict to
   peace in Colombia.},

Title = {What Are Crises for? The Effects on Users' Engagement in the 2022
   Italian Election},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Crises were highly relevant in the 2022 Italian general election. The
   label of ``crisis{''} was associated with multiple policy issues,
   ranging from the environment and health to foreign policy. Previous
   studies have extensively discussed the impact of crises on voter
   behavior, demonstrating that voters are particularly concerned with
   parties' valence attributes, such as the effectiveness of policies and
   leaders' ability to resolve emergencies. However, limited attention has
   been paid to assessing how parties mobilize the crisis paradigm on
   social media. This study seeks to bridge this gap by analyzing the
   impact of crisis -related content on Facebook user engagement, with a
   special focus on distinguishing the relative effectiveness of populist
   versus mainstream parties in deploying such narratives. Moreover, this
   research explores how the intertwining of crisis narratives with
   portrayals of party responsibility or irresponsibility influences the
   virality of social media posts. To answer these questions, we manually
   coded 4,827 election campaign posts to create an original dataset. The
   evidence shows that crises have an impact on boosting user engagement,
   although this effect seems to be limited to populist parties. The
   results also suggest that irresponsible claims cease to be rewarding
   during a crisis. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the
   strategic use of crisis narratives by political parties on digital
   platforms and underscores the complex interplay between crisis
   communication and public engagement in the contemporary political
   landscape.},

Abstract = {Ukraine is witness to an unusual kind of war, a Vernichtungskrieg, a war
   of wanton destruction. In the modern age there are few wars of this
   type, the most infamous being the aggression of Nazi Germany. The scale
   of destruction is now very different from then, but I ask whether we can
   nevertheless learn about the forces driving these two events by looking
   at one similarity: a deep historical tradition in both places that aims
   to create empire as well as nation state in the same space, that is the
   effort to build a nation state within the frame of an empire. This
   combination seems to produce the worst of both worlds: the intolerance
   and desire of homogeneity of the nation state, but also the wide
   geographic dispersion and great power ambitions of the empire.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the study of the relationship between education
   and political participation by comparing five European countries:
   Finland, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain. All of them are
   classified in the Human Development Index (HDI) prepared by the United
   Nations (UNDP, 2020), among the most advanced nations in the world,
   although with great differences between them in terms of educational and
   income inequality. Taking the European Social Survey (ESS9) as a source,
   in this analysis we have disaggregated political behaviour into four
   differentiated attitudes based on the practice, or not, of voting and
   the degree of interest of citizens towards politics: civic attitude-
   formal, active type 1, active type 2 and disconnection. Among the
   results obtained, we found evidence of the strong relationship between
   low educational level and political disconnection, we also observed an
   effect of social equalization of education on participation in countries
   with low educational inequality, while in the case of Spain, with higher
   rates of inequality in the two dimensions analyzed, education and
   income, the educational level dominates the explanatory centrality of
   the political behavior of its citizens.},

Title = {Is the Young Precariat a Problem of Modern Democracy? A Case Study of
   Poland},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {This article addresses the issue of the role and importance of the young
   precariat for the functioning of the democratic system. Based on
   scenario planning, it presents three possible directions for the
   development of democracy in the context of meeting the needs of the
   young precariat. The first scenario assumes a continuation of the
   measures applied so far by democratic governments towards young
   precarious people related to social policy and the low representation of
   the young generation in politics. The second involves a move away from
   democracy towards non-democratic systems, where the needs of precarious
   people are irrelevant. The third assumes a new approach among democratic
   governments to the needs of young precarious workers and the shaping of
   new social policies, as well as the creation of incentives for young
   precarious workers to be more widely involved in these policies. The
   empirical context for these considerations is an attempt to determine
   the possibility of the occurrence of each of these scenarios in Polish
   conditions, based on the results of qualitative studies conducted via
   asynchronous interviews with representatives of the young Polish
   precariat. The research relates to Poland and takes into account the
   characteristics of the Polish precariat. The article uses a mixed
   research methodology, combining different methods for solving research
   problems, including collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting
   quantitative and qualitative data.},

Title = {Queer epistemologies and law: erasures in Brazilian research between
   2019 and 2023 and the clashes to the recognition of a queer legal theory},
Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {30},
Pages = {128-151},
Abstract = {This article proposes to address the issue of queer epistemologies in
   Brazilian legal science, from the investigation in platforms of
   articles, theses and dissertations in the period from 2019 to 2023, in
   the concerning the existence of researches that recognize a queer theory
   of Law. In this bias, the general objective of the article is to analyze
   the existing epistemological references in Brazilian research -
   specifically theses, dissertations and articles- available in three
   platforms: Bank of Theses and Dissertations of the Coordination of
   Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), Brazilian Digital
   Library of Theses and Dissertations (BDTD) and Scientific Electronic
   Library Online (SCIELO). From the presentation of these results, it is
   intended to answer the following guiding questions: does Brazilian legal
   research already have a consistent epistemological framework about the
   existence of a queer legal theory in Brazil? What are the challenges in
   recognizing a theory that can serve as a parameter for the development
   of legal research focused on gender identities and dissident sexualities
   in Brazil? The methodology is a qualitative approach, using as a
   technical procedure the bibliographic research and the state of the art
   method, with the subsequent critical and analytical reading of the
   information. As results, it is understood that in Brazil, the conception
   of a queer legal theory has not yet been confirmed, and there is
   research that deals with the theme only in an interdisciplinary way,
   with the support of researchers from other areas, which makes legal
   science still insufficient in relation to the discussions addressed by
   queer theory.},

Title = {Architects of Constitutional Integration: Assessing the Role of the
   Constitutional Court},
Journal = {TEORIA Y REALIDAD CONSTITUCIONAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {53},
Abstract = {Rudolf Smend's constitutional theory, developed in the context of the
   Weimar Republic crisis, sought to address and resolve the challenges of
   that time. The integration concept he articulated in his theory assumes
   the unity of the political community around a set of shared values,
   embraced by individuals from a conviction of their validity. The
   underlying objective of this approach was to find a pathway out of the
   political conflicts that hindered the stabilization of the German state.
   However, Smend's theory surpassed its initial purpose, leaving behind
   interesting points of reflection that can now serve as valuable tools
   for interpreting contemporary reality. The article aims to identify in
   the jurisprudence of the Spanish Constitutional Court some of Smend's
   ideas particularly those related to the process of material integration
   facilitated by national symbols, language, rights, and the notion of a
   community bound by shared values. The ultimate goal is to assess the
   strength of this jurisprudence and consider whether it allows us to
   speak of its quality as a tool for integration.{''}},

Abstract = {Hegel situates himself within the tradition of political realism. This
   is evident in his perspective for addressing political reality. However,
   the philosophical nature of his work, his philosophical system with
   aspirations to encompass the totality of the real, destined for a higher
   purpose -the realization of the absolute spirit in history- ultimately
   narrows his political focus. The historical teleology, in particular,
   diminishes his realistic conception of the political, as this
   perspective advocates for a contingency in historical temporality that,
   as in Machiavelli or Spinoza, does not determine history toward a telos.
   Exploring these tensions between the more political Hegel and the more
   philosophical one, highlighting some of his ideas aligned with political
   realism, and presenting his attempt to reconcile the freedom of the
   ancients with that of the moderns, the particular with substantial
   unity, will be the objectives of this brief exploration.},

Journal = {CANADIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {The legalization of marijuana in Canada offers a unique opportunity to
   investigate a fundamental question about voting behaviour: are voters
   leading parties by judging them on the ground of their issue stands, or
   instead aligning their views to match those of the party they prefer?
   Utilizing panel data from the 2011 and 2015 elections, this study
   investigates how Canadian voters' support structures for marijuana
   legalization and whether they align with parties that reflect their
   preexisting policy preferences or if they modify their views to coincide
   with their party. The findings indicate a positive correlation between
   support for the Liberal Party of Canada and pro-legalization attitudes.
   Evidence suggests a two-way influence: marijuana legalization impacts
   support for the Liberals, and the Liberal Party influences voters'
   attitudes towards marijuana. This analysis underscores the significance
   of positional issues in voting behavior and adds to the long-standing
   debate on issue-based voting in Canadian politics.},

Abstract = {This article critically and multidimensionally examines the
   interrelations among consumption, ethical responsibility, and
   globalization-factors that shape identity construction as well as
   conflict and peace processes in contemporary society. Based on a
   critical literature review, case study analysis, and the comparison of
   various theoretical approaches, the paper explores the transformation of
   consumption, the distribution of ethical obligations in global
   production chains, and the inherent contradictions of global
   interconnectivity. The study argues that achieving sustainable peace
   requires articulating a shared commitment among individuals,
   institutions, and the state, which translates into new governance
   strategies and public policies aimed at social justice.},

Abstract = {A growing literature shows that extreme weather can induce
   pro-environment attitudes. We examine the political effects of a severe
   flood shortly before the 2021 German federal election. Drawing on about
   600,000 survey responses and electoral data, we assess how flooding
   affected (i) the perceived salience of climate change, (ii)
   self-reported Green Party support, and (iii) Green Party voting in
   federal elections. We find that even severe local flooding had little to
   no effect on these outcomes. Additional evidence supports two mechanisms
   underlying this finding: nationwide rather than local effects of severe
   disasters and voter demands for disaster relief rather than climate
   change prevention. We test the former mechanism using a regression
   discontinuity design and find that the flood increased nationwide Green
   Party support, although this effect persists for only two weeks. Our
   results shed new light on the precise duration and geographic scope of
   the political effects of natural disasters.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is the attempt to prove that in empirical
   political science and political ideologies there is no Kantian antinomy
   of determinism and freedom. The analysis is based on Kant's conception
   of transcendental ideas. His understanding of ideas shows why political
   science cannot be called empirical. Politics is unimaginable without
   reasons ability to transcend the world of sense and to think in terms of
   principles that are independent of it. Political judgements correspond
   to the requirements of reflexive judgement and not to those of
   determining judgement. Because of the reflexive nature of political
   judgement, antinomy is solved to the benefit of freedom. Free choice is
   the basis of science and ideology.},

Abstract = {Russia's external and internal borders are a product of Soviet
   nationality policy. Its polyethnic character goes back to the
   pre-revolutionary Tsarist Empire. For the most part, the federation
   consists of the territory of Muscovy, which was settled by a majority of
   Russians, but also other ethnic groups. The areas with non Russian
   populations were annexed through military conquest, economic
   development, agreements on loose sovereignty of the tsar, and voluntary
   subordination. Most ethnic groups were able to retain their identity for
   centuries. The constant territorial expansion offered settlers new
   arable land and ethnic minorities refuge. The centre pursued a cautious
   mission policy: religious or linguistic unification was not a primary
   goal.},

Abstract = {The Putin regime presents its war of aggression against Ukraine as a war
   of defence. Its aim is to liberate Ukraine from ``Nazism{''} and
   confront the hostile ``collective West{''}. To legitimize the war and
   strengthen society's fighting spirit, the regime has appropriated
   Dmitrii Shostakovich's most famous symphonies, the 7th
   ({''}Leningrad{''}) and the 13th ({''}Babi Yar{''}). Sergei Rachmaninoff
   is stylized as a hero of Great Russian patriotism, while conductors
   close to the regime use concerts and competitions to simulate cultural
   normality and perform Russian works to turn music into a ringing weapon
   of propaganda.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the place of conservative-traditionalist
   topics in the actual political agenda of Russia in the last decade. The
   research is based on the materials of the project Actual political
   agenda of Russia in inter-party debate, executed in the Institute of
   Scientific Information on Social Science of the Russian Academy of
   Sciences under the supervision of the author. It was established that
   conservative-traditionalist themes began to enter the country's current
   political agenda since the mid-2010s. Three of the 24 questions related
   to it belong to the foreign policy issue domain, the rest to the
   worldview one. 16 of the 24 questions meet the criteria of including in
   the current political agenda, that is, on the one hand, they generate
   polarization of positions, and on the other hand, they involve a fairly
   wide range of participants in the discussion. Factor analysis of party
   positions on conservative-traditionalist agenda issues revealed two
   dimensions: ``modernists versus traditionalists{''} and ``conservatives
   versus liberals{''}. In the first one, liberals (Yabloko and New People)
   are opposed to everyone else; in the second one, the main opponents are
   Yabloko and Rodina. The comparison of these two dimensions with main
   political dimensions and subject sub-dimensions, identified in the
   framework of the Actual political agenda project, shows that the
   dimension ``modernists-traditionalists{''} correlates most strongly with
   the sub-dimension ``originalists-Westerners{''} in the worldview issue
   domain and the first main political dimension, which in turn also
   correlates most strongly with the same sub-dimension. The dimension
   ``conservatives-liberals{''} correlates most strongly with the
   sub-dimension ``hawks-doves{''} in the foreign policy issue domain. In
   general, the author's research gives grounds to assert that
   conservative-traditionalist topics, which, in particular, introduce into
   the agenda such concepts as sovereignty, great power and empire, play a
   leading role in the formation of the political space of present-day
   Russia, and over the past year it has reached its peak.},

Abstract = {The spatial transformations that accompany the globalization process
   have motivated increasingly systematic social scientific analyses on the
   impact of geographical issues on social dynamics. The configuration of a
   global geography has revealed the importance of territory for the
   understanding of the new historical phase of capitalism and has warned
   about de-spatialization and hyper-historicization in social analysis.
   The article aims to characterize the recent trends that have accompanied
   the configuration of a new capitalist spatiality, placing special
   emphasis on the process that has taken place in Colombia over the last
   three decades. The methodology was supported by a documentary review
   work, especially of public policies and reports from international
   agencies, on territorial planning and spatial inequalities. Also, by
   monitoring social organizations that register territorial conflicts in
   Colombia. The article's conclusions revolve around the deepening of
   spatial inequalities under the new global order and the possibilities
   that emerge to advance a horizon of spatial justice thanks to the
   geographical imagination of the communities and their struggles for the
   care of common goods.},

Abstract = {A French translation is presented here of the last parliamentary speech
   of Giacomo Matteotti, secretary of the Unitary Socialist Party, which he
   delivered on 30 May 1924, a few days before his assassination by fascist
   henchmen. In April of that year, legislative elections were held in
   Italy. They marked the triumph of Fascism thanks to the large majority
   bonus guaranteed by the Acerbo law, as well as fraud, intimidation and
   violence. On 30 May, in the Chamber of Deputies, the opposition refused
   to validate the election of the majority MPs. In this context, Matteotti
   took the floor to denounce irregularities by presenting a long and
   detailed review of the deceptions carried out by the fascists before,
   during and after the elections. The speech was delivered in an
   atmosphere of great tension amid continuous interruptions, shouts,
   noises and insults. It ends with a call for the nullification of the
   elections and a vibrant appeal for the protection of democratic
   institutions and the free sovereignty of the Italian people.},

Pages = {113-133},
Abstract = {The kinship between contemporary Western political systems and the Roman
   Republic is well known, and is sometimes claimed by political actors as
   a legacy. The question of a vote in Rome, although still insufficiently
   detailed, is the subject of a broad historiographical consensus. Two
   factors prompt us to revisit the issue. The absence of any reference to
   Roman elections in revolutionary France, and the lack of a Latin term
   that can be easily translated as ``vote{''}, mean that we should try to
   rethink the issue using a lexicometric analysis. In the 35 surviving
   books of Titus Livius, the lexicometric analysis consists of listing all
   the terms used to evoke the inauguration of a magistrate. As the verb
   creare has the highest number of occurrences, the aim is to identify,
   over a long period of time, how this verb was translated into French,
   focusing on the revolutionary period. The diachronic study shows how the
   translation of creare by ``to elect{''} was not self-evident until the
   twentieth century, but also how this translation is now widespread. This
   result prompts us to return to the study of the construction of a
   supposed political field in the Roman Republic.},

Journal = {LABORATOIRE ITALIEN-POLITIQUE ET SOCIETE},
Year = {2024},
Number = {33},
Abstract = {In chapter V of Curzio Malaparte's La pelle (1949), the autodiegetic
   narrator recounts attending a figliata, a ritual practised in Campania
   that consists in a man simulating the act of giving birth to a boy.
   While Malaparte's highly dramatised account is often cited in scholarly
   works on the subject, this article sets out to highlight the way in
   which the author, far from acting as an ethnologist or anthropologist,
   inserts this element of folklore into a work that is eminently literary
   and ideological, where personal experience and fiction are constantly
   intertwined. In the end, what seems to matter is the spectacular and
   provocative nature, as well as the symbolic dimension of a practice
   tinged with paganism, which combines sexuality, death and birth, rather
   than the rite itself. Malaparte bends the rite to his demands as a
   writer and polemicist, moving from the ultra-local dimension of the rite
   to a more broadly European reflection. In this text, the rite is no
   longer practised by femminielli, ``endemic{''} figures of Naples and its
   region, but by ``inverts{''} from all over the world: the figliata,
   while demonstrating the survival in Naples of an archaic and irrational
   substratum, thus becomes a sounding board for a troubled reflection on
   the relationship between victors and vanquished in Allied-occupied Italy
   and, more broadly, on the emergence of a new society after the Second
   World War.},

Abstract = {The lives of children who live at the intersectional nexus between
   childhood autism and race may be considered as ``shadow stories{''} that
   have remained silenced in autism literature. We explored the experiences
   of racialized parents who provide care to autistic children. We drew on
   a theoretical framework known as DisCrit and decolonizing arts -based
   methodologies. Racialized parents of autistic children demonstrated
   resistance along various themes, including fighting the system,
   protecting my child, and creating cultural communities. We join black
   girlhood studies, critical race theory, and disabled children's
   childhood studies by continuing the journey of decentering Whiteness in
   childhood disability research. We demonstrate how disabled racialized
   communities engage in activism and social justice while forming powerful
   counter -discourses.},

Abstract = {The advent of digital technologies such as cloud computing has provided
   enormous opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to
   digitalise their businesses. However, with increasing cloud computing
   adoption, the security and privacy threats to the SMEs are on the rise.
   By conducting an extensive review of literature, this paper examines and
   identifies the security factors that influence cloud computing adoption
   specifically by SMEs. The literature review focused on papers published
   in ten years related to the security requirements and associated cloud
   computing adoption factors by SMEs. The framework focused on
   understanding socio-technical factors that influence the intent to adopt
   cloud computing by SMEs. The findings attest to the impacts of key
   security and privacy- related factors (including cloud security
   standard, data privacy concerns, data security concerns, skilled
   personnel, technology readiness, perceived cloud security benefits,
   legal compliance and trust in cloud service providers) on SMEs' intent
   to adopt cloud computing.},

Abstract = {The paper addresses the issue, largely unexplored in comparative law, of
   the enforcement of constitutional court decisions. Through the study of
   four constitutional justice systems (Austria, Germany, Spain, and
   Italy), the paper attempts to answer numerous questions that arise when
   dealing with such an unusual topic in the study of constitutional
   justice: is there a general demand for the enforcement of the decisions
   of constitutional courts? If there are rules on the matter, how do they
   differ? What are the reasons for the differences in the regulations?
   Does the enforcement in constitutional proceedings differ from the model
   established by common procedural law? In an attempt to answer to these
   questions, the article analyzes the bodies involved in constitutional
   enforcement, the different ways in which enforcement is regulated and,
   finally, by systematizing the analysis carried out for each legal
   system, it identifies models of enforcement in the European
   constitutional procedural law.},

Title = {The Preferred Governing Actors of Populist Supporters: Survey Evidence
   From Eight European Countries},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Populist parties have been shown to attract many voters disillusioned
   with representative democracies. And some of these parties do indeed
   propose models of government that challenge contemporary democratic
   systems. However, we do not know exactly what the democratic preferences
   of populist party supporters are. We propose to fill this gap by
   investigating the types of actors that citizens who are more sympathetic
   to populist parties would like to see play a greater role in their
   national political system. First, we find that populists believe that
   citizens should be more involved, highlighting the people-centred nature
   of populism. Second, they advocate a greater role for business leaders,
   military generals, and religious leaders, a preference found among both
   right-wing and left-wing populists. Third, left-wing populists show a
   unique preference for scientific experts in government, suggesting a
   technocratic inclination. Conversely, right-wing populists are
   particularly critical of elected politicians, underlining their deep
   anti-elitist attitudes. Our findings suggest that, among citizens who
   are more sympathetic to populist parties, there is support for models of
   government that challenge representative democracy. The question is
   whether populist parties would be influenced by these citizens to push
   for institutional reforms.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to insist on the inevitable connection between democracy
   as a system of government and the idea of citizenship as a bond of
   belonging to a state. It aims to highlight how the modern model of
   citizenship demands new elements to guarantee fullness and equality of
   citizens' rights, to avoid unjust exclusions and to advance towards

Abstract = {The study dealt with current factors related to Russia's geopolitical
   interests in Nicaragua, as another country of Russian interest in the
   Latin American world. For a more comprehensive understanding of the
   issue, the initial situation from the time of the existence of the USSR
   and the Cold War was approached. The aim of the study was to outline the
   key milestones related to Russian -Nicaraguan cooperation and to further
   reflect on the possible goals that the actors involved expected from
   these bilateral relations. The structure of the study was based on the
   historical context, current Russian -Nicaraguan cooperation (political,
   economic, military) and the US position. Methodologically, the studies
   were processed on the basis of a descriptiveanalytical approach. As a
   result, it was found that the Russian -Nicaragua cooperation is a
   continuation of the historical trend in mutual relations, when Nicaragua
   used this alliance as a certain counterbalance to the US, the
   possibility to modernize its army and to reach many commodities of the
   civilian sector, which were also important for the regime. Russia, on
   the other hand, was able to prove its global ambitions, manage and
   expand its influence operations in the Latin American world, and
   ``unnerve{''} the US with its presence. However, for the US, under the
   given situation, Russia did not represent a direct military threat, but
   rather a security risk and a challenge for the future.},

   organizations since 2003 to influence the Russians and Russian speaking
   people in the post-Soviet countries, especially in the Baltics. Russia's
   aggressions in Georgia and Ukraine resulted in a transformation of its
   soft power policies into a hybrid warfare in the Baltics. This study

Journal = {POLITICKE VEDY},

Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This article explores the origins of the Western Sahara conflict, and
   the contrasting interpretations of the factors which have kept it as an
   unresolved conflict after Spanish forces withdrew in 1975. This article
   shows how Algeria and Morocco continue to disagree on even the most
   basic facts of the dispute's history, and suggests that the continuation
   of the dispute is the result of conflicting models of statehood and
   historical narratives. Also, it explores ways in which developing
   concepts within political geography have contributed to understanding
   the ongoing significance of the region for all the parties to the
   conflict. Additionally, this paper argues that the contemporary contours
   of the Western Sahara conflict cannot be seen divorced from the larger
   geopolitical and balance of power developments in the Maghreb region.
   Algeria- Morocco relations in general and the Western Sahara conflict in
   particular are not only influenced by the local political, security and
   social dynamics, but also by the larger systemic and sub-systemic
   imperatives.},

Title = {Consolidating peace? The inner struggles of Sudan's transition agreement},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-117},
Abstract = {The use of transitional agreements to resolve differences between the
   state and non-state armed actors across the African continent appears to
   be on the rise. However, many of these transitional agreements tend to
   be stagnant and fail to deal with grievances, causes of political unrest
   and conflict or to provide sustainable paths to democracy. Drawing on
   the civilian-led Transitional Government of Sudan from 11 April 2019 to
   25 October 2021 (the length of the transitional agreement), and an
   original dataset, this article argues that the policies of the
   transitional government of Sudan, political rhetoric and the challenges
   of implementing transitional agreement policies did not align with
   political realities. This was primarily due to the inability of the
   Transitional Government of Sudan to dismantle existing power structures
   under previous regimes. We find that the Transitional Government of
   Sudan neglected to consider path dependencies of the previous regimes,
   which led to its being unable to provide the people of Sudan with
   strategies that could help to circumvent existing structures set up by
   past regimes. As a result, the efforts of the Transitional Government of
   Sudan acted as exacerbators of existing inner struggles. The article
   argues for the need for better technical support and provisions to
   support incoming transitional governments trying to emerge from
   autocracy or dictatorship to democracy during transitional periods.},

Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE},

Abstract = {The EU has been on track toward growing disunity along geographical and
   political lines, expressed in growing anti-EU sentiments and the rise of
   Euroskeptic forces. However, Russia's invasion of Ukraine seems to have
   functioned as a source of unity - revitalizing the European project by
   creating alliances in response to an external threat. However, as the
   war drags on, it begs the question of how brittle its new-found unity
   may be. This study thus seeks to examine the extent to which the war has
   mended the geographical and political divisions in the EU. Focusing on
   elite cohesion, we analyse social media interaction to provide a
   relational view of the alliances of the members of the European
   Parliament. We find that parliamentarians did not become more cohesive:
   East-Western division remains pronounced, and Euroskeptic political
   groups became further isolated. These findings imply that Euroskeptic
   groups will likely continue to be a source of contestation inside of the
   European Union.},

Abstract = {Although conspiracy theories moved to the centre of the public debate
   during the Covid-19 pandemic and have severe consequences on politics
   and society, the link between Covid-19 conspiracy beliefs and democracy
   has hardly been scrutinized. By combining the literature on
   understandings and conceptions of democracy and the literature on upward
   conspiracy theories, we ask whether citizens who share Covid-19
   conspiracy beliefs have a specific conception of democracy. Using data
   from a representative survey conducted in the East German Land of
   Thuringia in summer 2021 and by employing a fine-grained measure of
   attributes of democracy, we show that Covid-19 conspiracy belief is
   neither significantly associated with support for the idea of democracy
   nor with support for non-democratic forms of government. Instead,
   Covid-19 conspiracy believers have a particular understanding of
   democracy in which power is to be taken away from the political elites
   of representative democracy and more control is given to citizens.},

Title = {Crafting `dynamic interdependence': geopolitical implications of China's
   high-Speed railway projects in ASEAN member countries},

Abstract = {China is offering high-speed railway (HSR)-the most prominent part of
   the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)-to neighbouring member countries of
   the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, those
   countries' agencies have been overlooked while discussing China's
   eco-political interests in infrastructure cooperation. Thus, this
   article examines China's HSR projects in Southeast Asia to identify
   their geopolitical implications, especially regarding the ASEAN member
   countries' impact on China's regional competition. It focuses on China's
   expanding railway diplomacy and the reactions of ASEAN member countries
   and other major extra-regional countries. It argues that ASEAN member
   countries are not passive recipients of HSR projects, as they show
   significant agency toward China. Indeed, HSR projects reveal `dynamic
   interdependence' between such countries on the one hand, and China as
   well as other major powers competing for regional geopolitics. China
   utilizing the BRI to connect ASEAN member countries with its railway
   network for economic, political, and strategic purposes has resulted in
   two geopolitical implications: interdependent relations between China
   and ASEAN member countries, as both sides must collaborate in planning,
   constructing, and managing the HSR and increased geopolitical autonomy
   of Southeast Asian countries, as the US and its allies also offer

Title = {Populism and Anti-Populism in Climate Politics: Conflict Line,
   Contingent Relation, or Tacit Alliance in Climate Obstruction?},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 16},
Abstract = {Denial and far-right populism are regularly blamed for the inability of
   liberal democracies in the Global North to address climate change
   properly. But what is the nexus of populism and climate obstruction? In
   this article, I explore how ideational and discursive approaches to
   populism illuminate mechanisms of climate obstruction. While ideational
   approaches erroneously imply that there is a line of climate political
   conflict between ``bad{''} populism and ``good{''} anti-populism,
   discursive approaches suggest a contingent and relational character of
   populism, anti-populism, and climate obstruction. They not only enable
   raising awareness of the strategic-authoritarian character of far-right
   obstruction and the prevalence of obstruction beyond the far right but
   also prompt that anti-populist responses qua anti-populism contribute to
   obstruction by depoliticising climate politics. Eco-populist responses
   to obstruction that feature a political-strategic proximity to
   discursive approaches to populism, however, overlook an unresolved
   tension between agendas of inclusion via economic growth and agendas of
   ecological limitation. By ignoring this tension, they fail to capture
   societal boundaries of transformation, and they spread unwarranted
   strategies to break through climate obstruction politically. Therefore,
   I argue that instead of establishing a conflict line or a contingent
   relation, far-right obstruction, anti-populist, and eco-populist
   responses result in a tacit alliance in climate obstruction. To overcome
   this deadlock, I suggest research on (far-right) climate obstruction to
   focus on multiple entanglements of authoritarian defences of an
   unsustainable and imperial mode of living.
   Klimawandelleugnung und Rechtspopulismus werden regelm \& auml;ss ig f
   \& uuml;r das Verhindern klimapolitischer Erfolge liberaler Demokratien
   im Globalen Norden verantwortlich gemacht. Aber wie ist das Verh \&
   auml;ltnis von Populismus und der gegenw \& auml;rtigen Blockade in der
   Klimapolitik? In diesem Artikel zeige ich auf, dass ideelle Ans \&
   auml;tze der Populismusforschung implizit zur Reproduktion einer
   klimapolitischen Konfliktlinie zwischen ,,b \& ouml;sem{''} Populismus
   und ,,gutem{''} Antipopulismus beitragen, die aus der Perspektive
   diskursiver Ans \& auml;tze der Populismusforschung bedenklich
   erscheint. Letztere legt einen kontingenten und relationalen Charakter
   von Populismus, Antipopulismus und Blockade nahe. Damit sch \& auml;rft
   sie nicht nur ein Problembewusstsein f \& uuml;r den strategisch-autorit
   \& auml;ren Charakter rechtsradikaler und -extremer Klimapolitik,
   sondern deutet auch darauf hin, dass antipopulistische Antworten qua
   Antipopulismus durch Entpolitisierung zur Blockade beitragen. \&
   Ouml;kopopulistische Antworten, die eine politisch-strategische N \&
   auml;he zu diskursiven Ans \& auml;tzen der Populismusforschung
   aufweisen, lassen wiederum den grunds \& auml;tzlichen Widerspruch
   zwischen sozialer Inklusion durch wirtschaftliches Wachstum und \&
   ouml;kologischer Begrenzung unber \& uuml;cksichtigt. Indem sie soziale
   Grenzen der Transformation ignorieren, verbreiten sie unplausible
   Strategien, um rechtspopulistische und antipopulistische Blockaden zu
   durchbrechen. Daher enden rechtsradikale und -extreme Blockaden,
   antipopulistische und \& ouml;kopopulistische Reaktionen - entgegen den
   verbreiteten Thesen einer Konfliktlinie oder kontingenten Relation - in
   einer unausgesprochenen Blockade-Allianz. Um dieser Sackgasse zu
   entkommen, schlage ich vor, die vielf \& auml;ltigen Verstrickungen
   autorit \& auml;rer Verteidigungen der nicht-nachhaltigen und imperialen
   Lebensweise analytisch in den Blick zu nehmen.},

Abstract = {Historically (and currently) Indigenous languages have been suppressed
   and marginalized within society, inspiring declining levels of language
   usage and L1 and L2 speakers. It can be argued that these declining
   levels of speakership have impacted the tangible and intangible elements
   of Indigenous cultural practices. Although Indigenous peoples have faced
   punishment for using their languages, the reclamation or revitalization
   of Indigenous languages can lead to the recovery of cultural knowledge
   and, in the process, help heal the trauma caused by colonization. This
   article seeks to address the impact language revitalization efforts can
   have on maintaining the cultural practices of Indigenous communities by
   examining three case studies of ongoing revitalization efforts: the
   Tahltan Nation, the Cherokee Nation, and the Lakota Nation. Moreover, a
   theoretical analysis will be conducted following the Sapir-Whorf
   Hypothesis of linguistic relativity and linguistic determinism. A review
   of these practical and theoretical examples demonstrates that the
   language we speak can shape our thinking patterns as well as how we are
   predisposed to view the world.},

Abstract = {Understanding the strategic mindset of the United States and China is
   essential, as their military behavior has significant global
   implications. The study employs a cultural approach to examine how
   historical, geographical, and ideological factors shape their
   strategic-military decisions. By addressing the central research
   question: how do the strategic cultures of the United States and China
   influence their preferences for using military force? This paper seeks
   to reveal the main differences in American and Chinese approaches to the
   use of military force. The time frame of analysis is limited to the 21st
   century, a period marked by China's undeniable rise as a global power
   and the renewed significance of cultural theorizing in international
   relations scholarship. The findings underscore that the ideological
   underpinnings and operational behavior of both superpowers are pivotal
   in shaping their security perceptions and influencing patterns of
   military force application. By examining these elements, this study aims
   to enhance our understanding of how the distinct strategic mindsets of
   these superpowers impact their interactions on the global stage and
   inform their responses to various security challenges.},

Abstract = {We promise to our God the victory of the presidential candidate we
   support, that is the essence of \#nazarpemilu. Promoting of populist
   political communication that occurred on the social media platform X
   during the 2024 Indonesian presidential election campaign. The hashtag
   is a fascinating trend as it combines elements of religion and the
   election, and it did not originate from the elites but rather from the
   supporters. Using a content analysis approach this study aims to explore
   the role of \#Nazarpemilu in shaping faith-based populist political
   communication during the 2024 Indonesian presidential election campaign
   on the social media platform X.. We found first, \#Nazarpemilu contains
   various hopes and promises from supporters to their God for the victory
   of the presidential candidate they support. Second, the involvement of
   some political actors in the hashtag affiliated with parties with
   Islamic ideologies. Third, some identified messages contain strategies
   to persuade other users to vote for the supported presidential candidate
   and strategies to push the movement into the offline realm. Fourth, this
   hashtag has an exposure effect on other users. Fifth, this hashtag is
   also tainted by the activities of pro-Prabowo-Gibran candidate pair
   buzzer activities countering the hashtag with a reversed narrative. Base
   on this findings that populist content shared by users that appeals to
   faith-based in the form of hashtags can play an effective role in
   spreading populist political communication on the social media platform
   X and have implications for voters mobilization.},

Abstract = {How do authoritarian rulers make foreign policy decisions? Building on
   the triangulation of three qualitative research methods, I advance a
   theoretical construct that deconstructs authoritarian regimes'
   decision-making processes in foreign policy. Drawing inspiration from
   al-Sisi's foreign policy, this study argues that authoritarian rulers
   adopt three types of decision-making tools, which consist of structural
   control, the prioritization of securing external support and elite
   material benefits over citizens' wellbeing, and the repression of
   opponents beyond national borders. Although scholars have emphasized
   authoritarian regimes' instrumentalization of foreign policy as a means
   of rule consolidation, they have overlooked their prevalent
   decision-making mechanisms and tools. Building on an inductive research
   approach, this study triangulates data collected using 3 qualitative
   research methods, 20 open-ended and semi-structured expert interviews,
   the analysis of newsfeed content, and discourse analysis of al-Sisi
   speeches from 2014 to 2024. A rigorous cross-validation of data
   confirmed the replicability of al-Sisi's threefold foreign policy
   decision-making tools across authoritarian and hybrid regimes.},

Abstract = {Governments around the world are experimenting with deliberative
   mini-publics as a means of integrating public input into policymaking
   processes, including as a method for directly creating policy. This
   raises the important question of when ordinary people will judge the
   outputs of mini-publics to be legitimate and support their use. We
   investigate how public support for mini-publics is shaped by: (1)
   whether the mini-public is held in response to calls from politicians or
   from the general public; (2) which political party sets up the
   mini-public; and (3) whether there is partisan conflict surrounding the
   mini-public's creation. To do so, we use two pre-registered survey
   experiments fielded in the United Kingdom that focus on climate
   assemblies, a prominent form of deliberative mini-public. Results are
   three-fold. First, we find some evidence that assemblies are more
   positively evaluated when they stem from the demands of local residents
   rather than partisan actors, but this effect is relatively modest and
   does not emerge consistently across our analyses. Similar findings are
   noted with regard to partisanship. Partisan conflict, by contrast, has a
   more robust effect - leading respondents to adopt more ideologically
   stereotypical views of the assembly, with left-wing (right-wing)
   respondents being more supportive of Labour-sponsored
   (Conservative-sponsored) assemblies.},

Title = {Articulating a Delicate Balancing Act: Identity and Ontological
   Insecurity in Germany's Narrative Responses to Israel 1993-2023},

Abstract = {This article analyses how German politicians have responded, through the
   use of political narratives, to notable developments in the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict over a period of 30 years. Conceptually
   engaging with the literature on identity, ontological (in)security, and
   narratives, we explore how narratives have been utilised in Germany to
   mitigate situations which cause normative dissonance, thereby
   challenging the stability of Germany's autobiographical narrative, such
   as Israeli military campaigns or tensions between Israel and Palestine.
   In the first systematic narrative analysis on this topic, we look at 267
   German parliamentary speeches between 1993 and 2023. The article shows
   how German politicians and political parties developed specific coping
   strategies to uphold solidarity with Israel, while overall ensuring a
   stable and coherent narrative of Germany's national identity. We
   conceptualise Germany's narrative engagement as the articulation of a
   delicate `balancing act'. Specifically, politicians navigate competing
   perceived responsibilities and commitments through prioritisation and
   narrative adaptation.},

Abstract = {How responsive are House members to the immigration policy interest of
   constituents, sub-constituencies, and businesses? We test members'
   responsiveness to each of these groups by focusing on House Democrats'
   decision to cosponsor the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act (DDIA), a
   bill that phases out the use of private immigrant detention facilities.
   We expect House Democrats to be more likely to cosponsor DDIA when their
   constituents possess more liberal immigration attitudes and represent
   larger Latino, Asian American, and foreign-born populations. Conversely,
   we expect House Democrats with private immigrant detention facilities in
   their districts or accept PAC contributions from private prison
   companies to be less likely to cosponsor the legislation. Our findings
   show general support for all three expectations. Thus, even though some
   House Democrats are unlikely to take positions on liberal immigration
   reform policies, such as the DDIA, House Democrats are responsive to
   their constituents on the issue of immigration.},

Abstract = {While much of the scholarship on gender and corruption suggests that
   women in political office are, or are perceived to be, less corrupt than
   men, in just the past few years corruption accusations against Brazil's
   Dilma Rousseff and South Korea's Park Geun-hye have made headlines and
   led to their impeachment. In this article, we argue women heads of
   government are actually more likely to be charged with corruption due to
   pervasive beliefs that women, by their very presence, corrupt public
   office. Using cross-national data, we first demonstrate that women
   executives are significantly more likely to be formally accused of
   corruption than their male counterparts. We then present case studies of
   Brazilian President Rousseff and Turkish Prime Minister tiller to
   demonstrate the powerful role of gendered discourse in motivating
   suspicion and inflaming elite and public sentiment and thereby driving
   corruption charges. These findings make a substantial contribution to
   the literature on gender, leadership and the politics of corruption.},

Abstract = {This paper critically assesses Chapters 6 and 7 of On Taking Offence.
   Chapter 6 defends the idea that an inclination to take offence can be a
   `corrective civic virtue' against threats to social equality. Chapter 7
   argues that the practice of taking offence does not change much when we
   turn to analysing our lives online. With respect to Chapter 6, I argue
   that the instrumental vindication of offence-taking as a virtue is in
   tension with arguments earlier in the book, and needs more empirical
   support. Earlier chapters of the book defend offence-taking as
   intrinsically apt and justified, regardless of its effects. What is
   more, if the case for offence-taking is grounded on its effects, then we
   need solid empirical backing; and an initial obstacle to that might be
   that the marginalised are probably less likely to be able to produce
   positive effects through their offence-taking. With regard to Chapter 7,
   I suggest that McTernan overlooks some potentially relevant differences
   between real-world and online interactions, which might make the
   adjustment of our norms to social media interaction more complex than
   she suggests.},

Abstract = {Measuring the level of parliamentary involvement in European Union (EU)
   affairs cannot be undertaken without any reference to the parliamentary
   dimension, an integral part of the 6-month rotating presidency of member
   states in the EU. The parliamentary dimension encompasses all activities
   performed by the presidency parliament, playing a crucial role in
   shaping EU decision-making processes. Although a recently published
   study by Kaniok and Nov \& aacute;kov \& aacute; has addressed for the
   first time the theoretical groundwork for studying this phenomenon,
   their proposed research framework has not yet been applied to a specific
   case. This study addresses this gap by applying the framework to the
   Dutch presidency of the Council of the EU in 2016, evaluating its
   effectiveness, and refining it to ensure broader applicability. By doing
   so, it not only validates the framework but also enhances its potential
   for enabling comparisons of national parliaments across presidencies,
   facilitating the exchange of best practices, and developing a typology
   of national parliaments' roles in the EU presidency.},

Abstract = {The dramatic impacts of climate change presage an inevitable surge in
   mass migration; however, advanced democracies are ill-equipped for this
   impending crisis. Moreover, we know very little about how publics
   evaluate this group of prospective migrants, who are estimated to
   increase from 100 million to 200 million worldwide within decades. This
   study investigates American attitudes toward climate-related migrants in
   a conjoint experiment of more than 1,000 US adults, in which respondents
   evaluated fictional refugee profiles that varied across multiple
   attributes. Findings reveal that Americans (1) prefer political refugees
   over climate-related refugees; and (2) prefer climate- related and
   economic migrants to a similar extent, and that these preferences are
   not driven by concerns over climate-related refugees' integration into
   American society. Subgroup analyses indicate that younger individuals,
   those with high climate-change anxiety, and those who previously engaged
   in climate-related political activities discriminated less against
   climate-related migrants. Analyses of open-ended responses reveal that
   climate anxiety is a driver of positive evaluations of climate-related
   migrants.},

Abstract = {The central question guiding this research is whether municipal councils
   governed by mayors with party membership differ significantly in their
   transparency from those governed by non-partisan mayors. Although this
   is an exploratory study that does not seek to test hypotheses, there are
   ongoing lively theoretical debates about the implications stemming from
   the decline of traditional parties and partisanship, and the rise of
   independent local lists (ILLs) (as well as the rise of new challenger
   parties). Dealing with unbalanced panel data from 308 Portuguese
   municipal councils from 2013 to 2017, we use a Bayesian hierarchical
   model based on a Beta regression. Our findings suggest that there are no
   differences in local transparency levels-as measured by the Municipal
   Transparency Index-in municipal councils governed by mayors with party
   membership and those by non-partisan mayors. Given that transparency is
   a common concern for both party- and non-party-aligned local governments
   as well as voters, this preliminary analysis asks important substantive
   questions about the promises that many ILLs make about their ability to
   clean up party politics and return power to `` the people.{''}},

Abstract = {Racial justice organizations often operate in contentious and volatile
   environments with intense resource demands. This reality was especially
   apparent in 2020, when a global pandemic, social uprisings, and a
   relatively provocative presidential election drastically altered racial
   justice organizations' capacity to engage with their constituents. This
   paper details how we, a team of political science researchers, applied
   civically engaged research (CER) principles in collaboration with two
   local racial justice organizations to understand the strategic dynamics
   of social media outreach, particularly during hostile and challenging
   times. This paper advances collective and practical understandings of
   how CER can proceed, particularly as researchers navigate complexities
   such as defining reciprocity and developing partnerships. Further, we
   present five main lessons learned throughout our CER process. Overall,
   we highlight how CER can improve collaborations with vulnerable
   communities navigating challenging political environments and how CER
   can better inform academic research on the strategic dynamics of social
   media outreach.},

Abstract = {When do political transitions lead to greater inclusion for groups
   historically excluded from power? Scholars and policymakers often assume
   the answer is simple: a transition will result in more inclusion when it
   ends in democracy. Yet this answer is incomplete at best, since many
   democracies systematically exclude women, particular ethnic groups, or
   lower economic classes from power. Using data on political transitions
   around the worldfrom 1945 to 2014, this study shows that a political
   transition's initiatingforce critically shapes post-transition political
   inclusion. When transitions are initiated through unarmed civil
   resistance campaigns they achieve greater advances in inclusion relative
   to other types of transition. We propose three mechanisms to explain
   this effect: civil resistance leads to greater continued mobilization
   and civic activism among the historically excluded, provides greater
   opportunities for elites from historically excluded groups to rise to
   positions of leadership in new regimes, and forges more pluralistic
   norms of political behavior},

Abstract = {The present work will try to address the rereading promoted by Le \&
   oacute;n Rozitchner around the work of Karl Marx. I will focus on the
   first period of his work (1955-1972) with the aim of establishing a
   connection between Rozitchner's reappropriation of the Marxist tradition
   and the historical events that accompanied his biographical career. In
   this sense, Rozitchnerian Marxism can be approached from two different
   perspectives: on the one hand, its ``theoretical modulation{''}; on the
   other, its ``practical-political modulation{''}. This last perspective
   will be the object of analysis of this work, and will allow me to
   highlight one of the outstanding features of Le \& oacute;n Rozitchner's
   Marxism, that is: the enormous influence exerted by the historical
   context in which his work was developed. I will try to show the way in
   which the particularities of his (re)reading of Marx were from the
   beginning outlined by the historical events that accompanied his
   biographical trajectory.},

Abstract = {Prior approaches to evaluating legislative strength cross-nationally
   have focused on the idea of Means Independence, defined as the
   procedural autonomy of a legislature. However, expanded Means
   Independence might not necessarily effect policy effects outside the
   chief executive's preference, referred to as Ends Independence. Spatial
   models estimate the influence of different configurations of legislative
   processes on Ends Independence. Findings show that an increase in Means
   Independence does not simultaneously increase Ends Independence. Ends
   Independence can be guaranteed only when the opposition has the right to
   propose first, and results are minimally affected by new information
   updated through the exercise of Means Independence. These findings
   demonstrate the importance of understanding the overall structure of the
   legislative process to assess legislative power vis-a-vis an
   authoritarian executive.},

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 30},
Abstract = {rom 1972 to 1991, a network of Chicago Police detectives used torture to
   force confessions from over 100 criminal suspects. Almost all were Black
   men, and many were wrongly convicted, some for capital offenses. I
   synthesize insights from comparative research on human rights, state
   abuse, and police violence in democracies to explain why, for nearly two
   decades, liberal institutions in Chicago failed to stop the torture. I
   argue that the nature of state violence in this case-targeting
   marginalized individuals uninvolved in political activity-intensified
   the practical, affective, and informational obstacles that are inherent
   to activating liberal institutions-courts, elected officials, media, and
   civil society-to fulfill their roles as rights enforcers. Applying these
   literatures to atype of case they typically overlook-a wealthy liberal
   democracy-contributes to understanding why state violence persists in
   suchstates and why it tends to concentrate on marginalized populations},

Abstract = {The misclassification of murders results in the invisibilization and
   impunity of gender-based violence. According to Observatorio Cuidadano
   Nacional del Feminicidio figures in 2024, of the 3408 cases of murdered
   women in Mexico in 2023, only 827 were classified as feminicides. Since
   few cases result in punishment, women have protested for justice
   nationwide. The current study examines the effects of media
   representation of feminicide cases. Participants were randomly assigned
   two of four fake newspaper articles about a feminicide case, which
   varied based on the description of the murdered woman and the intention
   of the crime. Participants who received the victim-blaming article
   endorsed significantly more victim-blaming attitudes compared to
   participants who received the non-victim-blaming article. Additionally,
   participants who received the article where the male assailant exhibited
   a will to harm the victim exhibited significantly more victim-blaming
   attitudes. The results highlight the need for journalists to be mindful
   of the narratives they construct regarding feminicide cases.},

Title = {Perpetrators as Victims? Inclusivity and Proximity in Post-Genocide
   Cambodia and Rwanda},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENOCIDE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 24},
Abstract = {In post-genocide Cambodia and Rwanda, low-level perpetrators often
   identify as victims of the genocidal regimes alongside those they
   tortured and killed. However, state and societal responses to these
   claims appear to have varied dramatically. In Cambodia, the government
   and civil society organizations seem to view former Khmer Rouge cadres'
   claims to victim status as socially acceptable and politically useful,
   while in Rwanda, the government and civil society organizations have
   firmly rejected perpetrators' efforts to claim space as victims. What
   accounts for these different societal responses in Cambodia and Rwanda?
   At present, there is ample literature on how authoritarian government
   actors in both contexts have shaped their nation's post-genocide
   transitional justice responses to prevent future bloodshed, while
   simultaneously reinforcing their regimes' sometimes tenuous political
   legitimacy. However, this article offers complementary insights by
   exploring two otherwise under-researched factors that we argue further
   inform these polar-opposite reactions to perpetrators' claims to victim
   status: (1). post-genocide governments' offers of inclusivity in
   defining who is part of each nation's ideal post-genocide ingroup; and
   (2). the social proximity of perpetrators and their victims during and
   after the genocides. Our focus on inclusivity and social proximity
   related to the Cambodian and Rwandan genocide advances scholarly
   understandings of the various factors that shape government and social
   responses to perpetration in the aftermath of genocide internationally.},

Abstract = {The digital transition has become a crucial area of ideological
   contestation, as ongoing debates on digital surveillance and data
   commodification exemplify. Yet, we know too little about how political
   parties tap into these confrontations. This article elaborates a
   critical approach to map the ideological positions that 25 parties in
   France, Germany, Italy and Spain adopt on platform societies. The
   empirical analysis classifies parties' positions to uncover how their
   views on the digital economy and digital politics reshape their core
   ideologies. While parties are distributed along six ideological
   positions, most cases populate three types: Platform Neoliberalism,
   Social Liberalism 4.0 and Platform Socialism. These types represent the
   tripartite ideological divide on platform societies. Ultimately, this
   study provides an empirically informed theory of comparative digital
   politics and the foundation for research agendas on political parties'
   views on digitalization and the relations between ideologies, public
   policy and parties' organizational change in the digital age.},

Title = {Linking datasets on organizations using half a billion open-collaborated
   records},
Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 16},
Abstract = {Scholars studying organizations often work with multiple datasets
   lacking shared identifiers or covariates. In such situations,
   researchers usually use approximate string ({''}fuzzy{''}) matching
   methods to combine datasets. String matching, although useful, faces
   fundamental challenges. Even where two strings appear similar to humans,
   fuzzy matching often struggles because it fails to adapt to the
   informativeness of the character combinations. In response, a number of
   machine learning methods have been developed to refine string matching.
   Yet, the effectiveness of these methods is limited by the size and
   diversity of training data. This paper introduces data from a prominent
   employment networking site (LinkedIn) as a massive training corpus to
   address these limitations. By leveraging information from the LinkedIn
   corpus regarding organizational name-to-name links, we incorporate
   trillions of name pair examples into various methods to enhance existing
   matching benchmarks and performance by explicitly maximizing match
   probabilities. We also show how relationships between organization names
   can be modeled using a network representation of the LinkedIn data. In
   illustrative merging tasks involving lobbying firms, we document
   improvements when using the LinkedIn corpus in matching calibration and
   make all data and methods open source.},

Abstract = {Opposition in autocracies often uses negativism against the regime to
   frame its principal message. This study is the first to experimentally
   evaluate the effectiveness of a negative campaign on a regime
   candidate's vote share. For the field experiment conducted during the
   2013 Moscow mayoral election, we published a newspaper criticizing the
   incumbent mayor. We distributed approximately 130,000 copies near the
   entrances of 20 stations on four randomly selected metro lines one month
   prior to the election. We found that the incumbent's vote share was 1.7
   percentage points lower at the voting stations where the newspaper was
   distributed. These votes go to other candidates who address issues
   raised by the negative campaign. Anti-regime campaigning does not
   suppress turnout or increase disapproval voting.},

Abstract = {How are new generations of policymakers and subjects introduced to `the
   world out there' - and to their own state's ambitions, practices, and
   impacts within that world? While multiple studies have explored the role
   of education in fostering national identities more broadly, the
   relationship between education, mass media and foreign policy identity
   has attracted limited scholarly attention. Using Norway as an
   exploratory case, this article takes a first stab at addressing this
   knowledge need. Theoretically, we institute a dialogue between scholarly
   work on how foreign policy identities are (re)produced through everyday
   representations and practice, and work on how education and mass media
   shape public debate and the subjects partaking in it. Empirically, we
   offer the first study of how foreign policy is communicated to children
   through tailored media outlets.},

Abstract = {What might the foreign policy of a potential Trump presidency or that of
   a Harris presidency look like, and what could their respective
   implications for the Indo-Pacific be? The likelihood that Trump will
   revive his ``America First{''} doctrine, including his trade war with
   China, suggests that the region may be in for another bumpy ride from a
   ``Trump 2.0.{''} A Harris presidency will likely continue Biden's policy
   in engaging deeply (but selectively) with the Indo-Pacific, while
   ``de-risking{''} America from China and resisting Chinese efforts to
   delimit the global commons and deny others access to it. Whether led by
   Trump or Harris, it is likely that the United States will proactively
   take on China but in slightly different ways. In either instance,
   Southeast Asia stands to benefit if the Association of Southeast Asian
   Nations countries play their cards right, but it will be in terms of
   their perceived usefulness to America's effort to counter China.},

   helpfully elaborated pathways explaining variation in the engagement,
   there is still work to be done in elaborating how they develop
   capacities to do so. The issue is significant for our scholarly
   understanding of collective action because the literature currently
   provides contradictory evidence on whether activity in deficiency of
   theorizing that disentangles the impacts of social institutions on
   activism. While this study is interested in collective action generally,
   it is particularly preventional forms of political participation may be
   one of the only tools the masses can},

   Injustice},
Journal = {POLITY},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Recent years' political debates have raised questions regarding how to
   understand individuals' responsibilities for repairing unjust structures
   they may perpetuate, but do not directly cause. Though Iris Marion
   Young's conceptualization of structural injustice has become widespread
   in political theory, disagreements persist due to divergent and narrow
   understandings of intentionality. Some deny that individuals
   intentionally reinforce unjust structures, while others attempt to trace
   causality sufficiently finely to attribute such responsibility. This
   paper offers a novel cognitive entanglement model to move forward these
   debates, drawing on insights from neo-pragmatism and enactivist
   philosophy of mind. This model demonstrates how, to the degree that
   individuals cognitively entangle themselves with unjust structures,
   offloading cognitive responsibilities to them and uncritically accepting
   their logics, we can attribute extended intentionality and, along with
   it, an attenuated form of moral responsibility to inform differential
   obligations in the context of collective action. This framework explains
   how individuals relate to unjust structures, while also clarifying
   methods for combatting structural injustice through cognitive
   disentanglement-regaining critical perspective and cognitive distance
   from unjust institutions. I illustrate this framework's utility via the
   complex case of the United Kingdom's response to the COVID-19 pandemic
   and the structural injustice it perpetuated. After considering relevant
   mitigating circumstances, this model can help move forward tendentious
   political debates, including over individual responsibilities to pay
   reparations.},

Abstract = {The United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) is under-researched and
   undervalued as a forum for the implementation of the Responsibility to
   Protect (R2P) norm. This article analyses the HRC's potential and, as a
   case study, how Denmark approached R2P and atrocity prevention during
   its first membership of the HRC (2019-21). Despite having a longstanding
   positive record on advancing R2P, Denmark did not make the norm an
   explicit priority for its HRC term. This article examines whether,
   despite that approach, Denmark did contribute actively to the
   implementation of R2P on the HRC. Special attention is given to
   Denmark's participation in the Universal Periodic Review, Special
   Sessions of the HRC, interactions with special procedures under the HRC,
   and accountability measures adopted by the HRC. The article concludes
   that Denmark did advance R2P during its first membership and suggests
   lessons to be learnt for the upcoming Danish membership of the UN
   Security Council in 2025-2026.},

Abstract = {Conjoint experiments are often used to mimic political choices that
   people face, such as voting for public officials or selecting news
   stories. Conjoint designs, however, do not always mirror the real-world
   decision-making contexts that individuals engage in because respondents
   are typically forced to select one of the available options.
   Theoretically, we illustrate how offering respondents an abstention
   option can produce average marginal component effects (AMCEs) of
   differing signs and magnitudes relative to a forced-choice outcome. This
   difference depends on (1) the proportion of respondents who would rather
   abstain than select profiles lacking their preferred attribute-levels
   and (2) those respondents' preference orderings. Empirically, we
   replicate two conjoint experiments and demonstrate how omitting a
   realistic abstention option could lead to different AMCE estimates.},

Abstract = {Voters infer traits about political candidates based on their physical
   appearance. Research shows that candidates with certain traits receive
   higher vote shares regardless of their true abilities. This article adds
   to the mounting evidence that candidate appearance shapes voter
   decisions, but it goes beyond existing research by examining how
   variations of gender expression in candidate images affect voter
   choices. We analyze how vote choice is influenced by gender-expressive
   visual cues and find that candidates conforming to social norms perform
   better at the ballot box than those with nonconforming gender
   expressions. However, this effect diminishes with additional information
   about the candidate. Using a data set of over 460,000 candidate images
   and election returns, our analysis suggests that gender conformity
   serves as a ``cheap{''} signal of credibility for voters and washes out
   when other information is available. Our article concludes by suggesting
   ways to combat bias in gender expression.},

Abstract = {In recent years, research on the labor theory of value in the context of
   artificial intelligence has become a focus of social attention. A new
   round of discussion, centered on topics including ``value creation in
   the context of artificial intelligence,{''} ``the applicability of the
   labor theory of value in the era of artificial intelligence{''} and
   ``the development trend of artificial intelligence and human labor{''}
   is under way in academic circles. The core issue is whether the
   classical labor theory of value has become obsolete in the era of
   artificial intelligence. At the same time, consensus remains lacking on
   a number of major theoretical issues. In light of this the present
   study, which sets out to trace history on a problem-awareness basis,
   finds that since the 1980s the economics community has responded
   scientifically to the assertions, made in the context of the new
   technological revolution, that ``machines create value{''} and that
   ``the classical labor theory of value is no longer valid.{''} Over the
   years, new ideas and explanations have been put forward. Reviewing the
   classics, and basing itself on the theoretical framework of Marxist
   political economy, this article re-examines the significance of the
   labor theory of value in the era of artificial intelligence, with a view
   to deepening understanding of Marx's labor theory of value, clarifying
   doubts concerning its validity, and enhancing the practical explanatory
   power of its content.},

Journal = {POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 30},
Abstract = {Does resident diplomacy influence international outcomes? Theoretically,
   I argue that resident diplomats tend to adopt uniquely cooperative
   stances toward their hosts. I test this expectation using a natural
   experiment involving British visa issuance. Starting in 2007, the UK
   transferred visa decision making from local diplomatic posts to
   centralized hubs, located either at third country diplomatic posts or
   domestically. I study this rollout to credibly estimate the causal
   effects of visa adjudication by local posts. I find that resident
   diplomats implement a much more lenient visa policy-transferring
   adjudication to an outside hub reduces issuance by about fifteen
   percent. There is a robust difference between the behavior of local and
   third-country posts, showing that this cooperative effect of diplomacy
   is relationship-specific.},

Abstract = {Do democratic transitions affect citizens' subsequent support for
   democracy? We propose that the type of democratic transition
   (citizen-centered vs elite-centered) shapes citizens' support for
   democracy through the investment created by citizen participation in the
   transition and the expectations this generates about the future under
   democracy. We test our hypotheses using democratic transitions data from
   Geddes et al. (2014) and harmonized survey data of citizens' support for
   democracy from nearly 500,000 respondents in 78 established and new
   democracies over the period 1946-2015. Our results show a consistent
   negative effect of elite-centered transitions on support for democracy,
   while the effects of citizen-centered transitions are less robust and
   much more context-dependent. Using an augmented difference-in-difference
   estimation we can underpin these findings by isolating the causal effect
   of transitions. Our results indicate the political socialization effect
   and long-lasting impact of major political events on individuals'
   democratic attitudes.},

Title = {Sorry Not Sorry: Presentational strategies and the electoral punishment
   of corruption},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {92},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A growing literature has explored various factors that hamper the
   electoral punishment of corruption. Most studies have focused on how
   voters react to a corruption allegation, but this focus leaves out an
   important, common aspect of corruption allegations that voters also
   encounter: politicians' blame avoidance strategies. This study examines
   how politicians' presentational strategies in response to corruption
   allegations affect voter sanctioning. Employing an online survey
   experiment on a sample of 3531 U.S. citizens, we find that politicians'
   action-oriented strategies, such as denying allegations, acknowledging a
   problem but denying responsibility, or acknowledging a problem and
   taking responsibility, are more effective than passive non-response.
   These three active strategies do not differ in their effectiveness. This
   result is robust to heterogenous levels of state-level corruption,
   partisan bias, and political knowledge. Our findings suggest that
   politicians' presentational strategies may undermine political
   accountability for corruption, although they do not fully counteract the
   effect of corruption on voting intentions.},

Abstract = {In this article, we elaborate pedagogies of care, contemplating what it
   means to teach with and about care in the world politics classroom,
   situated within the neoliberal, colonial, heteropatriarchal, white
   western academy. Further, we actively reflect on what it means to work
   caringly and carefully in practice, exploring pedagogy as care. What are
   the dilemmas that arise for scholars and teachers, differently
   positioned in the academy, who seek to teach with and about care in the
   context of a world politics education? How can we teach with care in
   often uncaring educational institutions that are hostile to staff and
   students, particularly those from racialized and other oppressed and
   marginalized communities? How are our practices and methods of teaching
   also acts of care? Building on interdisciplinary feminist literature on
   care, we argue that caring pedagogies can disrupt academic hierarchies
   and foster intergenerational connection. We also position pedagogy as
   care, acknowledging that as we teach, we mourn and honor/care for
   antecedents (both human and more-than-human), nourish our present selves
   and those with whom we interact, and build community/care for
   (visions/versions of) the future. Our intervention contributes to
   ongoing conversations about opening our classrooms as spaces of radical
   possibility in contemporary higher education.},

Title = {The Differentiated Impact of Perceived EU Regional Policy on Citizens'
   Positions on European Integration},
Journal = {POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {575-597},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The main goal of the regional development programme of the European
   Union (EU) is to decrease disparities in the economic situation between
   the regional units of the EU member states. An important side note
   effect of EU regional policy is that citizens should be able to directly
   identify the positive aspects of European integration when realising the
   impact of the EU for structural programmes in their city or region. We
   aim to evaluate this mechanism and ask whether the individually
   perceived benefit of EU regional funds in the home area of a respondent
   has a positive impact on their position towards European integration.
   Furthermore, we discuss how a relational perspective on EU regional
   funds-that is, whether a respondent considers other regions or other EU
   member states to benefit more from the EU regional funds than their own
   region-mediates the expected positive impact of EU regional funds on an
   individual's position on European integration. We answer these questions
   by analysing new survey data conducted in two German states,
   Baden-Wuerttemberg and Thuringia, which differ significantly in terms of
   the regional funding they receive. The analysis shows not only that
   there is a significant difference in the positions of respondents on
   European integration between the two regions but also that perceiving
   personal benefits of EU regional funding increases the support for
   European integration. Furthermore, individuals' thinking that their own
   region benefits more from EU regional funding than other regions tends
   to increase their support for European integration.
   Ein Hauptziel der EU-Regionalpolitik besteht darin, die Unterschiede in
   der wirtschaftlichen Situation zwischen den regionalen Einheiten der
   EU-Mitgliedsstaaten zu verringern. Ein wichtiger Nebeneffekt zielt auf
   die Perzeption der EU seitens der B \& uuml;rger ab. In diesem Kontext
   soll die EU-Regionalpolitik die B \& uuml;rger dazu bringen, die
   positiven Aspekte der europ \& auml;ischen Integration direkt zu
   erkennen, wenn sie die Auswirkungen der EU-Strukturprogramme in ihrer
   Stadt oder Region wahrnehmen. Wir wollen diesen Mechanismus evaluieren
   und fragen, ob die individuelle Wahrnehmung von EU-Regionalfonds in der
   Heimatregion eines Befragten einen positiven Einfluss auf seine
   Einstellung zu weiteren Schritten der europ \& auml;ischen Integration
   hat. Dar \& uuml;ber hinaus diskutieren wir, inwieweit eine relationale
   Perspektive auf die EU-Regionalfonds, d. h. ob die Befragten der Ansicht
   sind, dass andere Regionen oder andere EU-Mitgliedstaaten mehr von den
   EU-Regionalfonds profitieren als ihre Region, intervenierend auf den
   erwarteten positiven Einfluss der EU-Regionalfonds auf die Position
   einer Person zur europ \& auml;ischen Integration einwirkt. Zur
   Beantwortung dieser Fragen analysieren wir neue Umfragedaten, die in
   zwei deutschen Bundesl \& auml;ndern - Baden-W \& uuml;rttemberg und Th
   \& uuml;ringen - erhoben wurden. Diese beiden Bundesl \& auml;nder
   unterscheiden sich hinsichtlich der erhaltenen Regionalf \& ouml;rderung
   deutlich voneinander. Die Analyse zeigt, dass es nicht nur einen
   signifikanten Unterschied in den Einstellungen der Befragten zur EU
   zwischen beiden Bundesl \& auml;ndern gibt, sondern auch, dass die
   positive Wahrnehmung der EU-Regionalf \& ouml;rderung die Unterst \&
   uuml;tzung f \& uuml;r die europ \& auml;ische Integration erh \&
   ouml;ht. Au ss erdem f \& uuml;hrt die \& Uuml;berzeugung, dass die
   eigene Region mehr von der EU-Regionalf \& ouml;rderung profitiert als
   andere Regionen, zu einer st \& auml;rkeren Unterst \& uuml;tzung der
   europ \& auml;ischen Integration.},

Abstract = {The West is experiencing the most intense era of sabotage since the
   Second World War. Russian operations have now reached unprecedented
   levels. It seems that the main aim of this latest wave is to increase
   the West's costs of supporting Ukraine, while at the same time slowing
   the delivery of military supplies. Daniela Richterova, Elena Grossfeld,
   Magda Long and Patrick Bury suggest a new conceptual approach for
   understanding the recent evolution of Russian sabotage operations.
   Russian operations are increasingly organised around `gig-economy'
   principles. This article offers suggestions for countering Russian
   sabotage in this new era.},

Title = {Trust in Implementing Institutions, Ecological Behavior and
   Decentralized Environmental Governance: The Case of Switzerland},
Journal = {SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Trust in political institutions has been found to shape individual
   ecological behaviors and attitudes. In this paper, we investigate trust
   in implementing government institutions (e.g., public administration).
   Heightened trust in implementing institutions is theorized to support
   overcoming environmental social dilemmas, enabling concerned individuals
   to engage in ecological behaviors. Further, as environmental policies
   are implemented across levels of government, decomposing trust
   perceptions in local, regional, and national agencies is crucial.
   Utilizing survey data from Switzerland, we find that trust in
   implementing institutions increases ecological behaviors and
   pro-environmental attitudes. Further, trusting implementing institutions
   can help overcome barriers to action, particularly amongst individuals
   with lower levels of concern. Lastly, we find that the role of trust can
   differ by level of government and ecological behaviors and attitudes.
   These findings support research on the moderating role of trust in the
   concern-behavior gap, exploring new conceptualizations across levels of
   government and measures of policy support.
   Die Forschung hat gezeigt, dass Vertrauen in politische Institutionen \&
   ouml;kologische Verhaltensweisen und Einstellungen beeinflusst. Diese
   Studie untersucht das Vertrauen in ausf \& uuml;hrende
   Regierungsinstitutionen (z.B. \& ouml;ffentliche Verwaltung). Wir
   argumentieren, dass Vertrauen in diese Institutionen die \&
   Uuml;berwindung sozialer Umweltdilemmata unterst \& uuml;tzt und es
   Personen mit Umweltbedenken erm \& ouml;glicht, sich \& ouml;kologisch
   zu verhalten. Da umweltpolitische Massnahmen auf verschiedenen
   Regierungsebenen umgesetzt werden, schl \& uuml;sseln wir die
   Vertrauenswahrnehmung in lokale, regionale und nationale Beh \&
   ouml;rden auf. Anhand von Schweizer Umfragedaten zeigen wir, dass das
   Vertrauen in ausf \& uuml;hrende Institutionen \& ouml;kologisches
   Verhalten und umweltfreundliche Einstellungen f \& ouml;rdert. Dar \&
   uuml;ber tr \& auml;gt es dazu bei, Handlungsbarrieren zu \&
   uuml;berwinden, insbesondere bei Personen mit wenig Umweltbedenken. Wir
   stellen fest, dass die Rolle des Vertrauens je nach Regierungsebene und
   \& ouml;kologischen Verhaltensweisen und Einstellungen variiert. Diese
   Ergebnisse tragen zur Forschung \& uuml;ber die Rolle von Vertrauen als
   Moderator zwischen Umweltbedenken und Verhalten bei, indem neue
   Konzeptualisierungen f \& uuml;r verschiedene Regierungsebenen und
   verschiedene Messungen der Unterst \& uuml;tzung politischer Massnahmen
   erforscht werden.

   \& Egrave; stato dimostrato che la fiducia nelle istituzioni politiche
   influenza i comportamenti e gli atteggiamenti ecologici degli individui.
   Questo studio analizza la fiducia nelle istituzioni governative
   attuatrici, come la pubblica amministrazione. Si ipotizza che fiducia in
   queste istituzioni aiuti a superare i dilemmi sociali ambientali,
   favorendo comportamenti ecologici. Poich \& eacute; le politiche
   ambientali sono attuate a vari livelli di governo, \& egrave; cruciale
   esaminare la fiducia nelle agenzie locali, regionali e nazionali.
   Basandoci su un sondaggio in Svizzera, lo studio rivela che la fiducia
   nelle istituzioni attuatrici aumenta sia i comportamenti che gli
   atteggiamenti ambientalisti. Inoltre, questa fiducia consente di
   superare gli ostacoli all'azione, specialmente tra chi ha minori
   preoccupazioni ambientali. Infine, il ruolo della fiducia varia in base
   al livello istituzionale e al tipo di comportamento ecologico. Questi
   risultati sono un contributo a ricerche sul ruolo della fiducia nel
   temperare il gap tra preoccupazioni e comportamenti, esplorando nuove
   concettualizzazioni a vari livelli istituzionali e varie misure di
   sostegno alle politiche pubbliche.},

Abstract = {In the ancient Roman world, on the threshold between the realm of the
   living and the realm of the dead, dwelt monstrous and anarchic beings,
   known as larvae. By analyzing the figure of the insolvent debtor in
   archaic and republican times, the article aims to understand the genesis
   of these monstrous beings. Following Gianfranco Purpura's considerations
   in relation to the debtor's fate after death and analyzing the legal
   institution of the pledge in Roman times, we will show how, in relation
   to the insolvent debtor, the creation of a larval being is structured on
   an unquenchable debt and the distraction that sanctions its epilogue. By
   subsequently linking the figure of the insolvent debtor to that of the
   homo sacer, we will discover how the relation of exception creates these
   monstrous beings.},

Abstract = {The study investigates the visibility politics used by civil society
   organizations representing persons with disabilities in Russia. The
   article applies the framework of social injustice developed by Nancy
   Fraser enabling the distinction of affirmative and transformative
   visibility politics that allow these actors not only to affirm
   guaranteed rights but also to promote structural changes. The study is
   based on the analysis of interviews collected in Russian cities, and
   information from open sources. It emerges that the reconfiguration of
   civil society results in civil society organizations implementing mainly
   affirmative changes although transformative visibility politics
   challenging ableist assumptions also occurred in the restricted
   political environment.},

   have been raised about the extent to which parliamentary petitions and

Abstract = {This research analyzes the correspondence of the Chilean-Argentine
   historian Luis Vitale during his exile in Germany and Venezuela between
   1974 and 1980. Here we identify a network of exchange composed of
   intellectuals, militants and political leaders of the Chilean left who
   were articulated in the context of the reconfiguration of political
   parties and alliances during the dictatorship. We paid attention to the
   reconstruction of the political organizations of Chilean socialism, in
   relation to the strategies of the revolutionary left to create an
   organization that would allow the unification of its different political
   tendencies. As a result, we reconstructed the political fabric in which
   the idea of forming a platform for discussion and convergence of the
   revolutionary left emerged, through the Center for Social Studies on the
   Latin American Reality created in Caracas during 1978.},

Abstract = {To Tocqueville, the ideal relationship between religion and democracy is
   one of tension, not partnership. Although Tocqueville is often taken as
   a staunch admirer of America's religion, this article shows how
   Tocqueville, through his delicate handling of both the positive and
   negative tendencies of Jacksonian Protestantism, not only anticipates
   common criticisms of American religious culture today but also offers
   theorists the conceptual tools to sympathetically (though substantively)
   critique that culture. Through a close textual reading of Democracy in
   America, this article reconstructs Tocqueville's idealized view of the
   role religion should serve in a commercialist democracy, while attending
   equally to the failures of American religion to serve those goals.
   Having built up this conceptual framework, it then takes a Tocquevillian
   lens to examine contemporary religious culture. Although Tocqueville
   proves to be no apologist of American religion, he does offer one source
   of hope for democratic soul crafting: philosophy and public moralism.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how governance and infrastructure moderate the
   effect of natural resource rents on economic growth using a sample of
   110 countries from 2000 to 2018. The empirical evidence is based on
   panel smooth transition regressions (PSTR). The nexus between economic
   growth and natural resources is not linear and the underlying
   non-linearity is contingent on existing infrastructural and governance
   levels. Evidence of a ``natural resource curse{''} is apparent in
   countries with extremely low levels of governance and infrastructural
   development. The favorable effect of natural resources on economic
   growth requires a governance threshold of -1.210 and an infrastructure
   threshold of 2.583, indicating that countries with governance and
   infrastructure levels higher than these values tend to benefit much more
   from the wealth of natural resources. Countries identified below the
   established thresholds are mainly from Africa. Policy implications are
   discussed with specific emphasis on African countries.},

Abstract = {Access to education and health care are core development goals of the
   United Nations since its inception. Today, almost all countries have
   education and health systems in place. In former colonies, the
   historical roots of these systems can often be traced back to colonial
   times. In this article, we argue that spending on social services for
   the local population was seen as a necessary condition to expand the
   trade-based colonial economy especially in the initial stage of social
   services dating back to the interwar period. Using novel data on health
   and education expenditure in 35 former British and French African
   colonies during the height of their empires (1919-39), we show that
   trade volumes account for a large share in the variance of expenditure
   on education but not health services, and that present-day expenditures
   partly reflect these patterns. Our results suggest that similar
   mechanisms are at play within the two empires and differences between
   them are in degree rather than in kind.},

Abstract = {Contemporary (European) politics is characterised by a strong presence
   of divisive discourses that pit `us' against `them'. The strong presence
   of such `conflict frames' raises three questions concerning the salience
   of conflicts in public opinion: (1) Which conflicts are salient among
   the general public and how do these perceived conflicts relate to each
   other? (2) How does the perceived level of conflicts (i.e. the salience)
   relate to preferences in these conflicts? And (3), is the mere salience
   of social conflicts-distinct from people's preferences in
   conflicts-relevant for populist voting? Survey data from the Netherlands
   from 2020 show that perceptions of conflict are structured along two
   highly correlated dimensions: a socio-economic dimension and a cultural
   dimension, and that the salience of conflicts and people's preferences
   in these conflicts are only loosely correlated. We also find that
   generalized conflict thinking moderates the relationship between
   outgroup attitudes and voting for populist parties.},

   Evidence from the 2022 US Midterm Elections},

Abstract = {After losing the 2020 presidential election, Donald Trump publicly
   asserted that the election was rigged due to voter fraud, and many
   voters also endorsed this conspiracy theory. This article examines
   American voters' belief in election fraud during the 2022 midterm
   elections, with a particular focus on (1) the propensity of Democrats
   versus Republicans to believe in voter fraud and (2) the potential for
   voters to hide their endorsement of such conspiracy theory. For these
   purposes, we conducted a post-election online public opinion survey in
   which we asked respondents' beliefs in voter fraud using both a direct
   question and a preregistered list experiment. Analysis of the survey
   data revealed that Republican respondents were far more likely than
   their Democratic counterparts to believe that election fraud influenced
   the election outcomes. We also found that the percentage of respondents
   believing in election fraud was significantly higher when estimated
   using the direct question method than when using the list experiment,
   which at least suggests that voters do not conceal their beliefs
   regarding election fraud out of social desirability concerns. We discuss
   the implications of this research for the broader literature on American
   political behavior and public opinion about conspiracy theories.},

Abstract = {While devolution in Scotland and Wales is often established as the
   settled will, it has been built on unsettled ground, lacking a robust
   system of intergovernmental relations, and sitting increasingly at odds
   with the central principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Examining
   successive UK Conservative-led governments, we evaluate devolution in
   Scotland and Wales through the lens of the Asymmetric Power Model and
   the British Political Tradition, documenting changes in the position of
   successive Conservative governments, from the more plurinationally
   sensitive respect agenda of David Cameron to the more assertive and
   intrusive Unionism advanced under those in post after 2016, notably
   Theresa May and Boris Johnson.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 5},
Abstract = {Although the research subjects of populism and autocratization studies
   are interconnected, the full potential of combining their focuses-the
   dynamic elements of political systems and institutional dimensions-into
   a comprehensive and systematic conceptual framework remains
   underexploited. This study makes a stride in this direction by reviewing
   and connecting these areas through the concepts of populist
   autocratization and populist electoral autocracies. These concepts aim
   to deepen our understanding of the nature of contemporary
   autocratization and the stability of autocracies. While the study is
   primarily theoretical-conceptual in nature, it also engages with
   methodological and operationalization considerations, and outlines a
   brief research agenda to demonstrate the empirical applicability of the
   analytical framework and lays the foundation for future research.},

Abstract = {The Scottish independence movement and its leadership have claimed `time
   is on our side', citing the increased support for independence among
   younger citizens as evidence a future referendum would be more likely to
   deliver a `Yes' result. Even amid protracted crises and tumultuous
   leadership changes within the Scottish National Party, observers still
   point to robust support for independence among younger voters as
   evidence of future change. Assessing this claim is important because it
   clarifies the role of different cleavages in Scottish and British
   politics and it helps us understand the motivations on both sides for
   trying to control the timing of any future independence referendum. In
   this research note, we assess the claim that time sides with the
   pro-independence movement, using data from the Scottish Social Attitudes
   Surveys and the Scottish Election Study from 1999 to 2021. Overall, we
   find limited support for the claim that generational replacement will
   help the pro-independence movement. Based on data from 1999 to 2021, the
   most appropriate interpretation is that time will neither help nor hurt
   the independence movement. Therefore, we need to treat claims on this
   topic from political actors with caution.},

Abstract = {Elections in Iran are considered to be an exercise conducted by the
   ruling regime as a show to prove its legitimacy and popularity among the
   common masses. It is because the president in Iran, unlike other states,
   is not a head of state; instead the power is vested in the hands of the
   Supreme Leader. On the other hand, the Iranian constitution gives the
   president the executive powers, while the Supreme Leader is responsible
   for marking the redlines of the political system. Hence, by default, any
   individual that ascends to the seat of presidency would be loyal to the
   Supreme Leader and by extension, to the Iranian system regardless of its
   political affiliation. Nonetheless, many experts based in the Western
   capitals often misinterpret the victory of the pro-reform faction as a
   success of anti-state sentiments in Iran. The victory of Masoud
   Pezeshkian, a pro-reform figure in Iran's presidential elections is seen
   as a potential rift between the state's vision and people's choice. To
   understand these political dynamics in Iran, it is imperative to analyse
   the 2024 presidential elections of Iran.},

Abstract = {Based on a qualitative study, we set out to learn about the experiences
   of indigenous women in Tartagal, Argentina with respect to criminal
   prosecutions of violence against women. Due to the institutional
   violence that exists in the area between indigenous communities and the
   state, as well as the lack of integration of the indigenous perspective
   into legal norms, indigenous women are isolated from existing resources
   in the territory.},

Abstract = {This article examines the politicization of Salafism in the UK over the
   past two decades - shedding light on why and how some Salafi actors,
   particularly those belonging to Haitham al-Haddad's network, are
   increasingly engaging in formal and informal political activities rather
   than da'wa (missionary work). It is based on more than 70 interviews
   with British Salafis and 20 months of participant observation within
   Salafi communities in London between 2017 and 2020, as well as content
   analysis of Salafi websites and social media. It argues that owing to
   increased exclusion and marginalization of British Muslims within the
   British public sphere, some Salafis have begun to organize protests,
   vote in UK elections, campaign, wage legal battles, and contest the
   marginalization of British Muslims through the production of
   counterhegemonic discourses. It draws on counterpublic theory to explain
   how exclusion from the public sphere can lead to greater political
   activity by highlighting how counterpublics enable marginalized
   communities to regroup and train for agitational activities. This
   article contributes to our understanding of the causes and consequences
   of the politicization of Salafi actors in European Muslim-minority
   contexts, as well as to our understanding of the politicization of
   religious actors more generally.},

Title = {Partisan Differences in Voters' Desire for Punishment in Response to
   Politicians' Moral Transgressions},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {Research shows that politicians are often not electorally punished for
   immoral behavior. Yet, voters may still desire to see politicians
   punished outside of the election context for committing moral
   transgressions. Moreover, these desires may be conditioned by the
   partisanship of the voter, the transgressor, and voters' perceptions of
   moral violation severity. To examine such effects, we conduct a vignette
   study asking 2997 U. S. respondents to consider politicians' moral
   violations. We randomly varied the moral principle violated (Care,
   Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity, and a social norm violation) and
   the partisanship of the politician (Republic/Democrat/Nonpartisan). When
   voters perceive the severity of a moral violation to be low, Republicans
   express a stronger desire to punish than do Democrats. Republicans'
   desire for punishment depends on the group of the transgressor, with
   higher levels of punitiveness desired for out-party transgressors than
   in-party. However, when voters perceive severity to be moderate or high,
   Democrats have the stronger desire to punish the politician involved,
   but they show no in-party bias. Across the moral violations presented,
   Republicans and Democrats differ in perceptions of severity of
   politicians' immoral behavior. Results show partisan voters'
   heterogeneity in punitiveness, with the relationship strongly mediated
   by perceived severity of the moral violation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 21},
Abstract = {This article contributes to the scholarship on Giuseppe Mazzini's impact
   on British radicalism, through an analysis of British idealist
   engagements with his life and writings between 1858 and 1929. Section
   one introduces the topic. Section two sketches a background for the
   analysis, highlighting Mazzini's place within the milieu of European
   exiles living in Britain from the 1840s to the 1870s, ultimately
   focusing on Mazzini's engagements at Oxford. Section three explores the
   ways in which, despite areas of agreement, ultimately the Weltanschauung
   of the foundational figure in British idealist social and political
   thought and practice, Thomas Hill Green, differed fundamentally from
   that of Mazzini. Section four argues that despite these fundamental
   philosophical differences, Green's practical political theory drew
   directly on Mazzini's writings, although differing over the crucial
   issue of the proper role of the state in the republic. From this basis,
   section five analyses the engagements with Mazzini's writings by the
   next generation of British idealists, especially John MacCunn. The
   analysis concludes that although in 1881 Toynbee had reasonable grounds
   for characterising Mazzini as `the true teacher of our age,' this claim
   became increasingly unsustainable from the late 1880s onwards, as
   evolutionary theory came to ground British idealist political thought.},

Abstract = {Rural voters are often portrayed as a monolith of White and
   conservative, although 22\% of the rural population are non-White. Rural
   minorities, specifically Black rural voters, intersect two potentially
   competing identities informing political partisanship. First, place:
   there is a growing geographic schism between rural and urban voters,
   with rural voters aligning more closely with the Republican party.
   Second, race: there is a political gap between White and Black voters,
   with Black voters aligning more closely with the Democratic party. Using
   data from the 2019 and 2020 ANES Studies I investigate the effects of
   these intersecting identities on political identification accounting for
   rural resentment. Rural resentment, or feelings of a loss of political
   power to urban areas, is found among both White and Black rural voters.
   For Black rural voters, a strong race identity can buffer the effects of
   rural resentment, keeping them from pushing toward the Republican party.},

Abstract = {There is a growing literature investigating the attitudes of political
   elites and citizens in a range of areas, and this article uses matched
   survey data of British MPs and voters to contribute a new comparison of
   their views on climate change. It finds limited evidence of systematic
   differences between MPs' and voters' attitudes to climate change:
   neither group is clearly more concerned about the issue than the other
   nor more polarized along partisan lines. However, there does appear to
   be incongruence between MPs' and voters' views on some specific climate
   policies. The research builds on previous analyses of British MPs'
   approaches to climate change, including finding that party identity is
   more useful in predicting their perspectives on climate change than
   their perception of public attitudes.},

   on the distribution of conditional grants (2004-2017)},
Journal = {REGIONAL AND FEDERAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 9},
Abstract = {Are grants strategically allocated to towns where ministers live? This
   question is investigated using panel data covering four legislative
   periods and 293 Flemish municipalities. The findings provide clear
   evidence of hometown bias. Ministerial careers related to local
   embeddedness explain differences in received conditional grants.
   Ministers, who were once mayors, started their careers locally or
   predominantly developed upper-level careers to bring more resources to
   their hometowns. Conversely, ministers, recruited from outside politics,
   do not generate extra resources. During local election years, ministers
   in key positions on local lists (leader or pusher) also secure
   significantly more funding. Investigating grants during federal,
   regional, and local election years consistently reveals significant
   hometown bias. This trend persists across various ministerial career
   trajectories, particularly for ministers who began their careers locally
   or served as mayors, highlighting the impact of ministerial local
   embeddedness on grant distribution.},

Abstract = {Against a backdrop of the post-1945 capitalist reaction against the New
   Deal, this contribution by Richard Wolff to a Festschrift for Jack
   Amariglio traces Jack's development as a student and activist, first at
   the City College New York (CCNY) and then as part of the graduate
   program in economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. This
   period was followed by Jack's decisive engagement with the group that
   would found the journal Rethinking Marxism during the 1980s and `90s,
   with Jack serving as its first editor. The essays follow through to
   Jack's own development of a novel synthesis of postmodernism and
   Marxism, provoking and providing new theoretical standpoints from which
   to work, both from within and without the field of economics.},

   Foreign Direct Investment},

Volume = {86},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1060-1074},

Abstract = {This article investigates the effects of US sanctions on Chinese public
   and private overseas foreign direct investment (FDI). Using data for up
   to 112 developing countries from 2005 to 2015, we find that Chinese
   state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are more likely to invest in countries
   threatened or targeted with US sanctions relative to Chinese privately
   owned enterprises (POEs) because they have the Chinese government's
   backing and are larger in number and size, motivating them to invest in
   higher-risk states. The Chinese government also reaps political benefits
   by Chinese SOEs investing abroad, enhancing China's economic strength
   and decreasing its rivals' influence. We obtain similar results for
   Chinese SOEs and POEs regardless of the investment sector and conduct
   additional robustness checks that further reinforce the main findings.
   Our study provides insights into how China's overseas FDI increases its
   economic and political reach across the globe at the possible expense of
   the United States.},

Abstract = {While some assert that social identities have become more salient in
   American media coverage, existing evidence is largely anecdotal. An
   increased emphasis on social identities has important political
   implications, including for polarization and representation. We first
   document the rising salience of different social identities using
   natural language processing tools to analyze all tweets from 19 media
   outlets (2008-2021) alongside 553,078 URLs shared on Facebook. We then
   examine one potential mechanism: Outlets may highlight meaningful social
   identities-race/ethnicity, gender, religion, or partisanship-to attract
   readers through various social and psychological pathways. We find that
   identity cues are associated with increases in some forms of engagement
   on social media. To probe causality, we analyze 3,828 randomized
   headline experiments conducted via Upworthy. Headlines mentioning
   racial/ethnic identities generated more engagement than headlines that
   did not, with suggestive evidence for other identities.
   Identity-oriented media coverage is growing and rooted partly in
   audience demand.},

Title = {Women Running for Office Are Less Risk Averse than Men: Evidence from
   Portugal},

Abstract = {Prior work shows that women are, on average, more risk averse than men.
   This evidence has been used to theorize about gender differences in
   elite behavior. However, whether differences in risk aversion hold among
   the subset of citizens willing to run for office remains an open
   question. We report a preregistered experiment with parliamentary
   candidates in Portugal and find that women candidates are less risk
   averse than men candidates. This effect is driven by risk preferences in
   public investments and is not explained by gender differences in
   political experience. The findings are consistent with a process of
   gendered (self-)selection in which women risk-takers are
   disproportionately attracted to enter a men-dominated career and run for
   office. Despite requiring future validation in different contexts, the
   evidence highlights the challenges of extrapolating from citizen samples
   to study elite behavior and suggests that risk perceptions are a
   relevant supply-side determinant of women representation.},

Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},

Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Numerous studies show that properly designed economic sanctions can
   force the target to refrain from violating international norms. However,
   policymakers cannot integrate this finding into their ex ante
   assessments of whether more forceful coercive measures could prevent
   military coups, human rights violations, or a war of aggression such as
   the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In this article, we address this
   shortcoming and introduce counterfactual predictions to answer the
   what-if question of whether adequate sanctions by the European Union and
   the United States could have provoked targets to abandon severe norm
   violations. To this end, a training data set from 1989 to 2008 is used
   to predict the success of sanctions from 2009 to 2015. Our policy
   counterfactuals for key sanction cases suggest that stricter EU coercion
   against Russia after the annexation of Crimea could have triggered
   policy concessions from the regime of President Putin.},

Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The current deconsolidation of liberal democracies has brought to the
   surface a discourse which was current in the 19th century but seemed
   refuted by the experience of 20th century totalitarianism: the
   affirmation of the absence of a necessary link between liberalism and
   democracy and, consequently, of the possibility of their being placed in
   antithesis. The diffusion of the phrases ``illiberal democracy{''} and
   ``authoritarian liberalism{''} illustrates the success of the idea
   according to which we are witnessing, after a long marriage, a divorce
   of liberalism and democracy. This idea neglects, however, that a
   dissociation of liberalism and democracy would mean a regression of
   both, their involution towards embryonic or underdeveloped forms.
   Certainly, because the liberal idea and the democratic idea do not have
   the same center of gravity, their link is dialectical; but it is only
   dialectical because it is based on conceptual solidarity.},

Title = {Conflict and Peace: An Approaching to Forgiveness in Colombia},
Journal = {CIUDAD PAZ-ANDO},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {The armed conflict in Colombia has left a deep mark on society, leading
   to various transitional justice strategies aimed at ensuring truth,
   justice, reparation, and non-repetition. In this context, forgiveness
   emerges as a key element of reconciliation, though its meaning and
   application generate debates and resistance. This study analyzes the
   relationship between the Comprehensive System for Peace (SIP) and the
   concept of forgiveness in Colombia's post-conflict period, using a
   documentary approach and an educational experience with 11th-grade
   students in Cucuta. The methodology combines legal analysis with
   classroom-based documentary matrix construction, allowing young people
   to reflect on the role of forgiveness in restorative justice and its
   compatibility with truth and reparation. Findings reveal that
   perceptions of forgiveness are influenced by social, educational, and
   emotional factors, highlighting the need to strengthen peace education.
   Finally, the study concludes that forgiveness is not a requirement for
   justice but a possibility that depends on genuine processes of
   recognition and reparation.},

   regulatory framework, composition, functions and appointments made
   during the period, this paper addresses two important issues arising for
   the Guanajuato's experience. The first is whether the Appointment
   Comission should be considered an authority for the purpose of `juicio

   not have the power to evaluate and, if necessary, to remove the people
   that they appointed. This work also offers some ideas to strengthen and
   legitimize the work of the Comission, concluding with a brief

Abstract = {The Spanish Political Attitudes Panel Dataset (POLAT) is an ongoing
   panel study carried out in Spain. The present research note introduces
   the dataset, and presents some results of the first six waves, fielded
   in political context defined by a prolonged economic recession, major
   corruption scandals and widespread mass protests (2010-2014). The
   longitudinal aspect of the dataset allows researchers to trace changes
   and exploit within-individual variation in a wide array of political,
   social and economic attitudes and behaviors. The note offers validity
   checks for some of the key empirical indicators against the benchmark of
   concurrent surveys, including the European Social Survey. Finally, the
   note illustrates the potential of POLAT for the analysis of change in
   political attitudes and behaviors.},

Abstract = {How is the experience of ethnic conflict associated with ethnic
   identity? While the study of ethnic identity has often focused on the
   role of political institutions, we contribute to the discussion that the
   experience of ethnic conflict should be considered as an important
   factor that can influence ethnic identity. Further, studies that examine
   the impact of ethnic conflict on ethnic identity have not reached a
   consensus about whether ethnic conflict hardens or weakens ethnic
   identity. Thus we aim to expand this scholarship by using survey data
   across 33 countries to formulate a generalizable argument regarding the
   effects of ethnic conflict on ethnic identity. The results of our
   analysis show that within their ethnic groups, the experience of ethnic
   conflict is associated with a stronger sense of ethnic identity.
   However, we also find evidence that there is a U-shaped relationship
   between conflict duration and ethnic identity. In other words, although
   a longer conflict duration is initially associated with a weakened
   ethnic identity, a longer conflict duration eventually strengthens the
   sense of ethnic identity again.},

Abstract = {The phrase ``action-reaction{''} has been frequently reiterated in
   public speeches by Malaysian leaders, formal documents, and
   behind-the-scenes discussions. This article contends that this
   expression operates as a manifestation of Malaysian policymakers'
   comprehension of the security dilemma and their strategic assessment of
   their position within a security ecosystem. As part of the
   interconnected web of relationships among regional actors, any
   disturbance has the potential to draw Malaysia, as a small state, into
   an extended cycle of crises. This article draws on Malaysia's conduct in
   the South China Sea (1970-2023). To mitigate risks, in alignment with
   various scholarly perspectives, Malaysia adopts a hedging strategy
   involving tradeoffs and contingency plans. Beyond hedging, a more
   proactive perspective is also emphasized: when Malaysia identifies
   affordances or opportunities to act within the security ecosystem, it
   endeavors to leverage them for its benefit.},

Title = {Errors and Calibration in Mail Ballot Signature Rejections},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {52},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Many U.S. states require election workers to check signatures on ballots
   returned by mail, causing tens of thousands of ballots to be rejected at
   each general election. This paper applies Bayes' theorem, along with
   findings from prior research, to show how rejection rates are likely to
   vary under plausible assumptions about signature checker accuracy and
   the prevalence of invalid signatures. This approach yields a pair of
   predictions. On the one hand, given findings from research on
   handwriting forensics, the Bayesian analysis implies election workers
   are more likely to wrongly reject valid ballots for purported signature
   mismatch than to correctly reject invalidly signed returns. On the other
   hand, research on election workers as problem-solvers suggests they may
   try to minimize the wrongful rejection of ballots. I find empirical
   support for each prediction, including signs that election workers learn
   from past errors to calibrate signature rejection rates downwards. This
   suggests election worker discretion may be an unexpected source of
   resilience against laws otherwise liable to disenfranchise eligible
   voters, although I also discuss conditions under which such discretion
   may conflict with democratic norms.},

Abstract = {Curfews are commonly used by governments to control restive populations
   during conflict, but are they effective? Although the primary goal for
   governments is to increase military advantage, they also cause
   significant disruptions to civilian life which may provoke a backlash.
   In this study, we analyze the effect of curfews on public attitudes and
   rebel attacks in Turkey. Exploiting the closeness of two national
   elections and the implementation of curfews between these elections, we
   employ novel data in a difference-in-difference analysis to examine
   effects on voting and violence. Our results show that curfews provoke a
   dual backlash effect. First, they decrease support for the ruling party
   and increase support for Kurdish and Turkish national opposition parties
   in the areas where they are implemented. Second, they increase the
   number of rebel attacks in the areas that experience a curfew. This
   paper provides robust evidence for the backlash effects of
   indiscriminate non-violent tactics.},

Abstract = {Women in male-dominated organizations often must adopt more
   stereotypical masculine traits to advance within those hierarchies.
   While politics, historically male-dominated, should induce women to
   blend in, increasing numbers of women in parliaments may give women the
   opportunity to stand out by not adopting a masculine style. This paper
   investigates how these contradictory incentives influence female Members
   of Parliament (MPs) in 24 democracies between 1987 and 2022, applying
   machine learning to 6.8 million parliamentary speeches to measure how
   feminine is their speaking style. Findings indicate a socialization
   effect, whereby women adopt a more masculine style the longer they stay
   in office, even after controlling for their speeches' topics. The effect
   is strongest for women in socially progressive parties. This research
   highlights the role of parliaments as gendered workplaces, which still
   lead women to adapt to the male norm, and helps us understand the
   incentives that shape how women represent women in parliament.},

Abstract = {What effect do gender quotas have on political responsiveness? We
   examine the effect of randomly imposed electoral quotas for women in
   Mumbai's city council, using a wide variety of objective and subjective
   measures of constituency-level public service quality. Quotas are
   associated with differences in the distribution of legislator effort,
   with quota members focusing on public goods distribution, while
   non-quota members focus on individual goods, member perks, and identity
   issues. These differences in effort seem to influence institutional
   performance: perceived quality of local public goods is higher in
   constituencies with quota members, and citizen complaints are processed
   faster in areas with more quota members. We suggest that men's more
   extensive engagement with extralegal and rhetorical forms of political
   action has led to men and women cultivating different styles of
   political representation.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 epidemic came at a sensitive time for Russia's leadership,
   which was attempting a political reset and structural reforms, including
   the removal of President Putin's presidential term limits. This article
   examines how issues related to the pandemic provided new opportunities
   for the systemic opposition, the Communist Party of the Russian
   Federation, who emerged as the main beneficiaries after capitalising on
   opportunities created by the epidemic. The underappreciated role of
   systemic opposition parties in electoral authoritarian systems, which
   balance ``voice{''} and ``loyalty{''} to benefit both themselves and the
   regime, is examined in the context of the Covid-19 crisis.},

Abstract = {Invalid votes are pervasive in many democracies and can threaten the
   legitimacy of elections. While often associated with factors such as
   choice complexity and disengagement, especially under compulsory voting
   rules, intentional ballot spoiling can also signal a political protest.
   We examine the argument that spoiling ballots as protest should occur
   under compulsory voting where voters perceive limited legitimacy to the
   electoral process and a lack of viable options. Using municipal
   elections in Ecuador, a context featuring both compulsory voting and a
   period of democratic erosion, we examine subnational variation in both
   spoiled and blank ballots. While factors related to sophistication and
   choice complexity explain variation in both forms of invalid voting, our
   results also reveal patterns consistent with the expectation that
   spoiled ballots reflect a protest of a lack of competition in the
   political system. Specifically, we find that areas opposed to Rafael
   Correa's dominant party had a higher rate of spoiled ballots in the 2014
   mayoral elections, a period when party dominance was consolidated and
   competition weak. This pattern declined in 2019 when the system's
   competitiveness increased. A separate analysis of the 2019 elections for
   the Correa-era participatory governance body suggests continued use of
   spoiled ballots as protest by opposition voters, but primarily in higher
   connectivity areas where the online coordination on use of this tactic
   may have had greater influence. Overall, our study sheds light on
   factors shaping invalid vote patterns in compulsory systems and
   highlights spoiled ballots' potential as a means to signal protest under
   conditions where some voters would perceive a decline in the legitimacy
   of democratic institutions.},

Abstract = {In political science, federalism is often treated as an ``antithesis{''}
   to empire. While Canadian Politics has recently become more attentive to
   the importance of ongoing settler colonialism as conditioning Canadian
   political life writ large, this has yet to induce a paradigm shift in
   understanding how the institutional logics of the state were established
   by, and in order to advance, colonial and imperial ends. This article
   contributes to this broader understanding by exploring how, in Canada,
   the federal arrangement congeals a constitutionalized whiteness that
   facilitates both the internal coherence of a settler class and its
   subsequent continental expansion. Attentive to the importance of this
   constitutional development within a world-spanning imperial context,
   this article also suggests that the simultaneous innovation of Dominion
   status contoured the early twentieth-century's global colour line, as
   self-determination was increasingly devolved to other white settler
   polities. The contradictory realities of these processes are also noted.

Abstract = {The scarcity of resources, the tendency towards the fragmentation of the
   globalized world into semi-autonomous blocks, and the ``third world war
   in pieces{''} require an acceleration in developing alternative
   products. Alternative fuels can complement or, in the future, replace
   traditional ones, allowing the same freedom of movement of people and
   commodities. Investments in developing e-fuels and HVO (Hydrotreated
   Vegetable Oil) diesel are increasing, and this suggests a growth of the
   market by 2030 because many plants will go into operation. These
   ``new-generation{''} and green synthetic fuels have the advantage of
   reconciling the ambitious decarbonization objectives with energy
   security and freedom of movement; furthermore, unlike electric ones,
   they do not require a new engine - and related infrastructures - but can
   be fully integrated with the internal combustion engines currently in
   use. Finally, the availability of a valid and ready-to-use alternative
   to increasingly expensive traditional fuels is part of a broader
   strategy to govern the current phase of global turbulence},

Abstract = {This research considers the effects of gendered personalities on
   political ambition. The sex gap in political ambition is a normatively
   troubling empirical reality. Ambition research is often limited by
   binary conceptions and measurement of gender and sex. Recent scholarship
   urges scholars to employ more nuanced measures, including gendered
   personality as a measure beyond sex. Using original survey research
   incorporating the Bem Sex Roles Inventory (BSRI), we explore how
   femininity and masculinity influence nascent political ambition.
   Respondents who score higher in masculinity are more likely to have
   higher political ambition regardless of sex. However, sex remains
   significant, as female respondents are less likely to express nascent
   ambition. The results have implications for understanding the sex gap in
   political ambition and how political behavior conceptualizes and
   measures gender as a variable.},

Abstract = {The trial served by two Indonesian activists, Haris Azhar and Fatia
   Maulidiyanti, about allegations of defamation against the Indonesian
   Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment (Menkomarves),
   Luhut Binsar Panjaitan, on mining issues, serves as a wake-up call for
   civil society to re-examine the state of democracy in Indonesia. The
   criminalization of activists and the representation of civil society
   organizations are the most explicit symptoms of shrinking civic space,
   which will worsen advocacy on environmental issues. At the same time,
   mainstream media in Indonesia tends to be ineffective in serving as
   watchdogs. This research aims to demonstrate how Indonesian media covers
   the phenomenon of shrinking civic space that occurred in Indonesia from
   2020 to 2021, particularly in environmental issues. The study examined
   news articles from 34 media outlets to categorize the symptoms of
   shrinking civic space. Recognizing the potential for significant
   underreporting in the coverage of shrinking civic space in environmental
   issues, this research also be supplemented with in-depth interviews with
   five senior environmental journalists. This study shows how media
   patterns frame the coverage of shrinking civic space and how media has
   become one of the loci of the shrinking civic space phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Are policymakers rewarded in elections when they succeed in moving
   public policy in their ideological direction? Or do they face a
   thermostatic backlash, as citizens judge their policy moves as too hot
   or too cold? Our analysis of Congressional election outcomes since 1948
   adds information on Congressional policy actions to traditional election
   models emphasizing the surge and decline of presidential support and
   referendums based on presidential approval and the economy. We find that
   the electorate reacts to the ideological direction of policy, voting
   against parties that push policy further to the left or the right in
   both midterm and presidential years. Even after accounting for policy
   and traditional explanations, however, there remains a large midterm
   penalty for the president's party.},

Abstract = {Most studies of political participation have either focused on specific
   political behaviours or combined several behaviours into additive scales
   of institutional versus non-institutional participation. Through a
   multi-group latent class analysis of participation in 15 different
   political actions, conducted among citizens from four Western European
   countries, we identified five empirically grounded participant types
   that differ in their political engagement, socio-demographic
   characteristics and political attitudes: `voter specialists',
   `expressive voters', `online participants', `all-round activists' and
   `inactives'. While the same participant types were identified in all
   four countries, the proportion of citizens assigned to each type varies
   across countries. Our results challenge the claim that some citizens
   specialize in protest politics at the expense of electoral politics.
   Furthermore, our typological approach challenges previous findings on
   the individual characteristics associated with political (in)action.},

Abstract = {In recent years, interest has grown in using election manifestos to
   measure populism. This, however, is not without its controversies, with
   critics arguing that party manifestos is an unlikely case for observing
   populist language. This paper discusses conceptual challenges associated
   with measuring populism in text-based data, specifically manifestos.
   Based on previous research, I argue that not all parts of manifestos are
   equally likely to contain populist language and that variation might be
   based on the issue being discussed. To test this point, I present a
   novel dataset containing 32 hand-coded election manifestos of German
   populist parties AfD and Die Linke. By utilising this data, I analyse
   the variation in populist sentiment within these manifestos and
   demonstrate that issues vary in their degree of populism employed and
   that this is partially related to what issues are salient to populist
   parties.},

Abstract = {How do lobbies and interest groups achieve their goals? To answer that,
   this article explores jointly the three dimensions of the lobbying
   dynamic: strategies, access and influence. We test several hypotheses
   with evidence from an original and pioneer survey with interest groups
   and lobbyists from Chile. Our results show that cause-oriented lobbies
   are more likely to embrace indirect lobbying strategies. We also
   examined access. We found that lobbies declare that it is more effective
   to direct their persuasion efforts towards convincing legislators who
   are not yet decided. They do so instead of focusing either on the
   representatives that already agree with them, or enemies. On influence,
   our results show that most business groups assert that legislators
   prefer constituents' input over theirs. Also, they perceive themselves
   as losing policy battles more often in comparison with other groups.},

Title = {Re-evaluating the welfare preferences of radical-right voters: evidence
   from a vignette experiment},

Abstract = {Research on the welfare stances of populist radical-right parties
   (PRRPs) categorises them as `welfare chauvinists' and `producerists',
   supporting generous benefits exclusively for `hard-working' nationals.
   However, it remains unclear whether their voters' welfare preferences
   align with these positions. The argument advanced in this paper is that
   a comprehensive understanding of PRRP voters' welfare preferences
   requires the examination of how solidarity and perceptions of welfare
   claimant deservingness interact. Thus, this article employs a factorial
   vignette survey experiment to evaluate the interplay between solidarity
   and deservingness perceptions among PRRP voters. Contrary to previous
   research, results show that PRRP voters do not exhibit stronger
   producerist attitudes; instead, they mostly stand out as particularly
   nativists. While PRRP voters exhibit significantly less solidarity
   towards welfare claimants deemed `least' and `average-deserving' than
   other partisans, they are not more solidaristic towards the `most
   deserving' claimant. These findings challenge existing understanding of
   deservingness perceptions of PRRP voters, providing a new perspective on
   the study of their welfare attitudes.},

Title = {Restructuring UK government at the Centre-Why the IfG Commission's Naïve
   Plan will not Work},

Volume = {95},

Abstract = {An Institute for Government (IfG) report on `government at the centre'
   recommends creating new, rationalist policy machinery (including an
   inner cabinet) to manage the UK government's four-year policy
   programmes-faithfully following how the Cameron-Clegg coalition operated
   in 2010-15. That government's disastrous example shows how politically
   na \& iuml;ve this plan would be. This article draws out its complete
   infeasibility in late 2024 conditions. The IfG also proposes setting up
   a new Department for the Civil Service headed by a powerful minister as
   a counterweight to the Treasury (criticised only for being `too good'
   and hence over-dominant). Instead, this article sets out the case for a
   new and strong Department for Finance, Procurement and Productivity to
   take responsibility for spending control and other key public management
   roles, where the Treasury resource management has conspicuously failed
   in the last decade.},

Abstract = {This article engages with the manufacture/purchase of feminine beauty,
   especially via cosmetic surgery, U.S. citizenship, and prosperity
   Christianity. It aligns the Kardashians' form of capitalist beauty with
   their Christian rhetoric in context of their uptake of `surplus
   citizenship'. I argue that prosperity Christianity together with certain
   aesthetic body modifications reveal a contemporary version of U.S.
   citizenship that speaks of entrepreneurial self-enhancement, national
   belonging, and affluence. I show that this `new' type of citizenship is
   rooted in deeply racialised practices and processes. A case study - the
   rise and fall of the so-called `Brazilian butt lift' (BBL) - is offered
   in order to demonstrate these ideas.},

Abstract = {How to improve security and strengthen the rule of law in fragile
   states? Community policing programs have long been at the forefront of
   policymakers' efforts to address this challenge. These programs tend to
   be more expansive than those found in developed countries, focusing not
   only on building trust through meetings and foot patrols, but also on
   eliciting `coproduction' from communities to supplement scarce police
   capacity and provide alternatives to vigilantism. I partnered with the
   Liberian National Police (LNP) to experimentally evaluate the
   effectiveness of this approach in Monrovia, Liberia, one of sub-Saharan
   Africa's most crime-ridden cities. Drawing on a large-scale resident
   survey and administrative crime data, I find that the program improved
   relations between police and citizens, strengthened social norms against
   vigilantism, and mobilized communities to participate in the police's
   ``Watch Forum{''} initiative by forming and sustaining local security
   groups designed to facilitate cooperation with police. These changes
   were accompanied by a roughly 40\% reduction in the incidence of mob
   violence. Despite these improvements, the program did not reduce the
   overall incident of crime, improve perceptions of security, or increase
   crime reporting.},

Abstract = {During the 1980s, the Mexican feminist movement, until then very limited
   in number of militants, experienced a moment of inflection, profound
   transformation and expansion. In many ways, this process was linked to
   the reaction of mobilized women from the popular sectors to the terrible
   crisis that hit the most disadvantaged sectors of Mexican society. These
   women, supported by a sector of civil feminists, began to participate in
   events and activities aimed at members of the feminist movement. In
   1987, a conflictive clash between these two worlds took place during the
   IV Latin American and Caribbean Feminist Encounter in the city of Taxco.
   Based on the testimonies gathered in interviews published by the
   magazine fem, the magazine Doble Jornada and the memory of the IV EFLAC,
   this paper aims to reconstruct the context of the formation of organized
   women's groups, characterize their modes of militancy prior to the
   Encuentro, differentiate the positions of the different groups of
   militants on feminism before, during and after the event and examine the
   debates that took place on feminism as a political practice, the
   fractures and the forms of discrimination that operated within the
   movement. Finally, it will discuss the consensuses that were reached in
   Taxco on the basis of the creation of a joint and transformative
   strategy that did not ignore the differences in women's demands in terms
   of class, race, age or sexual orientation.},

Abstract = {This article builds on recent theoretical contributions to
   sustainability sciences that have been grouped under the
   processual-relational perspective in which processes, relationships and
   their changes take predominance with respect to objects and entities. We
   highlight concepts from posthumanism, which questions human
   exceptionality and extends the definition of what constitutes a subject,
   and systemic thinking in the context of socioecological systems
   research, which insists on the intertwining of the social and the
   natural, constituting a single complex adaptive system. By bringing
   these perspectives into dialogue, we develop a theoretical position
   inspired by the ethical-onto-epistemology proposed by feminist
   philosopher Karen Barad, among others. In this view, understanding the
   world as a series of interconnected processes-or relationships in
   constant evolution-leads to an epistemological stance of entanglement
   between the researcher and the phenomenon studied. This, in turn,
   implies an ethical position of response- ability, or the development of
   response capacities. It is from this position that we propose a reading
   of water conflicts as sets of more-than-human relationships, or
   agencements/assemblages, in continuous flux, where response capacities
   can emerge. We land this framework in the case of the Mar Menor, where
   we have conducted fieldwork in recent years, and conclude with a brief
   speculative fabulation exploring socioecological transitions in which
   response-ability flourishes.},

Abstract = {A vast and growing quantitative literature considers how social networks
   shape political mobilization but the degree to which turnout decisions
   are strategic remains ambiguous. Unlike previous studies, we establish
   personal links between voters and candidates and exploit discontinuous
   incentives to mobilize across district boundaries to estimate causal
   effects. Considering three types of networks - families, co-workers, and
   immigrant communities - we show that a group member's candidacy acts as
   a mobilizational impulse propagating through the group's network. In
   family networks, some of this impulse is non-strategic, surviving past
   district boundaries. However, the bulk of family mobilization is bound
   by the candidate's district boundary, as is the entirety of the
   mobilizational effects in the other networks.},

Abstract = {This article discusses whether it is rational and valuable to have hope
   in the face of the climate crisis. The aim is to explore a distinctive
   Kantian perspective characterized by three main elements. First, hope is
   not seen primarily as a means of sustaining action, but action is viewed
   as a condition for rational hope. Second, the value of certain
   `fundamental' hopes is not merely instrumental but derives from their
   constitutive role in our practical identity. Here, I focus on Kantian
   hope in the compatibility of our fundamental ends, happiness and
   morality. Third, the rationality of such a hope presupposes trust - in
   particular, trust that our conceptions of morality and the good life are
   sufficiently flexible to adapt to drastically new circumstances.},

Abstract = {The 2023 election in Poland brought to an end the rule of the Law and
   Justice (PiS) party. With an extraordinary turnout of 74\%, the highest
   in recent Polish history, 13.2 million voters cast their vote in support
   of parties other than PiS, with four liberal-democratic parties alone
   attracting over 11.6 million votes. This shift indicates a departure
   from the period of selective demobilisation of the liberal-democratic
   camp and selective overmobilisation of the right-wing camp inclined to
   protect the traditional-religious world in decline. The campaign
   deviated from `normal politics', focusing instead on the principles of
   constitutional democracy, as the 8-year PiS rule marked the erosion of
   the rule of law. The election itself, while free, was unfair and
   unequal, attributed to the actions of the outgoing political camp.
   Paradoxically, however, the camp responsible for these violations failed
   to secure enough support to form a government. The new government now
   faces a complex array of challenges. It must restore the constitutional
   order, manage two electoral campaigns (local and European), and rebuild
   relationships with the EU as a pivotal objective. It also faces the
   necessity to foster Western support for Ukraine, which requires careful
   navigation of domestic and international challenges.},

Abstract = {This paper bridges literature on political parties and organizational
   studies by providing a new theoretical lens on political party
   developments. There has been growing scholarly interest in populist
   parties and the issues that serve as the raison d'etre for their
   political platform. While the literature has been preoccupied with the
   journey of the anti-hero rising to power, less has been written about
   the organization of the party once it has transcended to political
   influence. Likewise, whereas organizational birthmarks and imprinting
   have been integral concepts in the study of organizations, there has
   been little permeation of the concepts into the study of political
   parties. The Danish People's Party and Norwegian Progress Party provide
   two illustrative cases, showing that their original formation and later
   transformation into the current parties brought with it challenges to
   their structure and ideology. Our findings show that while an increase
   in external support to the political party, that is, votes, imprints
   organizational birthmarks, it is during a decrease in the very same
   external support that organizational birthmarks are uncovered and
   challenged. Through process-tracing and our theoretical model, we
   identify organizational birthmarks and causal mechanisms in which
   competing organizational birthmarks create an internal division within
   the political party.},

Abstract = {This article explains the role of political parties in influencing a
   democratic state's international security cooperation policy. It focuses
   on Japan's expanded security cooperation with Southeast Asian countries
   pushed by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) under Prime Minister Shinzo
   Abe. The LDP as the ruling party saw Japan's expanded security
   cooperation with Southeast Asian countries as an effort to success Abe's
   ``Take Back Japan{''} campaign and to overperform the previous
   Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) administration. Moreover, Japan was able
   to expand its security cooperation with Southeast Asian countries
   because LDP and its junior coalition partner New Komeito, using its
   preliminary review system in foreign and security policy making, and its
   stable power in parliament, were able to pass security legislations
   allowing Japan's to have more security cooperation with Southeast Asian
   countries.},

Abstract = {What are the local political, economic, and social conditions of the
   communities that sent insurrectionists to the US Capitol in support of
   Donald Trump? Using a new dataset of the home counties of individuals
   charged for the Capitol insurrection, we tested two prominent theories
   of electoral populism and support for populist leaders like Donald
   Trump-demographic change and manufacturing decline-and whether they also
   explain violent populism. We also examined the effects of local
   political conditions. We find that white population decline is a
   stronger predictor of violent populism and that counties that voted for
   Trump were less likely to fight for Trump. The effect of white
   population decline is even greater in counties whose US House
   Representative rejected the 2020 election results. These findings
   suggest scholars should resist assuming violent populism is merely an
   extension of electoral populism, and solutions to one will not
   necessarily remedy the other.},

Abstract = {In the last years, China and the United States of America (US) have
   engaged in unprecedented competition in emerging technologies (ETs), in
   a context of China's growing presence and shifting position in the
   international system. Drawing on data between 2017 and 2023 and
   strategic decisions, such as bans and export controls directed at
   China's companies and the changing alignment posture of Western states,
   we employ the Balance of Threat (BoT) theory to examine China's changing
   aggregate power, offensive capabilities and aggressive intentions, while
   also establishing the vanishing importance of the geographic dimension.
   We then turn to the behavior of the US and Western states by drawing on
   the BoT theory, which suggests balancing as a prime strategy to counter
   the threat and identify instances of the formation of a balancing
   coalition against China. We demonstrate how the notion of threat in ETs
   can be approached and conclude with a characterization of balancing in
   the domain of ETs that resonates with the notion of ``gradual
   balancing{''}, in addition to outlining suggestions for future studies.},

Abstract = {The concurrence of Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) states as parties
   to the American Convention on Human Rights and the Escaz \& uacute;
   Agreement makes it necessary to consider the interactions between these
   instruments and the implications for the interpretation of state
   environmental and human rights obligations. This article analyses the
   commonalities, synergies and conflicts between the two instruments and
   shows that, despite not being explicitly or formally bound together,
   they share a common approach to the protection of environmental human
   rights. It concludes that both instruments constitute the environmental
   human rights framework for Latin America and the Caribbean , the main
   feature of which is its pillar of fairness conditions for vulnerable
   persons and groups. As a consequence, it becomes visible that global
   instruments and policies for sustainable development and environmental
   democracy are incomplete if, in accordance with their normative premise
   of equality, they do not compensate for discrimination in participation.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to analyse the debate on the recognition of
   the rights of Nature in the European Union (EU), through the existing
   legal possibilities and systemic challenges that underlie a paradigm
   shift that must necessarily take place in order to reverse the
   anthropocentric view of Nature held by Western societies. Reinventing
   our relationship with Nature and protecting it is possible through
   European Union law, and more specifically through the rights of Nature.
   This undoubtedly means decapitalising the importance of Nature and
   affirming its intrinsic value, which entails questioning the levers on
   which environmental protection has been built in the EU. Despite the
   limitations existing in the EU, this has not been an obstacle for some
   EU Member States to promote initiatives to recognise the rights of some
   natural elements, demonstrating that a change in the socio-legal
   paradigm is possible.},

Abstract = {Does introducing de jure political equality affect legislative
   representation and the identity of elected politicians? This article
   exploits differences in enfranchisement rates across electoral districts
   to present evidence on the consequences of one of the most sizable
   franchise extensions in European history, the 1912 Italian reform, which
   trebled the electorate and left electoral rules and district boundaries
   unchanged. Enfranchisement increased the vote share of left-wing social
   reformers but had no impact on their parliamentary representation, on
   the parliamentary representation of the aristocracy and traditional
   elites, or on political competition. I document and analyze elite's
   efforts to minimize the political impact of enfranchisement: social
   reformers were systematically defeated in districts that saw a surge in
   political violence as well as in districts where conservative candidates
   had signed a secret pact (the Gentiloni pact) with the Catholic
   Electoral Union. I discuss the implications of these findings for
   theories of democratization and elite persistence.},

Abstract = {Political scientists routinely focus their investigations on the
   attitudes and behaviours of politicians and increasingly study them
   through systematic surveys. As with all surveys, researchers aim to
   maximize response rates, but we know little about the incentives that
   motivate politicians to participate in survey research. In this paper,
   we consider whether financial incentives in the form of small cash
   payments or participation in lotteries for slightly larger rewards
   increase participation. Based on a randomized control trial (RCT)
   conducted as part of an effort to survey local councillors in South
   Africa, we find that, if anything, material incentives depress response
   rates overall - weighing against their use in future surveys. However,
   we also find some heterogeneity in estimated effects by political party,
   which may indicate that the intentional provision of material incentives
   can affect sample compositions in ways that may be beneficial for some
   studies. While our findings in this regard are only suggestive, they
   should inform future research and research methods.},

Abstract = {This study aims to find out whether corruption in the court can be
   prevented with Information Technology (IT). This research uses a
   qualitative descriptive approach where the main data source can be
   processed from relevant and current literature material with the theme
   of this article as secondary data. Information technology is the most
   influential factor in changing the world today. The administration of
   justice is an activity that includes the provision of information,
   communication, and production of new information. There is no denying
   that information technology will affect the way justice administration
   works. Corruption that often occurs in courts (judicial commissions) is
   in the form of petty corruption, namely administrative or bureaucratic
   corruption with a power approach, namely the exclusive power of decision
   makers. The results showed that optimal use of IT can support efforts to
   eradicate corruption in the court by using E -Court, paperless court, E
   -Filing, E-Skum, E -Payment, E -Summons applications. These various
   applications can prevent judicial corruption due to the application of
   transparency principles, efficiency principles such as cost savings,
   reduction of illegal levies, ease of information transfer, reduction of
   case broker practices, reduction of opportunities for corruption due to
   potential conflicts of interest and face. -face-to-face, reducing
   gratification and bribery which are the main requirements of smart
   governance so that efforts to eradicate judicial corruption can be
   effective.},

Abstract = {Although women now occupy a record number of governorships and the
   number of women running for governor has increased significantly in the
   last four years, women still run for governor at lower rates than men.
   This study examines why there have been so few women gubernatorial
   candidates in primary elections using a dataset that includes every
   primary election or convention used to select major party gubernatorial
   nominees from 1978 through 2022. We examine four distinct areas to learn
   why so few women run: the potential candidate pool; candidates, parties,
   and voters as strategic actors; gubernatorial office structure; and
   major political, social, and cultural events and their impact on
   candidate pools. With some important differences between the Democratic
   and Republican parties, we find that each of these areas has a
   significant impact on whether women run for governor. Notably, we find
   that the pipeline is significant for Republican women during the period
   of study but not for Democratic women. Office structure, incumbent
   governors, and events such as those surrounding the 2016 election, also
   impact whether women run for governor. The results indicate that states
   can adopt changes to the structure of the governor's office, and parties
   can adopt rules and facilitate norms that are favorable to women.},

Abstract = {An extensive literature links the rise of populist radical right (PRR)
   parties to immigration. We argue that another demographic trend is also
   significant: emigration. The departure of citizens due to internal and
   international emigration is a major phenomenon affecting elections via
   two complementary mechanisms. Emigration alters the composition of
   electorates, but also changes the preferences of the left behind.
   Empirically, we establish a positive correlation between PRR vote shares
   and net-migration loss at the subnational level across Europe. A more
   fine-grained panel analysis of precincts in Sweden demonstrates that the
   departure of citizens raises PRR vote shares in places of emigration and
   that the Social Democrats are the principal losers from emigration.
   Elite interviews and newspaper analyses explore how emigration produces
   material and psychological grievances on which populists capitalize and
   that established parties do not effectively address. Emigration and the
   frustrations it generates emerge as important sources of populist
   success.},

Abstract = {Since first airing on HBO in 2011, Game of Thrones (GOT) has proven to
   be a fruitful text for teaching and studying politics. In 2022 the
   prequal to GOT-House of The Dragon (HOTD) debuted on HBO. This paper
   conducts discourse analysis on the entire first season with two goals in
   mind. First, we demonstrate how pop culture is impacted by real world
   politics by examining the change in gender and racial representation in
   HOTD compared to GOT and argue that this change was a product of
   cultural backlash that GOT received and a result of changing political
   attitudes over the time of both shows airing. Second, we use the show's
   content as text to teach American and Comparative politics concepts. In
   the appendix we provide three examples of low, mid, and high-stake
   assignments that use show content in teaching political science courses.},

Abstract = {Political scientists frequently argue that presidential and
   parliamentary democracies produce different policy outcomes but fail to
   fully consider semi -presidential democracies. To demonstrate the
   importance of considering semi-presidentialism, I reanalyze an existing
   argument that presidential democracies have more labor mobility than
   parliamentary democracies because presidential democracies empower
   special interests who support immigration. I replicate previous analyses
   and find little evidence that the type of democracy affects labor
   mobility. Political scientists need to consider semi-presidentialism or
   risk erroneous inferences. Further, theories of institutions and
   immigration policy, and institutional theories more generally, should
   focus on more specific institutions rather than rely on the blunt
   distinctions between types of democracies.},

Abstract = {Political candidates utilize social media to mobilize supporters,
   persuade voters, and raise money. However, little is known about the
   structure of mass electoral appeals when donors are the primary target
   instead of voters. Because candidates' donors and voters can differ
   significantly, with donors more partisan and ideologically extreme on
   average, we theorize that candidates use strategic rhetoric tailored to
   specific audiences. To analyze how campaigns perceive and target their
   ``financial electorate,{''} we leverage data from the Facebook Ad
   Library for 2020 U.S. congressional candidates and distinguish political
   ads by their persuasion targets. Using text analysis, we test the
   hypotheses that donor-targeting messages are more toxic, negative, and
   likely to reference a polarizing president than voter-targeting
   messages. The results support our hypotheses, and Republican candidates,
   on average, used more toxic language than their Democratic counterparts.
   As campaigns, scramble for donations intensifies, these characteristics
   of fundraising appeals may further polarize the electorate.},

Abstract = {Donald Trump's professional background is unique among presidents. I
   glean basic principles of negotiation from his professional life,
   presented largely in his book The Art of the Deal, but also other
   writing, media interviews, and social media posts. I argue the success
   of his approach is dependent for the most part upon three factors: the
   nature of his counterpart, the expected frequency of future deals with
   this counterpart, and the position of the status quo and reversion
   points in the negotiation. In the bargaining contexts I present, Trump's
   approach, I hypothesize, is most likely to bring about success-a deal-in
   foreign policy and least likely in regular lawmaking. I find some
   evidence consistent with this. The study illustrates scholars should do
   more to understand how pre-tenure careers affect presidential behavior.},

Title = {The ``adaptation{''} of the right to damages to artificial intelligence:
   the proposed Civil liability directive},
Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2024},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The unstoppable spreading of artificial intelligence and the potential
   benefits it generates are unquestionable facts. However, it also poses
   significant challenges, so European institutions have shown special
   interest in having adequate regulation. In this sense, there are two
   realities that sometimes appear to be confronted: technological
   development and the protection of the rights of individuals. In order to
   provide a satisfactory response, the European Union has articulated what
   appears to be the definitive strategy based on three fundamental blocks:
   the horizontal rules on artificial intelligence systems, security
   legislation and the derived civil liability. Regarding the first two, it
   should be noted that the proposed Act of 2021 (the so-called Artificial
   intelligence act), despite not resolving the civil liability issue, lays
   a foundation (the concept of an artificial intelligence system itself,
   the classification of the latter, the requirements, criteria and
   obligations derived) from which special provisions arise; this is, the
   proposed Directive on the modification of the Directive on defective
   products and the proposed Directive for the adaptation of extra
   -contractual civil liability rules to artificial intelligence. For this
   reason, the aforementioned basic guidelines, as well as the relations
   between the two proposals of Directives, will be analysed in this study,
   even in a shallow manner, in order to expose the current legislative
   frame. In any case, we will affect in more detail the proposal of the
   Directive for the adaptation of extra -contractual civil liability rules
   to artificial intelligence, with which we aim to avoid the possible
   differences arising when the jurisdictional bodies adapt the rules,
   which would result in an evident legal insecurity, in fragmentation and
   a decrease in economic investment in this sector.},

   syndemic},
Journal = {CAPITAL AND CLASS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2, SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article offers an insight into the challenges faced by social
   movements when attempting to politicize the crisis of reproduction which
   took place during the COVID-19 syndemic in the city of Barcelona. The
   analysis provided here expands on the analysis of social reproduction
   theory and, more broadly, on Marxist feminist approaches. In fact, one
   of the factors accounting for the absence of politicization during the
   syndemic is the type of responses given to the emergency by the
   authoritarian neoliberal state, which were beyond those envisaged by the
   10th thesis theorized by Marxism-Feminism and social reproduction
   theory. Thus, in this article, we argue that this situation is an
   opportunity to establish a dialogue between critical state theory and
   Marxism-Feminism to understand how the agency of the state may condition
   the social reproduction of life and block the emancipatory possibilities
   of care and the social struggles regarding the crisis of care,
   complementing thus the10th thesis of Marxism-Feminism.},

Abstract = {The benefits of open educational practices that invite students to
   collaborate and interactively create knowledge are well known. Despite
   this, it remains underutilized for teaching in research methods
   classrooms. This article presents a framework for using open pedagogy in
   undergraduate research methods courses. Drawing upon the knowledge
   authors acquired from the Open Educational Practices certificate
   program, this article outlines the development and application of a
   renewable assignment for research methods, and provides a critical
   reflection of the students' experiences. The assignment tasks students
   with creating an open educational resource that addresses a gap in the
   existing textbook. Students are asked to identify research methods in
   other disciplines or look for diverse representations of knowledge
   acquisition by a community to which they belong. The authors find that
   this renewable assignment helped students think critically about the
   potential limitations of the research methods covered in textbooks.
   Additionally, having students create content that will be used in future
   iterations of the class increased their level of enthusiasm and
   excitement for learning. Furthermore, this article discusses how the
   creation of a renewable assignment in an institutional setting with
   large minority student representation advanced various aspects of social
   justice. Particularly, how the assignment and students' experiences in
   the creation of knowledge addressed redistributive (having free access
   to resources), recognitive (views from diverse socio-cultural groups),
   and representational (self-determination of marginalized peoples)
   justice. The article concludes with a discussion on the ways to build on
   the success of this pilot project.},

Abstract = {Given the changes in partisan dynamics in the 21st century, is
   partisanship still the most important driver of voting decisions in
   American presidential elections as posited by Bartels's (2000) pivotal
   work? To answer this, we extend Bartels's original analysis on the
   changing importance of partisanship in presidential and congressional
   voting through the 2020 presidential election. We also provide a more
   fully specified model of vote choice to ensure any changes in the role
   of partisanship are not driven by an omitted predictor variable. In the
   bivariate model, we show that partisanship remains relatively flat since
   Bartels's analysis ended in 1996, with a spike during the 2012 election.
   In the model including additional covariates, we show that the impact of
   partisanship on presidential vote choice is higher now than at any point
   since 1972, although the change in importance of partisanship since 1984
   is negligible. This is driven largely by including political ideology in
   the vote choice model. We conclude that partisanship remains the most
   important driver of vote choice in presidential elections, even if its
   power has been slightly overstated in the past.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic triggered rapid transformations across the globe.
   Probably no other event in the past 50 years has changed the working
   environment more comprehensively. When the pandemic started in February
   and March of 2020, university campuses all over the globe shut down in
   less than a week. Most remained closed or had heavily restricted access
   for almost two years, depending on the country and the city. Overnight
   online teaching replaced in-person instruction; all professional and
   student interactions moved to Zoom, Teams, or Skype; academic
   conferences either did not take place or moved to an online format; and
   field research became almost impossible. In addition, contact
   restrictions, lockdowns, curfews, and homeschooling were unprecedented
   challenges for many people, especially members of the academic community
   who had small children (Del Boca et al. 2020). It is important to note
   that even in normal times women bear the greatest burden of childcare,
   social care for older people, and general household tasks. The COVID-19
   pandemic quickly amplified these disparities (Ohlbrecht and Jellen 2021;
   Yerkes et al. 2022). Discussions emerged in many sectors, including
   academia, about specific ways that the pandemic was impacting
   professional lives, especially those of women. Given the acute pressure
   to publish in most higher-education institutions, it is important to
   evaluate the effect that the pandemic had on this central aspect of
   scholarly careers.},

Abstract = {This article examines the intertwined logics of depoliticization and
   necropolitics as central elements of illiberal authoritarian power in
   post-2020 Belarus. It sheds light on the technologies used by
   Lukashenka's regime to maintain its rule, including anti-feminist
   visuals, violence of mass incarceration, and dehumanization and
   demonization of political opponents. Relying on media analysis, the
   article discusses how these technologies function as mechanisms through
   which the regime enacts its necropolitical power to curtail any
   political engagement. Juxtaposing politicization with depoliticization
   and biopolitics with necropolitics, it advances a different
   understanding of these concepts in illiberal autocracies, emphasizing
   their mutually reinforcing relationship in Belarus.},

Abstract = {What role did urban machines play in national politics during the New
   Deal? To what extent did they serve as facilitators in a local-national
   patronage system, converting the flow of federal funds into their cities
   into votes for federal Democratic candidates? To answer these questions,
   we bring together data on urban machines and work relief spending, the
   New Deal programs that received the most public and political scorn for
   their supposed patronage uses. Despite long-standing claims that
   Franklin D. Roosevelt and other New Dealers funneled extra work relief
   funds to urban machines, and that machines converted those funds into
   votes for the national Democratic Party, we find little evidence of this
   exchange relationship. Machines did not receive a disproportionate share
   of work relief funds, but they did see large influxes of federal funds,
   just like other cities with high levels of economic need. And yet, based
   on two-way fixed effects models and synthetic control analyses, we find
   no evidence that they succeeded at using those funds to turn out votes
   for President Roosevelt. We find evidence for just one dimension of a
   local-national patronage system: Democratic Senate candidates did see
   larger increases in vote share in machine counties versus non-machine
   counties with similar increases in work relief expenditures.},

Abstract = {This article illuminates an underappreciated political dimension of
   capitalism by elaborating media policy as a site for the dynamic
   interaction of corporate power and the state. Synthesizing Marxian
   analyses of monopoly capital, American political development (APD)
   perspectives on public policymaking, and communication studies
   conceptions of media systems as fields of democratic struggle, I trace
   the institutional mechanisms that enable corporate media interests to
   reinforce systemic imperatives and maintain political-economic
   dominance. I illustrate my argument with examples from the
   Telecommunications Act of 1996. My analysis sharpens APD's critical edge
   by defining path dependency, policy feedback, and policy drift as
   processes through which capital leverages structural power to fend off
   political challenges under changing economic, social, and technological
   conditions. State-sanctioned ownership and control of news outlets,
   communication platforms, and information networks furnish a unique
   mechanism for influencing the structural terms of public discourse on
   all issues, including media policy. This implicates corporate media
   power in the ongoing US political communication crisis and as a central
   force in the entrenchment of inegalitarian and undemocratic social
   relations. Lending greater theoretical coherence and empirical grounding
   to these material and ideological dynamics historicizes public
   communication and highlights contingent political openings for radical
   engagement with media policy.},

Abstract = {There is a tendency to find populist characteristics in all experiences
   of representation based on personal leaderships which present themselves
   as outsiders and establish direct communication with the citizenry. This
   paper seeks to contribute to avoid this conceptual stretching, proposing
   to start from a concept of a higher level of generality, ``immediate
   politics{''}, and then differentiate between a populist type and a type
   that I will call ``proximity{''}. The anti-charismatic or proximity
   identification is based on the figure of the ``ordinary person{''},
   close and empathetic, although without the component of ``extraordinary
   person{''} implied in charisma, and without the correlate of the
   construction of a collective subject or People. In short, this paper
   asks about this kind of ``populism without a People{''} that is also
   present in contemporary politics.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {118},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Should turning out to vote in mass elections be voluntary or compulsory?
   Previous normative arguments for compulsory voting often rely on
   contested normative claims about the moral duty to vote or about the
   democratic legitimacy conveyed by high turnout. Our article strengthens
   the normative case for compulsory voting by arguing that it could
   improve democracy by reducing polarization, which existing work suggests
   can lead to democratic backsliding. Drawing on spatial models of
   electoral competition, we argue that, by reducing more extreme voters'
   ability to threaten to abstain due to alienation, the introduction of
   compulsory voting can push party platforms toward the median voter's
   preferences. This directly decreases party polarization, defined as the
   distance between party platforms. We examine potential normative and
   empirical objections to this argument and provide scope conditions under
   which compulsory voting is likely to decrease polarization.},

Abstract = {North Waziristan is emerging from an episode of terrorism that lasted
   for decades. Critically examining the dynamics of borderlands, this
   paper explicates the intersection of informal cross-border trade with
   the local economy and livelihoods. These socio-economic patterns created
   by ungoverned geographies, and porous uncontrolled borders foster a
   dependence on the informal economy, which is largely responsible for
   financing and perpetuating the instability. The paper signposts that
   effective border management and ongoing security reconstruction have
   contributed to rejuvenating the local economy and providing the
   necessary impetus for post-conflict economic development, keeping
   widespread unrest and militancy on hold.},

Abstract = {European political parties are facing a slow erosion of their electoral
   and activist base. Due to multiple interrelated factors, traditional
   parties have become increasingly disembedded from society. In an attempt
   to escape this decline, several political organisations that emerged
   after the 2008 crisis have taken a movementist turn. These organisations
   (1) present themselves as ``movements{''} rather than ``parties{''}, (2)
   provide strategic support to social movements, and (3) explore a way of
   operating that is intended to contrast with that of traditional parties,
   and which values freedom of movement. Podemos, the Five Star Movement
   and La France Insoumise are emblematic of these developments; La
   Republique en Marche too, albeit in a slightly different form. This
   article proposes a novel conceptualisation of movementism, proceeding in
   two steps. In the first step, drawing on 36 months of research and
   around a hundred interviews with La France Insoumise, we will show what
   movementism means for the actors who claim to be part of it, stressing
   the plurality of meanings attributed to this phenomenon. In the second
   step, drawing on a comparative approach that sets La France Insoumise
   into a broader landscape, we will propose an ideal type of the
   ``movementist party{''}-one capable of opening up a new field of inquiry
   for political scientists and sociologists.},

Abstract = {Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, health-care spending became a key
   policy issue across the OECD. Comparing recent institutional trends in
   public health-care financing in three federal countries-Canada, the
   United States, and Mexico-this article explores the political struggles
   over fiscal federalism in health care related to both vertical and
   horizontal imbalances that can generate regional tensions and pit
   subnational governments against one another and, especially, against the
   national government. Grounded in a historical institutionalist
   perspective, the article shows how different institutional legacies
   shape current conflicts over federal health-care funding in these three
   highly dissimilar federal countries. Such an analysis stresses the role
   of policy feedback in social politics and the enduring ``varieties of
   federalism{''} in North American public health-care funding. More
   specifically, the article shows how the distinct nature of policy
   feedback effects in the United States, Mexico, and Canada helps explain
   why the two former countries recently witnessed major changes in
   intergovernmental relations over fiscal federalism for health care while
   the latter did not.},

Abstract = {Religion is on the decline in the United States. Americans increasingly
   report low religiosity, have less attachment to religion, and a rapidly
   growing number identify as nonreligious. In Congress, the story is
   different. While a quarter of the public identifies as nonreligious,
   only one member of Congress does. Why are the nonreligious vastly
   underrepresented in government? I use a conjoint candidate choice
   experiment to causally link religious voters' bias against nonreligious
   candidates to reduced support for them in electoral settings. I
   demonstrate that bias against the nonreligious affects electoral
   decisions and is causally linked to the exclusion of the nonreligious
   from government. Furthermore, I show that nonreligious voters only
   exhibit in-group support for candidates who explicitly identify as
   Atheists, not agnostic or candidates that merely lack a religious
   identity.},

Abstract = {Why do victorious rebels discard key aspects of rebel modes of
   governance when they create a new state through secession? This article
   demonstrates how rebel governance by the Eritrean People's Liberation
   Front left contradicting legacies in post-independent Eritrea. During
   war, the EPLF promised democracy, but the organisation was authoritarian
   at the top. Post-independence, the fairness of wartime practices was
   viewed differently, leading to pressure on the new government to fulfil
   its democratic promise. The leadership did not give in, however. It
   jettisoned its earlier commitment to democracy to protect its grip on
   power under the new condition of independent statehood.},

Abstract = {This review article presents key notes for the construction of the
   research object around the categories Teacher Subject, Teacher Training
   and Educational Policy. Tracing how since his appearance as a public
   worker has also several roles, such as evangelizer, values reproducer,
   urban and moral example, curriculum administrator, learning agent, and
   many others. It has transformed his/her experience historically making
   him/her to question who has been, who is or could be the teacher subject
   today. The study of <teacher subject> category describes the transition
   from an obedient subject to a self-exploited subject. The proposal is to
   rethink how to generate a not-limited training model that gives to the
   teacher subject the conditions to reproduce educational policy and what
   is expected of him or her.},

Title = {The Changing Faces of Populism in Turkey: From ``Inclusionary
   Populism{''} to ``Exclusionary Populism{''}?},
Journal = {SIYASAL-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This study examines the evolving populist policies of the Justice and
   Development Party (Adalet ve Kalk \& imath;nma Partisi or JDP) since it
   gained power in 2002. Although populism was embedded in the JDP's
   policies from the outset, this paper argues that the dominant form of
   the JDP's populism has transformed from ``inclusionary{''} to
   ``exclusionary.{''} Specifically, in its early years, the JDP leadership
   implemented inclusive populist policies to overcome the threat of party
   closure and expand its voter base. This policy worked well in the first
   two terms, and the JDP's vote share increased to 49\% in the 2011
   legislative elections. However, as the economic indicators deteriorated
   and the clientelist resources shrunk from the end of the second term
   onwards, the JDP gradually shifted towards exclusionary populism, which
   relied on deepening polarisation along religious and ethnic lines to
   consolidate its voter base. However, this strategy backfired and
   consolidated the opposition voters under the umbrella of the Republican
   Peoples Party (Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi or CHP). Overall, the populist
   transformation of the JDP's policies overlapped with the tightening of
   authoritarianism in the country},

Abstract = {This study critically examines the possibilities of armed conflict
   arising from the U.S.-China rivalry, addressing the central question:
   Will the current great power competition lead to war, or can peace be
   maintained? Through an analysis of three potential conflict
   scenarios-skirmishes over disputed territories, a Chinese invasion of
   Taiwan, and a Chinese blockade of Taiwan-the research evaluates the
   likelihood of armed confrontation, the factors that could precipitate or
   prevent conflict, and the potential consequences of military engagement.
   By integrating established international relations theories with
   contemporary strategic assessments, the study provides insights into the
   delicate balance between war and peace in this crucial bilateral
   relationship. The research concludes with an assessment of the
   conditions under which peace might be preserved and offers policy
   recommendations aimed at conflict prevention and strategic stability.},

Abstract = {- The revolving door phenomenon, understood here as the reconversion of
   former MEPs into jobs linked to lobbying, has been the subject of
   increasing media and political attention over the last twenty years,
   without it yet being easy to objectify its weight, concrete forms and
   factors. With this in mind, the article draws on a double survey:
   statistical data on the post-mandate futures (including lobbying) of a
   population of elected representatives - the French delegation to the EP
   - cross-referenced with interviews conducted with former MPs and
   potential recruiters in cabinets and large firms. Firstly, we observe
   that the occupation of full-time lobbying positions after a term of
   office is a statistically marginal phenomenon. The qualitative survey
   then goes on to identify a series of explanations referring to the
   professional boundaries between political institutions and
   private/commercial organizations, even in a European space that is
   reputed to be more blurred and more plastic. Finally, the article shows
   that such trajectories do exist, and that, above all, they are
   supplemented by various forms of collaboration with interest
   representation structures, which we seek to identify which MPs are more
   inclined to engage in, and what skills they commit to them.},

Abstract = {At the end of March 2024, the World Russian People's Council published
   an instruction that caused a stir: it declared the ``special military
   operation{''} in Ukraine a ``holy war{''}, called for a demographic
   change in Russia, and for the first time attempted to define the Russian
   world (russkij mir). It is understood as a ``spiritual and
   cultural-civilizational phenomenon{''} whose borders transcend those of
   ``great historical Russia{''}. The Russian world is closely linked to
   Russian statehood and opposes the evil that is identified with the West.
   There is no theological argumentation. The term is part of a specific
   historical and political worldview that has dangerous revisionist
   implications. The war in Ukraine shows this.},

Abstract = {The present article aims, based on Bell Hooks' work ``Teaching to
   Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom,{''} which derives from
   the concepts and reflections of fellow educator Paulo Freire, to bring
   new perspectives on legal education and the path to social
   transformation through the initiative of plural and insurgent education
   in the legal field. Thus, as a research problem, it intends to
   investigate how the revolutionary pedagogical proposals of Hooks and
   Freire can be applied to legal education, contributing to the
   transformation of law and society. The study begins with an exploratory
   bibliographic review divided into two main axes: (a) from the
   perspective of pedagogy, the theoretical framework is based on the works
   of Bell Hooks and Paulo Freire; (b) from the point of view of law, the
   focus is on legal pluralism and studies on the new Latin American
   constitutionalism, analyzing constitutional trends in Latin America. In
   the end, it is concluded that popular education, within the scope of
   law, is essential for Latin American political and social transformation
   and can be realized, among other possibilities, through extension
   practices inside and outside the universities, promoting dialogue
   between the legal community and marginalized groups, as well as social,
   political, and legal awareness of these groups. With this, it is also
   intended to provide contributions for democratic popular participation
   in the processes of constitutionalizing rights, improving the still
   unfinished model of Latin American constitutionalism.},

Journal = {PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {629-646},
Abstract = {The Spanish party system has recently undergone profound changes, marked
   by the rapid rise and decline of several political actors, such as
   Podemos and Ciudadanos, who challenged the imperfect two-party system
   that had characterised Spain since transition. This article examines how
   three major crises- the global financial crisis, the Catalan
   secessionist challenge, and the COVID19 pandemic-, have impacted the
   social imaginary and created opportunities for new framing and electoral
   competition strategies. Our research reconstructs changes in the Spanish
   ideological landscape and the relative salience of political cleavages
   in each of these crises. We argue that they had asymmetric impacts on
   party politics. Antiestablishment and nationalist populist discourses
   were effectively used to harness and redirect public discontent against
   political opponents. Political parties adapted their ideology
   strategically. Initially, outsider parties took advantage of the drop of
   trust in public institutions challenging the two-party system, but in
   the long run, the mainstreaming of populist interpretative frames,
   paradoxically, ended up consolidating two antagonistic blocs and enabled
   the resurgence of the two major parties, the PP and PSOE, as undisputed
   leaders of each of them.},

Journal = {POLITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1},
Pages = {141-162},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {This essay investigates Herbert Marcuse's concept of play: a collective,
   worldly form of solidarity. To do so, I propose that we take Marcuse's
   1955 Eros and Civilization as an occasion to rethink the affective
   commitments of critical theory by tracing the problem-space of his
   encounter with play and the critique of opposition that he consequently
   develops. This text on the social psychology of postwar liberal
   democracy repeatedly turns to play as a category of collective agency,
   distinct from the categories of contradiction that have animated
   critical theory and Marxist political theory more generally. For
   Marcuse, the historical circumstances of capitalist culture in the
   postwar period makes it difficult to see the ``paralysis of
   criticism{''} and a ``society without opposition{''} as anything but two
   symptoms of the same pathological commitment to negativity over
   solidarity. By examining Marcuse's concept of play through his critique
   of opposition, this article reconstructs an alternative vision of
   critical theory and practice. Rather than refer to a revolutionary
   overturning of reality, or the wholesale ``transformation of labor,{''}
   Marcuse doubles down on play's character as work and consequently
   enables us to understand that solidarity is neither totally orderable
   nor totally spontaneous, and never quite conforms to the logic of
   opposition. It only ever emerges out of play's suspension and
   supposition of reality. In short, when Marcuse wonders if there doesn't
   exist such a thing as play, he is wondering if there doesn't exist such
   a thing as democracy.},

Abstract = {This paper examines contemporary forms of nationalism through the
   populist parties in South Africa, Czechia, and Slovakia. Despite South
   Africa's progressive constitution, economic challenges, exacerbated by
   the COVID-19 pandemic and global crises, have fuelled anti-immigrant
   sentiments, the ``Put South Africans First{''} and ``Operation
   Dudula{''} are emerging as anti-immigrant movements, wanting to reclaim
   entitlements for South Africans. In Czechia and Slovakia, populist
   parties have resurfaced amid political narratives and economic concerns.
   The study employs critical discourse analysis, combining desk research
   and textual analysis, to contrast populist discourse on migrants in
   South Africa with that in Czechia and Slovakia, focusing on the recent
   tensions. The analysis extends to populist political parties such as the
   Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) party in Czechia, the People's Party
   - Our Slovakia (\& Lcaron;SNS), and Operation Dudula in South Africa,
   exploring their impact on public sentiment and government responses. By
   identifying commonalities and disparities, the paper contributes to
   understanding the complex interplay between nationalism, populism, and
   anti-immigrant sentiments in diverse national contexts.},

Journal = {POLITIX},
Year = {2024},
Number = {148},
Pages = {93-116},
Abstract = {Aboard merchant ships, sailors are a typical example of a fragmented
   collective marked by multiple inequalities. Yet protests against this
   racial and gendered social order are extremely rare: being a ``crew{''}
   seems to legitimize it. This article explores the way in which racial
   and gendered assignments simultaneously divide the collective and hold
   it together. In this dangerous environment, the imperative of social
   peace produces consent to a strict division of roles and tasks. However,
   this configuration of social relations is uncertain. It depends on the
   presence of indispensable compensations, and insofar as injustices
   remain acceptable. Otherwise, conflict arises, often outside the ship,
   because it is the only way to get around these social assignments.},

Title = {THE CONCEPT OF IDENTITY: MOVEMENT FROM THE ABSTRACT TO THE CONCRETE},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {3},
Pages = {177-191},
Abstract = {The subject of the article is an overview of identitarian research
   results in Russia reflected in the cycle of the 2010-2023 fundamental
   scientific publications. The main result is the formation of an original
   Russian scientific school of identity studies and the establishment of
   this scientific area as an autonomous subdiscipline of political
   science. Two substantive dimensions of identitarian studies are
   identified - analytical-conceptual and substantive-political. Within the
   framework of the first one, the author analyses the key theoretical
   parameters of identity studies, including the substantive evolution of
   the identity concept, theoretical and methodological context and
   semantic explications of identity studies. A number of identity
   theoretical articulations are considered: identity modus operandi
   (positive, negative), identity crises, development, complex society,
   political space and political time, social justice, social solidarity,
   civilisational and geopolitical identity, memory and culture wars,
   cancellation culture, cultural security and cultural sovereignty, and
   others. An overview of prospective identity studies is presented,
   including the synthesis of micro- and macro-level identity analyses; the
   development of the middle-level theories as the way to bridge the gap
   between empirical analysis and ``big theory{''} in understanding the
   changes taking place in different regions of the world, taking into
   account the historical past, political culture, emotional structure and
   worldview; the relationship between macro-political identities and
   ideologies; the correlation between civic and ethnic identities; and the
   relationship between identity and ideology. The political significance
   of identity research reflects the need to reorient the contemporary way
   of thinking as predominantly consumerist to the responsible development
   imperatives, which is supported by a positive identity.},

Abstract = {Much evidence suggests elite-level political incivility in U.S.
   politics, yet little research examines citizen-level incivility. We do
   so by examining responses to questions asking why citizens might vote
   against the 2016 presidential candidates. Uncivil responses stifle
   meaningful deliberation, for example by atta-cking the candidate's
   character; civil responses simply express disagreement or
   dissatisfaction with the candidate. Democratic incivility toward Trump
   (often focused on his attitudes about women and minorities) was matched
   by Republican incivili-ty toward Hillary Clinton (often focused on her
   gender). The fact that incivility was higher among those with greater
   media exposure suggests that citizens may model elite-level incivility.
   While civility outweighed incivility, our findings suggest a de-gree of
   incivility that may be normatively troubling for the he-alth of U.S.

Abstract = {For decades, remembering the famine of 1931-1933 was a taboo in
   Kazakhstan. Now the catastrophe, known in Kazakhstan as the Asar ylyq,
   is slowly finding its way into official remembrance policy. However,
   assessment of the event is still controversial, particularly with regard
   to the question whether the A ar ylyq should be classified a genocide.
   This is because the famine is linked to passing judgement on Soviet
   Kazakhstan's entire history, which also influences the country's current
   relations with Russia. It is not yet clear whether a new common view of
   the past is emerging or whether the debates about remembrance are
   dividing society.},

Title = {What Does It Take for Immigrants to Join Political Parties?},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Political parties are crucial agents in democratic representation and
   political integration of persons of immigrant origin, a growing category
   of citizens in the European Union. Research demonstrates that citizens
   of immigrant origin are less likely to join political parties than
   persons without a migratory background. Nevertheless, party membership
   varies across countries and between immigrants. Accounting for such
   inter-individual and cross -national variations, this article uses
   secondary data from the European Social Survey, the Migrant Integration
   Policy Index, and the Varieties of Democracy (V -Dem) project for 25
   European democracies to uncover mechanisms that explain the party
   membership of immigrants. In our multilevel analysis, we test
   interactions between country-specific variations in legislation on
   migration policies on the one hand and individual differences in
   political socialisation and political efficacy on the other. Our models
   suggest significant positive effects of exposure to a democratic regime
   in the country of origin and of internal efficacy on party membership of
   citizens of immigrant origin. Additionally, our findings highlight the
   significance of an inclusive national framework for immigrant
   integration, serving as a moderator to diminish the impact of political
   socialisation in less democratic countries on the decision of citizens
   with immigrant backgrounds to participate in political parties within
   their country of residence.},

Title = {The Myth of Deglobalization: Multinational Corporations in an Era of
   Growing Geopolitical Rivalries},
Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Globalization is past its peak, we are told. The rise of populist
   anti-globalization movements and the return of geopolitical rivalries
   among great powers in the 2010s has put an end to free-wheeling
   corporate global capitalism. Or has it? This article summons available
   data on cross-border corporate investments at the level of countries
   (balance of payments), firms (subsidiaries and affiliates), and
   corporate managers (industry surveys). It pays special attention to the
   period between 2015 and 2021, which spans the election of President
   Trump and the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic that have unsettled
   global politics. We analyze global patterns in foreign direct investment
   positions and in particular the evolution of investments by US
   corporations in China, arguably a ``most likely case{''} for
   deglobalization. Our analyses find no evidence that economic
   cross-border integration is in decline. The global allocation of
   corporate investments across the world's major economic regions has
   remained stable. US corporations have not notably reduced their global
   activities. If anything, their aggregate investment position in China
   has increased during the Trump administration's trade war. Overall, the
   results cast empirical doubts on prominent narratives about the state of
   the global economy. Geoeconomic transformations in world economic
   infrastructures may well be underway, but they are better understood as
   new and adapted forms of internationalization rather than the end of
   globalization.},

Title = {Latin American regionalism and integration in the ongoing process of
   hegemonic transition},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {When observing the critical balance of Latin America and the Caribbean
   in the 21st century, caught between the withdrawal of the United States
   and the rise of China in the global and regional political and economic
   stage, one cannot but wonder on what course the processes of regional
   integration and regionalism will follow in Latin America and the
   Caribbean in this context. Our hypothesis is that regionalism and the
   processes of regional integration cannot be understood as
   ``autonomist{''} processes -that is, as mere processes of facilitating
   consensus between different regional political actors- but must rather
   be perceived as a convergence with the extra-regional powers that
   dispute world hegemony, even amidst an absolute ideological diversity.
   Therefore, this work looks into the changes taking place within
   regionalism and the schemes of regional integration led by the
   Organization of American States (OAS) and the Community of Latin
   American and Caribbean States (CELAC) in the face of the ongoing
   anomalous and interstitial process of hegemonic transition from the
   United States to China that appears to be taking place; these are,
   undoubtedly, the extra-regional references shaping Latin America and the
   Caribbean regionalism in the 21st century},

Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2024},
Number = {2},
Pages = {50-64},
Abstract = {The permanent shift of modernity, the epistemological crisis, and the
   politicization of all social spheres determine an atmosphere of global
   political anxiety. The ever-expanding security deficit becomes an
   attribute of modernity, as a fragmentation as a response to globality
   and the emergence of alternative ways of political genesis reflects new
   socio-cultural semantic nodes. Existential threats raise a persistent
   appeal to religion. The loss of epistemological certainty in political
   constructions contributes to the theoretical confusion about the future.
   The diffusion of political and value contexts forces people to turn to
   religion while developing projects and setting the goals of modernity.
   This creates cognitive and political-instrumental difficulties in using
   legitimizing and, at the same time, mutually exclusive religious
   meanings. The simultaneous truth in different types of discourses and in
   theory makes it impossible to find a common denominator. We argue that
   the projects and goal settings of modernity, claiming to be universal,
   but not achieving it, are structured primarily based on the logic of
   alarmism and eschatology. A positive project, trying to overcome the
   limitations of politicization, moves to the value plane. We consider
   three perspectives of the teleology of modernity, including religious
   meanings: theoretical, metaphysical, and instrumental. The research
   methodology is based on the problems of political goal setting in the
   logic of, traditional/modern, explaining the religious coloring of
   political strategies and the splitting of future visions. The othering
   based on religious differences as a tool of political goal setting, the
   political instrumentalization of religious identities, simultaneously
   with religious creation of the world, puts two possible projects of
   modernity at opposite poles - the World of Religions and the World of
   Faith. Among the possible projects arising at the intersection of
   religion and politics, the author suggests three large clusters:
   alarmism, political expediency, and utopia},

Number = {33},
Abstract = {Gramsci's reflections on the Divine Comedy, and more particularly on
   Canto X of the Inferno, are a decisive moment in his theoretical
   maturation. Based on a meticulous study of Gramsci's notes on Dante, his
   sources and his interlocutors, Marcello Muste examines, in this chapter
   from his book Marxismo e filosofia della praxis. Da Labriola a Gramsci
   (Viella, 2018), both the coded messages- `the Cavalcante code'-
   associated with his reading of Dante and the theoretical elaboration
   developed therein. Gramsci's critique of Benedetto Croce and of the
   relationship he establishes between structure and poetry enables him to
   reformulate, through a meditation on Dante's verses, the problem of the
   relationship between the aesthetic dimension and the ethical-political
   dimension, between structure and superstructure. In this context emerges
   his concept of catharsis, which he would define later as ``the starting
   point for the whole philosophy of praxis{''}.},

   BRAZILIAN DEMOCRACY},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the institutional legacy of the Bolsonaro government
   on Brazi-lian democracy, with effects on 2023 and beyond. Focusing on
   the rebalance of the power of the executive branch vis-a-vis other
   powers, we argue that Bolsonaro's botched coup attempt exposed the
   limitations of existing regime safeguards. First, the activation of the
   military brought the shadow of raw power to the political table. Second,
   the increased leverage Congress now exercises over the executive has
   ambiguous effects on its willingness to check authoritarian overreaches
   from the President. Finally, we consider how the conflict between the
   past President and the Supreme Court has made the court more
   politicized, potentially affecting its public standing and making it a
   more likely target for future attacks within the political system. We
   suggest that, while democracy has resisted, it is not immune to
   backsliding. We briefly discuss how this reshuffling will shape the
   scenario for Lula's presidency and the Worker's Party in the coming
   years.},

Journal = {POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {The Western reactions to the Russian assault on Ukraine in 2022 were
   surprisingly united and tangible. This article argues that the
   intervention in the Russia-Ukraine war was a continuation of other
   liberal interventions that took place earlier in the current century.
   This article claims that there is no crisis of liberal interventionism
   because foreign policy decision-makers in the US agree that (liberal)
   interventions in foreign countries can serve the national interests of
   the US as well as the interests of the people in the countries affected.
   There is no crisis because the transatlantic partners in Europe backed
   the US in the interventions. Finally, there is no crisis of liberal
   interventionism because the domestic opposition in the US and Europe is
   too weak to restrain the liberal interventionist mood among Western
   governments. Liberal interventionism is still on the agenda.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic provoked critical changes to welfare in Europe,
   requiring the dematerialisation of programmes and services while relying
   mainly on remote support. This study aims to present insights into how
   European public employment services have coped and adapted to the
   pandemic challenges, particularly regarding the digitalisation and
   delivery of services to young people in rural areas. It focuses on three
   case studies from distinct European regions: Portugal, Bulgaria, and
   Lithuania. It is based on an exploratory survey of public employment
   services national offices and qualitative data collected from public
   employment services offices in rural settings. It highlights the
   advantages and dangers of the adoption of digitalisation processes,
   namely considering literacy and accessibility in diverse contexts. It
   concludes that despite cultural and regional differences, all three
   countries evidenced an acceleration in service provision due to
   digitalisation and were capable of adjusting their practices to remote
   delivery. However, rural areas faced delays due to poor infrastructure,
   and after the pandemic, public employment privileged on -site delivery,
   since it is considered more effective in the training and counselling of
   young people.},

   opportunities at school},
Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {The paper proposes to work together polarization and democratic
   dismemory in the school, in order to break the relationship that feeds
   back on both. Memory is continually reworked through group experiences
   and within a context, and this reworking is increasingly taking place in
   digital spaces. These spaces have become not only privileged places for
   the recovery and dissemination of democratic memory, but also its new
   social cadres. With this, the democratic memory is exposed to de dangers
   of the networks, among which is polarization, because democratic memory
   refers to ideological, identity and affective elements that especially
   lead to it. Polarization weakens the foundations of a democratic
   society, which is paradigmatic and serious when it occurs around a
   proposal like the democratic memory that has the opposite goal: its
   strengthening. The LOMLOE provides a framework from which to break the
   cycle between desmemory and polarization. This makes it possible to
   identify four axes from which to design learning situations that involve
   different subjects and promote the development of multiple competencies
   that, at the same time they favor the recognition of the struggle for
   democracy, also favor democratic coexistence},

Journal = {REVISTA ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {30},
Pages = {12-30},
Abstract = {In De Chair et de Fer: vivre et lutter dans une societe validiste, , the
   philosopher Charlotte Puiseux brings not only a radical critique of the
   normative sociocultural model, anchored in highly validist dynamics, but
   also seeks to think about the tensions with the norms instituted over
   bodies and social lives. In her reflections she provides theoretical-
   philosophical and militant alternatives to problematize validism. That
   is, its capacitating imposition on bodies and forms of existences that
   transgress a narcissistic, Euro- phallocentric notion of what a body is.
   One of the alternatives proposed by Puiseux is the intersection between
   queer theory and antivalidist theories. She claims that it is necessary
   to `` queerize disability.{''} The author questions the centrality
   imposed by a dual and binary perspective, instituted by guiding notions
   of thought and social practices present, both in the discourse about
   bodies and in the spaces destined for them. Thus, a problematization of
   the conceptual and social typologies of normal and pathological, of the
   valid and invalid body, of the myth of ability and disability, are
   thought by the author from the queer perspective. For her, queer theory
   builds its theoretical status precisely from the criticism of the
   naturalization and biologization of socio-historically organized,
   reinstituted, and reinvented norms that impose themselves as an
   organizational model of social life. In this sense, this article aims at
   thinking about Charlotte Puiseux's idea of queerizing the debate on
   disabilities and the interrelation between queer theory and antivalidist
   theory.},

   of internal regulatory powers, wide budgetary autonomy, and staff
   regulations), the internal and external aspects of the institutional
   autonomy of the Constitutional Court are exposed. The internal one is
   reflected, mainly, in the Organization and Personnel Regulations passed
   in 1981 and 1990. The external aspect fundamentally refers to the
   control of the activity of the support services: asymmetric judicial
   control in term of the assignment of competence, and control by
   independent administrative authorities. In relation to the latter,
   controls on contracts and transparency are analysed, with a critical
   approach to some recent proposal of amendments to the Law on
   Transparency, Access to Public Information and Good Governance.},

Title = {Endogenous Sources of Compliance with Territorial Agreements},
Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {157-190},
Abstract = {This paper develops a theory of compliance with international
   agreements, with a specific application to treaties about territory.
   Even though the signing of a treaty is (by assumption) an act of cheap
   talk, this decision can alter the incentives for subsequent compliance
   through the reactions of domestic or transnational actors. If these
   actors make decisions based on expectations of compliance, and if their
   welfare is valued by at least one of the parties to the agreement, the
   signing of an agreement can endogenously increase the costs or decrease
   the benefits of non-compliant behavior. The models developed here
   demonstrate how the signing of a border treaty can stimulate
   cross-border economic activities or the migration of co-ethnics living
   on the contested territory, both of which reduce the likelihood of
   reneging in response to future shocks to relative power. In both models,
   expectations of compliance driven by a selection mechanism become
   self-fulfilling by triggering actions that strengthen the constituency
   in favor of compliance or weaken the constituency in favor of
   non-compliance. The logic of the model is explored through a study of
   the Italy-Yugoslavia border after World War II.},

Abstract = {In Central Asia, water is a strategic resource due to its importance to
   the agricultural and energy sectors. There are competing interests for
   its use. Water policy moves between conflict and cooperation. The idea
   of cross-border neighbourhoods is of great importance within the region.
   Even in times of interstate conflict, it turned out that local water
   managers continue to cooperate. This has a conflict-mitigating effect.
   Competing interests can be reconciled. But one fundamental problem
   remains unresolved. Central Asia consumes too much water. Water use is
   not sustainable, and water resources are not adequately protected.},

Abstract = {The following paper analyzes the different narratives constructed about
   the notions of territorial peace, peace with legality and total peace,
   developed under the governments of Juan Manuel Santos, Ivan Duque and
   Gustavo Petro, respectively. Based on a discursive analysis, the main
   primary source is 18 in-depth interviews with key actors in the
   transformation of armed violence in Colombia. Based on criteria of
   relevance, plurality, representativeness and saturation, the semantic
   universes of different ideological positions are problematized, enriched
   by the voices of former FARC-EP leaders and high-ranking military
   commanders. Thus, the socio-political coordinates and the place of
   enunciation develop continuities and ruptures that gravitate around a
   concept, peace, as complex as it is polysemic.},

Abstract = {This study explores the political aspect of closed cities, which is
   understudied compared to their managerial and economic aspects. The
   author examines the association between the status of a closed city and
   political preferences in 1990s. The study suggests that closed cities
   were strongholds of both liberal and anti-communist voting. It also
   hypothesizes that the differences in political preferences between
   closed cities and the rest of Russia diminish over time. The author
   collects electoral data from 1995 to 2003 and employs regression
   analysis, finding support for these hypotheses. However, the effect of
   voting for the ``party in power{''} varies depending on the specific
   party project. This research contributes to understanding the political
   uniqueness of closed cities, considering their regional characteristics
   and social capital.},

Abstract = {A contribution to recent historiographical debates concerning the
   transnational circulation of corporatist projects and ideas, the article
   aims to determine to what extent, and with what theoretical outlooks,
   the principles of the fascist corporatist State circulated in Great
   Britain during the 1930s. The reception of fascist corporatism will be
   analysed by examining the influences that the model of the corporatist
   State, developed in Italy in the interwar period by the fascist regime,
   exerted on those British political groups that showed an interest in the
   Italian corporatist experiment. The article will focus on three British
   political groups: catholic, conservative, and fascist. Observing how
   advocates of these three political groups incorporated and
   re-interpreted the fascist corporatist model will help to highlight
   those key elements that led to the adoption of fascist corporatism as a
   reference model by different political figures such as the Catholic
   thinkers Gilbert K. Chesterton and Douglas F. Jerrold; the Conservatives
   Harold Macmillan, Eustace Percy and Leopold Amery; and finally, the most
   important representatives of the British Union of Fascists, Oswald
   Mosley and Alexander R. Thomson.},

Abstract = {Mining is of great economic importance in Kyrgyzstan. However, the
   country suffers from a ``resource curse{''}. Weak institutions enable
   the political leadership and its favourites to appropriate proceeds from
   the sale of raw materials. In order to preserve their lucrative prebends
   and protect themselves from prosecution, the rulers try to prevent a
   democratic change of government. In this way, institutions are further
   weakened. The economic damage is also considerable. Mining contributes
   little to Kyrgyzstan's socio-economic development, hinders the
   development of democracy and the rule of law, and causes massive
   environmental destruction.},

Abstract = {The continued success of populist political subjects can be observed in
   many countries in recent years, including Slovakia. Society is
   polarized, and dissatisfaction, anger, and fear are coming to the fore.
   This has been exacerbated by the pandemic, which, as a crisis, typically
   increases the potential for the spread of unfounded or even
   conspiratorial beliefs. As the occurrence of the mentioned phenomena
   postulates similar questions, the study's objective is to identify the
   rate of occurrence of populist attitudes and trust in conspiracy content
   during and after the pandemic. At different stages of the pandemic
   course, the prevalence of populist attitudes in the sample of Slovak
   adult men and women (N = 1345) and the tendency to trust conspiracy
   beliefs both in general and specifically in the context of the COVID-19
   pandemic are examined. Using the Populist Attitudes Scale, the Generic
   conspiracist beliefs scale, and the authors' questionnaire on belief in
   conspiracy claims related to the COVID-19 virus, we found a high
   prevalence of the variables of interest, with the highest rates observed
   in women, people of older age and people with lower education. Across
   the different phases of data collection, attitudes and beliefs were
   relatively stable, and a linear association was observed between them.
   The results demonstrate the validity of the study of populist attitudes
   and the tendency to believe in conspiracy content, while at the same
   time raising questions for further research.},

Journal = {POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The Basque Nationalist Party (EAJ-PNV) has become one of the main points
   of reference in regional politics over the last forty years. This paper
   analyses the factors that have influenced the electoral behaviour of its
   voters in Basque regional elections, from 1994 to elections in 2020.
   Following in the footsteps of most studies on Basque electoral
   behaviour, the nationalist and ideological dimensions will be taken as a
   reference, but extending the focus beyond them. In this sense, three
   specific objectives are set out: a) to study the PNV's location in both
   dimensions, according to the self -location of its voters; b) to analyse
   the perceived distance of its electorate towards the party itself on
   both axes using spatial models; and c) to carry out an analysis of the
   voting components by means of logistic regressions, paying attention to
   other types of variables. With regard to the third and main section, the
   results will show the importance of factors related to these two axes,
   as opposed to other types of socio -demographic or thematic variables.
   However, elements of a more affective nature, which until now have not
   received special attention, such as leadership or party identification,
   will prove to be highly significant in defining the electoral behaviour
   of voters.},

Abstract = {Before 2000, the UK operated one of the most liberal political finance
   regimes of any established democracy. Parties were highly dependent on
   private financing, state funding was minimal, limited transparency
   requirements existed with respect to party income or expenditure, and no
   limits applied to national election spending. Far-reaching reforms
   introduced by Labour in 2000 changed this regulatory environment
   radically, establishing donation disclosure requirements and capping
   election spending. However, Labour's reforms did not include significant
   increases in state funding, leaving the UK as a continued outlier in
   Western Europe in assuming political parties should predominantly be
   funded through private means. In this paper, we show how the
   Conservatives ultimately prospered under Labour's reforms, enabling them
   to greatly outspend Labour at four general elections from 2010 to 2019.
   Using the public registers created by Labour's reforms, we document how
   the party's financial re-stabilisation while in opposition was assisted
   to a surprising degree by state funding and how the party's donor base
   has shifted towards wealthy individuals and privately owned companies
   since its return to government in 2010. We conclude with a number of
   observations about how the apparently exceptional UK case can help
   generate important insights for the comparative study of political
   finance.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the debate on the normative value(s) of
   deliberative mini publics (DMPs) in climate policy-making. We discuss
   different conceptions of the objectives of DMPs, such as increasing
   democratic legitimacy, effectiveness, and social acceptance. Following,
   we critically assess the plausibility of each conception and argue why
   meaningful and independent participation is crucial for increasing
   democratic legitimacy. We also show that even if the instrumental
   perspective of climate policy effectiveness seems necessary against the
   background of the advancing climate crisis, it cannot be produced
   through deliberative formats without central democratic principles being
   ignored. Furthermore, we highlight that social acceptance as a primary
   objective is highly problematic because it threatens to lead to
   manipulation and sham participation.

   argumentieren, warum bedeutungsvolle und unabh \& auml;ngige
   Partizipation entscheidend f \& uuml;r die Steigerung der demokratischen
   Legitimit \& auml;t ist. Gleichzeitig zeigen wir, dass die
   instrumentelle Perspektive einer effektiven Klimapolitik zwar angesichts
   der fortschreitenden Klimakrise notwendig erscheint, aber nicht alleinig
   durch deliberative Formate erzeugt werden kann, ohne zentrale
   demokratische Prinzipien zu vernachl \& auml;ssigen. Dar \& uuml;ber
   hinaus heben wir hervor, dass soziale Akzeptanz als prim \& auml;res

Abstract = {This article explores the variable of emotion in the context of
   white-power music. First, it outlines and builds upon approaches to
   emotion offered through the lens of Social Movement Studies (SMS). After
   presenting a short overview of white-power music, the article then
   analyses emotion within the lyrics and musical-sonic elements of
   white-power movement music. Such analysis supports the idea that this
   distinct cultural form represents a dynamic amplifier to many of the
   emotion-based drivers that scholars suggest unfold in radicalization,
   such as social bonding and identity formation, quest for significance,
   and empowerment. The music of white-power, specifically racist skinhead
   bands, offers an insightful case study for elaborating upon the role of
   emotion within the broader field of extremism studies.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights the overlooked role of prior grievances stemming
   from historical territorial loss as a significant factor behind support
   for nationalist populist parties. While not essential for the emergence
   of nationalist populism, territorial loss uniquely aligns with the
   backward-looking victimization framing crucial to these parties'
   electoral success. Utilizing cross-national experimental and
   observational data from original surveys conducted in 2020-2021 in
   Romania, Hungary, Germany, and Turkey, we establish territorial loss
   attitudes as a robust predictor of nationalist populist party support.
   In addition to variations in national context, a trade-off emerges for
   governing populists, revealing that priming past losses attracts
   concerned voters but alienates those indifferent to territorial issues.
   Analyzing a quasi-natural experiment involving a new nationalist
   populist party that emerged in Romania between waves, we conclude that
   loss attitudes are stable over time and temporally prior to support for
   nationalist populism.},

Abstract = {A growing body of evidence indicates how climate change can, combined
   with other factors, increase the risk of violent conflict. Such claims
   have particularly been made in African contexts. This article studies
   the agency exerted by African actors in shaping international agendas on
   climate, peace, and security in the cases of (1) the UN Security
   Council, (2) The African Union and (3) COP27. The analysis shows how
   this engagement has included diplomacy, discursive innovation, epistemic
   engagement, and policy coordination. We argue that the continent's
   growing geopolitical centrality is enabling African actors to exert a
   nonaligned foreign policy on their own terms.},

Abstract = {Due to wider social, cultural and economic change, British youth are
   less understanding and supportive of, and less motivated to serve in,
   the armed forces. Meanwhile, the British all-volunteer force lacks mass
   across all its services, in particular the army, at precisely the time
   when strategic threats are growing. Based on best practices in Europe
   and beyond, Patrick Bury argues that in the forthcoming defence review,
   Britain should consider introducing a hybrid force design that blends
   professional forces with highly selective, national conscription to
   increase mass in the regular and reserve forces, build youth
   understanding of the armed forces and wider social resilience, and
   generate the data and systems around which rapidly scalable conscription
   can be introduced if needed.},

Abstract = {This article compares the Secretary General of the Elys \& eacute;e
   Palace and the US Chief of Staff,central political advisors to the
   French and US presidents. Our aim is twofold. Firstly, weidentify the
   precise roles of these advisors. By mapping their respective powers, we
   dem-onstrate their importance in presidential decision-making. By
   examining what the FrenchElys \& eacute;e Secretary General and the US
   White House Chief of Staff have in common and howthey differ, we develop
   a comparative understanding of the mechanisms of the
   presiden-tialization of political executives. We show that the
   similarities of the two offices are linkedto the ongoing
   presidentialization of the French and American political systems, which,
   bygiving greater power to heads of state, also strengthens their
   advisors. This commonalitydoes not rule out marked differences between
   these officials, demonstrating that presiden-tialization takes distinct
   forms, reflecting distinct political cultures as well as different
   bal-ances of power within each institutional system.},

Abstract = {Despite the frequent debate about membership decline, some established
   political parties in Western Europe are experiencing a significant
   increase in membership. This article examines how institutionalised
   parties handle this growth and highlights how the sheer number of new
   members and their otherness create potential pressure to adapt both
   organisationally and culturally. Based on a multitude of qualitative
   interviews with local party officials of the German Green Party, this
   article showcases how a political party tries to maintain its concept of
   party membership by adjusting its organisational structures and
   communicating its party culture while facing challenges, particularly in
   the cultural sphere.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CIVIL SOCIETY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-65},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Bolivia is the first country to incorporate the United Nations
   Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into domestic law, yet
   some have suggested that Indigenous People (IP) remain subjected to
   extensive rights violations that may amount to cultural genocide, or the
   effective destruction of a people by systemically destroying or
   undermining the integrity of their culture and system of values. This
   study examines whether there is empirical evidence to support such
   claims in civil society organizations' submissions to the latest United
   Nations Universal Periodic Review (UPR). The analysis confirms evolving
   rights and governance reforms yet details how IP are subject to
   discrimination, denial of land rights, exclusion from decision-making,
   violence and suppression of indigenous languages. We argue that whilst
   this currently falls short of cultural genocide, the present constitutes
   a critical juncture. Unless there is urgent action by government and
   other parties, over coming years this is likely to lead to the cultural
   genocide of some of the more vulnerable indigenous groups in the
   plurinational state.},

Abstract = {This essay argues that Charles Mills's normative vision for racial
   justice-a reformed, race-attentive liberalism-is fundamentally
   self-undermining because it embraces the liberal property form.
   Specifically, I show how Mills's insistence on the practical utility of
   the property form for racial justice ignores both W.E.B. Du Bois's
   signal warning about the reactionary power of propertied interests and
   how the hegemony of Lockean liberalism is a key mediator of
   racial/colonial domination in the United States. The essay first shows
   how Mills's anti-racist, social democratic liberalism relies on and
   legitimizes a property rights framework. I then analyze Du Bois's
   critique of liberal abolition-democracy during Reconstruction, surfacing
   how white propertied interests constantly threaten progressive gains and
   social democratic change. Building on Du Bois, I argue that Mills's
   reformed liberalism, by preserving the property form, places racial
   justice on an inherently unstable foundation while also excluding
   struggles for Indigenous sovereignty. Finally, I question Mills's
   pragmatic argument for restricting racial justice to a reformed
   liberalism. Mills's ``Black radical liberalism{''} is not as
   straightforwardly practical as he suggests because of the deep
   historical hold of Lockean, rather than Kantian, liberalism. Here, I
   excavate how hegemony around Lockean liberalism in the United States has
   been periodically reconsolidated, looking at the interwar and Cold War
   context as well as the deeper influence of Locke on US
   constitutionalism. Ultimately, against a politics that restricts racial
   justice to a social democratic horizon, I contend that it is necessary
   to challenge the liberal property form in the pursuit of racial justice
   and Indigenous sovereignty.},

   specific aspects of these issues to exploit electoral opportunities.
   This assertion, derived from the issue yield theory, represents a
   unified vision of valence and positional issues. While this vision
   considers one aspect of the issue emphasis debate, the issue yield
   theory has yet to investigate the moderating influence of issue saliency
   on its predictions. I address this gap by employing innovative data on
   party leaders. The findings from a survey experiment involving Swiss
   local politicians (N = 693) demonstrate that issue saliency indeed
   moderates the issue yield mechanism, influencing party leaders' choices
   regarding issue emphasis. This underscores the pivotal role of issue
   saliency and emphasizes the need to account for it in both the issue
   yield literature and broader contexts.
   Parteien und PolitikerInnen gestalten ihre Wahlkampagnen strategisch,
   indem sie sorgf \& auml;ltig ausw \& auml;hlen, welche Themen sie
   hervorheben. Zudem betonen sie spezifische Themenaspekte, um bestimmte W
   \& auml;hlerschaften anzusprechen. Diese Behauptung der Issue Yield
   Theory begr \& uuml;ndet eine einheitliche Sichtweise auf sowohl Valenz-
   als auch Positionsthemen. Obwohl die Issue Yield Theory hierdurch einen
   Aspekt der Debatte \& uuml;ber das Hervorheben von Themen ber \&
   uuml;cksichtigt, hat sie den potentiellen moderierenden Einfluss von
   Issue Saliency auf ihre Prognosen bislang nicht untersucht. Dieser
   Artikel schlie ss t diese L \& uuml;cke mithilfe innovativer Daten zu
   Parteivorsitzenden. Die Ergebnisse eines Umfrageexperiments mit
   Schweizer KommunalpolitikerInnen (N = 693) zeigen, dass Issue Saliency
   einen Einfluss darauf hat, welche Themen Parteivorsitzende betonen, und
   somit den Issue Yield Mechanismus abmildert. Diese Erkenntnis bekr \&
   auml;ftigt die zentrale Rolle der Issue Saliency und zeigt die
   Notwendigkeit auf, letztere sowohl in der Literatur zum Issue Yield als
   auch in breiteren Kontexten zu ber \& uuml;cksichtigen.
   Les partis et les hommes et femmes politiques fa \& ccedil;onnent strat

   I partiti e i politici adattano strategicamente le loro campagne
   elettorali selezionando con cura i temi (issues) da mettere in evidenza,
   talvolta enfatizzando aspetti specifici di questi temi per aumentare le
   loro chance elettorali. Questa affermazione, derivata dalla issue yield
   theory, rappresenta una visione unificata dei temi di valenza e di
   posizione. Sebbene questa visione consideri un aspetto del dibattito
   relativo ai temi enfatizzati, la issue yield theory non ha ancora
   analizzato il modo con cui la salienza dei temi possa avere un impatto
   di moderazione su quanto la teoria prevede. In questo articolo tale
   lacuna viene affrontata utilizzando dati innovativi sui leader di
   partito. I risultati di un sondaggio esperimentale che coinvolge i
   politici locali svizzeri (N=693) dimostrano che la salienza dei temi
   modera effettivamente il meccanismo di issue yield, influenzando le
   scelte dei leader di partito riguardo ai temi enfatizzati. Questo
   sottolinea il ruolo centrale della salienza dei temi e evidenzia la
   necessit \& agrave; di tenerne conto sia nella letteratura sulla issue
   yield che in contesti pi \& ugrave; ampi.},

Abstract = {To speak of ``new music{''} in Adorno is to speak of the emancipation of
   dissonance that occurred with the atonal expressionism of Sch \&
   ouml;nberg and the Vienna School to which the Adornomusician subscribed
   and which the Adorno-philosopher defended and postulated as the music of
   progress in his treatise the Philosophy of New Music. Adorno, an
   Enlightenment thinker, believed in the emancipatory capacity of human
   rationality and, therefore, in social and aesthetic progress. However,
   and as he analyzed together with Horkheimer in the Dialectic of
   Enlightenment , humanity fell again and again into new forms of
   barbarism, making it impossible to speak of progress in the world; But
   art, as social product, did manage to progress, although not in a
   teleological and linear way, but rather dialectically, that is, in
   constant dialogue with tradition, with musical material. Therefore, the
   music of progress, atonal music, was not a new music that was created ex
   nihilo, but a music that arose from the disintegration of past music, a
   music in which history, sedimented material, tonality, was destroyed by
   the emergence of dissonance as expression. Sch \& ouml;nberg, with that
   dissonant music that bothered the bourgeois ear, discerned the
   unfulfilled promises in the musical material of the past, a music that
   harmonized a disintegrated society that reached the point of no return
   in Auschwitz, and that trapped society in a constant dialectic of
   relapse of barbarism, as well as twelve-tone music captured those
   emancipatory capacities that atonal music had glimpsed. Now, this was
   not a closed dialectics but dialectics at a standstill, a stopping of
   the narrative that prevented the victims from being forgotten; that is,
   art continued to progress, il faut continuer .},

Abstract = {Despite the expansion of the regulatory agency model in Brazil since
   1996, specialized literature has raised concerns that the autonomy of
   the country's regulators has been persistently undermined. Based on a
   novel 22-year budget dataset, this study challenges the dominant
   thinking, as it points to a process of continuous institutional
   embedding. Nevertheless, this process has been endangered by fiscal
   austerity since 2016. The article contributes to the literature by
   presenting new ways in which organizational de facto autonomy can
   develop in state-dependent market economies. Moreover, it provides
   political economy insights into the legitimacy acquired by regulatory
   agencies across the political spectrum in Latin America.},

Abstract = {Digital technology is a solution in improving public services and
   governance, such as in administrative services with open access
   information. In organizing public services, the Hamparan Perak village
   government uses web-based applications, which aim to prevent corruption,
   increase transparency and reduce administrative costs in governance.
   This research uses a survey method, and is processed through smart PLS
   software. The results of this study indicate that digital-based public
   service innovation has a t value of 138.059 and a p value of 0.000. In
   addition, the results show that digital-based public service innovation
   has a significant positive effect on public value creation, which is
   1.96. Thus, by implementing an electronic system in governance, Hamparan
   Perak Village can co-create public value by fulfilling the strategic
   trangle and relating to the main components that can differentiate
   services provided by public and private organizations. The form of
   innovation in optimizing digital-based public services in Hamparan Perak
   Village is the application of web applications. This will strengthen the
   co-creation of public value derived from the level of community
   satisfaction through community trust and support for the implementation
   of web-based},

Abstract = {The article attempts to probe veteran diplomacy with the case of T \&
   uuml;rkiye and adopts its meaning from the distinct historical case of
   the Korean War. Veteran diplomacy gets attention as a means of new
   diplomacy as the changes in global political and economic order have
   brought limitations to state -centric diplomatic relations since the
   late 20 th century. Veteran diplomacy can be utilized as an opportunity
   to expand South Korea's soft power in the new public diplomacy era of
   the 21 st century. It engages diverse diplomatic actors and interacts
   with war veterans of the UN allied nations based on diplomatic security
   policies. It led to the effect of public diplomacy via open and
   multilateral communication between the countries and creating amicable
   and favorable environments to strengthen ties as well as improve South
   Korea's reputation in international society. It also paves the way for
   security cooperation with T \& uuml;rkiye.},

Abstract = {This research explored the empowerment of local communities in governing
   the border areas between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The research
   aims at strategies to improve community livelihoods through the
   development of agricultural infrastructure, increased productivity, food
   security, and community participation in decision-making. The research
   methodology used was a qualitative case study conducted in Kampung
   Mosso, on the Indonesia-Papua New Guinea borderline. Data was collected
   through interviews with local leaders and local residents, complemented
   by a review of government reports and policies, NGO documents, and other
   academic sources. Analysis will utilize NVivo software for systematic
   coding and evaluation. Research findings showed that agricultural
   infrastructure development receives the highest allocation in community
   empowerment efforts, followed by education and training, and community
   participation. The research emphasizes the importance of a holistic
   approach that does not simply address direct outcomes such as increased
   productivity, but also focuses on sustainable human and institutional
   capacity building. The research highlights that effectively empowering
   local communities in border governance involves strategic investments in
   complementary infrastructure, education and participatory processes.
   Adopting a comprehensive approach, policymakers are able to empower
   border communities to sustainably process their resources, improve their
   livelihoods, and contribute positively to sustainable development goals
   in the border area.},

Abstract = {From this article, we look for analyze the current situation of a book
   that, in principle and due to the speed with which the information
   society and digital technology has acted, seems to have few connections
   with contemporary reality. Because many and profound have been the
   changes that have occurred around its object of study, with the
   inclusion of digitization, mobile devices, and streaming platforms.
   Hence, an analysis of such cultural tools is carried out, through the
   reading offered by the theses contained in Dialectic of Enlightenment.
   Due to the breadth of the subject, and the impossibility of addressing
   it in an article, the research focuses on music and the new habits and
   rituals of around it.},

Abstract = {This article explores the perils of belonging among recently naturalized
   citizens in Russia from Tajikistan. As citizenship in Russia becomes
   accessible to ethnicized migrant workers, it becomes subalternized, a
   process broader than citizenship's neoliberalization. A racialized
   understanding of ethnicity, itself a legacy of the Soviet empire, shapes
   understandings of political membership in Russia. This has influenced
   both Russian migration legislation, as well as Russian citizenship, as
   former migrant workers become Russian citizens en masse. This article
   also explores how recently naturalized citizens embrace the ambiguity of
   new political forms of belonging within the deeply charged politics of
   new citizens' inclusion. Former migrant workers construe their belonging
   in both Russia and Tajikistan, claiming their transnational lives and
   rights to motherland/s as active political agents. Ideas of
   `motherland', however, are not strictly national or territorial:
   motherland is understood through localized and spatial experiences and
   memories. At the same time, former migrant workers' inclusion as
   political subjects in Russia has heightened the fragility of Russian
   citizenship itself, whereby citizenship can now be revoked and annulled
   with as little as a court order.},

Abstract = {Many argue that American elections at all levels of government are now
   national affairs. Yet to what extent are state executive election
   outcomes influenced by national factors? Individual election outcomes
   are used to test the relative influences of national, state, and
   individual factors in elections for governor and secondary executive
   offices. The results reinforce the federalist nature of American
   elections by indicating that individual and state factors exert greater
   influence than national factors on state executive elections, especially
   for high-profile offices and, to a somewhat lesser degree for other,
   lesser-profile offices. Similar outcomes in national and state elections
   appear to result from the partisan composition of the electorate rather
   than top-down influences. The analysis supports the view that American
   federalism is alive and well in the electoral arena.},

Abstract = {What drives legislators to emphasize local issues in a nationalized
   setting? Although the representation literature has highlighted why
   legislators present themselves as district- or nationally oriented in
   constituent-facing activities, research remains limited on this behavior
   within Congress. We leverage congressional speech to provide evidence on
   how electoral competitiveness, district demographics, and legislator
   characteristics influence representation during the committee stage, a
   critical step in policymaking. Using U.S. House hearing transcripts from
   1999 to 2018, we examine what types of legislators are more likely to
   mention their constituents and the local communities in their districts.
   Results reveal that women legislators use significantly more locally
   oriented statements compared to their male counterparts. This difference
   between male and female legislators, which is concentrated among
   Democrats, is similarly observed on the House floor. Overall, these
   results provide new evidence that the link between gender and policy
   representation persists even in settings when constituents are not the
   only intended audience.},

Abstract = {Litigants in colonial Burma were ascribed a set of personal law codes
   according to their race and religion. Women were generally given the
   personal law status of their fathers, which imposed disadvantages on the
   daughters of mixed Chinese Burmese couples. In this paper, I identify
   efforts mixed women litigants made to reinscribe their personal law by
   mobilizing claims about the communities they belonged to outside the
   court as `acts of citizenship'. I describe points of rapprochement
   between theoretical trajectories that locate citizenship in- and outside
   the law. I adapt Mamood Mamdani's classic distinction of citizen/subject
   to theorize the potential for enacting citizenship under conditions of
   colonial subjecthood.},

Title = {Estimating Ideal Points of British MPs Through Their Social Media
   Followership},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {54},

Pages = {1506-1518},

Abstract = {Ideal points of MPs in the UK House of Commons (HoC) are
   characteristically difficult to ascertain due to tight party discipline
   and strategic voting by opposition members. This research note generates
   left/right ideal point estimates for 591 British MPs sitting in the HoC
   as of 22/08/2022, ascertained through their social media followership.
   Specifically, estimates are derived by conducting correspondence
   analysis (CA) on MP Twitter (X) follower networks, which are
   subsequently validated against an expert survey, confirming that these
   estimates have a high degree of between-party (R-2 = 0.93) and
   within-party (Con: r = 0.84; Lab: r = 0.81) accuracy. The informative
   value of these estimates is then demonstrated by predicting candidate
   endorsement in the September 2022 Conservative leadership contest,

Abstract = {In the past five years, there has been a striking increase in the number
   of people experiencing homelessness, including unsheltered homelessness,
   across Canada (Infrastructure Canada, 2024). Facing this growing crisis,
   local governments are changing and expanding their responses. An
   important innovation is tiny homes, a form of deeply affordable and
   supportive housing for people leaving homelessness. In this brief
   article, I ask what explains local government's increased leadership and
   innovation with respect to homelessness and housing crises. Drawing on
   interviews and document analysis regarding the development of a tiny
   homes community in a mid-sized BC municipality, I identify three factors
   that have contributed to local government's policy innovation: 1) local
   officials are keenly aware of the inadequacies of federal and provincial
   responses and of the need for alternative approaches; 2) they hold
   important resources, notably local knowledge and land; and 3) they are
   facing pressure to respond from citizens and service providers.
   Au cours des cinq derni \& egrave;res ann \& eacute;es, le nombre de
   personnes en situation d'itin \& eacute;rance, y compris sans domicile
   fixe, a augment \& eacute; de fa \& ccedil;on frappante dans l'ensemble
   du Canada (Infrastructures Canada, 2024). Face \& agrave; cette crise
   croissante, les gouvernements locaux modifient et \& eacute;largissent
   leurs r \& eacute;ponses. Une innovation importante est la construction
   de maisons de petites dimensions, une forme de logement tr \& egrave;s
   abordable et solidaire pour les personnes qui sortent de l'itin \&
   eacute;rance. Dans ce bref article, je pose la question de savoir ce qui
   explique le leadership et l'innovation accrus des collectivit \&
   eacute;s locales en mati \& egrave;re de crise du logement et de
   l'absence d'un chez-soi. En m'appuyant sur des entretiens et l'analyse
   de documents concernant le d \& eacute;veloppement d'une communaut \&
   eacute; de petites maisons dans une municipalit \& eacute; de taille
   moyenne en Colombie-Britannique, j'identifie trois facteurs qui ont
   contribu \& eacute; \& agrave; l'innovation politique du gouvernement
   local : 1) les fonctionnaires locaux sont parfaitement conscients des
   insuffisances des r \& eacute;ponses f \& eacute;d \& eacute;rales et
   provinciales et de la n \& eacute;cessit \& eacute; d'adopter d'autres
   approches; 2) ils d \& eacute;tiennent des ressources importantes,

Abstract = {Party switching has received considerable attention in academic
   literature in recent years, especially in Brazil. Surprisingly, however,
   very little is known about the reasons why senators decide to change
   their party affiliation. Against this backdrop, this study takes the
   first step and sheds light on the matter by investigating what is behind
   senatorial party defection in Brazil. Overall, the results indicate that
   ideological distance between senators and parties emerges as the primary
   factor explaining the switch, although this relationship is slightly
   conditioned by office and vote considerations. However, the findings
   also highlight how the behaviour of senators changes according to the
   degree of the seats up to contest in the upcoming elections (i.e.
   one-third or two-thirds of the chamber). Thus, our results add another
   piece to understanding the party switching puzzle in Brazil and bring
   important implications for legislative studies and legislative
   behaviour.},

Abstract = {The problem of economic federalism in Argentina is closely related to
   its regional structure. This paper proposes a characterization of this
   structure as a contested and composite centrality, shaped by three main
   regions: the city of Buenos Aires, the Buenos Aires metropolitan area,
   and the interior of the Pampas region. The hypothesis is that the
   tension between these regions revolves around the primary scarce
   resource for peripheral economies: foreign currency. This tension is
   believed to be channeled through three institutional mechanisms: the
   foreign exchange market, export duties, and the capital inflow/outflow
   policy. Finally, some stylized facts of the Argentine macroeconomy are
   interpreted based on these hypotheses. The paper concludes by observing
   that economic federalism in Argentina is at play in the governance of
   these mechanisms.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship, indeed what is the interface, between
   disappearing biological groups of plants and animals and disappearing
   human cultural groups? Hardly more than a generation ago, the question
   itself would have been considered academically abstruse, even gauche.
   Today, in the high era of the Anthropocene with the natural world facing
   a sixth extinction, and traditional ethno-social groups founded on
   living relationships to niche eco-systems diminishing before our eyes,
   the question is more than urgent. This piece explores around the edges
   of this conundrum, ``edges{''} or more precisely historic ``rimlands{''}
   comprising a discrete yet ``normal{''} eastern European and Aegean world
   of rich, ethnographic communities and interactions between communities
   across the longue dur \& eacute;e, shattered not just by forces of
   extreme violence but also by a seemingly ineluctable nation-state-driven
   developmentalism. Might we consider the relentless and ostensibly
   irresistible ``perturbations{''} of modernity which in the process
   consigned whole elements of a rich human mosaic to the marginalisation
   of ``minority{''} status, through the prism of global, omnicidal forces
   which are bringing the entire biosphere to the brink of catastrophe? If
   this is the case, the struggle for human difference and biological
   diversity suggests a common cause, and a common solidarity.},

Abstract = {In May 2024, the Senedd Cymru (Members and Elections) Bill completed its
   legislative journey through the Senedd Cymru/Welsh Parliament. The bill
   marks the latest chapter in the Senedd's evolution from an assembly
   established with no formally separated executive branch and no primary
   legislative powers into a lawmaking and tax-raising parliament. It also
   marks the culmination of a long-running debate about the size of the
   Welsh legislature. For at least twenty years there had appeared to be a
   broad agreement that the Senedd was too small, its capacity too thinly
   spread and that a larger membership of at least eighty, but closer to
   ninety or 100, members was required. In those respects, the Senedd Cymru
   (Members and Elections) Bill can be seen as the culmination of that
   long-established consensus. However, as this article will explore, in
   one key area-the choice of electoral system-the bill marks a key point
   of departure.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how the structures of ruling and opposition
   political parties in dictatorships relate to party strategies and
   authoritarian regime survival. We focus on two key dimensions of party
   structures: organizational strength and concentration of power in the
   leadership. We argue that organizational strength will encourage party
   reliance on clientelism, while concentration of power in the leadership
   will lead to party reliance on coercion. Using cross-national data from
   1970 to 2019 that capture features of political parties, we find support
   for our expectations. We also explore how the structural and strategic
   nature of parties bear on autocratic breakdown. Our analysis reveals,
   among other patterns, that organizational strength in opposition parties
   is associated with more vulnerable authoritarian rule, a relationship
   mediated by the opposition party's reliance on clientelism. This study
   therefore improves understanding of authoritarian political parties and
   their consequences, shedding light on many potential avenues for future
   research.},

Abstract = {People on the radical right are often considered to be climate deniers.
   Today, however, the new right in France has embraced a radical,
   ecological agenda and set out to experiment with traditional, agrarian
   ways of life. This paper asks how the new right currently revives a
   far-right tradition of ecological thought and how they practice this
   ecological vision. To move forward with their ethno-ecological utopia
   and salvage European civilization, they turn away from national politics
   and create local communities or `identitarian sanctuaries'. This article
   explores the new right's practiced eco-utopias from three different
   angles. First, it shows how the `native soil' and notions of
   `rootedness' are pivotal for their understanding of identity. Second, it
   examines how the new right reframes `biodiversity' as a plurality of
   European cultures, currently threatened by global capitalism and
   unchecked immigration. Finally, the article argues that the new right's
   critique of modernity is not only political but also epistemic. To break
   free from modern scientific worldviews and enable a re-enchantment of
   nature, they turn to fantasy literature as well as Romantic and
   neo-pagan spiritualities.},

Abstract = {How do forms of trust influence South Korean views of North Korean
   arrivals? While a broad literature addresses the institutional and
   generalized social trust impacting a range of public perceptions, this
   has not been extended to views on North Korean arrivals. Meanwhile,
   research on views of arrivals often relies on only one measure for what
   are likely complex concerns. Through the use of a 2021 Korean Social
   Integration Survey, we find evidence of institutional and social trust
   positively influencing overall views of arrivals, with mixed results on
   the impact on proximal tolerance of arrivals, suggesting that policy
   efforts to enhance trust as a means to improve integration efforts may
   fail to produce substantive improvements for arrivals.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the Marcos golden age narratives on YouTube
   before the 2022 Philippine presidential elections. Despite evidence of
   brutality during the Marcos years, many Filipinos reminisce about his
   tenure as a period of peace and progress, influenced by selective
   historical accounts propagated through digital media. Expanding Laclau's
   theory of populism, we identify affective storytelling techniques
   prominent pro-Marcos YouTubers employ to glorify the Marcos era and
   examine them to understand how the populist logic of difference and
   equivalence guides the articulation of a romanticized past and endorses
   the vilification of elites and Marcos critics. Our analysis underscores
   the potency of nostalgia in populist and authoritarian politics,
   demonstrating their capacity to foster a collective yearning for a
   mythic past and stoke a collective desire for Marcos-brand
   authoritarianism. Ultimately, this article contributes to understanding
   the dynamics of historical revisionism and its implications for
   political discourse and historical consciousness in the digital age,
   emphasizing the role of YouTubers in shaping political landscapes
   through nostalgia and the manipulation of social memory.},

Abstract = {Several prominent studies predict that expanding markets in areas of low
   state capacity may decrease organized crime due to the opportunity cost
   mechanism, holding that booms in licit markets shift labor away from
   illicit markets. We posit an additional mechanism to explain the
   decrease in criminal violence-an influx in capital allows market actors
   to invest in self-defense forces to combat criminal incursions. We test
   this logic using the case of the Mexican avocado industry with a
   staggered difference-in-differences design and find that trade
   liberalization throughout the 2010s had a significant negative effect on
   cartel-related homicides compared to other violence-prone areas. Robust
   qualitative evidence highlighting the emergence of self-defense groups
   to deter criminal actors in the avocado industry supports the vigilante
   mechanism. This article thus contributes to the literature on the
   consequences of trade liberalization on organized crime by using a
   unique empirical case to test a novel mechanism.},

Abstract = {The ideological and issue positions of parties are known to shape
   citizens' political attitudes and voting behaviour. One important way to
   obtain estimates of parties' positions is to ask experts to place
   parties on salient ideological dimensions. The Chapel Hill Expert Survey
   (CHES) has been collecting such estimates for democracies in Europe and
   elsewhere. CHES Canada adds to this project by providing estimates of
   party positions and characteristics of Canadian federal parties and
   provincial parties in Ontario and Quebec. This note introduces this new
   data source, clarifies how the data were collected and illustrates how
   the data can be used to (comparatively) study party politics in Canada.},

Abstract = {On the eve of the 2024 European elections in Ireland, predictions
   suggested a potential seismic shift in the political landscape. Sinn F
   \& eacute;in, the leading opposition party, was expected to make
   significant gains at the expense of the coalition government. However,
   when the dust settled, it became clear that a Sinn F \& eacute;in surge
   did not materialise; Ireland maintained its political centre. Fine Gael
   held firm, losing only one seat, while Fianna F \& aacute;il doubled its
   seat count. The Green Party suffered the most, losing both its seats.
   Opposition parties fared worse than expected with Sinn F \& eacute;in
   managing to gain only one additional seat, and Labour securing its first
   win since 2009. Independent candidates performed well overall,
   maintaining their seat count, but with their composition altered. This
   report offers a detailed review of the election, highlighting key issues
   and results, and examining the electoral context, main candidates,
   campaign trail, and opinion polls. Domestic issues dominated the
   discussions, with European matters barely mentioned. Immigration,
   housing, and agriculture took precedence, while climate change, and the
   wars in Ukraine and Middle East were largely overlooked. This reinforces
   the argument that European elections often resemble as second-order
   elections, albeit with some differences.},

Abstract = {What brings competing parties to coalesce into new entities? I present a
   model of electoral competition in which parties can form alliances and
   decide how binding these should be. Parties face a dynamic trade-off
   between insuring themselves against significant shifts in public opinion
   and allowing flexibility to respond to future electoral changes. The
   model shows that more binding alliances such as mergers emerge in
   equilibrium when electoral volatility is high; instead, when voters are
   predictable (e.g., highly partisan), parties either run alone or form
   more flexible preelectoral coalitions. When the electorate is
   sufficiently volatile, a risk-averse centrist party might prefer to
   merge with an ideologically extreme party than with a moderate one.},

Abstract = {This essay builds on the work of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari to
   outline a consummative mood of authoritarian politics in Turkey. It
   defines the consummative mood as the fetishization of efficacy and
   delivery, the desire to realize value and bring cycles of social
   production to fruition. Focusing on the operations of the consummative
   mood across the construction of megaprojects in Istanbul's peripheries,
   this essay highlights how consummation brings together fantasies of
   national resurgence and sovereignty on the one hand and economic growth
   and autonomy on the other. Conclusively, it argues that while several
   scholars have traced the political-economic transformations Turkey has
   experienced throughout the governing Justice and Development Party's
   reign, zooming in on consummation can help us connect these accounts to
   an affective story, focused on bodies, affects and subjectivity.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the political implications of the debate between
   medieval Islamic philosophy and theology regarding the soteriological
   importance of hardship. Reviewing key works by al-Ghazali and
   al-Zamakhshari, I show that these theologians assert that divine rewards
   in the afterlife must be earned through the fulfillment of burdensome
   religious obligations. I subsequently turn to al-Farabi's Fusul
   Muntaza'a, focusing on the philosopher's discussion of virtue,
   happiness, and self-restraint. I argue that al-Farabi, though ultimately
   critical of that version of piety that seeks to make earthly life
   difficult for the sake of divine reward, simultaneously advocates for
   the popular adoption of just such a view. Finally, I discuss the precise
   manner in which the Fusul pertain to modern political debates in the
   Muslim world regarding the relationship between reason and revelation. I
   argue that al-Farabi's profound understanding of religious psychology
   makes clear the shortcomings of both a pious embrace of hardship as the
   key to salvation and a purely worldly politics.},

   small states save R2P from failure and oblivion?},
Journal = {NORDIC JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {435-444},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This article presents the background for and some main themes emerging
   from a research project on small states and atrocity prevention at the
   United Nations. The UN norm of the responsibility to protect (R2P) is
   widely considered to be struggling due to a tense global political
   climate and a lack of political will among member states to commit to
   the norm. The articles in this special issue address the role of small
   states in promoting the norm. Small states are often seen as norm
   entrepreneurs, and all the states studied in this special issue are
   strong advocates of human rights and the multilateral system. The
   analyses of Ghana, Norway, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden,
   the Czech Republic and Slovenia show that small states nonetheless have
   different approaches to R2P. While the small states under review all
   provide rhetorical support for the norm, their role in norm advancement
   varies considerably, even among European and Nordic small states. Thus,
   while small states certainly can find arenas where R2P can be promoted,
   they cannot be seen as guarantors of the norm. Moreover, the articles
   illustrate that norm promotion may be more viable outside the UN
   Security Council, despite the Council's role as the only authority that
   can implement R2P by force.},

Title = {Towards a critical space theory: The instrumental politics of space
   exploitation},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 28},
Abstract = {Though a growing number of voices in public discourse are expressing
   reservations about the new space race and its implications, inherently
   political questions have remained largely untouched by political
   theorists: Who is space for and for whose benefit? What are the
   ideological presumptions and functions of private space exploration? To
   confront this astro-aporia, we proceed in four parts. First, we develop
   a typology of two broad positions that predominate in contemporary
   criticism of space exploration: those who are ``space pessimists{''} and
   those who are ``space neutral{''}; second, we critique those two
   positions for relying on an instrumental rationality that cedes too much
   ground to the logic of instrumentalizing and exploiting that which is
   deemed non-human nature; third, we examine the linked material and
   ideological forces fueling the current space race and its enthusiastic
   supporters; and finally, we formulate a dialectical position that
   remains critical of space exploitation as it is currently undertaken,
   but on grounds other than mere utility, thus offering a way to reorient
   the discussion toward a critical theory of space. From this perspective,
   space's meaning-making role for humanity can be understood as good and
   should be held in common, rather than being either abandoned or
   plundered.},

Abstract = {I review a recent article published in this journal (Ademi and Kimya,
   2023) which uses a continuous measure of democracy as the basis for a
   `fuzzy regression discontinuity design' investigating the effect of
   democratization on party system polarization. I argue that their design
   does not qualify as a regression discontinuity design because continuous
   measures of democracy produced by social scientists are not used to
   assign treatments to country-years, and because the authors misuse the
   auxiliary variable recording regime transitions used in their analysis.},

Journal = {LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-106},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Today, rank-and-file members are increasingly removed from the
   legislative process and often rely on congressional leaders for
   information to discuss major legislative decisions with constituents. As
   a result, preparing constituent communication materials has become an
   institutionalized responsibility for party and committee leaders,
   leading to a partisan discussion of legislation. Using a mixed-methods
   approach of computational text analysis and elite interviews, I
   demonstrate how members of Congress use leader-led, partisan messages
   for constituent communication. Echoing prior work on asymmetric
   partisanship, I find that Republican leaders are more likely to
   encourage party-centric messaging, and rank-and-file Republicans,
   particularly in the House, are more likely to adopt party messaging. The
   findings illustrate the institutional power of party leaders in a
   centralized Congress, as well as the role that constituent communication
   plays in encouraging and maintaining asymmetric polarization.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Gambling has both negative and positive impacts on every economy. The
   existing literature of gambling-related protests has mostly centered on
   ``cost-challenging protests,{''} referring to resistance against social
   costs such as legalized gambling, problem gambling, and environmental
   deterioration. In this article, we adopt alternative types of collective
   action, namely ``benefit-sharing protests,{''} referring to those that
   seek state or casino companies to share economic benefits. By analyzing
   754 protests in Macao from 2000 to 2021, this study examines the trends
   and characteristics of gambling-related movements in the Chinese special
   administrative region. The results indicate that most protests were
   benefits-sharing in nature rather than cost-challenging. The conclusion
   strongly supports the thesis that improved performance by the gambling
   sector can help alleviate conflicts within society. Interestingly, as
   revenue from the gambling sector increases, there is a corresponding
   rise in benefit-sharing protests, which acknowledge the contributions of
   the gambling industry and advocate for enhanced welfare transformation
   for residents. These findings offer a novel perspective on understanding
   protests related to gambling in the context of Macao's well-established
   gambling economy.},

Abstract = {Public-private partnership (PPP) has delivered expected results on a
   number of significant projects. Yet, despite the growing appeal,
   problems have been encountered which have either resulted in slow
   progress or the total failure of such arrangements. This study offers a
   comparison between Nigeria and South Africa focusing on several
   identified critical success factors (CSFs) for PPPs. We rely on
   secondary data to compare Nigeria and South Africa based on the top ten
   ranking CSFs identified in the literature. Findings reveal that both
   countries account for the highest number of PPP projects in Africa but
   have not recorded huge successes as a result of their shortcomings in
   important CSFs responsible for the success of PPPs. Nigeria, for
   instance, is still being challenged with poor energy supply, bad road
   networks, and ineffective waste management practices, among others.
   South Africa appears to have had better success in PPP delivery due to a
   suitable financial market, stable economic policy, favorable legal
   framework, and a transparent procurement process. We conclude by
   highlighting the key CSFs for PPPs in Nigeria and South Africa and
   emphasize the need to address the identified shortcomings. The relevance
   of this study is in its contribution to the understanding of CSF in PPP
   projects thereby offering useful insights for policy makers and
   administrators in improving the success rate of PPPs and enhancing the
   delivery of public services in these countries.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the localistic behavior of legislators elected
   under open-list proportional representation (OLPR), focusing on the
   impacts of district magnitude, intra-party competition, electorate size,
   and the presence of a national tier. We examine the Ecuadorian case,
   where institutional reformers implemented a national tier to offset the
   parochial tendencies of lower-tier provincial legislators yet retained
   OLPR for both tiers. Our study, which analyzes a 12-year dataset of
   congressional speeches, challenges the expectation that national-tier
   members are less localistic than their provincial counterparts and shows
   that electoral incentives drive legislators' geographical focus.
   Contrary to conventional expectations, we find no evidence that
   increased intra-party competition is associated with more localistic
   behavior. However, there is consistent support for the hypothesis that
   smaller electoral constituencies amplify localistic behavior.},

Abstract = {Presidential elections are arguably the most consequential recurring
   political event in the United States. Understanding the factors that
   determine their outcomes, therefore, is of substantial importance. One
   proposed factor pertains to presidential candidates' incumbency status,
   yet its nature is complex and difficult to study with observational
   data. In particular, the individual-level mechanisms underlying
   incumbency effects remain unclear. This study proposes many citizens
   generally believe that, ceteris paribus, presidents should be afforded
   two terms. Crucially, such a norm implies that incumbency status
   possesses an inherent effect, operating independent of other mechanisms
   that may stem from incumbency. A large, pre-registered survey experiment
   was therefore employed to isolate the effect of incumbency status on
   presidential vote choice. The experiment finds strong evidence that
   one-term incumbent candidates have an inherent advantage against their
   non-incumbent opponents. The results also clarify that the two-term
   disadvantage present in observational data is not inherent, and is
   perhaps better understood simply as the absence of the one-term
   advantage. The study thus points toward a micro-foundational mechanism
   underlying incumbent-party performance in presidential elections.
   Finally, analyses of panel data explore which voters may be
   systematically inclined to vote based upon the incumbency status of
   presidential candidates.},

Abstract = {Territorial differentiation entails challenges for legitimate
   representation as legislators may be empowered to vote on legislation
   that does not affect their constituencies. A typical example of this
   democratic dilemma is the ``West Lothian question{''} in the United
   Kingdom, where all members of the House of Commons can vote on bills
   that only affect England. The European Union faces a similar dilemma
   when members of the European Parliament vote on bills from which their
   member states are exempted. We analyse EU legislators' voting behaviour
   on differentiated policies to provide the missing empirical evidence for
   an informed debate about the institutional design of legislative rules
   under differentiation. We show that legislators abstain more frequently
   than their party group colleagues when their constituency is not subject
   to a bill due to sovereignty concerns. This practice of abstention
   resembles an existing norm in the United Kingdom and mitigates the
   democratic dilemma associated with differentiation.
   Die territoriale Differenzierung politischer Systeme stellt die legitime

   da Abgeordnete dazu befugt sein k \& ouml;nnen, \& uuml;ber Gesetze

   f \& uuml;r dieses demokratische Dilemma ist die ,,West Lothian Question

   auml;hnlichen Dilemma, wenn Mitglieder des Europ \& auml;ischen
   Parlaments \& uuml;ber Gesetzesvorlagen abstimmen, von denen ihre
   Mitgliedstaaten ausgenommen sind. Wir analysieren das
   Abstimmungsverhalten der EU-Abgeordneten zu differenzierten Rechtsakten
   und tragen mit neuen empirischen Belegen zur Debatte \& uuml;ber die
   institutionelle Ausgestaltung von Gesetzgebungsregeln im Fall

   La differenziazione territoriale pone sfide alla democrazia

   dilemma democratico \& egrave; la ``West Lothian question{''} nel Regno

   leggi che riguardano solo l'Inghilterra. L'Unione Europea si trova ad
   affrontare un dilemma simile quando gli europarlamentari votano su
   progetti di legge da cui i rispettive Stati membri sono esentati.
   Analizziamo il comportamento di voto dei legislatori dell'UE sulle
   politiche differenziate per fornire la prova empirica mancante circa al

Abstract = {How politically important are family issues to voters overall and in the
   context of economic and cultural political opinion cleavages? We use
   data from the 2014 New Zealand Election Study to answer these questions.
   More than 60\% of respondents claim that family issues - generally
   defined - were `somewhat' or `very important' when deciding whom to vote
   for in the 2014 elections, suggesting that family issues are viewed as
   politically significant. Many respondents have clear political issues in
   mind when it comes to family and there is a strong connection between
   believing family issues are important and holding more economic
   left-wing attitudes and cultural authoritarian attitudes. Qualitatively,
   there is strong agreement on the main family issues of importance among
   those who argue that their vote was influenced by family issues, with
   education and healthcare defined as the most important. However, crucial
   differences in the most commonly listed family issues occur between
   citizens depending on their positions on the economic and cultural
   left-right dimensions. Arguably, the relative importance of family
   issues opens a unique cross-cutting view into the socioeconomics of vote
   choice.},

Abstract = {The scholarship on party digitalization discusses why, how and with what
   consequences parties use digitalization. Such a detailed account of the
   supply side contrasts sharply with the limited information we have about
   the demand side. We know little about party members' support for
   digitalization. To address this gap in the literature, our article aims
   to explain what drives the support for digitalization within political
   parties. We use individual-level data from an original survey conducted
   in March-April 2023 with 2,032 members of the second largest party in
   Romania. The statistical analysis tests the effects of two main
   categories of explanations: technology winners and reinforcement
   hypothesis. We find that those party members who are active and informed
   about party activities will support party digitalization. The results
   hold when controlling for technology experience and skills, length of
   membership, position in the party and age.
   In der Literatur zur Digitalisierung von Parteien wird diskutiert,
   warum, wie und mit welchen Folgen Digitalisierung in Parteien
   stattfindet. Die detaillierte Darstellung der Angebotsseite steht in
   starkem Kontrast zu den wenigen verf \& uuml;gbaren Informationen \&
   uuml;ber die Nachfrageseite. Wir wissen wenig dar \& uuml;ber, inwieweit
   Parteimitglieder die Digitalisierung unterst \& uuml;tzen. Um diese L \&
   uuml;cke in der Literatur zu schlie ss en, versucht unser Artikel zu
   erkl \& auml;ren, was die Unterst \& uuml;tzung f \& uuml;r die
   Digitalisierung in politischen Parteien antreibt. Wir verwenden Daten
   auf individueller Ebene aus unserer eigenen Umfrage. Dabei handelt es
   sich um Daten von 2032 Mitgliedern der zweitgr \& ouml;ss ten Partei Rum
   \& auml;niens, die zwischen M \& auml;rz und April 2023 befragt wurden.
   Die statistische Analyse \& uuml;berpr \& uuml;ft zwei wesentliche Erkl
   \& auml;rungsans \& auml;tze: Technologiegewinner und die
   Reinforcement-Hypothese. Wir stellen fest, dass aktive und \& uuml;ber
   die Aktivit \& auml;ten der Partei informierte Parteimitglieder den
   Digitalisierungsprozess der Partei unterst \& uuml;tzen. Die Ergebnisse
   bleiben auch dann bestehen, wenn f \& uuml;r technische Erfahrung, F \&
   auml;higkeiten, Dauer der Parteimitgliedschaft, Position in der Partei
   und Alter kontrolliert wird.
   La recherche sur la num \& eacute;risation des partis examine pourquoi,
   comment et avec quelles cons \& eacute;quences les partis utilisent la
   num \& eacute;risation. En revanche, nous savons peu de choses sur le
   soutien des membres des partis \& agrave; la num \& eacute;risation.
   Pour combler cette lacune, notre article vise \& agrave; expliquer ce
   qui motive le soutien \& agrave; la num \& eacute;risation au sein des
   partis politiques. Nous utilisons les donn \& eacute;es individuelles
   d'une enqu \& ecirc;te originale men \& eacute;e en mars-avril 2023 aupr
   \& egrave;s de 2 032 membres du deuxi \& egrave;me plus grand parti de
   Roumanie. L'analyse statistique teste les effets de deux grandes cat \&
   eacute;gories d'explications: les gagnants de la technologisation et
   l'hypoth \& egrave;se de renforcement. Nous constatons que les membres
   du parti qui sont actifs et inform \& eacute;s des activit \& eacute;s
   du parti soutiennent la num \& eacute;risation du parti. Les r \&
   eacute;sultats restent valables lorsque l'on tient compte de l'exp \&
   eacute;rience et les comp \& eacute;tences technologiques, la dur \&
   eacute;e de l'adh \& eacute;sion, la position dans le parti et l'\&
   acirc;ge.
   Gli studi sulla digitalizzazione dei partiti esplorano il perch \&
   eacute;, il come e con quali conseguenze i partiti fanno uso di
   digitalizzazione. Un'analisi cos \& igrave; dettagliata dal lato
   dell'offerta contrasta nettamente con le poche informazioni disponibili
   sul lato della domanda. Sappiamo poco in quale misura i membri dei
   partiti sostengano la digitalizzazione. Per colmare questa lacuna nella
   letteratura, il nostro articolo cerca di trovare i fattori che
   influenzano il sostegno alla digitalizzazione all'interno dei partiti
   politici. Utilizziamo dati a livello individuale provenienti da un
   sondaggio originale condotto tra marzo e aprile 2023, che ha coinvolto
   2.032 membri del secondo partito pi \& ugrave; grande della Romania.
   L'analisi statistica analizza l'impatto di due principali categorie di
   spiegazioni: l'ipotesi dei vincitori tecnologici e l'ipotesi di
   rafforzamento. L'analisi dimostra che i membri che sono attivi e
   informati sulle attivit \& agrave; del loro partito tendono a sostenere
   la digitalizzazione del partito. Questi risultati rimangono validi anche
   quando si controllano variabili come l'esperienza e le competenze
   tecnologiche, la durata dell'iscrizione al partito, la posizione nel
   partito e l'et \& agrave;.},

Abstract = {The Iranian intelligence apparatus acquired an institutional structure
   in the modern period, particularly under the rule of Mohammad Reza
   Pahlavi. It was associated with the renowned SAVAK and underwent
   substantial transformations following the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
   Notwithstanding the initial reservations of certain revolutionary
   leaders, notably Ruhollah Khomeini, it re-emerged as a formidable
   ministry in 1984. Since the 2000s, with the reinforcement of the IRGC
   within the country and its growing importance in all strategic sectors,
   from energy to communication, parallel structures have begun to emerge
   in the field of intelligence. This situation stems from the internal
   power struggle and represents a significant source of vulnerability and
   potential leaks, as later acknowledged by former intelligence directors.
   This article will provide a concise overview of the historical
   milestones of the Iranian intelligence apparatus up until 1979, followed
   by an examination of the debates that took place during the
   post-revolutionary restructuring of the security bureaucracy. In this
   context, the structure and activities of the Ministry of Intelligence
   will be compared with those of similar institutions in other countries.
   Finally, the issues that have arisen as a result of the competition
   between the intelligence agencies of the IRGC and other intelligence
   organizations will be discussed.},

   node in its Belt and Road Initiative and an emerging venue for US-China

   into three dimensions: economic, strategic and cultural. China is
   careful not to become mired in Middle Eastern politics and regional
   countries generally welcome China's growing engagement. China's
   expanding footprint in the region may intensify US-China rivalry.},

Abstract = {The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) represents a
   significant pivot in the economic and strategic orientations of the
   Indo-Pacific region, reflecting a collective endeavor to foster economic
   integration, sustainability, and security among its member states. This
   shift has profound implications for China, a main regional power with
   vested interests across the economic, political, and security spectrums.
   This paper delves into the multifaceted options available to China in
   response to the IPEF, analysing the strategic, economic, and diplomatic
   avenues Beijing might pursue to safeguard its interests and maintain its
   regional presence. Through a comprehensive examination of official
   statements, policy adjustments, and strategic engagements, the paper
   outlines China's nuanced approach towards the IPEF, ranging from
   competitive economic policies and regional partnerships to diplomatic
   overtures aimed at reshaping the narrative around regional cooperation
   and development. By dissecting these strategies, the paper sheds light
   on the evolving dynamics of regional power play, offering insights into
   how China navigates the challenges and opportunities posed by the IPEF.
   The analysis concludes with a discussion on the potential ramifications
   of China's strategies for the regional order, suggesting pathways for
   future research and policy considerations.},

Abstract = {What social processes guide the spread of ethnic or racial exclusion? I
   investigate the diffusion of medieval expulsions of Jews among over 500
   polities in the western Holy Roman Empire, 1385-1520 CE. For medieval
   governors, religious and material concerns were strong rationales
   against expulsion. Yet expulsions increase markedly in the 15th century.
   Did an expulsion by one government affect another government's choices
   about expulsion? I appraise three common theories of policy diffusion:
   learning, social reinterpretation, and social structural and resource
   constraints. Statistical models provide evidence only for the latter
   two. While theological changes gave expulsion fresh political value, the
   adoption of expulsion followed political and economic incentives that
   were embedded in inter-city relationships of power and dependency. The
   results indicate that social influence, especially spatial proximity,
   cannot be assumed to accelerate ethnoracial extremism.},

Abstract = {The activity Making Agreements with Friends was developed to help
   students understand the complex concepts of informal agreements and
   bargaining. Specifically, this activity sheds light on the reputation
   costs and strategies (iteration, issue linkage, and coercion) that
   countries rely on to foster cooperation. To do so, the activity
   leverages a relatable analogy, in which students are tasked with
   deciding which of their friends they should (and should not) lend money
   to at a pub. This approach is valuable because although students do not
   have firsthand knowledge about creating informal international
   agreements, they have extensive experience with informal interpersonal
   agreements. That is, the logic and strategies students use to decide who
   they can trust in an informal interpersonal agreement are similar to the
   logic and strategies countries use when making informal international
   agreements. Anonymous student evaluations and results from a
   pre-and-posttest on the material provide evidence that this activity is
   a fun, engaging, and effective way to teach these concepts to
   undergraduate students.},

Abstract = {While scholars consider the global democratic deficit a key issue, we
   know little about citizens' perceptions in this regard. To what extent
   and why do citizens perceive global democratic deficiencies? I
   conceptualize deficiencies absolutely and relatively-theorizing
   countries, knowledge, and framing as explanatory factors. Between 2018
   and 2021, I conducted survey experiments on around 42,000 respondents in
   17 highly diverse countries. Contrary to many scholarly assessments, I
   find that most people do not perceive major global democratic
   deficiencies, in the sense that global governance is generally not
   perceived as highly undemocratic in absolute terms and more democratic
   than developing democracies. However, the results vary by the object and
   aspect of inquiry: World politics (versus international organizations)
   and input (versus output) are perceived as less democratic. Plus,
   neither gains in relevant knowledge nor common framings affect public
   perceptions, which are thus quite robust. These findings add novel
   evidence to debates about global governance.},

   discordant monozygotic twins; Study 2 assesses the impact of a Swedish
   education reform; and Study 3 analyses dizygotic twins with the use of a
   polygenic index for education, a DNA-based measure for genetic
   predispositions toward education. The results indicate that education
   does modestly promote open views toward immigration (Study 1), yet the
   reform's effect remains uncertain (Study 2). Study 3 offers direct
   evidence of the effects of genetic predispositions and suggests that
   genetics related to education may influence attitudes beyond achieved
   educational attainment. These findings confirm the positive impact of
   education while pointing to the combined influence of genetic and social
   pathways in shaping immigration attitudes.},

   Narratives of Religious Actors on the Ukraine War},

Abstract = {In the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, reactions by religious
   leaders have differed greatly, with the Shia Ayatollah blaming the
   United States for the war, the Catholic Pope calling the United Nations
   ``impotent,{''} and the Dalai Lama stating that ``war is outdated.{''}
   But has there been a change in any of these religious narratives when it
   comes to war? Does the Ukraine war signify a turning point, or can we
   observe more of the same? Embedded in an English School framework, this
   article conducts a narrative analysis to better understand whether and
   how the primary institutions of war and international law are being
   (re)interpreted. The article analyses these three religious actors'
   narratives on the Ukraine war and compares them to their respective past
   war narratives. The article examines how these narratives reflect a
   strengthening and even an expansion or an undermining and thus weakening
   of international society, with a particular emphasis on the primary
   institutions of war and international law as well as the secondary
   institution of the United Nations. The article argues that at least for
   religious actors in international politics, the Ukraine war does not
   pose a formative event in global security policy. Instead, these actors
   may have missed a critical juncture for strengthening or even upholding
   international law.
   Die Reaktionen von Religionsf \& uuml;hrern infolge des russischen
   Angriffskriegs auf die Ukraine fielen sehr unterschiedlich aus. W \&
   auml;hrend der schiitische Ayatollah die USA f \& uuml;r den Krieg
   verantwortlich machte, bezeichnete der r \& ouml;misch-katholische Papst
   die Vereinten Nationen als ,,impotent{''}; und der Dalai Lama erkl \&
   auml;rte, Krieg w \& auml;re \& uuml;berholt. Aber hat es seit dem
   Ukraine-Krieg eine Ver \& auml;nderung der religi \& ouml;sen Narrative
   gegeben? Handelt es sich bei dem Ukraine-Krieg um formatives Ereignis
   (eine ,,Zeitenwende{''}) oder bleibt alles beim Alten? Die Englische
   Schule bildet das theoretische Rahmenwerk des Artikels, der mithilfe
   einer narrativen Analyse untersucht, ob und wie die Prim \&
   auml;rinstitutionen Krieg und V \& ouml;lkerrecht (neu) interpretiert
   werden. Die Narrative dieser drei Religionsf \& uuml;hrer zum
   Ukraine-Krieg werden mit vergangenen Kriegsnarrativen verglichen. Auf
   dieser Analyse aufbauend, erforscht der Artikel, inwiefern diese
   Narrative ein Erstarken oder gar ein Ausweiten oder ein Untergraben und
   somit eine Schw \& auml;chung der internationalen Gesellschaft
   widerspiegelt. Dabei wird ein Schwerpunkt auf die Prim \&
   auml;rinstitutionen Krieg und V \& ouml;lkerrecht sowie auf die Sekund
   \& auml;rinstitution Vereinte Nationen gelegt. Der Artikel argumentiert,
   dass der Ukraine-Krieg zumindest f \& uuml;r religi \& ouml;se Akteure
   in der internationalen Politik kein formatives Ereignis f \& uuml;r die
   globale Sicherheitspolitik bedeutet. Im Gegenteil wird argumentiert,
   dass diese Akteure solch einen Zeitpunkt, um das V \& ouml;lkerrecht zu
   st \& auml;rken oder \& uuml;berhaupt aufrechtzuerhalten, wom \&
   ouml;glich vers \& auml;umt haben.},

Abstract = {South Korea's state-guaranteed bond market was nearly half the size of
   its sovereign bond market in 2022, and in the early 2000s, it was nearly
   twice the size of the latter. What explains the overwhelming prominence
   of this fixed-income market? This paper finds that the prominence of
   this market is a path-dependent consequence of developmental legacies
   and the Asian Financial Crisis. State-guaranteed bonds allowed the state
   to circumvent conditionalities that limited the state's ability to
   access domestic savings for policy objectives and helped shield the
   newly established sovereign bond market from premature supply pressure.
   This finding demonstrates that the state not only supports or creates
   markets but also uses markets to maintain its influence against external
   pressure. It also explains how the South Korean state was able to
   maintain its developmental policies after market liberalisation by
   tracking the post-crisis flow of domestic savings.},

Abstract = {With this research, I introduce the concept of pro-environmental voting,
   proposing an outcome-oriented rather than motivation-based definition
   and measurement. By conceptualizing it as an instance of
   pro-environmental behavior, I define it as voting for a party that takes
   a pro-environmental stance and for which environmental protection is
   also relatively salient-regardless of whether that is why the voter
   supports that party. I suggest measuring it by multiplying, for the
   party voted, its salience score on environmental protection with the
   distance between its position on the environment and the average
   position of all parties in the system on the same issue. Then, I apply
   this measurement to the recently released ESS10 (2023) data from 26
   European countries. Findings primarily reveal that moral obligation and
   age are key drivers of pro-environmental voting; they also show that
   younger individuals vote more consistently with their environmental
   concern than older voters.},

Abstract = {The process of state building and sovereignty has long been debated in
   the literature to hinge on international recognition. Despite the
   importance of the international factor, an equally important factor in
   this process is the establishment of good governance grounded in
   democratic institutions and a culture of democratic decision-making
   practices. The link that will be established is between state building
   and governance. This will be investigated in the context of unrecognized
   and de facto states. By problematizing the question of sovereignty, I
   argue that these states should adopt the idea of reversed sovereignty
   whereby priority is given to governmentality and the art of government
   rather than to sovereignty. The case study that I will rely on for this
   argument is the Kurdistan Region in Iraq (KRI) and its governmental
   body, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Whilst the focus is on a
   single country study, the theoretical line has a wider reach that is
   intended to be applicable to a larger body of cases of unrecognized and
   de facto states, which are on the trails of seeking state formations.},

Title = {The Voting Potential of Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht},
Journal = {POLITICAL STUDIES REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 26},
Abstract = {A new challenger seeks to enter the German party system: B \& uuml;ndnis
   Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW). With her new party, former Die Linke politician
   Sahra Wagenknecht combines a left-authoritarian profile (economically
   left-leaning, but culturally conservative) with anti-US, pro-Russia and
   anti-elitist stances. This article provides the first large-n academic
   study of the voter potential of this new party by using a
   quasi-representative sample (n = 6,000) drawn from a Voting Advice
   Application-like dataset that comes from a website designed to explore
   the B \& uuml;ndnis Sahra Wagenknecht's positions. The results show that
   congruence with foreign policy positions and anti-elitism are strong
   predictors of the propensity to vote for the B \& uuml;ndnis Sahra
   Wagenknecht. In contrast, social/welfare and immigration policies are
   less predictive for assessing the party's potential. Among the different
   socio-demographic groups, the B \& uuml;ndnis Sahra Wagenknecht has a
   strong potential among baby boomers, the less educated and East Germans.
   Regarding party voters, the B \& uuml;ndnis Sahra Wagenknecht is
   favoured by supporters of some minor parties like dieBasis, Freie W \&
   auml;hler and Die PARTEI, but also non-voters. Among the established
   parties, the party's potential is high among Die Linke voters and, to a
   lesser extent, voters of the Social democrats (SPD) and Alternative for
   Germany (AfD). A potential below the average is reported for the
   supporters of the Liberals (FDP) and Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and
   most clearly for Green and Volt voters.},

Abstract = {The far-right political party in Spain, Vox, devalues women's policy
   machineries through its critical rhetoric about gender and equality
   policies. This note puts forth two rhetorical strategies utilized by the
   party, ideographs and victim contests; and it argues that these
   strategies communicate to the public that women's policy machineries are
   not necessary or appropriate. Consequently, the party's rhetoric has
   noticeably challenged the previous consensus in Spain around using
   women's policy machineries to improve and save women's lives.},

Abstract = {This note analyzes GEM's research agenda in Latin America amid

   rise of conservative anti-gender actors and high levels of
   intersectional inequalities challenging plural and democratic feminist
   political projects. From this, three discussions are proposed: (1)
   conceptualizing success and GEMs, (2) advancing comparative analysis of
   insiders in Latin America, and (3) integrating intersectional and

Abstract = {The goal of this essay is twofold: to introduce the eight contributions
   to this roundtable issue and to place them in the context of
   international and comparative research on gender equality machineries
   (GEMs) and state feminism in the twenty-first century and to present the
   overall agenda for state feminism research in the future that is
   suggested by these contributions. We first show how the roundtable
   effort came out of this journal's connections to the American Political
   Science Association's Partner Group on French Politics and the scholarly
   rationale for the structure of the roundtable. Next, we take a deeper
   dive into the role and evolution of gender equality machineries, also
   referred to as women's policy agencies and institutional mechanisms for
   gender equality. The third section presents how the concept of state
   feminism has been developed as an object of study in the international
   research community. It is followed by a discussion of French work on
   state feminism. We end the essay with a reflection about the research
   themes, agenda, and next steps suggested by this collection of eight
   articles.},

Title = {Electoral Innovation and the Alaska System: Partisanship and Populism
   Are Associated With Support for Top-4/Ranked-Choice Voting Rules},

Abstract = {In 2020, Alaskans voted to adopt a nonpartisan top-4 primary followed by
   a ranked-choice general election. Proposals for ``final four{''} and
   ``final five{''} election systems are being considered in other states,
   as well as ranked-choice voting. The initial use of Alaska's procedure
   in 2022 serves as a test case for examining whether such reforms may
   help moderate candidates avoid being ``primaried.{''} In 2022, incumbent
   Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski held her seat against a Trump-endorsed
   Republican, Kelly Tshibaka. We use data from the 2022 election in
   Alaska, along with a mixed-mode survey of Alaskan voters before the
   general election, to test hypotheses about how voters behave in these
   kinds of elections, finding: (1) the moderate Republican candidate,
   Murkowski, likely would have lost a closed partisan primary; (2) some
   Democrats and independents favored the moderate Republican over the
   candidate of their own party, and the new rules allowed them to support
   her at all stages of the election, along with others who voted for her
   to stop the more conservative Republican candidate; and (3) that Alaskan
   voters are largely favorable toward the new rules, but that certain
   kinds of populist voters are likely to both support Trump and oppose the
   rules.},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {In 2018, the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Ireland, which had
   prohibited abortion except under certain severe circumstances, was
   repealed by an overwhelming majority of voters in a national referendum.
   This article addresses opposition in the Oireachtas to the liberal
   changes to the abortion legislation that preceded and followed the
   referendum. By employing a critical discourse analysis approach, I
   identify characteristically conservative rhetoric and arguments used in
   the debates. Furthermore, I adopt an analytical framework provided by
   Albert O. Hirschman to argue that the opposing rhetoric employed
   wasrooted in the conservative tradition: the opponents of the abortion
   legislation argued both that the changes to the legislation will have
   the opposite result than intended and lead to unacceptable consequences.
   The legislation will not only harm society but also undermine the
   interests of women. I conclude that the opposition to the legislation
   was based on a mistrust of women, their agency and self-determination.
   The study aims to shed light on how core ideas of conservatism, such as
   opposition to `excessive' equality, manifested in the contemporary
   political debates on abortion and how, ultimately, the rhetoric in the
   Irish debates fits within the larger framework of conservatism as a
   school of thought.},

Abstract = {Using a large randomized controlled trial and rich individual-level data
   on eligible voters and their household members, we evaluate how
   get-out-the-vote (GOTV) appeals affect inequalities in voting, transmit
   from treated to untreated individuals within households, and how the
   transmission of voting decisions through family networks influences
   inequalities in voting. We find that receiving a text message reminder
   before the Finnish county elections in 2022 mobilized mainly
   low-propensity voters. As a result, the GOTV intervention reduced
   existing social inequalities in voting within the target group of young
   voters. We remarkably find that over 100\% of the direct treatment
   effect spilled over to untreated household members. These spillovers
   reduced inequality in political participation among the older voters who
   were not part of the target group. Overall, our results exemplify how
   randomized controlled trials with a limited focus on the analysis of
   individuals in the treatment and control groups alone may lead to
   misestimating the compositional effects of get-out-the-vote
   interventions.},

Abstract = {Silvio Berlusconi instigated a significant and lasting transformation in
   Italian politics. He revolutionized political communication, established
   a personal party, personalized the political process, and influenced the
   alteration of the party system. His approach was marked by a mix of
   diverse and sometimes contradictory elements. For example, this new
   political figure, who claimed to be the most important statesman in
   Italian history, strived to maintain his image as an outsider and
   non-politician. He framed himself, his party and his coalition as
   expressions of the centre-right, yet he was undeniably a new kind of
   populist, leveraging his vast media empire for the purposes of political
   mobilization. Berlusconi also succeeded in creating `Berlusconism', a
   unique political culture that I will discuss, along with an
   anthropological transformation of politics and society. Thus, even after
   Berlusconi's death, the legacy of Berlusconism endures in Italy.
   Moreover, in the mainstream literature, Berlusconi has often been seen
   as evidence of the `abnormality' of Italian democracy. Contrary to this
   view, I argue that despite Italy's distinct national characteristics,
   Berlusconi exemplified the first instance of a profound metamorphosis
   affecting many European democracies, which are no longer strictly
   classical liberal and representative models.},

Title = {Global egalitarianism and climate change: against integrationism},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 5},
Abstract = {A central question in debates about climate justice concerns how the
   global emissions sink should be shared among the global population over
   time. This paper considers how global egalitarians should answer that
   question. In particular, it defends emissions egalitarianism from a view
   known as `integrationism', according to which shares of the emissions
   sink should follow from a more general egalitarian theory of
   distributive justice. First, I show that emissions egalitarianism can
   draw on a source of functional support not adequately acknowledged in
   the integrationist critique: it can express an underlying account of the
   structure of historical responsibility for climate change I call the
   Fair Share View. Second, I claim that integrationism is also in tension
   with other principles of responsibility for climate change, and that its
   scepticism about historical responsibility has not been appreciated.
   Finally, I provide an alternative to integrationism. My central claim is
   that integrationism posits too direct a relation between a theory of
   equality of wellbeing and practical questions about claims to the
   emissions sink. Egalitarians should appeal to a species of derivative
   principle I call `applied principles of global justice', and emissions
   egalitarianism could plausibly be endorsed on these grounds.},

Abstract = {This study explores the analysis of public reactions to presidential
   debates using a largely untapped social media data source-YouTube
   comments. My findings reveal a striking consistency in topics across
   YouTube channels, pointing to a shared perspective among viewers that
   goes beyond ideological differences. These results question the
   assumption that online behavior mirrors traditional media preferences,
   suggesting that viewers may not apply ideological biases in their
   selection of YouTube content, instead influenced by accessibility or
   algorithmic recommendations. My findings also highlight the potential of
   leveraging social media for identifying significant voter issues and
   concerns. Lastly, I highlight the distinctive nature of YouTube data and
   the potential of researchers to utilize it, especially in light of the
   limited availability of Twitter data.},

Title = {(Trans)gressing the cisnormative legal system: arguments for the
   recognition of all women in the femicide law},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ESTUDOS POLITICOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {Gender-based violence is routinely thought of in terms of cisgenderism,
   involving violence against women and their legal protection; which
   maintains a normative structure that excludes from formal recognition
   trans women victims of attempted or consummated lethal violence. The
   article problematizes the incidence of the Femicide Law (Law
   13.104/2015) for the criminal responsibility of the aggressor when the
   victim is a trans woman. This paper contributes to discussions in the
   field by arguing an interpretation according to the Federal Constitution
   of 1988 for the recognition and intelligibility of trans people, based
   on the inseparability of the sex-gender elements. The general objective
   of the article is to argue the possibility of jurisdictional
   mobilization for crimes whose victim of violence is a trans woman,
   breaking with biological markers and resulting in the legal recognition
   of all women as subjects of the Law. There is insufficient legal
   protection for trans women in the country. This is a theoretical
   manuscript. It uses qualitative narrative bibliographic and
   jurisprudential research, with content analysis. It contributes to
   discussions in the field by arguing an interpretation in accordance with
   the 1988 Federal Constitution for the recognition and intelligibility of
   trans people, based on the inseparability of sex-gender elements. As a
   methodological limit of the research, the absence of field research is
   evident. We suggest new quantitative and qualitative field research on
   the topic.},

Abstract = {Theories of habit formation and transformative voting posit that voting
   has long-run consequences for turnout and political involvement, with
   younger voters possibly experiencing more pronounced effects from
   earlier eligibility. Long-term evidence of the effects of becoming
   eligible to vote at a younger age remains scarce. We use rich, long-term
   panel data from the United Kingdom to examine the effects of earlier
   voting eligibility on turnout and political involvement. By leveraging
   the election eligibility cutoff in a regression discontinuity design,
   our precise estimates document that earlier eligibility results in
   contemporaneous increases in several measures of political involvement.
   However, these short-term effects fade away quickly and do not translate
   into permanent changes in turnout propensity or political involvement.
   Our results imply that, in a setting with low institutional barriers to
   vote, the persistent and transformative effects of being eligible to
   vote at a younger age are short-lived at most.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between conflict, social order,
   and the crime-terror nexus, with a focus on non-state armed groups in
   Mali, particularly Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM). Using
   anarchist political theory, the study challenges the view of these
   groups as purely chaotic, instead suggesting their primary aim is to
   establish social order. The crime-terror nexus is explored to understand
   its role in new governance structures created by these groups. The study
   underscores the importance of re-evaluating the frameworks used to
   interpret armed groups, emphasizing their role in creating social order
   and stability in conflict zones. The research offers insights into the
   complex dynamics of armed groups in Mali and encourages further
   investigation into their influence on regional stability.},

Abstract = {The goal of this article is to study some of the denominations used in
   libertarian discourse in order to construct an adversary, establishing
   new demarcation criteria regarding the traditional political divisions.
   We deal with the concepts of casta and progresista and their derivatives
   (progre, progres \& iacute;a), which refer to the main antagonists in
   the imaginary of libertarianism. These political concepts are part of a
   wider transnational lexicon. From the perspective of political
   lexicology and discourse analysis, we explore the trajectory of these
   political concepts, their international and national circulation, their
   contemporary uses and their consolidation as a discursive formula.},

Abstract = {Chief justices in American state courts of last resort have been more
   diverse than their federal counterparts. Unlike the federal chief
   justices, women make up a significant proportion of state chief justice
   seats in the modern era. Meanwhile, representation for racial minorities
   has grown less rapidly but still exists. In this research, we examine
   state chief justice selection to determine whether certain institutional
   rules facilitate more diverse leadership. We also examine the impact of
   politics and other contemporaneous factors. Our analysis includes all
   chief justice selection events in the states from 1970 to 2020. We find
   that government appointment selection methods help further racial
   diversity among state court leaders but discover little evidence that
   such methods affect gender diversity. However, court size, mandatory
   retirement laws, and bench diversity are all associated with a greater
   likelihood of a woman or person of color serving as chief justice.},

Abstract = {The concept of white ignorance refers to phenomena of not-knowing that
   are produced by and reinforce systems of white supremacist domination
   and exploitation. I distinguish two varieties of white ignorance,
   belief-based white ignorance and practice-based white ignorance.
   Belief-based white ignorance consists in an information deficit about
   systems of racist oppression. Practice-based white ignorance consists in
   unresponsiveness to the political agency of persons and groups subject
   to racist oppression. Drawing on the antebellum political thought of
   Black abolitionists Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs, I contend
   that an antiracist politics that conceives of its epistemic task in
   terms of combating practice-based white ignorance offers a more
   promising frame for liberatory struggle. A focus on practice-based white
   ignorance calls for a distinctive form of humility that involves
   recognition of the limits of one's own political agency in relation to
   others, which is integral to democratic relations between free, equal,
   yet mutually dependent persons.},

Title = {Do Quality Candidates and Incumbents Still Matter in the Partisan World?
   Comparing Trends and Relationship Between Candidate Differentials and
   Congressional Election Outcomes, 1900-2022},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING},
Year = {2024},

Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {243-265},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {The increase in elite-level polarization and the changing partisan
   nature of elections to the U.S. House led scholars to posit that
   candidate characteristics are minor considerations in determining these
   election outcomes. However, it is not clear if these trends extend to
   the U.S. Senate or if candidate considerations have lost the relatively
   minor predictive power they exhibited during the 2010s, particularly as
   partisanship continued to rise as a predictor of election outcomes.
   Using historical data on elections to the U.S. House and Senate from
   1900 to the recent 2022 midterm elections, we test whether the
   incumbency advantage and candidate quality differentials are still
   salient predictors of congressional elections. We find that the
   incumbency advantage largely disappeared as a salient component of
   election outcomes for both chambers as partisanship increasingly shapes
   these outcomes. By contrast, we find that candidate quality
   differentials, while waning, still can play a considerable role in
   shaping congressional election outcomes, particularly in the Senate. We
   conclude by showing that the declining emergence of quality candidates
   may have played a pivotal role during the 2022 election cycle by costing
   Republicans control of the U.S. Senate.},

Abstract = {The article focuses on the evaluative attitudes of citizens and their
   association with regime support in European democracies. In the context
   of widespread public scepticism with politics, different findings about
   the effect of political dissatisfaction in terms of democratic
   legitimacy have appeared. This may imply that citizens' attitudes
   towards politics and their interrelations are complex and that the
   effects might not be the same across individuals and contexts. To
   investigate the link between political dissatisfaction and democratic
   support, data from the European Values Study and hierarchical regression
   models are used. The results of the analysis suggest that political
   dissatisfaction is not related to democratic support by highly
   interested and highly involved citizens. Nevertheless, contrary to the
   assumptions, the negative effect is quite strong in less corrupt
   countries, while in corrupt ones it tends to be positively related to
   democratic support.},

Abstract = {While much of the recent literature on the impact of COVID-19 has
   focussed on governance at the EU level and specific policy areas, the
   changing political institutional arrangements within the EU Member
   States themselves have received significantly less attention. This
   article aims to contribute filling this gap by asking: how, and to what
   extent, has the core executive in Italy changed to manage and implement
   the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP)? Italy has been heavily
   hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and has subsequently been allocated the
   largest proportion of the Next Generation EU (NGEU) funds: it is
   therefore a `most likely' case of organisational adaptation. We argue
   that the implementation of the NRRP triggers centralisation of power in
   the core executive. Such concentration of power, however, takes
   different forms depending on the composition of the executive. We also
   find that `coordinative' Europeanisation occurs through the continuous
   interaction and exchange between the executive actors (political and
   administrative) based in Rome and the European Commission in Brussels.
   Such interaction showcases the attempt to manage both further
   integration and politicisation of the EU. The collaboration between the
   European Commission and the national executive is based both on the
   recognition of the value of the political ownership of the NRRP and the
   importance of the EU support for post-pandemic recovery.},

Abstract = {In federal systems, non-judicial actors can engage in constitutional
   reasoning. The actions taken may come in different legal forms. Some may
   be consistent with positive law, while others may not. Nullification and
   anticommandeering are prominent examples. We show that these concepts
   have functionally made new appearances in Canada. One significant
   example of this is Alberta's enactment of the 2022 Sovereignty Act. We
   trace how the initial proposal for the legislation resembled
   nullification. Over time, the proposal was reformed to adapt it to the
   particularities of Canadian federalism. The result was a Sovereignty Act
   that appears to assert existing provincial powers, particularly as a
   formal framework for extrajudicial constitutional interpretation via
   anticommandeering, although only time will tell if this remains the case
   in practice. In doing so, we shine a light on the contours of some of
   the legal and political debates that may arise as the framework is
   operationalized.},

Abstract = {How incidents of mass violence are portrayed has great consequences for
   how the violence is understood and responded to, including whether it
   requires political attention. This article examines the portrayal of
   incel violence, a relatively new phenomenon of violence perpetrated by
   people who identify with the misogynistic worldview present in and
   perpetuated by incel online forums. It does so through placing this
   violence in comparison with Islamist violence and right-wing violence,
   both of which have shaped understandings of mass violence so far. By
   conducting this three-way comparison, this article investigates to what
   extent portrayals of incel violence align with media portrayals of other
   types of violence. This article finds that incel violence is portrayed
   in an overly personalised manner without much reference to the
   violence's gendered socio-political context, hindering the possibility
   of incel violence being understood as political. Not only does this
   article helps understandings of incel violence per se but also provides
   insight into to what extent processes of politicisation and
   securitisation play a part in understandings of misogynistic violence.},

Abstract = {In this study, we ask how and why do Members of Parliament adopt
   different representational styles? Looking at MPs in four
   Westminster-style democracies, we identify differences between MPs and
   inductively explore influences on representational styles by first using
   participant observation to gain deep insights into the activities of a
   small sample of MPs and then by using semi-structured interviews from a
   larger sample to elucidate findings from the observations across states.
   Our primary focus is the method of connection between representative and
   citizen, as fostered by the representative while present in the
   constituency. Despite similar institutional and electoral contexts
   across countries, we find a significant variation that is influenced by
   both country-level and constituency-level factors. Findings suggest a
   continuum from highly service-oriented to highly symbolic-oriented
   styles, where MPs from the UK illustrate the former, and MPs from Canada
   illustrate the latter, though with further variation at the constituency
   level that is based, in part, upon both geography and demographics.},

Abstract = {Although some studies have explored the phenomenon of Third Cultures,
   including TCKs and ATCKs, there is seemingly a category of identities
   that have not been clearly accounted for. Third Culture Adults (TCAs)
   have a distinct socio-psychological identity that emanates partly from
   migrants choosing a host nation as a long-term residence for themselves
   and their offspring. This paper espouses the concept of TCAs as a
   discrete identity that results from events and experiences among
   long-term settlers and provides the basis for future discourse and
   research to enable a more precise understanding of the TCA concept and
   its implications for labour markets.},

Journal = {POLITICAL BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-17},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This research aims to comprehensively illustrate the importance of
   perceived procedural justice among the public to police and governing
   authorities in crowd management involving multiple identities and
   identifications. It simultaneously considers the group engagement model
   and the elaborated model of procedural justice. We collected data from
   1,000 participants in Hong Kong at the end of the Anti-Extradition Law
   Amendment Bill Movement. Public perceptions of procedural justice,
   identification with militant protestors, moderate protestors, police,
   and the government, as well as their support for protestor violence,
   were assessed. Full structural equation modeling was employed to analyze
   the data and assess a complex model of procedural justice. We found a
   perception of low procedural justice contributed to increased public
   support for protestor violence by fostering identification with militant
   protestors. Additionally, a perceived lack of procedural justice was
   associated with heightened identification with moderate protestors,
   while simultaneously diminishing identification with the government,
   with the latter effect being fully mediated by reduced identification
   with the police. The significance of procedural justice for governing
   authorities in crowd management is multifaceted and should be considered
   within both the group engagement model and the elaborate model of
   procedural justice. The outcomes derived from the complex model of
   procedural justice provide insights for shaping comprehensive policing
   practices.},

Title = {Guns and Democracy: Anti-System Attitudes, Protest, and Support for
   Violence Among Pandemic Gun-Buyers},
Journal = {POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {77},
Number = {3},
Pages = {962-977},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The last decade has given rise to substantial concern about democratic
   backsliding in the U.S. Manifestations include decreased trust in
   government, conspiratorial beliefs, contentious protests, and support
   for political violence. Surprisingly, prior work has not explored how
   these attitudes and behaviors relate to gun-buying, an action that
   provides people with the means to challenge the state. We address this
   topic by focusing on the unprecedented gun-buying surge during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. Using a survey with over 32,000 respondents, we find
   that-relative to pre-existing gun owners (who did not buy during the
   pandemic) and the non-gun-owning public-pandemic gun-buyers are more
   likely to distrust government, believe in conspiracies, protest, and
   support political violence. These anti-government views and protest
   behaviors are especially likely among those who bought guns for
   political reasons. Our findings highlight a crucial dynamic underlying
   the recent spike in gun sales with consequences for American democracy.},

Abstract = {This research delves into the examination of China's potential hegemony
   in the regional sphere, juxtaposing its substantial military capacities,
   strategic ambitions, and ideological underpinnings. By leveraging a
   methodical triangulation of quantitative data from the Stockholm
   International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), theoretical implications
   from China's policy documents, and critical analysis of China's robust
   infrastructure, considerable resources, and impressive capabilities,
   this study explores China's strategic landscape in comparison with other
   regional and international contenders. It establishes that, despite the
   formidable potential for hegemonic pursuits, China's political
   ideologies-Harmonious World, Peaceful Development, Chinese Dream, and
   the vision of a Human Community with a Shared Future, intertwined with
   strategic imperatives and nuclear deterrence, indicate a proclivity
   towards preservation of the existing global order and a commitment to
   peaceful evolution. The research concludes that, in the foreseeable
   context, China will likely persist in its endeavor to foster peaceful
   bilateral and multilateral relationships with neighboring states,
   demonstrating a strategic preference for peaceful development over
   aggressive hegemonic dominance.},

Title = {Educationally Tracked Democratic Equalizers: How Citizenship Education
   Moderates the Effect of a Political Home Environment on Internal
   Political Efficacy Across Educational Tracks},

Abstract = {Citizenship education aims to compensate for the lack of a stimulating
   political home environment. However, not all scholars are convinced that
   schools are great equalizers, as citizenship education might reinforce
   rather than reduce socioeconomic inequalities. This paper investigates
   whether citizenship education compensates, reproduces, or accelerates
   inequality in students' internal political efficacy (IPE) and how this
   relationship differs across educational tracks. IPE is considered a key
   political attitude that predicts political participation and taps into
   self-confidence in a political setting. This political attitude is
   especially interesting considering the stigmatizing effects of
   educational tracks. We study the effect of citizenship education among
   senior high school students in Flanders. We examine three kinds of
   citizenship education: civic learning experiences, an open classroom
   climate, and active student participation at school. We conduct
   three-way interactions in multilevel models to study the moderating
   effect of these types of citizenship education at school on the
   relationship between a political home environment and IPE across
   educational tracks. We show compensating effects for the three
   citizenship education types. However, looking across educational tracks,
   there is a clearer compensation in the academic track compared to the
   technical and vocational tracks. Our findings indicate that citizenship
   education contributes to a democratic society where all citizens feel
   confident participating in the political arena. Still, technical and
   vocational tracked students not only receive less citizenship education,
   but the reduction of socioeconomic inequalities in feelings of IPE when
   receiving higher amounts is also less articulated than in the academic
   track.},

Abstract = {Recent changes in European politics-such as the rise of so-called
   movement parties on both the left and the right-call for a rethinking of
   the links between protest dynamics and party system transformation. In
   this paper, we contribute to the theoretical and empirical understanding
   of the mechanisms that unfold in periods of intensified interactions
   between protest and electoral politics through a case study of the
   transformation of the Hungarian party system. We ask what mechanisms
   drive parties' involvement in protests before and after entering
   parliament. We focus on two competitors: the radical right Movement for
   a Better Hungary (Jobbik) and the green party Politics Can Be Different
   (LMP). Using a dataset of protest events compiled from Hungarian news
   agency reports and official police records, we map the protest network
   mobilized by the two parties between 2002 and 2022. We analytically
   distinguish and empirically identify three different mobilization
   mechanisms: strengthening the party's profile by protesting its own
   issue, using protest mobilization to build alliances with other parties
   and actors, or relying on protest to establish a presence at the local
   level. The empirical results show that Jobbik relies on protest through
   a combination of different mechanisms, while LMP uses protest to broaden
   its issue profile and build alliances with other political parties. Over
   time, both parties increasingly rely on protest to establish a local
   presence outside of Budapest.},

Abstract = {Though the territorial dimension of ministerial recruitment has been
   explored in several countries, it remains a blind spot in France.
   Nevertheless, the geography of political elites matters, since it tends
   to channel debates and national policies around specific areas.
   Therefore, this research note aims to fill this gap by investigating the
   regional origin of cabinet ministers under the Fifth Republic through an
   original data set entitled GeoMin. This descriptive analysis stresses
   the existence of three concentric circles in terms of ministerial
   appointments: Paris (overrepresented), mainland regions
   (underrepresented) and peripheral territories (almost absent). The
   sharing of portfolios follows the same logic. Parisian ministers have
   occupied all the possible positions-especially the highest ones-but most
   ministers from mainland France have also led important ministries.
   Though the matching is far from perfect, some portfolios are more
   frequently attributed to ministers from a given region.},

Abstract = {Can legacies of fascism threaten democracies with political violence?
   Democracies aim to peacefully manage incompatible interests in a
   society. Yet, few democracies avoid violence altogether. Legacies of
   fascism may re-emerge because local networks can transfer their
   ideational tenets - supremacist identities and anti-democratism (know
   what), violent practices (know how), and paramilitary networks (know
   whom) - to the new generations. Thanks to an original subnational
   dataset, we study if the Italian fascist movement that emerged in the
   1920s affected political violence in the 1970s-1980s. The local strength
   of the fascist party before the institutionalization of the fascist
   regime predicts neofascist political violence more than forty years
   later. New catalysing events facilitate the resurfacing of local fascist
   legacies: when a Minister of Interior is appointed, we observe higher
   levels of neofascist violence in provinces where the early presence of
   the fascist party was stronger.},

Abstract = {Wargames and crisis simulations can be useful pedagogical tools when
   deliberately used. This paper explores the spectrum of pedagogical
   objectives; what use are wargames for learning? What types of objectives
   can they explore? How do you align the learning objectives with the
   right type of game? The paper leverages Bloom's Taxonomy of learning as
   a method to guide game selection according to the desired classroom
   learning objective. For each type of game, the paper identifies lessons
   from higher education classroom use that others should consider before
   applying their own wargame.},

Title = {Electoral institutions and repression in dictatorships},
Journal = {ELECTORAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {89},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We argue that the relationship between authoritarian elections and
   repression depends on the electoral system in use. Proportional
   representation (PR) systems co-opt more heterogeneous political groups
   to contest and receive seats in the legislature and thus, dictators are
   less likely to use broad-based repression. Under plurality rules, by
   contrast, the regime has more incentives to mobilize turnout and deter
   collective action. Examining electoral systems from 1990 to 2010, we
   find that elections only reduce broad-based repression under PR systems,
   which are less commonly used in non-democracies. Our results highlight
   the importance of formal institutions in shaping political outcomes even
   in dictatorships.},

Abstract = {Incumbents often make unpopular policy decisions. But can they remedy
   their negative electoral consequences? We extend the wide literature
   concerning retrospective voting to the case of unpopular policies and
   examine whether voters reward a responsive withdrawal of an unpopular
   policy proposal or punish the disclosed policy intention despite the
   withdrawal. To test this, we use granular data on Swedish local election
   results from 2002 to 2018 and the case of widely unpopular school
   closure proposals, some of which were implemented and others not. We
   exploit within municipality variation in voting over time to causally
   estimate the consequences for incumbents in the neighborhood surrounding
   the schools. Our results confirm that even if a school remains open,
   voters punish the incumbent and consider the initial proposal as
   informative for their vote. Our findings have implications for the
   understanding of democratic accountability and which information voters
   take into account when casting their vote.},

   Africa, Asia, America, and Europe from 2000 to 2018. Controlling
   inflation and unemployment, our results indicate that trade and
   inflation exacerbate income inequality in LICs, while financial
   development and government spending have no impact on reducing income
   inequality in these countries. Furthermore, the findings show that real
   GDP per capita reduces income inequality in LICs. To ensure the
   robustness of our results, we also conducted frequentist quantile
   regression, which yielded consistent findings that financial
   development, government spending, and trade do not reduce income
   inequality in LICs. We further discuss the potential channels through
   which trade, financial development, inflation, and government spending
   contribute to income inequality in LICs, and provide policy implications
   based on the empirical evidence.},

Abstract = {While some hail social media as improving political participation, some
   governments have received social media with a touch of trepidation;
   concerned that public servants' online political activity might threaten
   the public service's reputed impartiality. Recent research from some
   Westminster countries where government messaging about social media have
   been especially cautious have found a negative relationship between
   public sector employment and online political activity. But what about
   public sector employees in Aotearoa New Zealand, where, comparative
   research suggests, the tone and substance of social media guidelines are
   less risk-averse than other Westminster countries? Using data from the
   2014, 2017 and 2020 New Zealand Election Study, this article examines
   the relationship between public sector employment and online activity
   with several multivariate regression models. The results lead to two
   conclusions. First, consistent with research from other countries, a
   negative relationship has emerged over time between public sector
   employment and online political activity in Aotearoa New Zealand.
   Second, although public sector employees are less politically active
   online relative to other citizens, the substantive size of this gap is
   not as great as that found in other Westminster countries. The
   implications of these findings for the state of democracy and
   impartiality in Aotearoa New Zealand are discussed.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship on popular mobilization and activism in Central and
   East Europe suggests a shift from institutionalized civil society
   organizations towards grassroots mobilization. Whilst the emergence of
   such citizen-led activism across the region can be traced back to the
   anti-neoliberal urban movements that arose in the 2010s in the immediate
   post EU-accession period, the so-called ``illiberal turn{''} and the
   legal restrictions placed on formal civil society organizations by
   radical right and conservative politicians have arguably exacerbated the
   shift and momentum. In Poland, the reaction of political elites to air
   pollution activism and the apparent responsiveness of policymakers is
   particularly puzzling given the ``green conservatism{''} bordering on
   ``environmental nativism{''} of the Law and Justice government
   (2015-2023). Building on semi-structured interviews conducted with 30
   policymakers and activists involved in the clean air campaign in Poland,
   we contend that their success in terms of increased public awareness and
   positive government response is a consequence of the concurrence of (i)
   a particular (health) framing of air pollution, (ii) the devolution of
   power and responsibility for managing air quality to regional
   government, (iii) the circulation of new information and data, and (iv)
   the emergence of new actors and activist strategies.},

Abstract = {Within the broader discussion of US domestic terrorism, the impact of
   formal extremist groups on the behaviour of perpetrators of
   ideologically motivated crime stands as a key albeit under examined
   issue. Radicalization and terrorism have long been understood as
   group-driven processes, yet the degree and rate of group affiliation
   among US extremist offenders is highly variable, especially in the
   context of rising instances of lone actor attacks. This raises the
   question of the role that group affiliation plays in relation to
   perpetrators of extremist violence. For while discourse surrounding
   domestic terrorism has largely classified these organizations as
   facilitators or enablers of radicalization and extremist violence,
   patterns in recent years suggest these groups may in fact do the
   opposite and dampen the violent impulses of their members to preserve
   their organizational interests. This paper presents an analysis of data
   adapted from the Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the United
   States (PIRUS) dataset as well as original data and finds that
   membership in formal extremist groups does appear to create a moderating
   effect on perpetrators of ideologically motivated crime, reducing the
   probability of group members in engaging in violence.},

Abstract = {Understanding the origins of primary elections has important
   implications for evaluating their role in American elections. While
   there is little argument about the importance of primaries to the
   American electoral system, there is less agreement about why states
   adopted the direct primary and what they were intended to accomplish.
   Previous scholarship has laid out three theories: the strength of the
   progressive movement, parties' efforts to maintain one-party rule, and
   the urbanization of American society. Using comprehensive state-level
   data from 1892 to 1930, we test these theories of states' adoption of
   direct primaries. We find a strong influence of the strength of the
   progressive movement and the rate of urbanization on the adoption of the
   direct primary, but we do not, however, find any influence of state
   partisan competition. Our findings reinforce original arguments about
   the importance of the progressive movement and urbanization in the
   adoption of the direct primary.},

Title = {Why and when democracies ban political parties: a classification of
   democratic state orientations to party bans},
Journal = {COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 29},
Abstract = {Defending democracy requires undemocratic steps; one of the most radical
   is the prohibition of political parties. The functioning of political
   parties is fundamental to healthy and pluralistic democracies. Thus,
   their exclusion from the political process raises a severe dilemma for a
   democratic society, which has to address sufficiently why and when a
   political competitor can legitimately be kicked out of the political
   arena. The latter is crucially important because of the rise of
   far-right parties and attempts by authoritarians to infiltrate the
   domestic political competition of democratic countries. The approaches
   of various national courts in cases concerning the prohibition of
   political parties are far from uniform. Experiences in Spain, Ukraine,
   the UK and, eventually, Germany demonstrate significant contrasts
   regarding the political theory and legal rationale for prohibition.
   While democracy is a universal value for a pan-European context, the
   courts set different limits of democratic tolerance for guarding it. The
   paper offers a new paradigm that explains why and when democracies ban
   political parties. The classification of democratic state orientation to
   party bans consists of liberal, institutional and militant models, which
   illustrate different concepts around finding the balance between
   personal rights on the one hand and the interests of a democratic
   society on the other.},

Number = {8},
Pages = {1844-1865},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Corruption is a major challenge in the Arab Mediterranean countries
   (AMCs). The fight against it was a key point in the Arab uprisings, yet
   since then and despite the international community's attempts to support
   anti-corruption strategies, the governments of the AMCs have not been
   able to address effectively the demands of their population. The article
   compares the anti-corruption initiatives in four AMCs: two republican
   semi-presidential systems (Egypt, Tunisia) and two constitutional
   monarchies (Jordan, Morocco). It focuses on their fight against
   political corruption, which has different forms. To reduce corruption,
   policymakers advocate the decentralization of power, as it leads to more
   accountability and transparency. The article unpacks the idea of
   decentralization and asks to what extent it contributes to reducing
   political corruption in the region. In doing so, the article produces a
   new typology that adds two important factors that contribute to a better
   understanding of the links between anti-corruption initiatives and
   decentralization: the challenges to the political survival of the
   government and the type of external support to fight corruption. The
   findings show that decentralization measures frequently result in
   administrative deconcentration rather than the decentralization of
   decision-making. Thus, they reproduce political corruption in the
   region.},

   analysing friction in 2019 and cohesion in 2023},

Abstract = {The ROK-Japan relationship, characterized as a quasi alliance, has
   oscillated between moments of friction and cohesion. This study
   endeavours to pinpoint the explanatory variables responsible for these
   fluctuations and to articulate a coherent causal mechanism. Drawing upon
   alliance theories and the quasi alliance model, two hypotheses centred
   on external factors - common threats and common allies - are posite. In
   2019, divergent threat perceptions between the ROK and Japan, coupled
   with doubts about the US's reliability, strained their quasi alliance.
   Yet, as the prospects for North Korea's denuclearization grew murky,
   both the ROK and Japan began to share heightened threat perceptions.
   Concurrently, the US's commitment and credibility were reestablished,
   bolstering the cohesion of the quasi-alliance. This study strengthens
   the quasi-alliance model both theoretically and empirically.
   Furthermore, the study's findings suggest the necessity for more direct
   and binding bilateral ties between the ROK and Japan to ensure greater
   stability in future relations.},

Abstract = {A fundamental insight of various trade theories is that trade does not
   have a universally negative effect on different business activities in
   different countries. Rather, trade's impact varies concomitantly with
   the specific country and activity considered. This empirical note
   expands prior work linking trade to redistribution preferences by using
   sectoral comparative advantage to incorporate the notion that trade may
   hurt the prospects of a specific group in one country (e.g. workers in a
   highly tradeable or offshorable industry) but will simultaneously
   benefit this same group in another country. We expect that individuals
   in industries with a weaker (stronger) comparative advantage suffer
   (benefit) more from trade and are therefore more (less) in favour of
   redistribution. Empirical results confirm this expected effect of
   comparative advantage on redistribution preferences. We conclude that
   considering countries' comparative (dis)advantage in certain activities
   provides a deeper and more general understanding of the political
   consequences of trade.},

Abstract = {This article aims to explore the influence of heritage on Jordanian
   national identities, a topic that has received limited attention in
   research. Specifically, it examines the poetry of Nayef Abu Obeid to
   investigate how his work addresses the challenges of upholding heritage
   in the modern era. Furthermore, it assesses how his poetry contributes
   to the preservation and portrayal of Jordanian culture and identity. By
   delving into these aspects, this article offers valuable insights into
   the intricate connections between heritage, national identity, and the
   current global landscape. Such insights are crucial for advancing the
   promotion of Jordanian cultural heritage and fostering nation-building
   efforts.},

Abstract = {Reactions to the rise of far-right parties that advocate democratic
   backsliding, and the dilution of socially liberal democratic norms
   present a dilemma for existing political parties. How should existing
   political parties respond to this challenge? A commonly adopted strategy
   is to apply a cordon sanitaire which excludes radical right-wing
   challengers from the government-forming process. Do voters support this
   policy? Leveraging data from Spain - where the mainstream right has
   accommodated the radical right-wing party, VOX, via numerous governing
   coalitions - I rely on individual citizens' views on how parties should
   respond to rise of the far-right party, to answer this question.
   Empirically, the results show very low-level support for the cordon
   sanitaire in Spain. Indeed, the modal position of the electorate,
   regardless of their ideological position, is to treat the party just
   like any other. These results are not conditioned by the propensity of
   individuals to identify VOX as indeed being a ``radical right{''} party.
   These descriptive findings suggest that whilst radical right-wing
   parties may present an inimical threat to democratic norms, citizens do
   not necessarily view the means of squashing this threat to be one of
   strategic exclusion. This likely explains why the mainstream right has
   been able to institutionalise VOX as a political ally: where strategic
   exclusion is not expected, the mainstream right need not fear violating
   an expectation that does not exist.},

Abstract = {Policing by consent is an influential frame of reference for police
   forces, policy makers, and members of the public in appraising the means
   and ends of law enforcement in Anglo-American societies. The doctrine is
   nonetheless vulnerable to powerful philosophical and political
   objections, which suggests that an alternative paradigm is necessary.
   This article draws on recent republican political theory in elaborating
   a doctrine of policing by contestation. This republican conception does
   not rest the legitimacy of policing on the supposed consent of the
   policed, but on the availability and adequacy of the means through which
   the policed can contest arbitrary interference at the hands of the
   police.},

Abstract = {A principle of continuity was baked into the political and legal
   instruments underpinning the embryonic Irish state. At the same time, a
   process of evolutionary change we call `administrative greening' was
   initiated, which we examine here and in Biggins, MacCarthaigh, and Scott
   ({[}2024b]. Greening the Irish State: Early Legislative and
   Administrative Dynamics. Irish Political Studies, XXX, XXX). In this
   first article, we highlight the extent to which these dynamics shaped
   the formative or `priming' years of the new state and its politics. We
   interrogate this from both political and legal angles. The pre-existence
   of British administrative bodies and norms constrained the Irish
   revolutionary parliament (Dail eireann), the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921
   and the Constitution of Saorstat eireann in 1922. The early leaders of
   the vulnerable state understood they would have fuelled instability and
   uncertainty had they chosen to dispense with the existing public
   administration en masse post-1921. But this inheritance did not preclude
   administrative evolution either. We explore the mechanisms through which
   objectives of continuity and change were framed. In so doing, we place
   our narrative within a broader literature on path-dependency and
   critical junctures.},

Abstract = {Presidents possess vast authority over policies and outcomes. Recent
   studies suggest the public checks this unilateralism through expressive
   opinions and political participation. We reevaluate this accountability
   link with a preregistered panel survey that incorporates a number of
   design and conceptual improvements over existing experimental studies.
   Our findings reveal a more complex relationship between presidential
   actions and public opinion. We find no evidence that the public reacts
   negatively to unilateralism - and some evidence they react positively.
   Respondents, however, may punish an incumbent for failing to implement
   the proposed policy change. While such a result suggests that the public
   can hold presidents accountable, we close by discussing how a lack of
   information likely renders this check moot.},

Abstract = {This essay exposes the radicality of the subjective philosophy of living
   labor that Michel Henry (1922-2002) developed, following Marx. It
   suggests starting from the problem of the status of this interpretation
   as such. As an interpretation inhabiting the center of what it is
   interpreting while seeking to prolong it through clarification, how
   exactly does the philosophy of living labor enhance Marx's critique of
   capitalism? If it goes beyond what it is interpreting, how and to what
   degree does it modify the critique of capitalism? The present
   contribution clarifies this modified critique in stages to defend the
   explanation overall despite that-as enlightening as this modification
   might be-it ends up shifting the overall perspective.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {86},
Number = {2},
Pages = {582-596},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Research shows that dictators' public rhetoric shapes both elite and
   mass opinion and behavior. However, the determinants of dictators'
   strategic communication remain undertheorized and underresearched.
   Theoretically, we argue that (i) dictators primarily use three key
   communication strategies ({''}performance{''} and ``patriotism,{''}
   which serve to boost legitimacy, and ``intimidation,{''} meant to deter
   opponents); (ii) they substitute between them depending on the
   situational context. Empirically, we introduce a novel corpus of
   post-Soviet leaders' legislative addresses and then, employing
   semisupervised text analysis, test our argument. We find that autocrats
   legitimize themselves as performance-focused leaders during economic
   upturns, emphasize patriotism during elections, and turn to the rhetoric
   of intimidation when facing protests and sanctions. We further validate
   our theory using a global set of authoritarian speeches, in a different
   language. The findings support but also contest some established
   assumptions regarding how and when dictators' communication changes.},

Abstract = {A burgeoning body of research examines how women's inclusion influences
   civil war peace processes. While scholars note that women's inclusion
   can positively affect peace, the theoretical mechanisms remain
   underexamined. This article begins to address this lacuna by examining
   how female rebels affect the probability of peace talks. We propose that
   women's inclusion directly affects the likelihood a rebel group
   participates in negotiations with the state by increasing its propensity
   to cooperate and compromise. Our analysis of 112 African rebel groups
   fighting in civil wars between 1989 and 2014 finds that women's
   participation in rebel groups affects the likelihood of negotiation
   onset. We analyze the mechanism driving this relationship and find that
   rebel groups with women members are more likely to issue negotiation
   requests to the government. These findings offer nuance to the
   women-and-peace hypothesis and demonstrate that even women with higher
   propensities toward violence can be a force for peace.},

   countries},
Journal = {RESEARCH \& POLITICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We investigate the relationship between education and antisemitism using
   unique individual-level survey data on antisemitism from more than 100
   countries. Our findings show that education is associated with greater
   favorability toward Jews, but the relationship between education and
   endorsement of antisemitic stereotypes and conspiracy theories varies
   between countries. In countries that actively supported recent
   statements condemning Holocaust denial and antisemitism at the United
   Nations-which we use as a proxy for country-level opposition to
   antisemitism in education and politics-greater education is associated
   with reduced endorsement of antisemitic stereotypes. By contrast, more
   educated people are more likely to endorse antisemitic stereotypes than
   less educated people in countries that declined to endorse those
   statements. These descriptive findings provide new evidence about the
   association between education and intolerance.},

Abstract = {What is the role of elite-level inter-party strategies in promoting or
   reducing negative affective evaluations of citizens? This article
   explores this puzzle by focusing on the decision of mainstream parties
   to exclude or cooperate with populist radical right-wing parties (PRRPs)
   in Western European countries. The analysis is based on CSES
   cross-national data and the LISS Dutch panel data merged with the record
   on whether PRRPs are subject to a cordon sanitaire or (in)formally
   cooperate with mainstream parties in a government coalition. The
   findings suggest that political exclusion fuels loathing for PRRPs among
   mainstream party supporters, while cooperation reduces dislike of PRRPs
   both among supporters of PRRP coalition partners and left-wing voters.
   Distinguishing between informal and formal coalitions, the
   cross-national data shows that only formal cooperation has a significant
   effect. However, the longitudinal Dutch data shows a temporary decrease
   of dislike also during informal cooperation.},

Abstract = {After 9/11, contemporary debates on security often place civil liberties
   and security at opposite ends of the same spectrum, requiring the loss
   of one for the maintenance of the other. In addition, public concerns
   about terrorism determine or at least color public perception about
   government counterterrorism activities. Thus, the current study
   empirically examines factors influencing the public's perception of
   government activities that may infringe upon individual rights, focusing
   on the effects of concern about terrorism. For this study we use data
   collected in World Value Survey (WVS) pertaining to respondents from the
   U.S. The results of a series of regression analysis and structural
   equation modeling (SEM) indicate that public concern about terrorism is
   positively associated with support for counterterrorism activities.
   Moreover, other factors including satisfaction with democracy, community
   membership and trust in the government are found to play an important
   role in explaining public support for counterterrorism activities.},

Abstract = {Local governments play an important role in addressing the climate
   crisis. However, despite public support for climate action, local policy
   responses have been limited. We argue that (1) biased beliefs about
   voter preferences, (2) the time horizon for credit claiming, and (3)
   source credibility are barriers for legislators to learn and adopt new
   environmental policies. We test these arguments in a real
   policy-learning context. Representatives from six Western countries
   received customized invitations to a webinar on climate solutions for
   local governments. We find that constituency opinion on climate issues
   made local office-holders more responsive to public preferences.
   Invitations sent by a climate scientist and emphasizing shorter term
   policy effects increased interest in the webinar, but did not boost the
   likelihood of policy commitments. Only US officials responded negatively
   to climate scientists. The results reveal concrete steps to induce
   climate action and contribute to scholarship on policy learning.},
